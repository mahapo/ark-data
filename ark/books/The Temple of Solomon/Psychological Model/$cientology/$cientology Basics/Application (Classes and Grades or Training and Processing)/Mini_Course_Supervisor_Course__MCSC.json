Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. \"Quickie grades\" entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not \"entirely a tech matter\" as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can't get the technology applied then you can't deliver what's promised. It's as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what's promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 2 MCSC So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 3 MCSC In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable â€“ only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact â€“ the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve â€“ psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 4 MCSC So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell â€“ and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 5 MCSC still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 6 MCSC Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse â€“ never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us â€“ win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive â€“ and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 7 MCSC But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don't muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs.

In Scientology a course consists of a checksheet with all the actions and material listed on it and all the materials on the checksheet available in the same order. \"Checksheet Material\" means the policy letters, bulletins, tapes, mimeo issues, any reference book or any books mentioned. \"Materials\" also include clay, furniture, tape players, bulletin boards, routing forms, supplies of pink sheets, roll book, student files, file cabinets and any other items that will be needed. If you look this over carefully, it does not say \"materials on order\" or \"except for those we haven't got\" or \"in different order\". It means what it says exactly. If a student is to have auditing or word clearing rundowns or must do auditing those are under actions and appear on the checksheet. A course must have a Supervisor. He may or may not be a graduate and experienced practitioner of the course he is supervising but he must be a trained Course Supervisor. He is not expected to teach. He is expected to get the students there, rolls called, checkouts properly done, misunderstoods handled by finding what the student doesn't dig and getting the student to dig it. The Supervisor who tells students answers is a waste of time and a course destroyer as he enters out-data into the scene even if trained and actually especially if trained in the subject. The Supervisor is not an \"instructor\", that's why he's called a \"Supervi-sor\". A Supervisor's skill is in spotting dope-off, glee and other manifestations of misun-derstoods, and getting it cleaned up, not in knowing the data so he can tell the student. A Supervisor should have an idea of what questions he will be asked and know where to direct the student for the answer. Student blows follow misunderstoods. A Supervisor who is on the ball never has blows as he caught them before they happened by observing the student's misunderstanding before the student does and getting it tracked down by the student."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE? 2 HCO PL 16.3.71R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 12 MCSC It is the Supervisor's job to get the student through the checksheet fully and swiftly with minimum lost time. The successful Supervisor is tough. He is not a kindly old fumbler. He sets high checksheet targets for each student for the day and forces them to be met or else. The Supervisor is spending Supervisor Minutes. He has just so many to spend. He is spending Student Hours. He has just so many of these to spend so he gets them spent wisely and saves any waste of them. A Supervisor in a course of any size has a Course Administrator who has very exact duties in keeping up Course Admin and handing out and getting back materials and not losing any to damage or carelessness. If Paragraphs One to Three above are violated it is the Course Administrator who is at fault. He must have checksheets and the matching material in adequate quantity to serve the course. If he doesn't he has telexes flying and mimeo sweating. The Course Admin is in charge of routing lines and proper send-off and return of students to Cramming or Auditing or Ethics. The final and essential part of a course is students. If a course conforms with this P/L exactly with no quibbles, is tough, precisely time scheduled and run hard, it will be a full expanding course and very successful. If it varies from this P/L it will stack up bodies in the shop, get blows and incompetent graduates. The final valuable product of any course is graduates who can apply successfully the material they studied and be successful in the subject. This answers the question What is a Course? If any of these points are out it is not a Scientology Course and it will not be successful. Thus, the order \"Put a Course there!\" means this P/L in full force.

There is a technology of criticism of art, expressed beautifully in the Encyclopaedia published by Focal Press. In this article it stresses that a critic who is also an expert artist tends to introduce un-fairly his own perfectionism (and bias and frustrations) into his criticism. We suffer amazingly from this in all our courses. I had not previously spotted it be-cause I don't demand a student at lower levels produce results found only in higher levels. You can carelessly sum this up by \"letting the student have wins\" but if you do you'll miss the whole point. Example: A student up for a pass on his Itsa is flunked because he or she couldn't ac-knowledge. But a student at the Itsa level hasn't been taught to acknowledge. This student hasn't even read the data on acknowledgement. So the student can't pass Itsa level and so never does get to the level where acknowl-edgement is taught â€“ and if he does, really never passed, in his own mind, Itsa and so hasn't advanced. And we catch all our students this way and they don't therefore learn. How is this done? How could this be? The instructor is an expert auditor. That's as it should be. But as an expert auditor, bad execution of a level above where the student is studying, pains the instructor. So he flunks the student because the auditing looks bad. But look here. The student wasn't being checked out as an auditor. The student was only being checked out on Itsa."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 2 HCO PL 24.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 18 MCSC Further, the action of auditing as a whole is so easy to an instructor who is an expert auditor that he fails to take it apart for instruction. If I say the following, it will look ridiculous and you'll get the point better: The student is up to pass TR 0. The Instructor on check out looks the student over and says \"You flunked the test.\" The student says \"Why?\" The Instructor says \"You didn't take the Class VI actions to clear the pc of all his GPMs.\" All right, we can all see that that would be silly. But Instruc-tors do just that daily, though on a narrower band. The Instructor puts in additives. As an expert auditor it seems natural to him to say \"You flunked your test on Itsa because you never acknowledged the pc.\" You get the point. This really is as crazy wide as the ridiculous example above. What does Ack have to do with Itsa? Nothing! Because the Instructor is an expert auditor, auditing has ceased to have parts and is all one chunk. Okay. A good auditor regards it that way. But the poor student can't grasp any of the pieces because the whole chunk is being demanded. What's Itsa? It's Listen. Can the student listen? Okay, he can listen but the expert says, \"He didn't get 15 divisions of TA per hour.\" On the what? \"On the meter of course.\" What meter? That's Level II and Itsa is Level 0. \"Yes,\" the expert protests, \"but the pc didn't get any better!\" Okay, so what pc is supposed to get better at Level 0. If they do it's an accident, usu-ally. Now does this student pass? \"No! He can't even look at the pc!\" Well, that's TR 0 of Level I. \"But he's got to look like an auditor!\" How can he? An auditor has to get through a comm course before you can really call him that. \"Okay, I'll drop my standards.... \" the expert begins. Hell no, expert. You better pick up your standards for each Level and for each small part of auditing. What's it say at Level 0? \"It says 'Listen'.\" Okay, then, damn it, when the student is able to sit and listen and not shut a pc down with yak, the student passes. \"And the meter?\" You better not let me catch you teaching meters at Level 0. And so it goes right on up through the Levels and the bits within the Levels. By making Itsa mysterious and tough, by adding big new standards to it like TA and Ack you only succeed in never teaching the student Itsa! So he goes on up and at Level IV audits like a bum. Can't control a pc. Can't meter, nothing. So the expert tries to make a student do Class VI auditing the first day and the student is never trained to do any auditing at Level 0. This nonsense repeated at Level I (by adding a meter, by purist flunking \"because the pc couldn't handle an ARC Break\") and repeated again at Level II (\"because the pc couldn't assess\") and at Level III etc. etc. Well, if you add things all the time out of sequence and demand things the student has not yet reached the student winds up in a ball of confusion like the cat getting into the yarn."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 3 HCO PL 24.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 19 MCSC So we're not instructing. We're preventing a clear view of the parts of auditing by add-ing higher level standards and actions to lower level activities. This consumes time. It makes a mess. The new HCA always tries to teach his group a whole HCA course his first evening home. Well, that's no reason seasoned veterans have to do it in our courses. If you never let a student learn Level 0 because he's flunked unless he does Level VI first, people will stay on courses forever and we'll have no auditors. Instructors must teach not out of their own expertise but out of the text book expected actions in the Level the student is being trained in. To go above that level like assessment in Level II or Ack and meters at Level 0 is to deny the student any clean view of what he's ex-pected to do. And if he never learns the parts, he'll never do the whole. And that's all that's wrong with our instruction or our instructors. As expert auditors they cease to view the part the student must know as itself and do not train and pass the stu-dent upon it. Instead they confuse the student by demanding more than the part being learned. Instruction is done on a gradient scale. Learn each part well by itself. And only then can assembly of parts occur into what we want â€“ a well trained student. This is not lowering any standards. It's raising them on all training. BULLETIN CHECK OUTS The other side of the picture, theory, suffers because of a habit. The habit is all one's years of formal schooling where this mistake is the whole way of life. If the student knows the words, the theory instructor assumes he knows the tune. It will never do a student any good at all to know some facts. The student is expected only to use facts. It is so easy to confront thought and so hard to confront action that the Instructor often complacently lets the student mouth words ideas that mean nothing to the student. All theory check outs must consult the student's understanding. If they don't, they're useless and will ARC Break the student eventually. Course natter stems entirely from the students' non-comprehension of words and data. While this can be cured by auditing, why audit it all the time when you can prevent it in the first place by adequate theory check-out? There are two phenomena here."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 4 HCO PL 24.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 20 MCSC FIRST PHENOMENON When a student misses understanding a word, the section right after that word is a blank in his memory. You can always trace back to the word just before the blank, get it un-derstood and find miraculously that the former blank area is not now blank in the bulletin. The above is pure magic. SECOND PHENOMENON The second phenomenon is the overt cycle which follows a misunderstood word. When a word is not grasped, the student then goes into a non-comprehension (blankness) of things immediately after. This is followed by the student's solution for the blank condition which is to individuate from it â€“ separate self from it. Now being something else than the blank area, the student commits overts against the more general area. These overts, of course, are followed by restraining himself from committing overts. This pulls flows toward the per-son and makes the person crave motivators. This is followed by various mental and physical conditions and by various complaints, fault-finding and look-what-you-did-to-me. This justi-fies a departure, a blow. But the system of education, frowning on blows as it does, causes the student to really withdraw self from the study subject (whatever he was studying) and set up in its place a cir-cuit which can receive and give back sentences and phrases. We now have \"the quick student who somehow never applies what he learns\". The specific phenomena then is that a student can study some words and give them back and yet be no participant to the action. The student gets A+ on exams but can't apply the data. The thoroughly dull student is just stuck in the non-comprehend blankness following some misunderstood word. The \"very bright\" student who yet can't use the data isn't there at all. He has long since ceased to confront the subject matter or the subject. The cure for either of these conditions of \"bright non-comprehension\" or \"dull\" is to find the missing word. But these conditions can be prevented by not letting the student go beyond the missed word without grasping its meaning. And that is the duty of the Theory Instructor. DEMONSTRATION Giving a bulletin or tape check by seeing if it can be quoted or paraphrased proves ex-actly nothing. This will not guarantee that the student knows the data or can use or apply it"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 5 HCO PL 24.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 21 MCSC nor even guarantees that the student is there. Neither the \"bright\" student nor the \"dull\" stu-dent (both suffering from the same malady) will benefit from such an examination. So examining by seeing if somebody \"knows\" the text and can quote or paraphrase it is completely false and must not be done. Correct examination is done only by making the person being tested answer (a) The meanings of the words (re-defining the words used in his own words and dem-onstrating their use in his own made up sentences), and (b) Demonstrating how the data is used. The examiner need not do a Clay Table audit just to get a student to pass. But the ex-aminer can ask what the words mean. And the examiner can ask for examples of action or application. \"What is this HCO Bulletin's first section?\" is about as dull as one can get. \"What are the rules given about.....?\" is a question I would never bother to ask. Neither of these tell the examiner whether he has the bright non-applier or the dull student before him. Such questions just beg for natter and course blows. I would go over the first paragraph of any material I was examining a student on and pick out some uncommon words. I'd ask the student to define each and demonstrate its use in a made up sentence and flunk the first \"Well.... er.... let me see.... \" and that would be the end of that check out. I wouldn't pick out only Scientologese. I'd pick out words that weren't too ordinary such as \"benefit\" \"permissive\" \"calculated\" as well as \"engram\". Students I was personally examining would begin to get a hunted look and carry dic-tionaries â€“ but they wouldn't begin to natter or get sick or blow. And they'd use what they learned. Above all, I myself would be sure I knew what the words meant before I started to ex-amine. Dealing with new technology and the necessity to have things named, we especially need to be alert. Before you curse our terms, remember that a lack of terms to describe phenomena can be twice as incomprehensible as having involved terms that at least can be understood even-tually. We do awfully well, really, better than any other science or subject. We lack a diction-ary but we can remedy that. But to continue with how one should examine, when the student had the words, I'd demand the music. What tune do these words play? I'd say \"All right, what use is this bulletin (or tape) to you?\" Questions like, \"Now this rule here about not letting pcs eat candy while being audited, how come there'd be such a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 6 HCO PL 24.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 22 MCSC rule?\" And if the student couldn't imagine why, I'd go back to the words just ahead of that rule and find the one he hadn't grasped. I'd ask \"What are the commands of 8C?\" And when the student gave them, I'd still have the task of satisfying myself that the student understood why those were the commands. I'd ask \"How come?\" after he'd given me the commands. Or \"What are you going to do with these?\" \"Audit a pc with them\" he might say. I'd say, \"Well, why these commands?\" But if the student wasn't up to the point of study where knowing why he used those commands was not part of his materials, I wouldn't ask. For all the data about not examining above level applies very severely to Theory Check out as well as to Practical and general In-struction. I might also have a Clay Table beside my examiner's desk (and certainly would have if I were an HCO hat checker, to which all this data also applies) and use it to have students show me they knew the words and ideas. Theory often says \"Well, they take care of all that in Practical.\" Oh no they don't. When you have a Theory Section that believes that, Practical can't function at all. Practical goes through the simple motions. Theory covers why one goes through the motions. I don't think I have to beat this to death for you. You've got it. L.

Therefore the system given in Sept 24, '64 Pol Ltr is to be used as follows: 1. Do not use the old method of covering each bit combined with the new method. 2. Use only the new method. 3. Spot check the words and materials, do not try to cover it all. This is done the same way a final examination is given in schools: only a part of the material is covered by examination, assuming that if the student has this right the student knows all of it. 4. Flunk on comm lag in attempts to answer. If the student \"er . . . .ah . . . well . . .\", flunk it as it certainly isn't known well enough to use. (Doesn't include stammerers.) 5. Never keep on examining a bulletin after a student has missed. 6. Consider all materials star rated or not rated. Skip 75%'s. In other words, the check-out must have been 100% right answers for a pass. 75% is not a pass. When you con-sider a bulletin or tape too unimportant for a 100% pass, just require evidence that it has been read and don't examine it at all. In other words, on those you check out, re-quire 100% and on less important material don't examine, merely require evidence of having read. THE \"BRIGHT\" ONES You will find that often you have very glib students you won't be able to find any fault in who yet won 't be able to apply or use the data they are passing. This student is discussed as the \"bright student\" in the Sept 24, '64 Pol Ltr. Demonstration is the key here. The moment you ask this type of student to demon-strate a rule or theory with his hands or the paper clips on your desk this glibness will shatter. The reason for this is that in memorizing words or ideas, the student can still hold the position that it has nothing to do with him or her. It is a total circuit action. Therefore, very"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THEORY CHECK-OUT DATA 2 HCO PL 28.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 24 MCSC glib. The moment you say \"Demonstrate\" that word or idea or principle, the student has to have something to do with it. And shatters. One student passed \"Itsa\" in theory with flying colours every time even on cross-check type questions, yet had never been known to listen. When the theory instructor said, \"Demon-strate what a student would have to do to pass Itsa,\" the whole subject blew up. \"There's too many ways to do Itsa auditing!\" the student said. Yet on the bulletin it merely said \"Listen\". That given as a glib answer was all right. But \"demonstration\" brought to light that this stu-dent hadn't a clue about listening to a pc. If he had to demonstrate it, the non-participation of the student in the material he was studying came to light. Don't get the idea that Demonstration is a Practical Section action. Practical gives the drills. These demonstrations in Theory aren't drills. Clay Table isn't used to any extent by a Theory Examiner. Hands, a diagram, paper clips, these are usually quite enough! COACHING IN THEORY There is Theory Coaching as well as Practical Coaching. Coaching Theory means getting a student to define all the words, give all the rules, demonstrate things in the bulletin with his hands or bits of things, and also may include doing Clay Table Definitions of Scientology terms. That's all Theory Coaching. It compares to coaching on drills in Practical. But it is done on Bulletins, tapes and policy letters which are to be examined in the future. Coaching is not examining. The examiner who coaches instead of examining will stall the progress of the whole class. The usual Supervisor action would be to have any student who is having any trouble or is slow or glib team up with another student of comparable difficulties and have them turn about with each other with Theory Coaching, similar to Practical coaching in drills. Then when they have a bulletin, tape or policy letter coached, they have a check-out. The check-out is a spot check-out as above, a few definitions or rules and some demonstration of them. DICTIONARIES Dictionaries should be available to students in Theory and should be used in Theory Examination as well, preferably the same publication. Dictionaries don't always agree with each other. No Supervisor should try to define English language words out of his own head when correcting a student as it leads to too many arguments. On English words, open a dictionary. A Scientology dictionary is available. ____________________"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THEORY CHECK-OUT DATA 3 HCO PL 28.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 25 MCSC Remember that with Courses becoming briefer in duration, the number of bulletins and tapes which the student must know on a Star-Rated basis is also less. General written examination for classification, however, remains on an 85% pass ba-sis. ____________________ Be sure that students who get low marks constantly are also handled in Review, pref-erably by definitions of words they haven't understood in some former subject. Scientology is never the cause of consistent dullness or glibness. Processing of this nature can be on an Itsa basis. It does not have to be Clay Table. Just finding the prior subject by discussion and discussing its words usually blows the condi-tion. I've seen it change the whole attitude of a person in just 5 or 10 minutes of auditing on a \"locate the subject and word\" basis. Therefore, definitions exist at Levels 0 and I, but not with Clay Table or assessment, only by Itsa. You'd be surprised how well it works and how fast. \"Subjects you didn't like\", \"words you haven't grasped\" are the discussion question. ____________________ The subject of \"wrong definitions cause stupidity or circuits, followed by overts and motivators\", is not easy to get across because it is so general amongst Mankind. There is a possibility that past lives themselves are wiped out by changing language, whether it is the same language that changes through the years or shifting nationality. But however that may be, don't be discouraged at the difficulties you may have in getting this principle understood and used in Scientology departments-the person you are trying to convince has definitions out somewhere also!

Each student is as-signed a \"twin\" to work with. The student studies his assigned material and is sometimes coached over the rough spots by his twin. When the student knows the material, he is then given a checkout by his twin. If he flunks, he returns to study and when ready gets a new checkout. When he passes, the twin signs the assignment sheet certifying that he has grasped it. The assignment sheet is turned in to the Course Supervisor at the end of the period.

Retesting the entire bulletin is both time-wasting and exasperating. Therefore bulletin and tape tests are given an Expiration Date. If retaken in one week, the only part examined is from the area flunked onward. If, however, the bulletin or tape is retaken after a period of one week the entire material is retested. The Examiner, when a student flunks, marks the student's bulletin or tape notes with an initial and a date just above the area of the first flunk. The Examiner may go a question or two above the question flunked to enter the date and initial. No other record is made. If the student is re-examined on a date before the date marked plus seven (within one week) the Examiner only asks questions from the date mark onward. It does not matter how many flunks are given or how many weeks a bulletin or tape exam is extended so long as no period of seven days elapses between tests. If such a period does elapse (date written + 7 days) only then does the whole material get examined. The reason for this Expiration Date is this: students are often very poor administrators. They take a bulletin or tape, study it and flunk it, throw it aside and take up another one. Fi-nally they have gone through all the course materials in this fashion and have nothing on their check sheets and nothing but failure in their studies. By introducing the Expiration Date they are persuaded to complete that which they begin. As students have to go to the end of the examination line, popping back in for the next bit a minute later is unworkable.

(See HCO PL 4 Oct 64 Theory Checkouts Data, point number 4.) 2. Not spot-checking a student on the policy or bulletin. This stems from not knowing the purpose of spot checking or why it is okay to spot check a student. (See HCO PL 4 Oct 64, Theory Check-Out Data, paragraph number 1 and point number 3.) 3. Not knowing that Coaching in Theory means getting the student to define all the words and give all the rules. This misunderstanding comes from not knowing the pur-pose of Coaching in Theory. (See HCO PL 4 Oct 64, Theory Check-Out Data.) 4. Not asking the student to use the word in a sentence after asking him to define the word in his own words.You ask for the meaning of the word and the use of the word in a made up sentence.

Also doing this when a student flunks on a word and just having him look the word up and carrying on with the checkout without having him look up the word and restudy the materials. This stems from not knowing what happens when a student goes past a misunderstood word. (See HCO PL 26 Aug 65 Scientology Training Twin Checkouts, paragraph 1 and the sec-tions under the two phenomena of a misunderstood word.) NOTE: Sending a student back to study means the student gets his MUs found and cleared and re-studies the materials from the earliest misunderstood word found or from the beginning. It means full application of Study Tech. Students who haven't fully grasped the starrate checkout procedures have missed out on one or more of the above points. These points are all covered in the policies referenced at the beginning of this issue and these policies must be known and applied by Supervisors and students alike.

Coach with a purpose. Have for your goal when you are coaching that the student is going to get the training drill correct; be purposeful in working toward obtaining this goal. Whenever you correct the student as a coach just don't do it with no reason, with no purpose. Have the purpose in mind for the student to get a better understanding of the training drill and to do it to the best of his ability. 2. Coach with reality. Be realistic in your coaching. When you give an origination to a student really make it an origination, not just something that the sheet said you should say; so that it is as if the stu-dent was having to handle it exactly as you say under real conditions and circumstances. This does not mean, however, that you really feel the things that you are giving the student, such as saying to him, \"My leg hurts.\" This does not mean that your leg should hurt, but you should say it in such a manner as to convey to the student that your leg hurts. Another thing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with. Be inventive in present time. 3. Coach with an intention. Behind all your coaching should be your intention that by the end of the session your student will be aware that he is doing better at the end of it than he did at the beginning. The student must have a feeling that he has accomplished something in the training step, no matter how small it is. It is your intention and always should be while coaching that the student you are coaching be a more able person and have a greater understanding of that on which he is being coached. 4. In coaching take up only one thing at a time. For example: Using TR 4, if the student arrives at the goal set up for TR 4 then check over, one at a time, the earlier TRs. Is he confronting you? Does he originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really intend for you to receive it? Are his acknowledg-ments ending the cycles of communication, etc. But only coach these things one at a time; never two or more at a time. Make sure that the student does each thing you coach him on correctly before going on to the next training step. The better a student gets at a particular"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"COACHING   2   HCOB   24.5.68   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 38 MCSC drill or a particular part of a drill you should demand, as a coach, a higher standard of ability. This does not mean that you should be \"never satisfied\". It does mean that a person can al-ways get better and once you have reached a certain plateau of ability then work toward a new plateau. As a coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coach-ing. Never allow yourself to do a sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your student a disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice. If you are ever in doubt about the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing, then the best thing is to ask the supervisor. He will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct ma-terials. In coaching never give an opinion, as such, but always give your directions as a direct statement, rather than saying \"I think\" or \"Well, maybe it might be this way,\" etc. As a coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are ob-tained on the student. This does not mean, of course, that you are totally responsible but that you do have a responsibility toward the student and the session. Make sure you always run good control on the student and give him good directions. Once in a while the student will start to rationalize and justify what he is doing if he is doing something wrong. He will give you reasons why and becauses. Talking about such things at great length does not accomplish very much. The only thing that does accomplish the goals of the TR and resolves any differences is doing the training drill. You will get fur-ther by doing it than by talking about it. In the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under \"Training Stress\" and \"Purpose\" on the training sheet. These training drills occasionally have a tendency to upset the student. There is a pos-sibility that during a drill a student may become angry or extremely upset or experience some misemotion. Should this occur the coach must not \"back off\". He should continue the training drill until he can do it without stress or duress and he feels \"good about it\". So, don't \"back off\" but push the student through whatever difficulty he may be having. There is a small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when he has gotten the drill right or he has done a good job on a particular step. Besides correcting wrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness. You very definitely \"flunk\" the student for anything that amounts to \"self-coaching\". The reason for this is that the student will tend to introvert and will look too much at how he is doing and what he is doing rather than just doing it. As a coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and don't become so interested in what you yourself are doing that you neglect the student and are unaware of his ability or inability to do the drill correctly. It is easy to become \"interesting\" to a student; to make him laugh and act up a bit. But your main job as a coach is to see how good he can get in each training drill and that is what you should have your attention on; that, and how well he is doing."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"COACHING   3   HCOB   24.5.68   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 39 MCSC To a large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coach-ing.

It is a Scientology innovation in training. For years it was used highly successfully when done correctly and as a standard action on Scientology courses. Recently I discovered a big WHY behind course failures. That is that twinning as a subject and practice has become confused and fallen into misuse or fallen out completely and one of the reasons behind that is that a number of HCOBs on twinning were canceled and no one issue exists that covers the subject in its entirety. This HCOB reinstates twinning firmly and with emphasis. It is not subject to cancellation."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"TWINNING   2   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 42 MCSC It fully lays out the purpose of twinning, the basics and rules and correct use of twin-ning, when and how it is done, the responsibility of twins and the responsibility of the Super-visor and the handling of twinning bugs. It re-establishes mandatory twinning on all practical courses, such as the TRs Course, or on the practical sections of a course, such as E-Meter Drills. It also covers twinning in some areas of theory study where it is obviously called for, such as Method 9 Word Clearing when done between students. BACKGROUND In 1954 we found that when you teamed up students of comparable case level and ability they then made progress. When we find something that is that workable we put it to use. Twinning was installed as a fundamental part of the Scientology system of training and it immediately and effectively brought up the participation and action levels of entire course rooms of students. Students grasped the application of the materials faster. It gave us results. Originally twinning was used almost exclusively on practical drills. Later, in the early '60s, it was carried over into twin checkouts on theory. Still later, with the advent of Word Clearing, applied study tech and fast flow, twinning as a broad mandatory action for all stu-dents on theory was canceled. Even so, some orgs continued twinning students unnecessarily on admin courses and some theory courses and were not enforcing twinning on courses where it is mandatory, such as a TRs Course. Twinning on practical courses and practical actions has never been canceled by me and was never intended to be canceled. However, a line in a BPL (BPL 18 Oct 76RD Rev. 10.9.78 Urgent, Important, Successful Training Lineup) which stated: \"Requirements of twin training or checkouts for Academy are canceled\" caused twinning to be dropped out even on practical drills in some areas and threw a confusion into the scene in other areas. The above BPL has now been canceled with a vengeance and is replaced by HCO PL 25 Sept 79 I Ur-gent, Important, Successful Training Lineup. And this bulletin restores twinning to its rightful place in training as the vital tool that it is. WHY TWINNING? One reason twinning is so vital is that it brings those people who have sunk back into their First Dynamic up out of their First Dynamic and onto the Third. It gives the student a terminal to work with. It puts students into communication, into doingness and participation. One doesn't learn by being a spectator. Twinning not only gets students extroverted but also gets them to take some responsibility for their fellow man. These are factors that are sadly lacking in modern permissive education."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"TWINNING   3   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 43 MCSC TWINNING VERSUS MODERN PERMISSIVENESS With twinning we are cutting right across modern \"permissive\" teaching. The modern tendency is to just let everybody do as they please and put their attention on whatever they please. This is the \"think\" of the day, and it is in in most basic school sys-tems and has spread as well into many different fields. Probably someone somewhere thought it would be much quicker and easier and re-quire much less confront to just let a student sit there permissively, with his attention wander-ing around in the total significance of it all and then claim he had passed the subject when he had never gone near it. It is a symptom of people who can't confront not to make anyone else confront. We don't buy this. It is totally batty. The creeping disease of permissiveness, noncon-front and spectatorism is simply a part of \"the beautiful world of irresponsible slop.\" It has no place in Scientology training. Real twinning, enforced, effectively pulls the student right up out of the vague permis-siveness of modern think and lands him with some responsibility right from the start. With that he can be honestly trained. CAUSE AND EFFECT A person being trained is mainly working on an inflow basis. Day after day it is in-flow, inflow, inflow. This tends to put him at effect. In twinning, the person can balance his inflow with outflow. This keeps him from go-ing totally into effect. It puts some cause into the scene. A person, when he is expected to apply knowledge or skills, must, of course, be at cause. When he is trained totally at effect, he can get into what is called a \"stuck flow\" phe-nomenon whereby he can't outflow the subject. Yet, if he is ever going to apply it, he is going to have to outflow it. Twinning has the virtue of balancing inflow and outflow. It will be found that when the person comes to apply the tech, he is already able to outflow if he was trained using twin-ning. WHEN TO TWIN It is not necessary to twin students on admin courses, nor, as a general rule, on tech theory courses. You ensure the student is applying study tech and is not going past misunder-stood words and you let him get on with it. Practical and practical courses are another matter."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"TWINNING   4   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 44 MCSC Mandatory Twinning Twinning is mandatory on those courses where the essence of the course is to train the student in the practical application of the data. This would include the TRs Course, any Upper Indoc and Objectives Course, a specialized E-Meter Drills Course and courses of a similar nature. Even though such courses also include theory, the final objective of such a course is a person trained and drilled in the doingness involved and twinning is absolutely essential for this purpose. Thus, on such a course, twins are assigned at the beginning of the course and they re-main assigned through to the completion of that course. We call it \"assigning twins in con-crete.\" One does not musical chair twins, once assigned, nor allow them to drift from one twin to another. The whole essence of twinning is to get two students to work together, to assist each other and take responsibility for getting each other successfully through the course. Twinning On Practical Sections Of Courses On certain courses containing both theory and practical, such as Academy Levels, you would not necessarily twin students on the theory section of the course. You would, however, definitely and mandatorily twin them on the practical sections. For example, twinning is a must on E-Meter Drills, or such actions as assessment drill-ing, drilling of special rundown procedures where this is called for, Learning Drills, Obnosis Drills and other practical applications. Twinning On Word Clearing One always twins students where Method 9 Word Clearing is to be done between the students themselves and not by a Word Clearer. Similarly, Method 8 Word Clearing is twinned, on exactly the same turn-about basis as described in Method 9. (Ref: HCOB 30.1.73RB, Method 9 Word Clearing The Right Way) An example of turn-about on Method 8 would be: First twin clears word \"a.\" Second twin then clears word \"a\" AND word \"b.\" First twin then clears word \"b\" AND word \"c,\" etc. You do two actions consecutively every time. Twins may also be assigned to get each other through other methods of Word Clearing in this way. Henceforth, on courses such as the Primary Rundown, where Word Clearing is the es-sence of the course, twinning is mandatory. Wherever twins are assigned, whether for an entire course or for practical sections of a course, the rules of twinning apply. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"TWINNING   5   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 45 MCSC ASSIGNING TWINS The Supervisor is responsible for assigning twins. He should take care to team up students of comparable case level and training and abilities inasmuch as possible. In this way both twins make the best progress. Twinning a very fast student with a slow student should be avoided, if possible, as it can be frustrating and upsetting to both students. This must never be used as an excuse NOT to twin students. How-ever, ideally, one matches them up according to their capabilities and twinning goes smoothly and produces best results when this is done. In some rare instances it may be necessary to reassign twins who have been incor-rectly paired. But it should not be necessary if care was taken in teaming them up correctly to begin with. Otherwise, once assigned, twins work together through to successful completion of the course or activity. TURN-ABOUT The rule of twinning is that it is done on a \"turn-about\" basis. \"Turn-about\" is done as follows: One student coaches his twin through a drill or a section of a drill. They then turn-about and the second twin does the same drill or section of that drill PLUS the next drill or next section of the drill. They then turn-about again, with the first student doing the drill his twin has just done PLUS the one following. The same system applies in Method 9 or Method 8 Word Clearing. One twin clears a word or M9s a paragraph or section of the text. They turn-about and the second twin clears the word or M9s the paragraph or section plus the following one. They turn-about again, with the first twin now clearing or M9ing the word or section his twin just cleared plus the one following. Turn-about is applied as well to starrate checkouts where these are called for. It may be done by checking out an entire bulletin on one's twin before the turn-about is done. Or, where a very long text is to be starrated, the turn-about can be done after each section. With the turn-about system one person is not constantly leading and misunderstoods are kept picked up between twins. The twins keep apace with each other, we don't get unbal-anced flows and both are kept progressing. THE TWIN'S RESPONSIBILITY A twin is responsible for seeing that the student with whom he is twinned knows and can apply the material he has studied . Twins must be made aware of this responsibility at the onset of the course."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"TWINNING   6   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 46 MCSC The twin word clears his fellow student. He listens to his sentences and sees that they are correct and fit the definition of the word being cleared. He makes sure his twin under-stands the materials. If the student doesn't know them cold, the twin helps the student find his misunderstood words and gets him through any difficulties. Twins do practical drills together. They coach each other to wins and certainty in ap-plying the materials hundred percent correctly. If a student flunks a Supervisor checkout on materials he's been passed on by his twin, both students get a flunk. The twin must have a misunderstood himself if he missed the other student's goof. Morale and Production Morale depends on production. Production, in training, is the evidence of the demonstration of competence. Morale is up when competence is demonstrated. Morale is up when production is up. Morale isn't necessarily built by being \"nice.\" Twinning actions are carried out with good ARC, but being \"nice\" is not enough. A student getting a good stiff coaching session from his twin and passingâ€”or getting a good, stiff checkout and passing, feels great. He has really accomplished something. He knows that he knows the data or drill. A student who gets poor or nonstandard coaching or checkouts feels and knows that he has been cheated. If his twin is just being \"nice\" he doesn't win and doesn't appreciate the checkout. His morale will be down. One keeps his twin's morale and production high. One gives him tough standard coaching sessions so he becomes competent. One gives him tough standard checkouts so he knows he has demonstrated his competence in the materials. It is always done with good ARC. It must be real to student and Supervisor alike that twinning is not a namby-pamby, brush-off activity. One is responsible for getting his twin through the course. If one twin goes to Review, the other goes to Review. If one twin goes to Ethics, the other goes to Ethics. If one twin should blow, the other twin must go and get him. One is responsible for getting his twin through the course. There have been cases in the past where one twin worked like mad to get the other twin through an extensive section right at the end of the course. The other twin then simply went off and would not do the same so the first student could also finish the course. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TWINNING   7   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 47 MCSC It is now firm policy that where such an instance occurs, the student who aban-doned his twin just because he himself was finished may not be certified and may not be given a course completion until he has completed his twin. Twins are responsible for getting each other through the course. THE SUPERVISOR'S RESPONSIBILITY It is the Supervisor's responsibility to enforce twinning per the points in this bulletin. He assigns twins, pairing them according to their capabilities. He ensures twinning is being done by the book, on a turn-about basis, with both twins making progress. He makes sure twins are wearing their hats as twins and taking responsibility for get-ting each other through, exactly as laid out in course materials. A \"double flunk\" is given when a student flunks a Supervisor checkout on materials his twin has passed him on. \"Double flunk\" means the student and his twin are both flunked in such a case, as, if the twin has missed the student's goof, he must have misunderstoods of his own. The Supervisor maintains high tech standards by adhering firmly to this system and when he must double flunk he makes sure both twins get handled on the goof. A situation can occur where a student and his twin get into a \"games condition,\" one with the other. This gives a no-progress, problem situation. The students who are twinned are not both working toward the same goal but one is in opposition to the other in some way. This gives no progress, no wins, no production, no demonstration of competence being permitted and low morale. It is the responsibility of the Supervisor as well as the twinned students to not permit such a situation to occur. With any failure of a twin to be a twin and assume that responsibil-ity, the Supervisor gets the student checked out on this bulletin and any other applicable course material and ensures the student is fully handled. To keep the course morale high, Supervisors must insist on production and on the demonstration of competence on all materials by the student and his twin. In a case where a student gets sent to Review or Ethics, the Supervisor must uphold the rule that his twin always gets sent as well. He ensures that any blown student is recovered by his twin. In all such cases the Supervisor keeps track of his students and ensures they're handled and gotten back on course rapidly. A Supervisor who understands the why of twinning and sees it is carried out stan-dardly is going to produce causative, responsible graduates who can apply what they have learned. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"TWINNING   8   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 48 MCSC EMPHASIS ON NO VERBAL DATA All students should be made aware, from the beginning of training, that the answers to their questions are in their course materials or other source references. The issues on verbal tech, HCOB 9 Feb 79 How To Defeat verbal Tech and HCOB 15 Feb 79 Verbal Tech Penalties, should be well-known in the course room. Even so, students, particularly when they are new, sometimes get into an exchange of verbal data or opinion while they are twinning. A Supervisor must be on the alert for this and step in to handle at once when he observes it happening. He uses study tech to straighten the scene out and always refers the students to the above mentioned HCOBs on verbal tech. Twinned students, of course, bear a responsibility for not spreading verbal tech, nei-ther between themselves nor to anyone else, for that matter. A twin always refers his fellow student to source materials. HANDLING BUGS ON TWINNING The main twinning bugs which could arise are those which were encountered earlier on the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. One twin would get sent to Ethics or Cramming or Review and the other one then had no twin. Thus, twinning could get to be a little bit unpopu-lar and could block somebody from finishing the course unless these factors are handled. The remedy for this sort of thing is to send both twins to Ethics, both twins to Cram-ming, both twins to Review and if anybody blows, send his twin after him. In other words, we don't buy the idea that everybody is totally irresponsible for everybody else in this wonderful First Dynamic world. This is not a mere expediency. It takes only a good, straight look at the purpose and WHY of twinning to recognize the value of this system. Those who do recognize its value will enforce and maintain it. There is another situation which could act as a bug in twinning. What happens when one twin actually does disappear from the scene totally, in spite of checkouts and crammings and ethics? What do you do with the remaining twin? Unhandled, it can stop a course for a student, so handled it must be and with no time wasted. You don't let the odd twin rattle around on his own for very long. If he's not too far advanced into the course he can be twinned with an oncoming stu-dent. (A well-run course room will always have new students enrolling.) Every effort is then made to get the newcomer caught up with his twin as rapidly as possible. But what of the more advanced student who loses a twin? If there's absolutely no other single terminal to team him up with, there is still a solution far preferable to having him con-tinue on his own. You match him up with a set of twins of comparable ability and advance-ment to his and you turn that twinship into a trio. Once formed, you run that trio as tightly as you would any twinship.

All the rules of twinning then apply to these three. You \"assign the trio in concrete\" and you ensure they keep advancing. Again, the point here is that we operate on the Third Dynamic where one does take some responsibility for his fellow man. HANDLING BOGGED STUDENTS AND THEIR TWINS When a bogged student cannot be handled in the course room with standard Word Clearing and Study Tech and he is sent to Cramming, Review or, where indicated, to Ethics, his twin is also always sent. The idea is not only to keep the twins together and taking responsibility for each other but to also correct and repair both of them as needed. In other words, one twin doesn't simply sit there and observe the other twin being han-dled. The twin of a bogged student will also require handling in Review, Ethics, or Cramming himself. If a student has ended up on Review lines, it must be assumed that the twin has"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"TWINNING   10   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 50 MCSC goofed as a twin and has misunderstoods on the course materials. This must be sorted out and resolved by the Dir Review when the twins route through Review. The Dir Review determines, by interview, what the trouble is and how it should be re-solved. This is done on an individual basis for each twin. For example, the bogged student may need Word Clearing or a Word Clearing Correc-tion List and his twin may need to restudy this twinning bulletin or other course materials. In Ethics, for example, a student may be involved in some sort of out-ethics situation, such as continually being late for course. In any ethics situation one would look for the possi-bility of mutual rudiments between twins. Whether or not mutual ruds exist, the twin would always be given some handling in regard to his responsibility in the situation. In the above example, the Ethics Officer might handle the student with an amends pro-ject. He would then go over with the twin the matter of his responsibility and what steps he could take to ensure the student gets to course on time. The twin would then get the student through his amends, get through his own handling, whatever its nature and the two of them would then go back to course. The twin sees the student through his review, cramming or ethics cycle and, whenever possible, is used to help the student get through it. He also receives appropriate handling him-self. The rule is: When one student becomes bogged, his twin is always sent with him to cramming, review or ethics. In the rare case where a student is going to require extensive handling in Review or Ethics, such as case handling or suspension from course where such would be truly war-ranted, the Dir Review or Ethics Officer may send the other twin back to course to be ret-winned with another student. The Supervisor always checks up on any students who have been routed off course temporarily. He must keep himself informed as to their whereabouts and progress on correc-tion lines and see that they are returned to course corrected, as rapidly as possible. He does not allow any student or twin to simply drop off his lines with an incomplete course, unhan-dled or unaccounted for. Any twin has the responsibility of getting himself and his fellow student back onto the course as well. __________________________ Once students get the idea that their own progress on a course depends utterly on the quality of their twinning you will start to see some quite magical results. They're now out of the irresponsibility of it all and operating on the Third Dynamic. It simply takes standard supervision plus real twinning. That is the winning combination. So enforce twinning."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TWINNING   11   HCOB   21.8.79   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 51 MCSC It will show up in F/Ning students and high and genuine course completions, which any Supervisor, any org. any graduate can be proud of.

(Revision in this type style. Ellipses indicate Deletions) CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING (Ref: HCOB 11 Oct 67 CLAY TABLE TRAINING) The only reason any student is slow or blows lies in failure to understand the words used in his or her training. You will find that students at any level in any course will benefit greatly from Clay Table work on definitions. The importance of this will become apparent as you study our ... educational technol-ogy, now mainly to be found on the Study Tapes. THE CLAY TABLE A Clay Table is any platform at which a student, standing or sitting, can work com-fortably. In an Academy it may be 3 feet by 3 feet or 5 feet by 3 feet or any larger size. Smaller sizes are not useful. ... The surface must be smooth. A table built of rough timber will serve but the top sur-face where the work is done should be oilcloth or linoleum. Otherwise the clay sticks to it and it cannot be cleaned and will soon lead to an inability to see clearly what is being done be-cause it is stained with clay leavings."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 2 HCOB 10.12.70R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 54 MCSC In the Academy castors (wheels) can be put on the legs of both the clay table and the clay container where they will be moved a lot. Large classes should have several clay tables. CLAY Several different colours of clay should be procured. The best source is a school sup-ply house where educational supplies are sold. Artists' clay is not as good as the school type. (Ask for kindergarten clay.) A receptacle, also of wood or metal and having a separate stand of its own of any type, is also valuable. It should have subdivisions in it for the different coloured clays. The amount of each colour is not important so long as there is at least a pound or two of each colour in a small class. ... In the Academy colours are only used to make a student see the difference between one object and another and have no other significance as the objects in the mind are not uni-formly coloured. While \"ridges\" are black, they can become white. Engrams may be a number of colours all in one engram, just as Technicolor is a coloured motion picture. However, some persons see engrams only in black and white. So the colour in the Academy is for instruction only, assisting to tell the difference between one object or another. ... ... USE ON COURSES Any part of the mind or any term in Scientology can be demonstrated on a Clay Ta-ble. This is an important point to grasp. The use of the table is not just for a few terms. It can be used for all definitions. The ingenuity of ... the student and his understanding of the terms being demonstrated are the only limits on a Clay Table. Simplicity is the keynote. Nothing is too insignificant or unimportant to demonstrate on a clay table. ... Anything can be so demonstrated if you work at it. And just by working on how to demonstrate it or make it into clay and labels brings about renewed understanding. In the phrase \"how do I represent it in clay\" is contained the secret of the teaching. If one can represent it in clay one understands it. If one can't, one really doesn't understand what it is. So clay and labels work only if the term or things are truly understood. And working them out in clay brings about an understanding of them. Therefore one can predict that the clay table will be most used in a practice or organi-zation which understands the most and will be least used in an organization that understands the least (and is least successful)."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 3 HCOB 10.12.70R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 55 MCSC Let us look over the level of simplicity of the terms to be used in a course of instruc-tion. Let us take body. All right, make a few lumps and call it a body and put a sign on it \"Body\". Now that doesn't seem to be much to do. But it is a lot to do to forward understanding. Let us make a yellow ring of clay beside the body or on it or in it and label it \"A Thetan\". We can thereupon see the relationship between the two most used terms in Scientol-ogy, \"Body\" and \"Thetan\". And cognitions will result. The student's attention is brought right to the room and the subject. Getting the student to do this by himself ... produces a new result. Getting the student to do it 25 times with his own hands almost exteriorizes him. Getting the student to contrive how it can be done better in clay or how many ways it can be done in clay drives home the whole idea of the location of the thetan in the body. Art is no object in clay table work. The forms are crude. Take a large lump of clay of any colour, and cover up both \"thetan\" and \"body\" with it and you have Mind. Take every part of the mind and make it in clay by making a thetan, making a body and making one or more parts of the mind (Machine, facsimile, ridge, engram, lock, what have you â€”all Scientology terms) and get the student to demonstrate in clay what it is and we begin to clarify what we're about. Get a student to make a Present Time Problem. Make him put in all its parts repre-sented in clay (boss, mother, self) and have each one done with a body, a thetan and a mind and some rather remarkable insights begin to occur. The quantity of things that can be made has no limit. LABELING CLAY DEMONSTRATIONS Any part of the mind can be represented by a piece of clay and a label. The mass parts are done by clay, the significance or thought parts by label. A piece of clay and a label are usually both used for any part of the mind. A thin-edged ring of clay with a large hole in it is usually used to signify a pure significance. ... Everything is labeled that is made on the clay table, no matter how crude the label is. Students usually do labels with scraps of paper written on with a ball-point. ... The procedure should go - student makes one object, labels it, makes another object, labels it, makes a third object and puts a label on it and so on in sequence."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 4 HCOB 10.12.70R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 56 MCSC If a student makes all the masses of his demonstration at once, without labeling them, he is sitting there with all those significances stacking up in his mind instead of putting down each one (in the form of a label) as he goes. The correct procedure is label each mass as you go along. SIZE OF CLAY DEMOS The size of the demo can be important. A clay demo should be rather large. (One or two inches high is usually inadequate.) Large demos help to increase the student's reality on what he is demonstration. More reality means more affinity and communication and therefore more understanding. CHECKOUTS The clay demonstration must show that the student's understanding of the materials being demonstrated is present. The clay shows the thing, not the labels or the imagination. If a student's clay demonstration isn't correctly done or doesn't show what is to be demon-strated it must be flunked with reference to the material. In such case, the student must be referred to the correct Bulletin, Policy, Book or Tape reference from the materials of the course. Another student's demo is never referred to or used as an example. HANDLING CLAY Clay is messy. Until we find or unless we find a totally non-oily clay, precautions must be taken to keep students clean, and if not clean, cleaned up afterwards. Therefore the course administrator can provide liberal quantities of cheap cleaning tissues and odourless solvent. The clinging quality of clay and the odour of bad solvents could put an end to the great value of clay table work. So safeguard against this. _______________ The principal thing is to get every Scientology term made in clay and labels by the individual student. You will see a new era dawn in training. You will see Academy blows vanish and time on course cut to one fifth in many instances. These are desirable attainments in any course so Clay Table work is serious Academy business. Ingenuity and understanding are the only limits on the use of the clay table and the at-tainment of excellent results with it. L.

To make the materials being studied real to the student by making him demonstrate them in clay. 2. To give a proper balance of mass and significance. 3. To teach the student to apply. The student is given a word or auditing action or situation to demonstrate. He then does this in clay, labeling each part. The clay shows the thing. It is not just a blob of clay with a label on it. Use small strips of paper for labels. The whole demonstration then has a label of what it is. On the checkout, the student removes the overall label. The student must be silent. The examiner must not ask any questions. The examiner just looks and figures out what it is. He then tells the student who then shows the examiner the label. If the examiner did not see what it was, it is a flunk. Clay table must not be reduced to significance by the student explaining or answering questions. Nor is it reduced to significance by long-winded labels of individual parts. The clay shows it, not the label. The clay demonstrates it. The student must learn the difference between mass and sig-nificance. For example, the student has to demonstrate a pencil. He makes a thin roll of clay which is surrounded by another layer of clay â€“ the thin roll sticking slightly out of one end. On the other end goes a small cylinder of clay. The roll is labeled \"lead\". The outer layer is labeled \"wood\". The small cylinder is labeled \"rubber\". Then a label is made for the whole thing: \"pencil\". On checkout, the student removes \"pencil\" before the examiner can see it. If the examiner can look at it and say, \"It's a pencil,\" the student passes. It might also be noted that checkouts on bulletins must also ask for demonstrations. Use paper-clips, rubber bands, etc. The examiner should ask questions that require an ability to apply. Give the student a situation and have him tell you how he would handle it. Questions about what is rule \"a\" do not detect the glib student. Long-winded explana-tions on clay table put it back into significance, prevent the student from learning to apply, and prevent the student from getting the proper balance of mass, and do not blow confusion."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE TRAINING 2 HCOB 10.10.67 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 58 MCSC All checkouts must keep in mind that the purpose is application, not just getting a checksheet complete.

RON HUBBARD LRH jp....rd"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 59 MCSC STUDYING: INTRODUCTION A lecture given on 18 June 1964 Thank you. Well, I'm glad to see you, too. What's the time? [laughter] Female voice: June the 18th. I'm getting so I think in terms of broader periods of time. It's quite amusing to me, but I notice the 16th took two or three days to go by and the 17th has taken two or three days to go by, and now we're on the 18th, so this is 18 June AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The things are swinging along beautifully and it's quite a tribute â€“ this is not germane to the lecture, the lecture is on something quite important, but â€“ the lecture is about studying â€“ but it's quite interesting that a very â€“ a rather indirect tribute can be paid to the auditing of Saint Hill students who've been through their lower materials and come on up to the co-audit, and so forth. They have actually kept their pcs going, over a considerable quantity of by-passed charge. That isn't said as a gag, you see? It's the truth, see. Because the top of the reactive mind, you see, the top of a GPM, is the hardest thing to find out what's in it. You haven't been over this â€“ these humps, and you probably won't have to be, but just let me give you this in passing. The hardest thing in the world to find are the top items of a GPM. I don't know how many potential oppterms and terminals were discarded before the actual ones were found, see. It's up â€“ oh, I don't know, the arrangements of that bank are almost uncountable. You have, at the moment, a perfect line plot. That's why you're getting away with it. But the top of a bank, you see, the whole reactive mind would be equally hard to get to because the thetan is sitting on all that charge, you see? Similarly, the top of a series, you see, would be the hardest thing to find the root words of, don't you see? And that is the scramble which has been going on before the thing was finally taped. It's very funny. I've got the rest of the root words of the series, you see? They just run out like hot butter, there's nothing to those. But getting those exact top ones, that was the tough one. And in putting that material in exact lineup, of course, we had mo-mentary stumbles on the line of exactly what was this thing. Of course, you know, you could have laid off and knocked off and not done any auditing on this, you see, for a couple of years and let me have run the whole bank out, don't you see? But you were running this danger, is by the time I've run the whole bank out, I might not be interested. [laughter, laughs] Gag."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 2 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 60 MCSC But it was a considerable tribute to the fact that there was â€“ there was some missing elements there, perfect line plot they started with â€“ didn't start with a perfect one, but had one within 24 hours â€“ and the materials pretty well lined up, exactly how they went, what the pat-terns were, and that sort of thing. This was pretty well ironed out, but nevertheless, neverthe-less, there were quantities of bypassed charge, huge quantities such as no co-audit will ever face again, you see? And the auditors in the co-audit actually were sufficiently smooth as auditors, and so forth, that their pcs just kept going along and they didn't have any big casual-ties or anything else. Now, in the clumsiest look, they would have killed somebody with that much charge, see â€“ the clumsiest look. And if their auditing had been the least bit crude, and so on, why, those people would have just been flying apart at every joint, you know. There would have been ARC breaks and rabble rouses and so forth, and max â€“ mass exoduses and people check-ing out and... [laughter] You know, I mean, it'd been â€“ it'd been horrible. Because if you can see the amount of catastrophe caused by just missing one item, and so forth, well, here they had a whole series missing. And yet they were auditing over the top of this and actually were making very nice gains and gave me yesterday afternoon a very beautiful series of reports. Everything was going along fine. [laughter] Now, by George, that's pretty good auditing, that's pretty doggone good auditing. So I wish to give them a compliment right now, on the subject of their auditing. They must be aw-ful good. [applause] All that's straightened out now, and I imagine in today's sessions the cases just took off like rockets. They must have gotten into the top of that other series and so forth, and it just must have run swish! In fact, I never saw anything connect up with such reads as the â€“ as connecting up the missing element with what had been bypassed. That really shot the lot, rerunning it and connecting it up. So the upshot of the situation was that I was very, very pleased with that. They're mak-ing terrific progress and everybody is very, very happy about this and very enthused about this. And I get a side note occasionally on letters going out of here and I'm not having to say, \"This is it,\" now. \"This is it\" is a very, very calm statement compared to some of the state-ments I've heard going out of here on various lines. And there isn't, I don't think, any doubt in anybody's mind who is in the co-audit, they'll eventually make it. They may make it with only one leg or something like that, they're figuring at the present moment, [laughter] but they'll make it, they're on their way and the door is open, wide open. All right, the situation with regard to auditing depends on another subject and that is a subject called study. If you can't learn anything, why, then you can't find out how to do any-thing. So just as I talked to you in the last lecture and told you that communication was not an end-all of processing but was absolutely vital if an auditor was ever going to get to a pc to do something for him, so it is true that study operates as the door, open or closed, to learning how to audit. If an auditor can't learn anything, then of course he won't be able to audit, regardless of the attitude he has towards the human race or his wish to do something for people or his desires in any way, shape or form. These all would be barriered by just this one point â€“ he couldn't learn anything."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 3 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 61 MCSC So in order to teach somebody how to audit, it's necessary that they be able to learn. Now, this is terribly fundamental, awful. This is down there scraping the bottom of the barrel with regard to fundamentals, and yet all great successes are built on attention to fundamentals. Everything is built on a fundamental. Unless you can isolate these fundamentals, you of course leave your building with a â€“ with an incomplete foundation. It's sort of sitting in the air ever afterwards unless you find the fundamental with which to proceed. You wouldn't build any skyscrapers if you didn't put down a foundation. Well, what is the foundation? That foundation in auditing is, of course, study â€“ the ability to learn. And failing that, why, an auditor has an awful hard time. This next datum I am going to give you is something â€“ is something I really don't want you to park behind the left lobe and skip, because this is going to make all the difference in the world to the future of Scientology. And that is a knowledge of this one point, this one point: That better than 50 percent of Scientology consists in the discipline of application, con-sists in the technology of application, consists in the know-how of application. And that's bet-ter than 50 percent of the subject â€“ better than 50 percent. Now, perhaps that datum is not very impressive, but let me â€“ let me amplify this and I think you will see how that datum is impressive. You could give the entirety of the processes which have produced results in Scientology â€“ and there are a great, big, many of them â€“ you could give these in their entirety to a field of mental practice, carte blanche â€“ that's just the processes, you understand, just the commands â€“ and they wouldn't be able to do a thing with them. They wouldn't be able to get any result with them of any kind whatsoever. They would turn out an asinine statement like the University of Chicago. It's a college. That's what we used to say about it at GW. We used to be tolerant about Chicago. Most of us wanted to go there because you only had to go a couple of years before they handed you a sheepskin and we were bored. But this outfit uttered this asinine statement: \"We have tested all the techniques of Dianetics and found out it didn't work.\" Well, in the first place it's asi-nine because all the techniques of Dianetics didn't exist in published form and were not avail-able to them to test, see? So right away, that was nonsense. For instance, I know of techniques that were released at the first Foundation in Elizabeth which have never seen the light of day; I have never seen them published or anything else. Matter of fact, I saw three or four splinter groups suddenly start up on stuff that was merely designed to take care of one pc or something like that, and then they decided that this would apply to all pcs and so forth. There are several brands of therapy which are adrift today which simply consist of one technique developed for one pc at Elizabeth. So for any outfit â€“ for any outfit to grandly look down its nose and say, \"We have tested all the techniques of Dianetics,\" you know? Well, what a statement, see? They haven't got them to test. How would they even know if they had tested \"all the techniques\"? Right away they are irresponsible. And then to say they didn't work would also be asinine because if they had tested even slop-pily, they would have gotten some result someplace, unless they were simply uttering a pub-licity statement to protect the vested interest. But that is aside from the point. The point is simply this: Yes, they could have had all the techniques. They could have had them all. They didn't, but they could have. And they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 4 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 62 MCSC could have, in their haphazard, bunged-up way, have tested these techniques and they would-n't have worked, because they didn't have a Dianeticist in the lot of them. There was nobody there trained in the basic disciplines of Dianetics. And that was 50 percent or better of the technology which they might have gathered. Quite important, don't you see? Now, give you another one: Reg and I, sailing around on the deep blue sea, invented a â€“ dreamed up a course that was â€“ had nothing to do with Scientology but had to do with business and commerce and nevertheless was a very broad application of Scientology to busi-ness and commerce. But the course was for another reason entirely and Reg thought this was a good idea, and he went ahead and he executed this course. And this course has been mar-velously successful. It's running, I think, at the present time and it's doing fine, you see? Only trouble is, everybody else is now trying to get into the act. It's a goodwill ges-ture. All this course is, is a nice goodwill gesture; it's trying to increase the salesmanship, and so forth, of retail merchants and their clerks, you see, so as to move more equipment and that sort of thing, see? That's what the course is designed to do. And everybody tried to get on the bandwagon, you see? There were other people started teaching this course, teaching their own courses to accomplish the same end, you see? And recently some company or another re-quested that Reg's course be taught to all of their staff and so forth. They get requests of this particular character. But Reg made the broad statement there that is particularly applicable to this lecture, and so on. He says, \"Well,\" he says, \"you don't have to worry about any competition or other people giving this course. They'll start and they'll fail, and so forth, but they won't be able to duplicate the course.\" Well, that's been the facts of the thing. This course could go on, they could (quote) \"teach similar courses,\" do this, do that, do the other thing, but of course, they are always aware, if only this, that they are teaching a substitute, that they are not teaching the real one. And people are always faintly aware of the fact that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship. Well, this in itself, you see, enters enough â€“ even on the copyist â€“ in the way of an overt or something like this, so that he then goes into an obsessive alter-is and the statement that Reg made was, \"They can't duplicate it,\" becomes completely true. They can't and they won't duplicate it and that is the end of that. And that â€“ these other courses have probably risen â€“ I don't know what the history of this â€“ I haven't kept up with it too well, but I think there are other courses have risen up and faded away by this time and a lot of enthusiasm has been generated in this quarter or that on duplicating this course and I think this course is still going on. Very successful. Probably one of the more delicate goodwill gestures that's been entered into by a company for a long time. Well, of course, one of the reasons it's successful, it's somewhat oriented Scientologi-cally. But that course wouldn't be duplicated and therefore wouldn't be tremendously success-ful. Now, supposing they taught the exact same methods; that is, they used the technique or something on these other courses that are being taught which are copy courses of this course, you see? Supposing they did that, and so on. There would still be some element miss-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 5 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 63 MCSC ing of some kind or another. That element would be the missing thing that would make the course that was being taught fail. I don't wish to belabor that particular simile, but it is merely interesting, it is merely interesting that even there, even there on such a thing as simply teaching some salesmen how to be nice to their customers and that sort of thing, that this thing, too, fails when you move it out of its own perimeter of discipline. So even on a thing as slight as that, you see, that one fails, too; and so it goes along the line. I don't know how much technology a university loses because every professor makes 90 percent of his salary by making the students buy his personal books. I think by the time you've rewritten James Watt, I think you've lost steam engines. And it's highly probable that there probably isn't a steam engineer in the world today that has really got the technology of steam. It has been perverted and twisted aside and misduplicated, and so on. And I go back to some of these old boys that knew their business, and so on. One time I was covering an air meet and there was a fellow standing there â€“ it was a bright sunshiny day and he was standing there with rubbers on and an umbrella. The umbrella wasn't unfurled, but he had that umbrella handy. It was a beautiful midsummer day, you see, and I wondered what this character was doing at an air meet â€“ all these daredevil racing pilots and that sort of thing around; and I was covering this thing for The Sportsman Pilot. But I thought this was good side color, so I surreptitiously took a shot at him with my press camera and got his name. His name was Young, and he was the second man in the world beyond the Wrights to fly. Ha-ha! He was probably one of the most famous early birds there was. My face was a little bit red, you see? He had become cautious in his old age, but in his day â€“ I imagine his caution still didn't extend to flight â€“ but in his day they used to fly a plane off the ground with an ambulance running along below it. [laughter] That's right! They saved more pilots that way. This was a man who was a wild man along this particular line. Well, I was very inter-ested in talking to him; I did an article on him eventually, and he showed me his scrapbooks, and so on. And I was particularly fascinated that there were 13 methods of flight, heavier-than-air methods of flight â€“ 13 of them â€“ of which the motionless wing was only one, and by the way, one of the less favored ones. And one of the reasons it was favored was because â€“ at all or done at all is because it didn't take much mechanical ingenuity to build it. But there were twelve other methods of heavier-than-air flight-heavier-than-air; that's not ballooning or zep-pelins. There's all kinds of methods of keeping aircraft aloft. There's the principle of the rotating stick, that if you throw a stick in a certain way it'll hum â€“ spinning, you know â€“ it'll hum and you will see it curve straight up into the air. It'll do the darnedest ascendancy and that's just a rotating stick. There is method after method of flight of this particular character. Because they concentrated on the one wing, it won, see? And you now have aircraft all over the world which are going along with this stiff wing out there from the fuselage, mostly because the early birds didn't have any of the wherewithal or anything else to build something"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 6 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 64 MCSC a little more esoteric or different, so it got the concentration of research and that is what we now call an airplane. But it was interesting listening to old Mr. Young â€“ who was designing these things back when â€“ it was very interesting to listen to him on a tone of disappointment that they had chosen that particular one to push forward in research because it was one of the less workable and one of the less efficient. Here was this vast body of technology, see, which had never been developed and which is lost back there in the first ten years of this century. All kinds of methods of flight; none of them ever went forward. Well, this one that was easy to do did get developed. Well, it's very interesting that one of them emerged and went forward; that's probably the one thing one should look at. But it is customary almost in civilizations for a body of knowledge to come into being, then get grooved into a certain specialization â€“ some piece of it, don't you see â€“ then that piece of it poorly duplicated and the rest of the technology to be lost. Boy, would I like to talk to James Watt on the subject of steam engines. He probably could tell you all about high-pressure boilers. See, he just didn't have the time, money, mate-rials, to build one. But maybe there were dozens of methods of utilization of steam which have just been lost, you see? What you're studying now is lost technology, lost technology. \"Now,\" you say, \"the civilization goes forward and wins anyway.\" Well, may I invite you to go almost in any direc-tion from where you are at this moment at Saint Hill, for a distance of ten or twelve miles and try not to find the remains of civilizations which did not win. They are all over the place here â€“ civilizations that are dead, civilizations that are missing, civilizations that no longer are with us. They are all on the basis of lost technology. They start specializing in one gimmick, there's nothing to amplify that gimmick, they finally lose the pieces of it and it vanishes. The civilization may be very well dependent upon that one gimmick; they have nothing to back it up. They lose it, in other words. Fascinating, the changes and turns and twists that these things take. Now, you could say a lot of other things about these civilizations, but the only thing I am pointing out at the moment is they're not here. See, they're not present. We don't have them with us. And they were good civilizations as they went: the Roman-Briton civilization, the Danish civilization that was here, the Saxon civilization here â€“ all these things terribly different â€“ the Norman civilization that was here. They're all over the shop. How about the Celtic civilization that existed before? Must have been quite a civiliza-tion. You read casually about wicker chariots charging through the Ashdown Forest. What's this â€“ wicker chariots charging through the Ashdown Forest? Well, our good friend Caesar reports as such. Well, this civilization has went. We know nothing about this civilization. It must have been pretty well advanced. And yet the scene of this battle, and so forth, is within about ten miles of Saint Hill. Well, where did that civilization go? What was it all about? That's a pretty"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 7 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 65 MCSC esoteric civilization â€“ wicker chariots, see? Maybe some somebody forgot how to weave wicker. Who knows what happened to that civilization, see? Now, the situation here is that technology gets lost and we have to study how it gets lost. And it's â€“ gets lost because people can't study. That's really the only reason it gets lost. That's quite a â€“ quite an interesting fundamental, to reduce everything down to that particular fundamental. We don't, then, go into the esoterics of \"They couldn't duplicate\" and \"They couldn't this,\" but that's only why they couldn't study. Civilizations tend to rise forward to a certain peak. And then under the stress of com-bat and the various elements and so forth, they start losing their technology. Well, they lose their technology simply because nobody studies the technology. How about this fellow, the silversmith of England? England's no longer today turning out the silver it once turned out. Its silver craftsmen used to be very, very famous. And then they got a Labour government, and it put the tax up on silver to a point where British silver no longer could be sold. They might as well have stood the British silversmith up against the wall and shot him because he drifted off then into other trades and the technology became lost; and it's practically a lost technology at this moment. Now, this has only been lost in the last decade or so. You'd have to talk hard to a â€“ to jewelry store managers and that sort of thing before you understand why it is that you can't buy silver. You can buy antique silver, you can buy yesteryear's silver; there are two or three of them still in business, and so forth. Well, what about these fellows? There are fellows around who learned this and there are plenty of textbooks on this subject and that technology still exists but it's going to be lost. That's for sure, it's going to be lost. How about the one old craftsman who is left in the plant? You see, he knows all about that. He's surrounded by people, and all of a sudden there might be a resurgence in that. Well, everybody merely depends on him; they don't learn the craft. You see, they simply depend on him to know it. It all comes up against the dead end of not being able to learn, not being able to study. Well, I always prided myself in being a very quick study, so I, myself, can speak from fair expertness in this particular line. But I know my own history on this and I know my own blind spots on this. When you become less worried about your mental status or something like this in the world, you can actually look at it and find out if there is anything wrong with it and dare admit that it could stand a few improvements here and there. One of the things about study itself is that there are a great many things around that are false and you could study a lot of false things and therefore become disabused of studying because you had studied something false. This would be one of the reasons why you might cease to study. I really don't see that that has anything to do with it, except that it enters the idea of judgment of what you're studying. So if one studied without any judgment whatsoever of what he was studying or ability to evaluate what he was studying or know what he was studying, why, his ability to study would be very poor indeed. He'd just be Chinese in aspect. Nothing wrong with the Chinese, but I remember going to school, the eighth grade, I think. I spent some months going through grammar school, all on different stations and places. And the situation that arose in the eighth grade was that nobody could get an A mark"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 8 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 66 MCSC except two Chinese who were in the school. And they had â€“ they had learned how to study but so have parrots learned how to study if that is their study. And they would get up and they would reel off the page number and the paragraph and everything else of the history book assignments, you see, and they'd give it to you verbatim. Most marvelous job of total duplication you ever heard of, but they would not be able to tell you what universe. And if you had â€“ if you had varied one comma or asked for an opinion on that material studied in that way, they would have come a cropper at once, and very fre-quently did. They would have to remember whether it was in the middle of the book or the back of the book, as to what period that it applied to or something like this. Most marvelous job of carbon-copy duplication that I ever saw, and it used to irk the rest of us, you see, because they would always get A-plus, and it held up such a horrible ex-ample to the teacher that the teacher would, of course, then give nothing like an A-plus to any mere knowledge of the subject, you see? So our renditions of it were quite rapidly thrown away and we usually got D. I'll never forgive them. [laughter] But anyway, joking aside, these â€“ this is â€“ this is a case of perfect, perfect, complete perfect duplication without a grain of sense connected with it; and that's absolutely deadly, so that isn't how you study. Deadly! But perhaps you should be able to do that, but I would con-sider that a mental feat, and I don't think study has anything to do with mental feats. Study has to do with understanding. Study has to do, basic and most formally, with just really one thing: willingness to know. That's the first little gate that has to be opened to embark upon study: willingness to know. If that gate remains closed, then you're liable to get into such things as the total verba-tim, rote system; you are liable to get into all kinds of other systems, none of which will add up to any knowledge. Now, when you recognize that in Scientology we have one thing â€“ one thing â€“ which is not very easy to put into texts and which may never be put into texts: the discipline of how you do it. But when you recognize that that one thing actually is difficult to transmit in â€“ by the written word â€“ and is very easy to transmit by example. And when I call your attention to an earlier part of this lecture, when I said that it amounted to at least 50 percent of what we were doing, and I'll point out to you that there's a frailty involved in the relay of this informa-tion that's the future success of Scientology, and that frailty is right there. It could very easily, very easily become an unworkable subject. You could take all the GPMs in the world â€“ what do you think would happen if you took all the GPMs and the total map of the bank and everything exactly right and gave it at this moment to psychiatry? I know what they'd do. They would immediately analyze Poe to see how many times one of these words had occurred in one of his books, and then get the fractional recurrence of and then try to explain why Poe was mad, or something like this, don't you see? This is probably what they'd do with this material. It'd be monkey tricks, you know? I even thought vengefully one day of sending all of the whole plot to the American Journal of Psychology â€“ which, by the way, would absolutely fall on its face and bound its forehead to flinders if I were to give them an article. That's one of the reasons why they're a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 9 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 67 MCSC little bit mad at us. I have been soundly berated by them for not publishing it with them at least one of our case histories, because it would revolutionize all... You see, it can't revolu-tionize anything unless published in their magazine. [laughter] I've been scolded by them for this but I thought vengefully of just giving them the whole plot and let them publish it, see? And that would eliminate that. [laughter] But the point, the point I'm making here, is that all of this technology that can be writ-ten down, and so forth, could be relayed with the same result of the University of Chicago: no result, see? Because it has this element missing from it: the discipline of how you do it. Now, when I tell you that an auditor can get so good that a gross bypassed charge ex-ists in a session and his auditing is sufficiently smooth that nowhere and on no student in that co-audit did it get keyed in â€“ wow! See, this is an almost impossible auditing feat. That's walking around the edges of the lion's cage, you see, so neatly and adroitly that there didn't even have to be bars there. This is pretty terrific, see? Well, what did that? That's auditing discipline. That's the communication formula, that's this, this is handling the meter, this is what you do with a pc and what you don't do with a pc, and so forth. This is omitting from the auditing sessions the things that Mary Sue comes down as GAEs on, on Wednesdays, on TV demos; weeding these things out, keeping that line straight â€“ over 50 percent of it. We must, at this particular time, then, do this rather superlatively well here at Saint Hill. Because if any serious goof existed on the part of any of those auditors in the co-audit, any such consistent GAE as we see when a person first arrives here, he would have just wound his pc up in a pile of junk because there was enough there to have jammed the pc into a pancake against the brick wall, see? There wasn't any slight bypassed charge to be triggered, see? They weren't even aware of the fact that it was there and they were auditing around it sufficiently smoothly that it didn't cave anybody in. Well now, on the reverse side of the coin, on the reverse side of the coin, if they had had all of their materials absolutely perfect right at the outset and if their auditing discipline â€“ their ability to audit â€“ had been as poor as it might have been, with all the materials and tech-nology perfect and the process being done, they would have turned their pc into a pale pink pancake up against the brick wall. Do you understand? That's the other side of the coin! Now, if you appreciate that, you can appreciate the remark I make when I tell you that the technique is one thing but the way it is applied is what makes the car go down the road. And that thing is the most likely thing to get lost. So therefore, we're in business as long as an auditor can learn how to audit. You see, you don't have to learn anything actually to run GPMs. You can be handed it on cards. Did you â€“ you realize this? You could probably be handed it on cards and you could reel it off one way or the other in some kind of patter. You wouldn't even have to learn it, you know? You could just let it sort of go off water like the â€“ goes off the ducks back, you see? You could parrot it, you see, from a â€“ from a list or a card or something like this. You would-n't have to be learned. You're not up against learning in that burrow. In fact, if I ever hear of an Instructor making some new student memorize a line plot so that he can run it better, I'll give him a GAE with exclamation points â€“ the Instructor, see? That would be the most grue-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 10 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 68 MCSC some thing. So actually, in that particular case the technology is not something you would learn. You wouldn't even learn the â€“ what's called the technique â€“ you wouldn't dare! It'd just kill the student; that'd be it. If you ever have a â€“ have a â€“ find yourself, bird-dogged by a spy from the Federal â€“ I don't want to be â€“ pardon me, I'd â€“ there are ladies present â€“ why, just decide that he had bet-ter learn by heart â€“ don't even pick out anything very rough, just give him one of the Helatro-bus line plots and tell him, well, he has to start in by learning that by heart. [laughter] So therefore, when I am talking to you about learning, we're practically not on the sub-ject of technology at all. We know what grade certain technology belongs in and so forth, but â€“ I do it myself very often, write the process out rapidly below the meter, so that I can put my pencil â€“ let's say it's a multiple question. I don't want to involve my wits, which should be involved with auditing, with remembering what question the pc is stumbling along on. I don't want to involve my wits with that, so I'll just write down the four or five commands, or what-ever the thing is in rotation, and just stab the one with my pencil that is currently in action, you know; and when I come to the next one, why, I see that all is well and I look down at the paper and refresh my memory of the thing and give it to him again, don't you see? Well, that leaves me free to audit; has nothing to do with that. In fact, there's tricks like you're running a multiple alternate question, and so forth; your positive is your index fin-ger and the negative is the middle finger, and so forth, and just touch them with your thumb. Touch the positive question â€“ you're on the positive question. Well, your thumb is on your index finger; negative question, your thumb is on your middle finger, and so on. You don't get mixed up that way, and you don't mix up the pc either nor do you have to sit there saying, \"Now, let me see, what am I now...\" you know? That's for the birds. So frankly, aside from classifying and know where the technology goes, I wouldn't say there is anything to learn in that zone at all. You're not going to learn auditing commands. You know what type of command should be there, you're going to learn that but not the com-mand. You're not going to learn line plots or GPMs or something like that. Well, this changes the complete complexion of, \"What â€“ what â€“ what are we supposed to learn? Then what â€“ what learning is he talking about?\" I'm talking now about learning how to do it, how to apply it. See? That's what I'm talking about. Well, it's quite fascinating that there's many a guy shows up, he just wants a couple of processes so that he can learn these processes, and so on, and then he thinks he's educated and he can go on his way because he knows he can apply those; and then somehow or another they never seem to work for him, and he's always missing as to why they're not working for him. Well, what he should be learning is the subject of auditing. Bulletins connected with good indicators, bulletins connected with comm cycles, and this type of thing. What are the tools of the trade here? Where â€“ what's the categories of these tools, and so on, and how are they applied and what judgment do you use in connection with them? Learn those well enough so you're relaxed about them. Now, that's something to learn. And yet, I guarantee you, that that consistently will get brushed off lightly in comparison to some gimmick or trick"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 11 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 69 MCSC or process, see? The person, in other words, will be very happy to learn what are the auditing commands for something or other but have nothing whatsoever to do with a comm cycle. Now, a comm cycle takes some learning, man, as you know! You can't even glibly say, \"Well, it blah blah blah blah blah, and it starts and continues and it finishes, and â€“ and that's all there is to a comm cycle and now we know all that. All right, now what's the auditing command, you see? That's what's important.\" No, that's not what's important. The auditing command won't work unless you arrive, unless it arrives with the pc. And it's got to arrive with the pc along with certain \"How do you do it? How do you act like an auditor? How do you sound like an auditor?\" That's the stuff, that's the stuff that gets it there. Now, I had a recent experience which is quite amusing. I have my lighter moments and I decided that I had better make an independent study. There's no sense in getting too concentrated on any one particular point, and I was going along like a shot rocket in the direc-tion of Class VI materials and working on them very hard and very concentrated and that sort of thing, but I didn't figure that was going to keep my mind that involved. I find â€“ I felt I might as well take up another subject which was entirely independent, you know? Give me a nice shift of attention. So some years ago I had incautiously and in a moment of weakness bought a course of photography. Of course, I've been at photography since I was a kid; a nice hobby, and I have a lot of fun with it, and so forth. And at one time or another, why, I've sold pictures and so on. It's just one of these hobbyist things that you fool with. I'd probably classify as an advanced amateur; one time I classified as a pro, when I was in college. Used to make a lot of money, National Geographic and so forth. I think there's some geography books around that still carry pictures of mine in them. But the upshot of it is, that I decided that in view of the fact that my mind was very heavily in this direction, I might as well put it in another direction. So I took up this corre-spondence course in photography â€“ the New York Institute of Photography, one of the best â€“ and rolled up my sleeves, and found out I'd never gotten deeper than about the third lesson. So I decided I would learn a little bit about study and I would start and study this thing up and I would get myself pushed along the line and get all my lessons done like a good boy, and send it all in, lesson by lesson, you know? Well, what do you know? What do you know? First time in my life I learned some-thing about studying. I learned something very subjectively and very real about studying. The only reason I'm telling you this is not to amuse you particularly, but you might be able to use this. And it's just this: I began to wonder why I had stopped at the third lesson. I was toler-antly going on forward studying the remaining lessons, and so forth, but why had I stopped at the third lesson and why was I bogging here and there along the line? Because this was not going easy. Now, of course, this is a very, very wild, occasionally very dry, very often very stupid subject, the subject of photography, because it gets into optics. Well, you want to take a pic-ture, not study optics, you see? But optics are apparently something that people who want you"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 12 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 70 MCSC to know about photography hold very dear to their hearts and they nag you about, you see? [laughter] And then there's the subject of chemistry, and chemistry is very interesting. There are numbers of chemicals and they have something to do with the picture appearing on the thing, but that's something you really don't know too much about. If you can walk into a darkroom and turn yourself out a good negative and a good print, who the devil wants to know anything about chemistry, don't you see? This was more or less my attitude. But I went on studying like a good boy and passing my examinations at the end. Every booklet has an examination. And all of a sudden it dawned on me that although I'd been inter-ested in this since I was 12 years old, I didn't know anything about it! Horrible, dark thought. I've taken pictures, I've published pictures, people have paid me good cash money on the line, my pictures have been on covers of magazines, a very slick fellow. And I don't know anything about this subject! It struck me like a thunderbolt! This is a subject I had been at, if you please, since I was 12, in this lifetime. And I suddenly realized I didn't know anything about it. And it wasn't a case of sudden amnesia or something. It was just... [laughter] \"You what?\" you know, and \"It's â€“ it's which?\" And I suddenly rapidly reviewed what my reactions had been and made a very careful analysis of the whole thing and exactly what had happened. I'd had a particularly great subjec-tive reality on this. I was studying an allied subject; I was forcing all of you to study; I should know something about the subject of study. And so I had, more or less, to some degree, started out to learn something about study and I learned something right then. The tolerance that I had toward them had brought me up to a point where I was per-fectly willing to learn a few gimmicks from them, and that was the state of mind I had entered that course upon. I was perfectly willing to learn a few gimmicks from them. I realized that my arrogance on the subject has absolutely â€“ unprintably unspeakable. My arrogance was absolutely fantastic! But look, I've been at it since I was 12. I studied photography under some of the â€“ some of the old boys that were kicking around at that time. Some of the government photog-raphers and scientists up in the National Museum were patient enough to teach me about pho-tography, I read books on the subject, read this and that, even worked in professional dark-rooms. And the evidence was right in front of my face. Good heavens! People pay you money for pictures. I used to take pictures for Underwood and Underwood. And I had always said that the trouble with my photography as I came on up the line â€“ I had it all beautifully explained â€“ the trouble with my photography as I came on up the line was they kept changing their methods. [comm lag, laughter] I had it beautifully explained. So therefore â€“ well, actually, since I started photography, miniature cameras have come out, pan-chromatic film, different types of developers, flashbulbs have come out; they've changed all these things. As a matter of fact, they're changing one on me right now. I had one film made by Ilford so tame that I could turn out a fine grain negative on this stuff, and they went and changed the speed rating of the film. Now you can't get the old film, so I don't know how to do it now. I was â€“ this was blame on my part, you see? They kept shifting materials on me."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 13 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 71 MCSC And what had dawned on me is, what I was being struck with in these texts â€“ because this is a good professional course, see; this is nothing for any amateur â€“ what I was being struck with in the text was known by Mathew Brady in the American Civil War. The basics and fundamentals that I didn't know had been present in that subject since 1860! Had nothing to do with changing materials. I didn't know the first fundamental of why the picture got took in the first place! And all of a sudden, at that moment, it dawned on me with a tremendous crash that I had been very arrogant and that I really didn't know all there was to know under the sun, moon and stars on the subject of photography; I really wasn't the world's past master on the subject of photography because I had gotten a few results in my day, but that there was some-thing there to learn. That's what I was struck with. And boy, I buckled down and started to study. Now, the speed of advance is very interesting: three books in three and a half years; eight books in two weeks. And one is prior to that realization and the other is post that reali-zation. I suddenly looked at it last night and realized I was halfway through the course. Three and a half years it took me to get the first three of the fifty-some books that comprise the course. Why was I unable to move through that? Well, I was studying something I knew all about. I could not bring myself into a relaxed frame of mind of \"Here is something to study. Let's study it.\" No, I was studying it through this screen: \"I know all about this. I know every-thing there is to know about it.\" Well, will you please tell me why the devil I was sitting there studying it, then? If I knew all about it, why was I sitting there studying it? And yet I was putting up this pretense of studying it. I was even pretending to myself I was studying it. I didn't realize that I was pretending. I thought I was really studying it, you see? I'd read it, you know, and so on. [laughter] But it was all from the viewpoint that I knew all about it. And my arrogance was such that I was perfectly willing to learn a few tricks from them, and I think that was very tolerant of me. Now, the funny part of that is, in subsequent study and so forth, my whole viewpoint has shifted on the subject, the whole viewpoint of what I'm willing to take a picture of; and my critical standards of what's a good picture have shifted utterly. I'm even criticizing their examples of perfect pictures, see? Very critical, but very well-founded criticism. I couldn't learn because I knew all â€“ that I knew all about it, you see? Now, that passed from a realization that I didn't really know a thing about it; I had to get right back to funda-mentals and study those fundamentals. Once I got those fundamentals in and had those fun-damentals well studied, and so on, and moving along the line up there, then I got to a point where I was not only perfectly willing to learn, I was also perfectly willing to talk back. I wasn't in any slavish state about learning. I knew my fundamentals now. I could see where they applied, and so forth, and within the scope and limits of that educational course was able to talk up. In other words, I could have an opinion. I could now have an opinion, I could exert judgment. I had no judgment on the subject before. I merely had some fixed ideas, just fixed ideas, and these fixed ideas told me that I really knew all was to know about the subject."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 14 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 72 MCSC When I finally found out â€“ the big breakthrough was I found out there was something there to learn â€“ that I didn't know. It wasn't a matter of a few gimmicks. Then this reversed around the other way, and with hard study, all of a sudden made another breakthrough: I freed my own judgment. I'd talk to any of these birds now. [There are] texts there by some very famous photog-raphers. Good, hard, tough slugging this thing is, but one of those guys, I'd say, \"Ah, come off of it,\" you know? \"You're talking like this, but this picture here, man, I â€“ how come? Look, you've burned out all of the...\" This would have been legitimate. He would have talked to me about it, too. I'd say, \"Look-a-there. You've burned out all of the highlights. You just burned them right straight through. Why? You might even have at least remedied it in the darkroom, for heaven's sakes.\" And he would have said, \"Well, I didn't think anybody would notice.\" I'd say, \"Well, I noticed.\" Critical. Not that criticism is bad, don't you see; but I developed a critical eye, did not have to slavishly say, \"This is a picture by Sam Falk, New York Times magazine, one of the greatest exhibition photographers of all time. Therefore it is holy.\" See? Gone completely through that and up to a point of where, \"That's an awful good picture. That guy really has a good sense of composition, terrific sense of composition. What the hell was he doing that day in the darkroom? Drunk?\" See what I mean? And I could have put my point â€“ finger on a point which I'm sure that Sam Falk himself would have agreed with. He'd say, \"That's right. I didn't even hold back the enlarger light on that burned off highlight over at the side, and it completely washes out that bird's features over there. That's right, you're right. Attracts the eye over to the side of the picture, not to the principle subject. You're right, could have been improved, could have been improved in the darkroom.\" He wouldn't have argued about it. Or he could have said to me, \"You don't know how bad the negative is!\" [laughter, laughs] You see what I mean? Then this would have been a sensible discussion because in the meantime, by burning the midnight... dawn actually; I've been using this to go to sleep on. But the point had come up here, where one's fixed slavishness to something was there because one really didn't understand it in the first place, so he had to have fixed opinions to safeguard himself. \"Perspective: Perspective is handled by making something dwindle into the distance. Well, there is â€“ if I don't have something go 'dwindle into the distance,' the picture won't have perspective.\" You know, this kind of a slavish fixed idea on the subject of perspective. Not \"There are a lot of ways to give pictures a three-dimensional effect.\" See, that'd do you a dif-ferent point of view, see. And \"Perspective is accomplished in several ways.\" A different viewpoint, see? Then, once you understand that, then you can look at a picture and say, \"Well, that photographer had a good command of perspective,\" or \"He didn't.\" See? You say, \"This guy had stepped over here another couple of feet to take his picture, he probably would have had a different depth, and it would have looked a lot better,\" see? Because, look, here's a couple of advantages he could have taken that he didn't take."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 15 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 73 MCSC In other words, you have a flexibility, you have a flexibility of route, so therefore you can have an opinion, not a fixed idea or a prejudice. There's a big difference between a preju-diced or a fixed idea and the ability to have an opinion. An opinion could be based on many things. But when an opinion is based on an inabil-ity to find out what it was all about in the first place, a man looks like a fool, and he suddenly looks like a fool even to himself when he makes a breakthrough. So that my ideas on the subject of photography were not resulting in a finished picture. That's one of the first things I suddenly recognized, you know? The lightning struck. That was not necessarily what broke me down on the line. I'd broke it down before that, but I recog-nized that afterwards. Well, a guy's as good as he can finish a picture. It doesn't have anything to do with anything else. It obviously can be done, so therefore, why, there it is. And this also included overshooting the mark, which you might find interesting. Pre-vious to this breakthrough I made and the realization that I didn't know what the devil I was doing when I took a camera. I know how to clean lenses and do all sorts of things, but I didn't know what I was doing when I picked up a camera. I mean it was just ridiculous to even think that I did. A few lucky breaks, you know, and you seem to be so hot, but what about this? It's a bum day and you want to get a picture and if you're real shaky and you don't know your business and so forth, you say, \"Well, it's a bum day. That's one day I don't get a picture.\" See? Well, if you really knew your camera, you wouldn't pay any attention to the fact that it was a bum day. You'd say, \"Oh, yeah. Well, all right.\" Bang-bang. \"What do we want the ef-fect here? Bright sunlight. Good.\" Bang, boom! You'd say, \"That's kind of interesting; awful foggy out there. Well, let's make the fog a little bit worse, and let's get it â€“ real spooky-looking picture,\" see? If you knew your business, then you could turn the tool to your advantage, any which direction you could, see? You weren't the victim of everything that occurred. You weren't the victim of every little splinter on the road, see? \"Well, it's too bad a day. The sun's not out and â€“ oh, we'll take that picture tomorrow or some other day when the weather is nicer,\" you know? Well, what's â€“ what's this? You mean â€“ this can â€“ this can exist to such a big goof that you don't get a picture at all then? How do you like this? And yet a guy would not be able, who couldn't say, \"All right, let's see,\" pick up a camera and take a picture, see? He's supposed to get a picture. Well, he should know his sub-ject well enough that he can get a picture. That's fairly easy. All he's got to do is put himself in the vicinity of what he's trying to take a picture of; if he knew his tools real well, if he knew his darkroom technique real well, he'd p... he'd get a picture. See, he'd get a very ac-ceptable picture. Now, the degree of picture that you would get depends a lot on practice and that sort of thing. So, I learned that lesson, too, in a big way, that the conditions of the activity around me did not necessarily monitor whether or not I got a result or not. \"Pc nattery today, there-fore we couldn't get much auditing done.\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 16 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 74 MCSC What the hell! Are you an auditor or aren't you, see? I mean that's it. Nattery pc, snat-tery pc â€“ who cares? You're going in to do a session? Well, do a session. So it takes you a little bit longer to get the session wheeling. Well, get it wheeling. That's the difference, don't you see? But these are the things I learned through this little side study, and it was â€“ I found it, myself, very interesting to pick up a completely alien subject to what we are doing â€“ it had been lying around for quite a while; it merely exists in the field of hobby â€“ and find all kinds of applicable materials on the subject of study, and to find out that the first thing that barriers learning is the consideration that you know all about it. And if you want to build up a ridge on the subject of learning, man, that's it! Just consider you know all there is to know about it. And the next thing â€“ the next thing is, don't let your idea of what you know â€“ this is most amusing â€“ don't let your idea of what you know get contaminated in any way by the fact that you're not producing. You're not getting any result, see? You're not getting any result and this is quite â€“ rather obvious to you that you're not getting a result, but this doesn't challenge for a moment the idea that you know, see? Yeah, this never causes you to question it for an instant. See, you're not getting a result; you know that you know; and the fact that you're not getting a result doesn't challenge your conviction that you know. The other thing is the fixed â€“ the idea of the fixed opinion. One has to have certain fixed opinions to protect the fact that he's stupid on the subject and that he can exercise no judgment of any kind whatsoever as long as he's mired down in a bunch of fixed opinions. And that afterwards, that judgment, then, depends on a freedom from fixed opinions and an actuality of a â€“ of a good assessment. You know what you know, you know what you don't know, see? You know what you know, you know what you don't know. In other words, you're not fighting this chimerical thing. You're not protecting your nebulous reputation to yourself about how wise and how marvelous you are. You're relaxed on this subject, you see? You can say, \"Well, there's one section of this I don't know anything about. Have to look into it some day.\" But at the same time this doesn't bring you into a feeling that you don't know what you do know. Utilization of judgment, then, depends on a very thorough knowledge of a subject, and if you haven't got judgment on a subject, why, it's because you don't know the subject. That's just that. If you find your judgment is very often false or bad in some line, well, you must realize that this signals to you in some way or another that this â€“ maybe you don't know all there is to know about this certain situation, see? If your judgment on it was bad, why, it must have been bad because of an absence of knowledge of the subject. So, what it boils down to, what it boils down to is an auditor's ability to learn depends not necessarily on his saying how stupid he is, but depends certainly on a willingness to learn â€“ just a willingness to learn. He's willing to learn, and so forth. And the biggest single barrier is a preconception that he knows that is not attended by any singular result. For instance, let's hear a remark something like this: \"Well, I â€“ I know Scientology. I've studied Scientology a long time and I know it very well. In fact, I audit very well. Of course, I don't get very good results.\" Well, this is that thing â€“ same thing in a nutshell: this â€“ the fact that he isn't getting results â€“ results can be gotten; he's heard of these things, he's seen"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 17 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 75 MCSC them around, and so on; results can be gotten. But this fact does not at all challenge his im-plicit confidence that he knows all there is to know on the subject, you see? Doesn't challenge him for an instant. Well, of course, that's just a lack of perceptiveness. A fellow can't see. He's not capa-ble of judgment with regard to his own skill. His judgment, then, with regard to what he's do-ing is at fault to that gross error. He is uttering the fact that black is white. He can't do it, yet he knows all about it. He knows all there is to know about doing it, yet he can't do it. Well, that's a silly statement, and that is the lowest ebb of judgment on any one particular subject. You get into a â€“ you can get into an area of examination of this sort of thing, you find out that nearly everyone is put up in some particular sectors to status. Status has an awful lot to do with this, you know? And he gets pushed up into a feeling like he has to protect his own status by a certain arrogance or pretense, even to himself He has to think well of himself, don't you see, by pretending that he knows something or appearing very clever to himself or so forth. He's really â€“ really, you can head it under the heading of \"self-esteem,\" one of the methods of bolstering self-esteem. Nothing particular wrong with this. I'm pointing this out in a very mild way. It's necessary that an individual feel somewhat confident in some direction. But it's also very interesting that this need for status and self-esteem evaporates in the pres-ence of real knowledge and a real esteem takes its place. And it's that real esteem which is most impressive to self and to others because it's producing results. The â€“ competence â€“ there is no argument with competence, no argument with it at all. It doesn't then really come down to a test of \"What does a person know?\" but it comes down to a test of \"What can a person do?\" And if you just adjudicate this on the basis of it's not â€“ well, psychiatry should serve as a wonderful example to you in this, man. I hate to run these boys down because they are being kicked to pieces anyhow, but let me tell you, I have never been as surprised over things as I have been by that particular crew. It's not that I'm even terribly fascinated with what they're doing. But do you know, I read one time what an examination for a diplomate in psychiatry consisted of, and do you know, it only consisted of the date and the context and title and the place of publication of Freud's lectures! Not what was in them! Not \"What could you do in the field of psychiatry?\" But it was just that: \"When was the lecture given? What was its title?\" don't you see, and \"What publication did it appear in?\" And that's an examination for a diplomate, the highest degree in psychiatry! Oh, some psychiatrist will come along because they're always trying to make a liar out of everybody, they come along and tell, \"Oh, that's not true, that's not true, that's not true.\" And you say â€“ they're doing this down in Melbourne right now. \"Oh, that's not true, that's not true, that's not true. And well, he doesn't really know anything about psychoanalysis,\" and so forth. \"Well, does psychoanalysis assert that sex is the basic mainspring of life?\" \"Well, yes.\" \"Well, does the article say this?\" \"Yes.\""},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 18 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 76 MCSC \"Well, is that true about psychoanalysis?\" \"Well, yes; but, you see, Hubbard doesn't know anything about psychoanalysis.\" \"Well, what doesn't he know about psychoanalysis?\" See? \"Oh, well, he wouldn't know anything about it, because he just wouldn't know any-thing about it,\" and so forth. \"Well, what psychoanalysis are you talking...?\" \"Well, we don't know. There's various brands of psychoanalysis.\" [laughter] You always would get into this kind of an argument. It's something like walking into a swamp when you â€“ when you try to talk on this particular subject, you see? So it's not very sensible. Well, I'm just pointing out to you that that is really pure idiocy â€“ that's really pure idi-ocy. One, could you learn anything from that lecture? And two, how have you been able to apply it? And three, if the fellow really knew about it, he'd be able to answer the next ques-tion. If he really knew up to this point, he'd be able to answer the next question: Well, what opinion do you have of it? What opinion do you have of that subject matter? See? If he really â€“ if he really knew the subject and he'd studied that, and he really knew that and he could apply that, and so forth, then he'd have a free opinion on it. He wouldn't have to be pro-tecting himself with his free opinions. See, it'd have nothing to do with esteem or anything else. He'd just have a free opinion on the subject, you see? In other words, he'd have judg-ment. But if you fix it on \"Give us the lecture and the date and where was it published and that's all you have to know about it,\" you know, you of course have taught the man nothing more than you could learn from a card-catalog system. Well, it doesn't have anything to do with doingness. Well, in photography â€“ which I've just used as a somewhat amusing sidelight to this to you â€“ the test, of course, is whether or not you can get a picture. That seems rather obvious, doesn't it? That would be â€“ it's different than in â€“ well, you conclude photography now is an art, which is interesting, because it's only graduated into that field very recently. Metropolitan Museum, and so forth, has exhibits on it now as a fine art, but â€“ didn't used to be. Now, a critic could exist in the field of painting, merely through his knowledge of painters and paintings, and that sort of thing, and he could have opinions on the subject. These things would probably be very basic, and that's all very fine because here's a very wide, very complex field. And maybe you could have a critic in the field of photography who didn't really have to be able to produce a picture. Maybe he could just criticize pictures and maybe to a very good extent. But the odd part of it is as you enter into a technical subject out of a purely artistic subject, this burning question comes up: How the devil would he know whether or not that was a good darkroom piece of work? He would have to be able to know what can be done in a darkroom, so he'd have to answer the question, \"What is done in a darkroom? Is this better"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 19 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 77 MCSC than what is done in a darkroom or worse than what is done in a darkroom?\" because you're up against this technical fact. A technical fact intrudes here, unlike art. You can take a handful of mud and throw it at a rock and say, \"That's a great painting.\" See? Well, maybe it does have form and design. Who would know? Because there is no real technical backup with regard to art at large. It's great, great, wide, huge subject, you see? Depending on, mostly, on whether a person is pleased or displeased with some form, color, object or significance. It basically forms an opinion anyhow. But the second that you get into a technical fact, when you get into the technical line, well, you have to know what can be done, you have to know if it is done well, what is being done and what isn't being done, see? This, then, you would have to know pretty well before you could have much of an opinion on the subject. In other words, there could be an art critic quite legitimately, but I don't think there could actually be a photographic critic who didn't really know his photography. See, he'd have to know his photography to be a â€“ be a critic of it, because he'd have to know what the devil to compare it to. And actually, there wouldn't be any auditing critic who couldn't audit. You couldn't criticize auditing if you couldn't audit. You'd have to know what could be done and what couldn't be done. I think anybody that's been over the jumps of the co-audit here recently, and so forth, he'd be quite a critic of auditing â€“ not on a basis of my giving an examination and finding out what he knows about auditing but just on the basis of the trial and error of just the last two or three weeks. I give you that as a very broad test, man. I don't think there ever again will be such a test, never again. Probably won't be that much bypassed charge, you see? But that's a terrific test; wasn't given to them willingly or anything of that sort, it just occurred that way. What a fantastic test! Those people must really know how to audit, see? That's the test, be-cause under similar circumstances, you ARC break a pc on itsa â€“ oh, you get the comparison; very simple. Ha-ha-ha, you see? Well, God, all you have to do is drop a toothpick in R6 and you ARC break one. That must be pretty smooth. Now, I don't think there's anybody â€“ doubts in anybody's mind in R6 that they aren't going places and that the technology in running GPMs isn't doing some fantas-tic things, one way or the other, for pcs, and so forth. The result is being produced; the result is being produced smoothly. It'll of course be produced much more smoothly and much more rapidly, as a matter of fact, with the top of the bank being cut into, exactly correctly. But even with that, it's producing results, see? All right. Then that tells you that there must be an awful difference between a Level VI co-audit auditor and somebody who would ARC break a pc on itsa. But I'm willing to make you a bet that the auditor now in Level VI co-audit, asked for an opinion of auditing, would probably give you a very honest, offhand, very certain, very firm opinion â€“ boppety, boppety, boppety, bop."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 20 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 78 MCSC You ask him something about, \"Well, is that person's auditing good or bad?\" or so forth. Or \"Was that a proper way to do it?\" and so forth. He'll give you quite an opinion, see? Boppety, boppety, bop. Wouldn't be any status connected with it, see? He'd just give you an honest opinion on the subject, you see? And you ask this person that can ARC break a pc on itsa for an opinion, he'd give you a couple of fixed data but he wouldn't be able to give you much of an honest opinion. Something else that would be different, something else that would be different: I'll just bet you that a person in the Level VI Co-audit at the present moment, you gave him some-thing to study and so forth, he could find out what was there and know what knowledge was there, without questioning whether or not it was good, bad or indifferent that he learn it or whether or not it was damaging for him to learn it or whether or not it was this or that or whether or not he knew all about it. You wouldn't run into much of that argument. But the person who would ARC break a person on itsa: Don't challenge that arrogance, man. He knows all there is to know about it; he has known all there is to know about it from the beginning; he will notice all â€“ knows all there is that will ever be known about it; he knows all this perfectly, and he would be deeply insulted if you even inferred there was some-thing on the subject that he didn't know. Do you see? There would be this significant differ-ence. If you asked him at the same time if he was willing to learn about it, well, he'd hedge. Of course, he isn't. He isn't willing to learn about it. He's on the false premise that he knows all about it. Well, you want to ask him, \"Well, what are you there for? Why are you studying it then, if you know all about it?\" This might shake him up. But you only really have to shake up this point in that auditor. He isn't being bad, he's merely being arrogant. He lacks the humility of vast wisdom, and in its place he has the arro-gance of \"know it all,\" when he knows nothing. He doesn't even know what he doesn't know. And there's the gates of study; they're right there. That's the gate of study. That's the gate you got to crack, that's the one you got to kick down before you walk any road in toward any subject. And I don't care whether that subject is auditing or photography. I think you would hold â€“ it would hold good uniformly and straight through, and so forth. So I've been over the jumps on a completely alien and different subject and I have found certain things held true and I compared them to the experiences I've had in trying to relay, interpret or teach Scientology, and so forth. And I've found that they held good. I've found out that they held good straight through. I can give you dozens of case histories and I can't really give you a lot of exceptions outside of this field, and I can even tell you â€“ you say: \"Well, there's the case of the fellow who can't see, and doesn't know the language,\" and that sort of thing. I don't know, what's the matter with him that he can't see and doesn't know the language? He must be arrogant indeed! Very, very funny, but you'll find that that would hold good, too. If you don't believe it, talk to a field mouse some day. Talk to a field mouse about the ways of man. It might be a very entertaining conversation, if you could talk to him. And there, man, you would find arrogance. Electronics, nuclear physics â€“ he's never heard of them but he knows all about them. [laughs]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ INTRODUCTION 21 SHSBC-387 â€“ 18.6.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 79 MCSC And there is the only place that we in Scientology are going to break down, if we break down at all. And there is about the only place where our technology will break down. It won't break down just on the basis of getting lost and drifting off and all that sort of thing. It won't get lost that way, because we'll take good pains that it doesn't. The only place it can get lost is an unwillingness to learn about it, and the only place that can get lost is just not know-ing it at all, and not knowing particularly that the reason why one can't learn is one thinks there is nothing there that he doesn't know, and he feels he knows it all, so he doesn't learn it. And that's a very silly fundamental, it's almost an idiotic fundamental. It's like \"The way to cross the river is cross the river,\" you know? I mean, it's one of those stupid data; but stupid data are the ones that have a habit of getting lost, and in the final analysis it's brightest to re-member. You will always have difficulty if you do not get down to the true fundamental and the true fundamental is always stupid and is always nonsensical and is not really worth knowing, which is why it remains un-as-ised till the end of time. So it itself stays in for the same rea-son: nobody bothers to know it. Trying to teach â€“ trying to teach some savage how to tie his shoes will always be very upset, and be a very upsetting procedure, if he doesn't have any reason to wear shoes and doesn't know what they are, and so forth. So you go in it upstairs trying to teach him how to tie his shoes; you haven't taught him that if he wants to look civilized he should wear shoes. You see, you can always fail utterly in teaching somebody something by not cutting in at the lowest level of entrance and reality on the subject. There is always a first lesson to teach. And where you fail in instruction is you haven't isolated the first lesson to teach. There are numerous examples. I could give you tons of data on that subject, all by itself. Very inter-esting. But on the subject of learning itself, the first datum to teach is this little â€“ and the first barrier to crack is this datum about \"Why are you studying it if you know all about it to begin with?\" This is your first datum, there is your fundamental, there's bedrock on the subject of learning a subject. And if you just remember that, you won't have any trouble trying to teach somebody. You realize he's having an awful time, it's taking him an awful long time to learn this; well, then, you'd better get right in at rock bottom on the subject of education, and the first thing you're going to find out is he knows all about it; and the next thing you've got to make him find out is, if he knows all about it, why is he studying it? And then somehow or another you've got to crack that door open. If you get that door cracked open, then he can learn anything from there on like a shot. Okay? I hope that will be of some help to you. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 81 MCSC STUDYING: DATA ASSIMILATION A lecture given on 9 July 1964 How are you today? Audience: Fine. What's the date? Audience: Nine July. Nine July. Nine July AD 14. All right. Now, what are you weakest in? Female voice: Auditing. Auditing. Yeah. Frankly, I haven't anything to talk to you about because you're all do-ing so well. It's I who am lagging, you see? But I've given you quite a few lectures about study and how to get through it and how to do this and how to do that and there's very little that can be added to what I have told you, but I better add that very little. In trying to â€“ in trying to assimilate a piece of information, these are the points to watch and these are the points that trip you. Nomenclature. Nomenclature: what does a word mean? And that's what trips you basically, because then you cannot read a sentence with that word in it and know what the sentence says. So no-menclature is a major stumbling block in any study. Now, there are no vast, well worked-up glossaries in Scientology, but there is a glos-sary on Class VI material, and part of nomenclature is the recognition of what the definition is. It's one thing just to have the definition and it's another thing to have an idea of what the definition means. Now, you get yourself a thing like a GPM. All right, let's take that as nomenclature. \"GPM\" means Goals Problem Mass. Unless you combine such a thing with an observation and work on the clay table, and so forth, even the nomenclature is relatively meaningless. It is a thing, in other words. There is something called a GPM. It's not an idea. It is a GPM. Now, there are â€“ there's one or two pcs around (not necessarily in the course) who are stumbling all over the place on a GPM, because they are in disagreement with that piece of nomenclature. And they are saying, \"Well, it doesn't have mass, it's just Ron's idea that it has mass, see, and it doesn't have mass. So therefore, of course, there is no such thing as a GPM.\""},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 2 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 82 MCSC Well now, trying to audit somebody on something of which there is no such thing as, is just a little bit difficult. Now, if you're running GPMs correctly, the mass simply expresses itself as heat and pressure. It does not express itself as a visio. You never see it unless you've made a mistake. When you've made a mistake you'll see it. You get an end word in the wrong situation and you can see this long parade of mass going out there. Well, there must be some-thing wrong with it to see the mass. So here is the oddity about this â€“ the GPM. It's true it's a goal's matched items, one against the other, and very matched and held in midair, from which it gets problem, although that isn't too good a word because \"problem\" is an end word also and \"mass\" is also an end word. So, that nomenclature is adapted to the subject at a time when not all is known about it, so it can be described and worked with, don't you see? Now, we move on a little bit further and we find out there probably could have been better nomenclature, but by this time everybody knows this as a \"this\" and you would get a total catastrophe if you went and shifted the thing, and we can't go on referring to it as \"the thing.\" [laughter] So we go on calling it a GPM. Well now, of course, GPM means \"Goals Problem Mass,\" but that's not important. It's not important what the \"G\" means or the \"P\" means or the \"M\" means. This is a symbol that stands for something. Well, what is this thing So, if you're simply content to say, \"Well, a GPM is a thing and it has this form and construc-tion,\" and work with it on a clay table, all of a sudden you begin to understand what it is. Now, you're in a never-never land that has never been explored. There is no language to adequately represent any of these parts of the mind. If you used any terminology that is used by the psychiatrist, you don't know what you're getting into. You, frankly, have no clue what you're getting into because he's way out, man. And when he uses a word to describe something, there may be innuendoes in relationship to that word that would, if we then used it, would impart a totally incorrect zone or area and would make somebody think he knew what you were talking about, when you hadn't a â€“ he hadn't a clue what you were talking about. So, you've crossed up your terminology with some other field that meant something else. Well, the reason you can't cross it up: it has a different purpose â€“ that other field â€“ it has a different target and it has an entirely different basis of operation. Their â€“ well, their pur-pose is to make people quiet, to give you how wildly different this is. You want to get upset when you see a very quiet pc, man. His idea of treatment is based on the common denomina-tor, as far as he's concerned, that men are animals that rose spontaneously from a sea of am-monia and he wots not of and all thinking is done by the brain, and so forth. So, this is a different â€“ completely different â€“ zone or area. And it has not produced results, so we needn't pay any attention to it. We don't care how loudly somebody beats the drum and says, \"This is authority.\" Those people are the authorities who can get the results and those are the authorities. A painter is somebody who can paint a picture. An \"authority on painting\" has been Hobson-Jobsoned over into somebody who can criticize a picture. Well, anybody can criticize a picture, so I guess any child, then, is an authority on painting. So that the thing doesn't hold up when you take it from a critical viewpoint, you see?"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 3 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 83 MCSC No, an authority is the fellow who can do it. And the world in apathy and failure, driv-ing out in various lines and directions where they have been unable to do anything, have elected authorities on subjects that can't do them. So, therefore you would become all crossed up with fields that have failed. And that would enter, all by itself, an ingredient of failure into Scientology. So, we have to leave their technology alone. We have to leave their nomenclature strictly alone. We cannot talk about \"ids\" and \"egos.\" We can't really talk about the uncon-scious â€“ which, by the way, is another end word in GPMs. [laughter] We can't discuss, in other words, what we are doing in terms of what they were doing, because they didn't do anything. And we would immediately come a cropper and we would be in very bad shape indeed. So we have to have technology named in a certain way as to convey a meaning. And we are the people who can get results in the field of the mind, so therefore we are the authorities. So therefore, we don't have to pay any attention to anybody else who sets himself up an authority, because any raving madman could go down here at the crossroads and say, \"I know all about grapes,\" see? \"I am the world's greatest authority on grapes.\" And any raving madman could do this, you see? He could just go on screaming, \"I am the world's greatest authority on grapes!\" Well, he could get a few other madmen who would come around and say, \"You're the world's greatest authority on grapes.\" Nobody ever would think of asking this madman, perhaps, the question, \"Have you ever eaten a grape, seen a grape, raised a grape, or done anything with a grape?\" and of course, if the answers were all \"No\" to those questions, then of course, it would be quite obvi-ous that he was a raving madman. And that's the psychiatrist, you see? He has never seen a mind, he never created one, he never changed one and he never brought about any results in this particular field. And the only thing he can brag about is being a bit destructive on the subject. And he's screaming that he's an authority, so therefore, somehow or another, you should borrow his nomenclature. Now, any one of you, sooner or later, is going to run into this down at some cross-roads, \"Why don't you use standard terminology?\" Well, the answer to it is, \"Whose standard terminology?\" It would have to be the ter-minology of a person who could produce a result, before it could be said to be even terminol-ogy. So man has had not much understanding of this particular field and has even gone into an inversion, where he has elected to have the nomenclature of the field standardized by peo-ple who know nothing about it. Now, that's a wildest inversion that anybody could ever dream of. Not only is there no terminology, but there is a great deal of false terminology. That termi-nology is false. And you start to lead down that line, you're going to be in trouble. Some-body's going to say to you sooner or later, \"Why don't you use standard nomenclature, why don't you do this and why don't you do that?\""},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 4 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 84 MCSC Well, my rebuttal on it, of course, is always very savage. When somebody starts in on me like this, I have no idea that they're trying to be helpful. I never make that mistake, so I just cut them up and serve them for dinner. And it's something on this particular â€“ particular line, I would answer, \"Well, why haven't you developed anything that could be used?\" So Doctor Spinbin is standing there, \"Well, why don't you use standard terminology so that somebody can understand you?\" \"Why the hell haven't you invented any?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, why don't you know something about the mind? What do you stand around be-ing such a fake for?\" \"Well, really! I have a degree!\" \"I know that. That degree doesn't mean anything. Take one of these patients out of one of these rooms that you've got down here. Bring him out here and heal him. I want to see it!\" \"Well, you can't do anything like that.\" \"Therefore you're a fake. To hell with you!\" This is my idea of a polite conversation with one of those guys. [laughter] I hate fakes. And it's interesting that the only mud they can throw at us is that we're somehow fakes. See, \"The overt doth speak loudly in accusation.\" Shakespeare rewritten. [laughter] Now, therefore you can't help but have trouble with terminology â€“ nomenclature. I've had trouble with it, don't think I haven't. How do I dream up some word that will describe something, that can be found, can be examined and does exist, that will not conflict with some other school of nomenclature, which has failed? How do I move into that perimeter? Oh, we could probably do a much better job, but part of the trouble is you. You accept certain lines and start using them in your common communication and then the last thing in the world that I could do is pull them away from you and say, \"Well, actually a better word is so-and-so, what little Scientology terminology you know, is now dead and nonexistent. We're going to substitute a brand-new terminology,\" and you would be upset. Right? So, terminology has to deal with this factor of evolution in use. We not only have evolved it and they've wobbled a little bit on their meanings occasionally, but then they get into use and they get fixed on the printed page. They get into bulletins and they get into your certificates, and so forth. Certify an HCA, well, he's supposed to know what a reactive mind is. Great. So the next day we're going to call it something else; we've immediately wiped out part of his education, haven't we? And we've made it hard for him to communicate with any-body who is trained later. If we want dissonance, why, we're going to get it in a very large cacophony if we go knocking apart the terminology we have developed. So we have to safe-guard the terminology we've developed. So therefore, when we learn more about the subject, you see, the word may become unreal, but we're still using it."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 5 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 85 MCSC So, the only thing we can do is actually elect those things which are the most impor-tant in the mind and keep that terminology as standard as possible. First try to evolve it as cleverly as possible, so that it won't conflict â€“ first try to evolve it cleverly, so it won't conflict and bring about a misunderstanding in some older activity. And then we've got to carry it forward as a standardized item and then not go changing it all over the place just about the time everybody learns what it is. So, there's a certain necessity here to maintain a constant on nomenclature and terminology. And the word \"GPM\" will never, never be changed. It's in too much, too long, too often, don't you see? And even though \"Goals\" â€“ end word; \"Problem\" â€“ end word; \"Mass\" â€“ end word. But it becomes just \"GPM.\" Well, it could become \"XYZ\" â€“ it wouldn't matter much. Now, another responsibility is not develop too many of them, not to â€“ not to go whole hog on the subject, not to try to name everything in sight some new peculiar name that no-body would ever get around the end of. The vocabulary of Scientology is probably about 472 major words, which is a small enough technical vocabulary. The medical vocabulary is some-thing on the order of 20 to 40 thousand, somewhere in that range â€“ of very peculiar words that don't mean a thing. So, your task in learning \"Scientologese\" is relatively short, relatively brief compared to other technical fields. Now, you could complain about any technical field on the subject of its nomenclature and its nomenclature is just, very often, five times as silly, if you look at it that way, as Scien-tology is inapplicable. Some of these specialized fields are really marvelous. But if you have a bent for it, if you have a knack for it and are amused by these nomenclatures and terminol-ogies and special languages, you might say, you can have a lot of fun with some of these. I know I recently have been hobnobbing in the world of the circus. Well, fortunately I know a little of the circus terminology, but from an American circus viewpoint. And I don't know that this holds good in the English circus, you see? Well, you daren't use â€“ I'll show you now the upper class of terminologies. They're all \"snob\": These languages are all snob languages, including Scientology, see? The boy that comes out of his HCA class, you see, and he throws off a couple of words; there's two or three who understand what he's talking about, and so forth, and they chin-chin together, see? They â€“ it's like the lodge has just passed the password, see? Other people stand around with their jaws dropped and say they are listening to the upper elite. Well, to that de-gree they are, you see? Somebody has a superior understanding. But this is a signal system and actually, I couldn't take that away from the subject if I had to. If I didn't invent it, you would. Give you â€“ in the circus world if you use carnival â€“ the carnival, you see, is pretty downscale. To the circus, a carnival is almost beneath contempt. These things are quite defi-nitely fixed on the social strata. So you daren't use carnival terminology, of which I know of about four or five hundred words in carnivalese. You daren't use that in referring to the same identical objects and actions in the circus world and the circus world has maybe seven-eight hundred, a thousand words, you see, for these same things. It's â€“ you've seen the same thing, there, you run into it in Low Dutch and High Dutch, in languages and so on."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 6 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 86 MCSC So you have to be very careful about some of these. But quite the reverse, you can tell a real organist â€“ this is in the world of music. You can tell a great concert pianist by the awe with which he speaks the word \"Steinway\" and with which he speaks of his instrument and with which he speaks of his scores and so on. You can tell him. He acts the part of a snob in his longtailed coat and his flowing gestures and his poseurs with his hands over the keyboard and all that sort of thing. You know this boy for what he is, you see? He is a classical pianist, a classical concert pianist. Now, his terminology is quite staggering. If he and a symphony orchestra conductor were to start a conversation in your immediate vicinity you would be snowballed. You'd never know that many musical terms taken into or out of Italian and other â€“ and German and that sort of thing, could exist. And it would, frankly, be over the head of most of the very men in the symphony orchestra. They would say, \"God, listen to that,\" you know? But the field of the organ does a complete reverse. Now an organ is an instrument which a piano is not. An organ is a percussion instrument, only to the degree that you turn on a percussion key and beyond that, you can get music out of it. But a piano, of course, is solely and only a percussion instrument. This is according to modern classification, see? They clas-sify it as a percussion instrument. Well, it's a pretty trick percussion instrument and you have to be very virtuosity on it, but an organ will also â€“ you can throw a key on an organ and make it sound like a piano. You can also make it sound like a clavichord. You can make it sound like almost anything. And I've been hobnobbing recently with pro organists. Real pros, you know? Theater organists, circus organists, guys like this, you know? And I actually â€“ my hair's been standing on end. These boys rank in their field just as high as the concert pianist ranks in his field â€“ in fact a bit higher. Because you've got to grow â€“ you've got to be like Vishnu, before you can play an organ, you know? Eight arms. And their terminology would absolutely bowl you over. There's two fields of terminology and when you get to be a real pro in the field of the organ, where you're an organ designer as well as performer, you know, real upscale, you actu-ally shift gears on terminology and the organ terminology with which you're familiar is the organ terminology which is referred to by the musician, the normal musician. But when you go up scale, you go into a new field of terminology. So there's two fields of terminology in the field of the organ. And the real pro and the real snob in that particular field does a volte-vis â€“ complete volte-vis when he leaves the field of mere music into the field of playing an organ and design-ing them. Second we get into that field, we're in another pasture. It doesn't even look or smell the same thing. And that is so rarefied that when I first heard those boys talking, and so forth, I wotnotted anything they were saying, you know? It was just like listening to the Hottentots jabbering about the next feast of roebuck â€“ I didn't have a clue. Well, I finally got hep to it, and did a bit of organ work and designing and that sort of thing and hobnobbing with these birds and I still don't have but a small edge on their termi-nology and they're always startling me. But I've gotten to a point now where I know what they're talking about, you know?"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 7 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 87 MCSC Well, for instance, the organist at Saint Paul's Cathedral who probably would be â€“ probably the top-top-top amongst mere organists, you see, in England, refers to the \"pedal-board,\" see, those are that board that you walk on, you know? Well, he calls that a \"pedal-board.\" When you get into the real snobs that is no longer a pedal-board â€“ that's \"firewood.\" [laughter] Now, the top organist at Saint Paul's undoubtedly refers to \"notes\" and \"pipes\" and \"footages\" and the real snob calls them \"noises.\" They're \"noises,\" and he says this with a complete â€“ complete straight face. So, the first time I heard this I thought they were gagging, you see? And every time I've heard one of these things I've made the repeated mistake â€“ which I am now beginning to recover from doing â€“ of laughing like mad, you see, [laughter] thus displaying my great ignorance of the whole subject. I've gotten so I can chatter back and forth on it now. What the hell was it that I heard the other evening? I think it was a \"Blackpool snarl.\" \"This organ was capable of a â€“ was capable of a good, solid 'Blackpool snarl.'\" I think I've probably got the word \"snarl\" wrong, but it was â€“ it was capable of making a \"terrible, clash-ing dissonance which would reverberate,\" see, and that was the way it was described, see? You catch up with it after a while. I'm getting there though. I'm getting there, I'm getting there. I'm getting up to a point where I've now developed something that I don't think they've thought of yet with regard to firewood. And I can play a piece on firewood that they haven't thought could be played on firewood, so I'm practicing this very hard and the next time I'm going to get even â€“ I'm going to throw them. [laughs] But the point is, as you enter into the inner sanctum of any profession, you quite nor-mally leave the purely snob language and get into a \"slanguage.\" Lord knows what a medical doctor calls tonsils while he is dining with other medical doctors, see? But he probably calls them something else. His terminology shifts, then, from the very formal with enormous, forced formality that almost has worship mixed up with it, you see, and shifts, then, as his familiarity increases with his subject into something that sounds more like slang. And we have not bothered, then, to go through the country of pomposity to reach the world of slang; we've just short-circuited the whole thing. This is true what I tell you about nomenclature; as nomenclature really gets up amongst the knowing, it is never serious. It is a very unserious subject. The things which great electronic engineers that can whip you out a rocket for the moon â€“ wiring circuit or connection â€“ probably what they call it is not what is taught in college, you see? They've got this stuff and it's a rattledybang, it's almost jive talk-ing moved upstairs into the profession, you know? It's pretty wild. Well, we've taken a straight road. Since none existed, we haven't really developed a secondary language. We're in our secondary language. So that is another way that the thing has been narrowed down. We could develop a highly pompous, formal nomenclature; a vo-cabulary, perhaps, of two or three thousand words, and expect you all to learn it verbatim and be able to discuss it with great solemnity â€“ only to have you eventually evolve a much less lengthy vocabulary which is in the field of slang. We've taken the step at one jump. So, our"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 8 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 88 MCSC language does not sound dignified, see? Our nomenclature is not pompous since there was no reason to enter this other extraneous step into it. Now, anybody then who is talking to you about not using proper psychoanalytic no-menclature probably himself is the veriest tyro in the field of psychoanalysis, see? He â€“ he's just a â€“ well, if he graduated well and kept his nose clean he'd become a neophyte, you know, or he wouldn't be expressing this reverence for nomenclature, because it's symptomatic of the stage where you are simply memorizing without knowing. After a boy gets to know some-thing, and so forth, he normally shortens his nomenclature quite markedly and rapidly. And of course, what an organist has to know who is up in the field of engineering and design, and so forth â€“ this circus organist, Kit Francis, for instance, hasn't any \"stop.\" Well, actually the stops on his organ do not agree, I'm sure, with what it says on the stops and he's pulled out most of the stops â€“ he's thrown them away. When he had the organ rebuilt, he threw them away. What he did was just get the noise combinations from the generators and he put a stop on each variable noise combination of the generators, knowing how they hooked up and he knows that if he throws bing-bing â€“ and why, he's got then these two noises come out of the generator. They will combine and they'll sound in a certain way. He's setting it up by electronic sound; electronic combinations of sound. So he's even done away with all of the izzards and piccolos and diapasons and nothing says anything, you know? There it is. It's just... As a matter of fact, the other day I saw him throw a 64-foot pipe together out of an upper scale. There weren't any even 32-foot pipes in the thing, but he just got a couple of things that would then sound like they built down and he threw those in. And the next thing you know, why, he had Saint Paul's Cathedral going at a very mad rate, but that organ doesn't happen to have any such stops. So, he doesn't even refer to noises by their traditional names anymore, see? In other words, when a guy gets to know his business he generally throws away â€“ when he really knows his business â€“ he throws away the nomenclature he doesn't need. He gives it the yo heave and he quite commonly, amongst his brethren who are in the know and part of a lodge, develops a short-circuited slang-type nomenclature to describe what he is. Well, knowing some of these things, and so forth, I've tried very hard to reduce the nomenclature of Scientology as far as possible and keep it only in the realm of slang where it would have evolved to anyhow. And that would save you a lot of trouble. But if you went back over the years and found the name of everything that had been named, you would probably arrive with a much larger vocabulary than 472. But a lot of those things have been given the yo heave. But a lot of old-time auditors would still know what they were. You talk about a DEDEX â€“ most any Johnny-come-lately would look at you with his eyes \"What's that?\" you know? Well, actually it was a DEDEX, that's what it was. Now, the dependence of knowledge upon nomenclature is extraordinary, and as a mat-ter of fact, almost never appreciated by teachers or students. They are trying to talk and use a language they don't know. And this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehen-sible or that they are incapable of understanding it, when as a matter of fact this is not what is wrong at all. It's just that they haven't grasped the meaning of some of these symbols that are"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 9 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 89 MCSC being used to designate. And they haven't got an instantaneous grasp of these meanings. They've got a \"fumble grasp\" of them. That is, if they thought for a while they might possibly be able to remember what an engram is, see? Now that's the grasp of it. So they read a sentence and it says, \"Of course, there may be an engram in the middle of the GPM.\" That's not necessarily true, but it's certainly true of implant GPM. And they have to think, \"There might be an engram â€“ an engram â€“ an engram... I don't quite â€“ know quite what that means, so I'll just learn this much of it. There might be something in the mid-dle of a GPM.\" And they go on into the next paragraph and this has made an impression on them, that there's something they don't know about a GPM and that's what carries on into the next paragraph. And as they go on studying past these points of uncomprehended nomenclature, they begin to stack up an opinion that they \"Don't know about it.\" And it isn't \"it\" that they don't know about. To get a persistent thing, you see, you'd have to have a lie, and the lie is that it isn't the subject they are having trouble with, it is simply the nomenclature they are having trouble with. They don't know about the nomenclature so they, however, wind up with an opinion that they don't know the subject or that there is something very incomprehensible about this subject. No, it isn't the subject at all, they just don't know their nomenclature. Now, it may start back someplace in HCA, see, or HPA class and one day, why, somebody jumped up and he said, \"Well, that's a lock,\" and the individual... you know, he said, \"Well, you see, that's not important, because it's just a lock, you see?\" And the person says, \"Just a lock â€“ a â€“ lock-lock-lock â€“ what's a lock?\" And then he was interrupted before he could think the thought through and remember what a lock was. So this, in actual fact, stays there as a little basic incomprehension of nomenclature and that'll hang up on the track and he will develop an automatic comm lag around this word \"lock.\" He'll get up to a point where he's reading a sentence here at Saint Hill and it says, \"You want to check this out, because it might be just a lock.\" And again that hunted feeling comes over him, you see, and now he thinks he doesn't know much about checkouts because he will misassign, the other being out of sight. So, his opinion now is that he doesn't know much about checkouts. No, he didn't know a word in a sentence discussing checkouts. You see how important nomenclature is? But a comprehension of the nomenclature which is used is primary to the study of anything. Now, for instance, I'm studying a parallel course to get insights into study of Scientol-ogy. And a very, very smart thing â€“ an extremely smart thing to do â€“ is to take a page of ma-terial and look over it for words you don't know â€“ words that don't instantly react to you. Circle each one of those words or make a list of each one of those words and look up and study their definitions or ask people and get definitions for them. Find out exactly what those words mean. Don't tackle the subject of the page. Just tackle the nomenclature of the page. Get that nomenclature slick as a whistle, tackle the subject, you'll find out the subject was very easy. All the thing was trying to tell you is that if you went ahead and ran a service facsimile which didn't give TA action on exploration, why, the pc would get loused up be-cause you were running without TA action. And this is all this whole thing is devoted to."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 10 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 90 MCSC But one runs across this thing: \"Service facsimile â€“ ohhh! What's that?\" Another word: \"Ohhh! What's that?\" you see, and \"What's that?\" and \"What's that?\" Well, if you want to put yourself in a total mystery, go ahead and study pages you don't know the words on. Then you can put yourself into a gorgeous mystery. Now, this language is so common to your instructors, it's so common to people around here and their \"snob action\" â€“ which we have â€“ don't doubt about that, see, and will continue to have, because it is an index of status and competence, will cause them to explain these things to a student with a bit of a sneer. And they're liable to cure you of asking, \"What is a service facsimile?\" because you will hear in the answer that comes back to you at least the tone for, \"Well, you idiot! Why don't you look it up in your bulletin, you know? Fancy anybody not knowing that!\" see? This is sort of reflected in the atmosphere you get back when you ask these things. And that, again, makes you feel stupid for not knowing. Well, actually nothing can be done to minimize this latter. Why, I could say, \"Always answer a student's questions politely,\" and you'd probably only build up a covert hostility. [laughter] They'd answer the questions politely and flunk all tests for 24 hours, you see. Something wild is liable to go awry when you start to put the brakes on some natural action. So, the only point I'm making here is: Don't let yourself be put off because somebody thinks you're stupid because you don't know it. You're not stupid because you don't know it, you're simply uninformed. Well, if you're uninformed, don't get so status happy of thinking that you must appear bright in order to be thought well of, when it has nothing to do with it. You're here to learn and anybody is studying anything, is studying it, I suppose, to learn it, not to acquire â€“ he may acquire status through having learned it, but he doesn't acquire status by pretending he knows it when he doesn't. As a matter of fact he acquires himself quite a headache. So, the point is, in spite of any rebuff that you get, or of difficulty digging into some book to find out what it means, you actually put yourself in a soup at once, the moment that you leave one word in a sentence behind you, you do not know the meaning of. One unknown piece of nomenclature left behind you can absolutely ruin your comprehension of the whole thing you're studying. Now, if you want to speed up your grasp of the situation, apparently do it the slow way. This obviously is a slow way to do it, isn't it? But it's not the slow way to do it because it snowballs. You'll get faster and faster and faster, whereas if you don't do it this way you will get slower and slower and slower. So, never leave a word behind you in a study that you don't know the meaning of. And when you hear me use a word in a lecture â€“ and I try to minimize nomenclature, actually, in lectures â€“ when you hear me use a word in a lecture that you don't know the meaning of, for God's sakes, write it down in your notes and right after the lecture find out what it is. \"What is that word?\" see? It's something that has passed you by. Well, it's that which you don't understand, not the mind, not Scientology, not the theo-ries and practice of Scientology. The stumbling block, first and foremost, is simply nomencla-ture."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 11 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 91 MCSC Now, nomenclature will be there regardless of any reform undertaken, because, in the first place, we are examining things which are not hitherto known. So they have to have a name. Now somebody uninformed may try to tell you that some of these things were known but that's merely his misinformation talking. He doesn't know what you were talking about so he thinks it was previously known. He will try, for instance, to compare an \"id\" and a \"thetan,\" see? And he says, \"Well, Freud described all that. He said, 'id,' and an id was â€“ something, and...\" Well, probably a person saying this to you really doesn't know what Freud said was an \"id,\" see? His nomenclature failure is prior to his misunderstanding where you are, see? So, if you want to wind yourself up in a ball and become very confused and get a lot of slow passes and go slower and slower and slower and slower, just start leaving words behind you you don't know what they are. You get halfway down the page, all of a sudden there's a word you've never seen before. Just say, \"Well, I'll catch that later,\" and go on. Why don't you just say, \"Well, I'll cut my throat right now and add several weeks onto my course progress?\" Because that's just what that'll do. You cannot help but wind up at the end of that page. Now, the next thing is the subject matter itself, arrangement and understanding of Now, this is your second one. Now, it's all right to name something and get a definition for something, but what is being named? And if you were very, very clever, you would worry it and worry it and snarl at it and walk around the circles of any piece of subject matter; now we're talking about the â€“ a thing, see? We're talking about â€“ we're not talking about the name of the thing, we're talking about the thing. You'd walk around any one of those pieces of sub-ject matter until you had a good comprehension of what that was all about. \"What the devil are we talking about?\" see? I'll give you an idea: You say, \"Well, a person has a bad opinion of another person be-cause they have an overt against that person.\" All right, there is a thing, you see? That is the â€“ a mechanism that surrounds the overt-motivator sequence. That's one of the phenomena. Joe is mad at Bill and if you search a little bit, you'll find out he's mad at Bill because he's done something to Bill. Joe has done something to Bill. Now this is contrary to the explanation everybody makes in life, so it is very easily read this way, see? Because life is that way you can get this thing â€“ scoong! â€“ wrong way to, in your skull, see? So \"'Joe is mad at Bill, because Bill has done something to Joe.' Yes, I understand that.\" Well, you missed the whole point. Thereafter, if you've done that, you will really never then understand how to pull an overt or why you must do so. See, that has just gone up in smoke, see? Very important mechanism! \"Joe is mad at Bill because Joe has done something to Bill.\" All right, that is the thing. Now, several things can get in the road of the acceptance of this thing and first and foremost is, it isn't usual or ordinarily thought of this way and that gets in your road by misin-terpretation. You think you've read something you haven't read, see? Because it's so usual for it to be the other way you think you've read it the other way. Or it is so widely accepted the other way that it is simply unbelievable. So there's the next thing that gets in your road, is the unbelievability of it. You say, \"Well, that couldn't possibly be true.\" Now, for heaven's sakes, make sure when you come to"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 12 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 92 MCSC the unbelievability of something that you know what you're unbelieving. Now, that's impor-tant â€“ that's important. Let's know what we're unbelieving. Now, to know what we're unbelieving we have to take the first step again â€“ the no-menclature, you see? Did I get the word right? Now, the thing, the mechanism â€“ phenomenon here, have I got that right? And you'll find in about ninety percent of the cases that a reexami-nation at this \"unbelieve\" step â€“ you are unbelieving the wrong thing. You weren't unbeliev-ing what was there. You were unbelieving something else, see? So, when you run into a total \"gawp,\" see â€“ you know, you say, \"That couldn't be, you know? Wha-wha? I â€“ that â€“ that couldn't be. I â€“ no, that couldn't be!\" see? And instead of go-ing out and jumping in the lake or something like this or taking cyanide, the thing to do is to check over nomenclature and the description of the thing itself. Now, if you check those two over, you'll find out you probably had something in crosswise and that this \"unbelievable\" was not unbelievable at all but is quite â€“ quite easily seen. That's about ninety percent of the time. The other ten percent of the time you just can't see how that works that way. Go back and check your nomenclature, check what the thing was that you're not believing, and so forth. Get down to this other thing, you still can't see how it's that way â€“ set yourself up some examples of how it's not that way and how it is that way. Now, this is the â€“ really the first place where you really have to apply it to you and life, where it becomes an abs... a complete must. You must apply it to you, you must apply it to life. \"Does this thing exist in life or doesn't it? Has it existed in my life or has it existed in anybody else's life that I know of? Is there any incident here that demonstrates this phenom-ena?\" And you'll start looking at it and you'll find out that the reason it wouldn't go that way is normally a button got in its road or something like that. You know, you didn't dare believe that it was this way; something like that â€“ just an examination of it, trying to, \"How does it apply to me? How does it apply to life? Has it ever applied to life? Did anybody ever see this thing?\", you see, and \"Do I know of any incident or anything of the sort which would exem-plify this thing?\" Why, the other ten percent that I've been talking about here, that will tend to evaporate, too and you'll say, \"Ah, yes, now we got it.\" Now, this procedure followed actually gives you a terribly firm grip on what you know. And careful study is not necessarily either thorough or brilliant or wise or anything else. It's merely careful. And if you work right along at it on the subject of being careful with it and what you're careful about is â€“ as you're going down the page pocketa-pocketa-pocketa, you all of a sudden see this word \"boojum\" see? \"What the hell is that?\" Now, I'll show you how you can be stupid: that's to go on. Read the next word to it in the hopes that somehow or other the explanation will all drop out into your lap. Gloss over that word, you've done yourself in. \"What's this word 'boojum'?\" Boy, you better find out right now. You might glance at the rest of the sentence: \"Does there â€“ a parenthetical descrip-tion what 'boojum' is in it as you sometimes â€“ occur? Or a â€“ there's nothing there. It's evi-dently a word I'm supposed to know. It's not a new word, because it's not explained in this paragraph, so it's a word I know...\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 13 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 93 MCSC Boy, you go any further than that, you've just hung yourself up in a nice little brass mystery and there you'll be: going around with a lamp looking into the dark corners and won-dering what you're being mystified about. And then you'll think you're mystified about the subject, you're mystified about anything â€“ it's tracing back to this time you read this paragraph and you didn't understand a word in it so, of course, then it didn't communicate. By not understanding the word you inhibit any communication. You've inhibited communication between what you're studying and yourself You've also inhibited your com-munication between yourself and other auditors and you also, oddly enough, have inhibited your communication with yourself and a pc, because this is something in a pc that you will not thereafter recognize because you don't know what it is. Now, following down some sort of a â€“ of a routine like this in study, you'll find out that you can study. It's all right for somebody to come around and say, \"Well, you can't study and you just don't apply yourself,\" and that sort of thing and they're â€“ they've done this to people in school â€“ they've done it to me; they used to do it to me in school; they used to say, \"You don't know how to study.\" And I used to say, \"Gee, that's very interesting, you â€“ I don't know how to study,\" and I accepted this â€“ that I didn't know how to study. And I don't know that I made much of a ruckus about it, but I did manage to finally find out that this was not accompanied by any method of study. In other words, you were saying â€“ somebody was saying to you, \"You don't know how to hang up a skyhook, and therefore you're very stupid indeed, because you don't know how to hang up a skyhook.\" And it's sort of like catching snipes, same kind of a gag, see? You're supposed to stand out in the woods for hours holding a sack while they drive them in on you. Actually they're home having some coffee, and you're standing in the damp woods for hours, you see? It's just that crude a gag. They say, \"You don't know how to study.\" Well, what pretentious people! They don't know how to study either, see? There is no â€“ there's no subject called \"study.\" If there was a subject called \"study,\" they'd start teaching it to you in kindergarten. They would certainly start teaching it to you before you were into the â€“ your high schools and that sort of thing. They'd say, \"This is how to study.\" I've run across various systems, but they're not in the formal textbooks. I've seen them in â€“ remember the Pete Smith specialties from way back when that used to show on the screen, and so forth, gag, one-reel comedies and so forth? Well, I've seen methods of remem-bering things, and methods of knowing things, and so forth, come up in that form. But I've never seen it on a textbook basis. I myself developed a method â€“ a (quote) \"a method of study\" in defense and I remem-ber vividly applying this in the field of history; it's just not going onto the next paragraph unless I could shut my eyes and rattle off the last paragraph, see? It didn't increase my knowl-edge of history. I actually get along better just by reading a history textbook. At the end of the line when I finish off the history textbook and somebody asks me for dates, I look in the book. I find that is the best method by which to do this."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 14 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 94 MCSC The only other method of study that I ever developed for myself in school might be of some interest and that was just to get every book on the subject I could get hold of and read all of them and not try to concentrate on any of them, you see? I think one of the most stellar grades I ever got and bragged about all over the place, and so forth, and called upon to give lectures on every hand, made me feel a little guilty. I was taking American history and I simply got hold of every textbook I could find on the sub-ject of American history and read them all, including Woodrow Wilson's five-volume history of the United States, you see? That's one of those things that you put on a bookshelf to hold it down in case of an earthquake. [laughter] And I read all these textbooks, but I don't think I ever told the professor that because I was allergic to its very, very bad prose, that I had never read that class's textbook. I'd never read the class's textbook. I'd read all the other textbooks I could lay my hands on, but I could-n't stand its prose. Its prose was horrible, and I â€“ it was sort of socialistically weirdly put to-gether and it was pedantic in the extreme. It wasn't that it was full of difficult words. As a matter of fact the fellow was sort of underplaying â€“ the places where he should have used a good, big, pompous word, you know, why, he'd put some offbeat word, and so forth. He didn't know how to write, see, and so I did-n't read the school's textbook, but I read all the other textbooks and I got â€“ oh, I don't know â€“ A pluses and gave lectures on history for them and got gold stars and silver cups and all this sort of thing as being a terrific student. Well, actually it was just to the degree that I just cov-ered everything in sight. And I find out that's fairly reliable as a method â€“ fairly reliable when there isn't any training available, you know, like an American school. When there's absolutely no training available, why, what you want to do is just get ahold of every book on the subject in sight and then just read them all from cover to cover, see, making very sure â€“ I would now and do and always did â€“ that you didn't cross over words you didn't know. Get yourself a great big dictionary and get yourself some kind of an anthol-ogy or something that went along with it and look up a word you didn't know and find out what that was related to and then get that word real good and then go sailing on your way. It wouldn't matter if you read a book in five hours, you see. It wouldn't matter how fast you read the book or didn't read the book. That's in absence of formal knowable training on any subject. That's a very good method â€“ excellent method as a matter of fact because you wind up at the end of the thing â€“ you've seen this word so often, you've looked it up so often, you eventually know what it is, you know? You say, \"There again is the 'Rembrandt Profile.' Now, what the hell does it mean, a 'Rembrandt Profile'? Well, a 'Rembrandt Profile' is actually â€“ well, I guess it must have been something painted by Rembrandt, but they must mean something here. I'll turn back over here â€“ I saw a mention of it over here. Here's a description of the thing: Yeah, well, so on and so on and so on and so... Ohh, oh I get it! It's the main light is not showing on the front of the face. Oh, good. Yeah, it's just the fill shows on the thing. Ahh, that's good, yeah. I got that now. All right.\" Sail along the line, and so forth, and finally, why, forgot all about that, you see, but chapters later we run into a \"Rembrandt Profile,\" see? \"A what? Oh, something about a fill."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 15 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 95 MCSC Yes. Well, I know where I can find it. I'll go back â€“ ah, yes, yes. Main light back of the per-son, fill in the front of the person. Yeah. Main â€“ face mainly in shadow. Yeah, I got it. Noth-ing to it.\" All right, running down the line chapters later, in another textbook on the subject. \"'When shooting a Rembrandt Profile so on, so on, so on, so on...'Oh, that's how you do! You add a spotlight to it also. Okay.\" You see, the word no longer operated as an impasse to your study. Looking up words and meanings and so forth, is sort of the erosive course of the river and it eventually grinds away on the banks until it has a good, strong flowing stream, you see? Actually, I don't think there are bright students and dull students. I don't think this at all. I don't think so, because I've never seen any real coordination between knowledge of the subject and the brightness and dullness of a student. But there is a careful student and a care-less student. Now, a student can be very fast and still be very careful. It hasn't even too much to do with speed. But he knows when he's whipped. That's about the only thing he knows. He's reading down this paragraph and all of a sudden he wakes up to the fact he hasn't the foggiest clue what the devil he's talking about â€“ what he's reading about so he goes back and finds out where he got tangled up. Ah, well, here was a word and here was a phenomenon he didn't know anything about. Now, if he's a careful student he puts it all away until he finds out what that word and what that phenomena is and exactly what that is and he gets that straight. He may cruise around in the thing just a little bit further to find out if it's defined in that particular publica-tion, see? But he's looking for the definition â€“ he's not any longer doing it. Now, there's a careful student. And his brightness on the subject is dependent upon the degree he does this. It isn't dependent on any native talent or anything else. It isn't even de-pendent on his buttons. And in Scientology, because of the tremendous amount of breadth of study we are do-ing and because we are studying what we study with, why then, it's necessary to have some command of the subject of study. It becomes absolutely imperative in our field to know some-thing about how to study and it's no longer walking up to some poor luckless student and say-ing, \"Well, the trouble with you is, you don't know how to study,\" then walking off, you see? Or saying about some other student, \"Well, he's just stupid. That's all, you see? That explains it all, see?\" Frankly, it doesn't explain a doggone thing. We've talked â€“ we hear about the lightning-quick student. We hear about the very, very fast, fast, fast student and we hear about the very, very, very, very slow student. And we hear about the grind and we hear about the brilliant student and honest, those classifications have no more validity than the field of psychiatry. Why? Because they have never produced uniform fast study. They're apparently merely excuses and justifications of something. They're an effort to classify on something nobody's cracked. So, why should we talk about dull students and slow students and brilliant students, and so forth? There are certain phenomena in study which are worth commenting upon and one of those is the oddball who can memorize almost at a glance and who can go back and spit out"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 16 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 96 MCSC the memorized words. I've known Chinese students that got anybody whipped I ever â€“ in the Anglo-Saxon world or in the Western world â€“ anything whipped on this line. I know Chinese students who could go ahead and give you pages of mathematical formulas and things of this character and descriptions of it, and so forth. About the wildest thing you ever listened to and they'd come to school the next morning with their lessons and ka-wow! You ask them, \"All right, now let's go into the slope formula.\" \"Well, the slope formula is so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so kow-kow, pow-pow, kow-wow.\" It's all there, see? You say, \"Wow!\" Don't say instantly, \"Well, then this is the very man we need to build the dam,\" because building dams has very little to do with study of that particular kind or character. We don't even know if he could solve the problems on the page, but he sure could remember them. Now, that's a test mainly of memory. Now, if you want to be sure of this person, in examining this person you'll find imme-diately what's going wrong here. Immediately you'll find what's going wrong. There's a way of examining this person that would only be fair to the instructor and to the student alike. Take any oddball word that occurred in the first paragraph you have just got back so glibbishly and ask for a definition of that word (the definition is not given on the subject mat-ter which the person is doing). And if you want to see a hunted, horrified look come into any-body's face â€“ it's the perfect memory repeat, see? And you've thrown an ax into it because you've asked for something which isn't memory. You've asked for the definition of a certain word. And if this person â€“ now look at this â€“ if this person could give you this whole paragraph and tell you all about it but couldn't define a word in it, that person must be in total mystery about that. So the missing ingredient is understanding. And then naturally the missing ingredient, application, will show up soon afterwards. Do you see how that would work? In other words, this very, very fast study falls down exactly as the slow study would fall down. In other words, everybody caves in on this same point uniformly. Now, if some-body comes up and he takes this same thing and he stumbles all over the place and he tries to get it out and he spits it out, and so forth, the examiner could ask him, too, the same word. \"What's the definition of that word?\" And he'd say, \"...Well, I don't know.\" Puts him in the same boat as the fast study, doesn't it? So, the direction and end purpose of study is understanding and, of course, you â€“ with an unknown word in the middle of it, and an unknown phenomenon in the middle of it â€“ you're not going to get understanding at all. You're going to get disbelief, noncomprehension. You're going to get mystery. You're going to get, of course, also nonapplication. Now, if we examine study a little bit further, the main complaint about study is that it does not immediately and at once result in good, clean, clear application. This is one of the primary scolds about modern education â€“ primary criticisms â€“ is if you educate an engineer â€“ or it was â€“ you educate an engineer and you don't dare send him out to build a bridge, see?"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 17 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 97 MCSC Well, that's in the field of application or practice of application. But if this man can't go out and build a bridge after he's been taught to build a bridge, the familiarity ingredient, of course, is missing. But even so, if somebody had borne down on him like mad for the definition of every word that he was stumbling across in the direction of bridge building, he should be able to go out and unroll his sextant and transit and get to work. He should; he should. He's now got the horrible task of acquiring his familiarity, but he wouldn't be doing it across the barrier of a misunderstanding of his terminology and a misunderstanding of his tools and he theoretically could do it. I found myself doing it the other day. I just had a textbook command of a certain prob-lem on this line â€“ parallel line â€“ I'm studying. I just had a textbook command of the thing; nothing but and I saw it, saw it happened and applied the textbook and it resolved, bang! And I had about something on the order of maybe two or three seconds to do the whole thing. Be-cause something was happening and I had to straighten it out fast, see? Just textbook. It worked â€“ it worked perfectly. So therefore, you could and should be able to take a purely textbook thing â€“ if it was a valid textbook and a valid subject â€“ and apply it directly without familiarity. Now, think of what a whiz you would be, however, if you also had the familiarity at the same time. And that's why we study auditing while auditing, see? But if this other ingredient of careful study is missing, the nomenclature is missing, you can't make the boat. It just won't make the boat. I studied â€“ been studying this parallel subject very hard because it is a bearcat on the subject of terminology, too. It's terminology that you'd think anybody that had been around photography very long would be very familiar with. He couldn't help but be familiar with it â€“ oh, no, no, no, no. Not when you're studying text after text after text after text after text! Well, if you were taking some little course that didn't have much to do with the price of fish, that didn't intend to make a pro out of you along any line and \"This is, see, this is how you develop pictures\" â€“ the Eastman book for the home beginner, you know? I've read those by the ton. No, that hasn't got anything to do with it. It says, \"Hammer, pound, hit 'em with the grape, you know â€“ no holds barred. Now we charge with the bayonets. You take the me-tabisulphite and pour it into the yattapin,\" and you say, \"You take the what?\" you know. And then you're busy in the very next lesson studying a completely disrelated field of the same subject, \"Make sure that you adjust the headscreen.\" \"The what? Where the hell did this come from? I've never met it before around here anyplace. A headscreen, a headscreen. Now, what is a headscreen?\" Scatter, scatter, flutter, flutter, look in the dictionary, and so forth. \"What do you know? It isn't in the dictionary. It's so common they don't have to define it. But I don't know it. No worry now about how stupid this makes me, you see? Flutter, flutter, bing-bang. Finally figure it out by context and by illustration. There was a picture of all of the photographic material needed. A headscreen? Obviously a headscreen was what you hold back a corner of the main light force so as to get a"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 18 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 98 MCSC prominent ear to be less prominent. Obvious, isn't it? Headscreen! Who would have dreamed it, man?\" A nonsensical but very usual piece of equipment. The guy writing the textbook, being so familiar with his subject, would make the same statement that you would make, you see? You say, \"Well, you set your E-Meter down on the table first, of course.\" You have said it almost sarcastically, you see? \"Well, you set your E-Meter down on the table, of course, before you start auditing.\" If you want to be really sarcas-tic, you'd make such a remark, you see? This guy, this bloke, this expert on portraits to end all experts on portraits says, \"Well, of course, you adjust the headscreen to hold back that. That's the way you subdue the light.\" He just says this parenthetically, you see? \"This is how you make less prominent, undesirable features on a subject in portraiture. You hold back the light on them.\" \"What do you hold back the light with?\" Get the same answer out of the textbook. \"Oh, don't be an ass.\" \"Yeah, but what do you hold back the light with, you know?\" \"You hold it back with a headscreen, of course, you idiot!\" \"What's a headscreen? What is a headscreen? What is this thing? \"Put it over the piece... Put it over the lens of the camera so it doesn't show the fellow's head?\" So, this has been â€“ it's been very amusing, because I can look at a subject, you see, from an oblique â€“ look at the same study problems that you run into. And I've been analyzing these problems and putting them together. What I've been talking to you about and what I've talked to you about in recent things has been the views I've had on this as worked out and as I know they apply in our own field. And I think you've been making some progress as a result. But there are just these points about study and you expected there would be probably a lot more complex points about study, but there are no more complex points about study than I have just given you. Now, of course, if you didn't read or write English there would be a further study on nomenclature. But remember it would just be a further study on nomenclature. So, it even falls into that particular field. Now, the person who can't talk at all, or let us say, an animal trying to arrive at this particular line â€“ he's totally out of communication, he hasn't got the vocal chords, he can't be educated in the first place. You say, \"Well, that's a totally lost field.\" Well, I'm â€“ I'm not completely willing to lose that field utterly because I've already raised animals in tone to a remarkable degree and I've already met dogs that could talk, see? Yeah, I met a dog one time â€“ he used to say \"Hungry\" every time he wanted chow. He managed it somehow. He used some Hollywood scheme of how you breathe from the dia-phragm, you know? But he could say it clear as could be â€“ that he was hungry. Startled peo-ple almost to death because they'd say, \"Well, that's funny. The dog probably makes a grunt, you know? And this mistress that's taught him and so forth is just being too too for words.\" And then they'd hear this dog and this dog would say \"Hungry\" and they'd go \"Ahhhh!\" And I was talking to an elephant the other day that wanted his picture taken, as I told you and I've"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"STUDYING â€“ DATA ASSIMILATION 19 SHSBC-391 â€“ 9.7.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 99 MCSC run into animals that know their cues much better than their trainers and have to pull the trainer through the act somehow and make him look good. [laughter] So I don't know what the barriers to communication are. I have a greater insight into the fifth dynamic lately than I have had before and I have found that they're â€“ you can go a lot deeper into the fifth dynamic. In fact, I've pretty well got an idea of what GPMs, and so forth, certain animals and insects and so forth get stuck in. And just about how they go into that particular zone or area and how they go out the bottom. I've had a little â€“ quite a little bit more insight into this. But anyway, that being as it may, the point is that the communication of the nomencla-ture of the language â€“ of the ability to talk or communicate â€“ would be the first barrier, don't you see? And so it remains into â€“ the fellow who does know English, who can read, who sits there and so forth â€“ it's still his first barrier. But, of course, he is so high on this level of com-munication he is contemptuous of these little inabilities to communicate and so neglects them. And neglecting them, then of course, he comes an awful cropper when he gets into the field of study. And that is about the first place where he really falls down. There are many ways you could make a person fail in studying, but mostly it would be in denying them an insight into the necessity of understanding the communication symbols used. That would be a big failure in delivering the field of study. We never published a dictionary as such. There are several manuscripts of dictionaries around but they unfortunately all depend on my re-editing from beginning to end and they just go fantastic quantities of words and it is just those extra twelve hours on top of the forty-eight in the twenty-four â€“ to get such a job completed. It's a very rough rough beef. And I particu-larly would not want to attempt the job until I felt it was pretty wrapped up, so it's just about now it would be wrapped up. But I did have definitions of the various words at Level VI, and so forth, codified which I'm sure has been issued and â€“ so that you could look those things up and know what the score was on that. But despite the lack of a glossy dictionary, you nevertheless can look up these words and they are known and people all over the place know what they are here, and there really isn't much excuse going to one. So it takes you a half an hour to learn what this word is. Boy, that's a half an hour that won't get multiplied and added on to the end of your course, when you're busy floundering around wondering why you just can't seem to get to first base on that particular quarter. Well, I hope what I've told you today will be of some use to you.

Very memorable day. Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, August the 4th, AD 14. All right. You seem to have hit a few records here lately, in your examination grades. Your examination grades on lectures and so forth, are coming up, up, up, up and I'm very proud of you with this. Thank you very much. Aside from your own brightness on the subject, some of this is attributable to the fact that I've been talking about and teaching you something about study, and I think you have learned quite a bit about study in the last many weeks; and that is the subject of this lecture. I want to give you, in this lecture before it gets cold, a brief summary â€“ no matter how rough and ragged and no matter how well worked out later â€“ of the things I have learned about study. And I break my record by lecturing from a note. But I don't want this to go too far before I make it a matter of lecture and record because I found out it was already getting dim in me skull. And I keep very little information in my skull lately, and that I do put in sometimes tends to get dim because it gets lost. So I didn't want that to happen and I want to give you this information about study. Now, there's not been a technology of study or a technology of education. Now, that sounds like a very far-fetched, fantastic statement, but it's true â€“ it's true. There was a school technology, and â€“ sort of â€“ but it didn't have too much to do with education. You see, there was the technology of how you go to school and how you get taught in school and how you teach children to go to school and how you go through grades and how you get examined and how you go through the college and so forth. There was an awful lot of this school technol-ogy. And you should differentiate between a school technology and an educational technol-ogy â€“ it's the first thing I'd ask you to do â€“ because education very seldom, in its final touches, has anything to do with a school.

This actually happened â€“ happened in Cavite before the war, many years before the war. This young engineer had just gotten out of school and he did just that. He went down and he calculated the amount of gravel in the barge by calculus. And it was very arduous. And he'd been sent down by the chief engineer of the yard to find out if they had enough gravel. And he didn't come back for most of the afternoon. So finally, the chief engi-neer got very, very curious about this and he went down there to find out where this young new engineer was and what he was doing and whether or not the sharks had gotten him or something. And he found him down there just putting the finishing touches on it, and he gave him â€“ the young engineer gave the chief engineer â€“ with great triumph, the fact that he had 150.7-9 cubic yards of gravel on hand. He had pages of calculations. And the yard foreman, a Filipino, standing near at hand, looked very sourly at the young engineer and he said, \"Is that what you were doing? \"And before the chief engineer could even get in there and find out what it was all about he said, \"You see those white paint marks on the front and the back of the barge? Well, they tell you how much gravel is in the barge!\" I've had a wonderful example of how pedantic schooling can be as opposed to educa-tion. I read a dissertation last night on the subject of slides. The preparation of lantern slides. And boy, this was the most intricate calculations of how close you had to be to a screen and how â€“ the density of the lantern slide had to be in order for you to get a proper lecture hall projection. And these went on and on, and if I hadn't myself had experience in this particular line, I would have taken all this quite seriously. But it was somebody â€“ I guess his pen just got to going and he couldn't stop it. Because what you do if you have dim lantern slides is get a brighter lamp. You don't move a projector backward and forward in the hall and calculate the superreflectiveness of the screen and all that sort of thing. Now, with great experience then â€“ and it is considerable experience, you see, I know slides and densities and that sort of thing, by experience â€“ I knew that this data I was being fed so laboriously had very, very little importance. See, it was interesting. You know, it was interesting that anybody would write that much on the subject. But Reg and I and Bonwick at a circus not too long ago, with a mismatched voltage line and common bed sheeting hung up between two circus poles, enlarged a picture four to five diameters above anything ever intended for either the picture or the projector. Everybody was delighted; they looked beautiful. We had a twelve-by-twelve screen of bed sheeting which even had puckers in it. There was only one slide that it made look odd â€“ one slide out of about two hundred â€“ and it just happened to fall, this pucker did, in a young man's face and it just fell wrong. Not a critical proposition at all. You take any old density of slide and show it in â€“ throw it into a projector, then, with enough lamp â€“ and you put up a sheet that will reflect and you've got yourself just about the finest lantern slide show you ever wanted to see and there isn't anybody going to say a word about it. Two pages of text out of how you calculate the density of a lantern slide â€“ not a criti-cal problem. So, education would take into effect, as opposed to schooling, the relative importance of the data being taught. That's very, very important. The relative importance of the data be-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 3 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 103 MCSC ing taught, by which, one would say, the relative applicability of the data being taught â€“ the applicability. Now, schooling, as opposed to education, has in actual fact no thought, no real thought of applicability, no such thought. It is just as important to the pedantic or scholastic school of education, this technol-ogy, that \"Pliny, in the year umpty-ump-dash-ump, did hereinto aforesaid with semicolons, discover that there were sturgeons.\" Now, what you going to do with that datum? Yet a man's whole career could have been wiped out, you see, by an inability to have vociferated this fact. This is under \"fishing,\" heading of \"ichthyology,\" see; fishing, fishes. Guy goes down to the bureau of fisheries, see? On his final examination paper he was asked, \"Who and what and when discovered sturgeons?\" You can just see him now â€“ young fellow in the bureau of fish-eries out there off the north coast of Norway, blowing about forty degrees below zero trying to count the number of herring boats out there he's going to have to rescue in the next twenty-four hours, using this datum about Pliny. You can just see this now. Inapplicable! So, there's a sort of a pomposity that goes along in the field of schooling that has no real basis in education. You'll find this in the arts. You will find people who really think they are artistic and really know something about art, who are simply capable of rattling off a number of pictures. \"There's this picture and that picture, and there's the other picture and so forth and it was painted â€“ it was painted by Jules Drool, you know, and in 1710.\" See? You say, \"What did Jules Drool paint it with, bud? What did he use?\" \"Oh, uh â€“ ha-ha. I think it's an oil.\" But he knows it's 1710, see? And he knows it was Jules Drool, and he knows the name of the painting is Shameful Morning or something. But you ask this bird â€“ you ask this bird, you say, \"What did he paint it with?\" \"Oh, I think it was â€“ uh, I think it's an oil. I-I think it's an oil. I-I-I think it's an oil. It's an oil.\" He ain't got the point. It's very valuable to know what they were painting with when. See? That's quite valuable. You can use that. Well, you'd â€“ just a crudest possible use â€“ you see something that is painted with ICI Best House Paint, as represented of having been painted in 1510, you know that's wrong, because they didn't make peanut-oil-emulsion paint in... I mean, that's crude, see? But you can see that it does have some applicability in the de-tection of authenticity. What did he paint it with? That's very â€“ that's a good applicable datum, you see? I'll give you a parallel datum like this. I was tearing apart encyclopedias yesterday to find out if anybody else had ever mentioned a certain art form. I could find it no place but I did find in the dictionary that \"dorÃ©\" meant \"gold colored.\" I thought that was very interesting because the name I was looking for as an art form was a dorÃ©-type and so I didn't know which way I was going on this thing. I thought it was probably a man's name, probably interfered with â€“ with Gustave DorÃ©, you know, and his etchings. No, it wasn't after a man's name and so the thing has never survived as a name, because it wasn't a man, you see? It was simply a goldish form of art reproduction. So they called it a dorÃ©-type and the name is so esoteric that it has only survived in the super-super-professional lines. If a guy was really on the ball and he delved into everything, he'd know there had been such a thing as a dorÃ©-type, see? But oth-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 4 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 104 MCSC erwise, he wouldn't know anything about it. Everybody knows what, for instance, a da-guerreotype is, see? Nothing like that. But what was a dorÃ©-type? Well, that becomes important in examining the development of picture display, the display of pictures and so forth. So there was a type which did a strange piece of picture dis-play. Well, you should be able to run such things back. Beyond that, in actual fact, whether it was Mr. Wall or Mr. Pall who invented it when â€“ has nothing much to do with it. But how it was done, you see, at such and such a time â€“ oh, that would have quite a bit to do with it, see? So, when you're dealing with education you have to be very careful not to lean over into the significance. Don't lean over into the significance exclusive of the mass. That is a very interesting datum. Now, when you get into significance versus mass, you get into action; and action could be defined as significance versus mass, of some kind or another. That's rather drawing a longbow, you understand, but the reason one engages in action or doingness and so forth, is he has some kind of an idea of accomplishing something or making something or avoiding something or... He has â€“ there's a significance there, you know? There's an idea about it. Even though â€“ even when we look at a lot of particles flying around in the air and we say: \"That's a confusion,\" we've added significance to the mass, don't you see? Do you see that? But in education when the significance is never added to the mass but stands in pris-tine purity all by itself, you tend to get a jammed curriculum â€“ no doingness. Let's get down to earth about it, you see? I've just given you an example of it â€“ I've just given you an exam-ple of it, of who â€“ who invented what, see? And now we say, \"And there was a great deal of conflict between these two men at that particular time. One of them â€“ one of them had a greater idea of the destiny of his development than the other one did.\" Oh, what's this got to do with anything? It's a disrelated datum, don't you see? It's just a significance. It hadn't any-thing to do with the doingness or the action, had nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting. All it does is throw you a curve, you get the idea? So, school is expert at throwing curves until one begins to wonder whether or not school ever has education in mind. So, you could have a school technology which would teach, which would never really educate, never really train anyone. You see that? But it could be marvelous. You could fill your whole university through courses of The work of Thomas Hardy. You could have The Plight of Miners in Roman Times on the Cornwall Coast. You could have The Number of Synonyms and Antonyms used by Hunters and Huntresses in the 16th Century. You could have courses which flunk people because they referred to the wrong word, they used the wrong word in connection with the wrong group of animals, you see? You know, like you have \"a covey of quail,\" you see, and \"a covey of foxes,\" you know, that kind of thing, see? Very pedantic! But what is the basic error here? The basic error â€“ I'll come back to it now â€“ the basic error is simply failing to add the mass or doingness to the significance, see, failing to add the mass or the doingness to the significance. You say, \"This fellow was a good painter. He painted and he painted and he painted and he painted and he painted. Well, he painted a lot.\" You could say this in 90,000 different ways. \"He drove seven â€“ his first seven wives batty by the fact he never paid any attention to anything but his painting.\" Well, it's good curiosa but it is not an educational datum. It's just curiosa. What did he paint, see?"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 5 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 105 MCSC Your student then must be taken into consideration. Your student is trying to get to be a painter. And I'm afraid they've spent so much time teaching them on how many wives the painters have had, or haven't had, that their idea of painting is to get married and divorced or to become a walking catalog. Well, of course, if you're a judge, if you're going to be a professional judge or a pro-fessional critic, not a painter but one of these birds, naturally you want to be practically a walking catalog, see? You want to overwhelm everybody. It's good one-upmanship, you know? You walk through looking at things this way â€“ this way. \"Yes, this man over here, he's copied â€“ he's copied Hans Verboten.\" [laughter] \"Yes, that's a very obscure painter of the 1416.\" See, you want to know things like that, you know, if you're going to be that. But to be a painter â€“ and that's why you'd almost never turn a member of the arts out of a university. That is almost impossible. It's unheard of, and... to teach short story. They ruin more writers! Well, it's of interest how they do this, and they detach the significance and the action. They separate these two things so it becomes a pure significance without any action or mass connected with it. And when you have done this you have then sort of wound a guy up in a no-confront of the subject and you've introverted him. And the way a student becomes introverted is to give him too much significance and too little doingness and too little mass. That's still knocking you for a loop. You keep looking at me with your heads tipped over here and I want to know what's so incomprehensible about it? No, it's slipping some-where. I don't know how to state it, really, any more plainly than I'm stating it. If you're going to teach a fellow about roller balls, give him a roller ball! Is this â€“ is this difficult, see? Don't teach him the history of roller balls! Am I making more sense? Audience: Yes. All right. Does it â€“ does that make sense? It doesn't? Audience: Yes, yes. So, when you have detached the significance from the action and separated these two things apart, you can have schooling but you can't have education. And that's basically how it's done. If you want to wind up with a whole bunch of do-less graduates, if you want to wind up with a whole bunch of painters who can't paint, a whole bunch of doctors who can't doc, [laughter] engineers who can't eng, then by George, you're going to just â€“ all you have to do is take the doingness and the mass connected with the subject and park that over here as some-thing you really don't want to have much to do with and go into the total significance of it all. And then you make a highly impractical person. And this is the only way it's done. There aren't a number of other ways to do this. You wind it up hard enough and he never does go out of school, he never does leave school; he becomes a professor. Now, I've learned that for a person to teach who cannot do, is a terrible mistake. Let's get right down to earth here, in Scientology. If our Instructors couldn't audit â€“ guahhh! What goes on? If our Instructors couldn't audit, what catastrophe would we face in all educational lines? Supposing they all knew the history of auditing and then supposing they could give you"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 6 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 106 MCSC chapter and verse of everything ever written on the subject and tell you exactly where to find this and tell you how many pages it had; supposing they could do that â€“ but they couldn't au-dit. This would be somewhat catastrophic. And any trouble that an Instructor has in teaching has a little bit of something to do with something he doesn't confront about the doingness or the mass of the subject. You got the idea? So, this Instructor finds that he really doesn't like to teach geometry or something like that. Well, he can't do anything with geometry. Do you see? He's got a blind spot in this par-ticular direction. Now, this became so notable from my inspection and study of study that I was practi-cally struck dumb on the subject. It goes to this degree: that a person who is simply writing the reports of people who can do is too far removed for the execution of a good textbook. A person writing reports of people who can do, no matter what people this person consulted, is too far removed from the doingness and mass to make a studiable, good textbook. That is remarkable. Now, you understand all this background I am giving you here on this particular sub-ject â€“ came about when I realized that if we were going on upstairs and we knew something about the mind, that we had to wrap up another subject which is entirely separate to the sub-ject we were trying to wrap up. This is our inheriting the dropped balls of yesterday. They didn't wrap up the subject of education, so we have to wrap up the subject of education, you see, in order to educate; just for our own practical application, see? Well, they didn't do it. They got a lot of money for it, they were paid to do it and they didn't do it, see? So you feel the same crossness that you would feel at the switchman that you had down there on the rail-road tracks and he drew his pay to throw the switch and he didn't, you know? And the Twenti-eth Century Limited went off the rails, see? And you say, \"That blas, of blah, blah, blah, blah â€“ that was his job and he didn't do it,\" see? Same way, same way. Here we are. We've got a difficult subject to confront because one is studying what one is, and we should have had the whole subject of education beautifully wrapped up. But instead of that, it's just mud-died up. There are many preconceptions in this line. So, I recognized that it was necessary â€“ even though we had made great inroads on this â€“ I recognized that it was necessary that I get a new viewpoint on this subject. Therefore I picked up an analogous, or a similar line of study, in that it's a practical subject â€“ if you know certain things and you do certain things, you get a certain result, see? That type of a practical subject â€“ and yet one that sort of borders over into the field of the arts, don't you see, so that you have to have some judgment and taste and so forth. And I picked up this subject â€“ one, because it was available, two, because I had some interest in it â€“ but basically because it did show a fairly decent pattern of what an auditor would do. In other words, he has certain theories and actions which he's supposed to perform which, when applied, will produce a certain result if he uses judgment and good taste. Now, you'd â€“ it isn't the same thing: auditing and photography are very long from the same thing. But auditing does have this in common with photography, that when you do certain things, and you do them right, you then wind up with a result, with a certain result. But if you do these things a bit wrong, you don't wind up with a result, you see? But also, if you do these"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 7 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 107 MCSC things and you do them without using good sense, see, you also don't wind up with a result, see? It's a comparable action. So I picked up this particular field and took a full, blasting, exclamation point, profes-sional course on this from the word \"izzard\" straight on through. Now this was all sandwiched in during the last few months of everything else I've had to do. And I learned, however, a great deal about it just by experiencing subjectively something that was off the subject of what we are doing, something that I had a dilettante knowledge of and so forth. And as I showed you the other day, I think it was starting to come up with a professional result. So then therefore, the course was well studied and did lead to a finite result at the other end of things. I've gone past the point now of just studying it and I can actually develop those points and portions of it necessary to produce the better result, don't you see? It's gone over that bor-derline. For instance, it's all right to do this and that and the other thing and you do that ex-actly by the textbook. But if you're terribly good by the textbook, why, you can then give it that extra frill over here that makes it come out on top, don't you see? In other words, you can use the textbook so well that you can think while you're doing it. Do you see that? Now, that is what I have been going through. And I noticed a great many points very early that would never have struck me if I were not working in a completely new field of study. This is not a field, by the way, that I was ab-solutely new to. I've actually been trained in darkrooms and that sort of thing from a practical viewpoint. So, from another viewpoint here â€“ that I got an idea of â€“ that actually just practical training isn't enough. You can't just give the guy the tools and say, \"All right. Well, dabble around with it and go to work on the Daily Express and watch the birds rushing in and out of the darkroom at the Daily Express and if you do that long enough, why, you will become a good photographer.\" That's not true! I have fabulous evidence that this is not true. The evi-dence lies before you every morning when you glance at the paper. What they commonly call a news photograph is so bad and oddly enough most of those boys are untrained. The top-notchers that you see around, the real headliners and that sort of thing, oddly enough, are trained. It isn't, then, a gift that they suddenly pick up, see? It isn't this vast talent â€“ fellow sees a camera â€“ \"Oh!\" you see, and this huge streak of light goes through his skull of that brilliant inspiration and he clicks the shutter and then he has pictures all over the front of everything. It doesn't work that way. And he can go through all of the menial jobs he wants to in the field of photography, cleaning plates and all the rest of those things, through to the last bitter end of the thing and he will never become a top-notch photographer. They're doing it all the time because this is the way the newspapers get the young men to come in and work in their dark-rooms. They tell them this and that's not true. Top-notch photographers of England are most severely trained photographers you ever had anything to do with. They are just a little bit too severely trained, if anything. But they're hot. You get Tony Armstrong-Jones, my God! If you ever saw a man use standard photogra-phy, this guy uses it with a capital \"S\" with an exclamation point. He can't even take a picture of his own new baby without setting up the exact textbook lighting for a baby picture, see? He doesn't even get thrown by the event of being a father, you see? He goes and gets the exact"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 8 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 108 MCSC lamps and he sets them up at the exact angle and he fixes them up this way. He got a fluke picture by doing this â€“ it's just one of those flukes. You run into them all the time â€“ you take advantage of them. Nevertheless, his lighting was absolutely textbook. This guy is a head-liner, see? He's taken design photography now, and in the â€“ in the big Sunday Times Maga-zine Section â€“ he had an article in there a couple of Sundays ago and I know he just laughed like mad when he published that lead picture in there. He's standing outside of a building, he gets the perfect architectural texture â€“ he's been elected to the Design Council and so forth â€“ he takes â€“ stands outside the building, he gets the perfect texture of the brick, perfect texture of glass, perfect texture of everything, and shoots the inside of the building like daylight. And I know what he did. He said, \"Nobody will notice it but a pro, but let them figure out how I did it,\" see? He knew the public would just be interested in it sort of as a picture and so forth. But I'm sure that it was in the back of his mind, \"Let somebody figure out how I did this,\" see? I don't know how he did it. I know how I would have done it but you don't shoot from the out-side of a building in glaring sunlight and get the total detail of the inside of the building with-out doing cutouts or something and this is no cutout. How did he do it, see? And I know he sort of laughed to himself because he's put together, of course, two brands of very standard lighting. Knows his subject cold, you see? So he â€“ but he uses it in this peculiar way with color film to get this fantastic result. You never stand outside of a building, see it in perfect detail and look into the room inside and see it in perfect detail at the same level of light. And then you don't shoot this in color. No latitude to the film. But a pro can be counted on to do things like that. But when you break him right on down, why can he do things like that? He knows all the right ways to do it and therefore he knows how to fail at doing what he's doing and then he can think that extra step, see? He knows his equipment and so when he can think that one more step, that makes him a cham-pion. The leading glamour photographer of England is a fellow named Tom Hustler. They're always calling in Tom Hustler to shoot some star or something of the sort. They rave about his pictures. Well, it's quite amazing, because Tom Hustler never took anything in his life except a standard professional photograph. He never took anything. He doesn't even add that extra. He is so standard that he's painful to look at if you're a pro, see? The hair light is always exactly where the hair light is supposed to be â€“ that light that you see in portraits that gives the little gleam to the person's hair, see? His main light, the big one, and the fill, they're al-ways in exactly the right position. His background is always exact. It's just a technically per-fect photograph, do you see? There isn't anybody else in England taking them. Lancere, the great theater photographer, I am told â€“ I am told â€“ their great theater pho-tographer. I saw some pictures by this character the other day, he's about as standard as a pig lost in the swamp, see? And the pictures look it â€“ they're faulty. And his lighting is not stan-dard and he doesn't know what to do with the lighting. I think he's got baby picture lighting he's lighting stars with or something of the sort. He's just not a pro. You see? Shows up â€“ bang! People look at the picture; and you show them one that is perfectly lighted, you say, \"How about this one,\" you see?"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 9 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 109 MCSC They say, \"Oh! That's a beautiful picture,\" you see? And you show the next one and it's got a technical imperfection in it and they, well, they don't like that so well. They can't tell you why, this is a common guy off the street, see? Now, photography has got the common denominator of the public taste. What does the public want to see and what does the public like to see? So now, we have a new subject in photography â€“ this is another reason I chose it â€“ brand new subject. Just a little over a century old. About 1810 â€“ 1810 somebody said, \"You know, I get a poiple shadow on a piece of paper when I paint it with some funny chemicals\" and there it all began. Color photography is so far from new that they were actually projecting color photographs on the screen for the edification of audiences â€“ not hand-colored or any-thing â€“ as the same time as Mr. Brady. But, that's all new. That's a Johnny-come-lately sub-ject, isn't it? It's not really had time to pick up too much snob. It's not had time to get lost. So, to make my point, when you give it all mass and doingness and no significance, you also fail. In other words, you can send this fellow up as a darkroom assistant to the Daily Mail, have him packing cameras for somebody or other, and have him standing in there at Lancere's adjusting lights for half a lifetime without his ever really becoming a pro. So, professionalism has to do with the significance and the doingness and the mass. It has to do with all of those things. You can't have all doingness and no significance, and you can't have total significance and no doingness and wind up with a final result in the way of a student. Education, then, would consist of a balanced activity which would treat with equal importance the significance and the doingness of a subject. You would treat these things equally. Now, this is not a new thought â€“ it's not a new thought. It's been with us for some time. But it was terribly confirmed to me on an inspection of what is standard photography today and having been over the jumps and being almost finished with this course and ready for my finals, I thought I had better just make all these notes of it and so forth. But one of the things that stuck me in the eye all the way through the line is the pro, the real pro, was the fellow who knew the significance and had experience in the doingness and the handling of the mass. And that was a real pro; a real professional. Now, you say, \"Well, what about this fellow who comes busting out of the middle of nowhere and he all of a sudden develops this whole fantastic panorama of new material?\" No, you were looking at a pro. You didn't look at anybody who suddenly busted out of nowhere uninformed and so forth. But his education might easily â€“ because it wasn't being taught any-place â€“ the significance was backed up by a great deal of additional hard study, see? You still had the study there, see? He studied like mad. Let's take somebody like the fellow who projected the first color pictures. I bet you he could have given you the number and book of practically every photograph that had been taken in the history of photography, which went back of him only about 20-30 years. He must have known them, see? He must have known them all. Then you go back into it a little bit further, you'll probably find out he was a chemist by training, see?"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 10 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 110 MCSC Professionalism, then, doesn't leap full-armed from the breath of somebody's hope. Professionalism is sweated for. And also, professionals are distinguished by the fact that they work hard. Dilettantism is supposed to mean \"good at many things,\" but actually I would rather extend its meaning a little bit to saying that \"unprofessional at everything,\" because part of professionalism is hard work. You, really â€“ to pick up all the significance of a subject and to put that into a doingness action and so forth, rough, rough, rough. Now, that all sounds very interesting but there is another factor involved in it: Is, you don't have to have done everything that was done in order to be a pro and that is a very hope-ful thing. And I learned that the hard way. You don't have to have made a piece of photo-graphic film in order to become grounded in making photographic film, see? That's lucky for you, you don't have to make a human mind in order to fix one up. That's carrying the point a little broad but you actually don't have to have run Standard Operating Procedure of July of 1950, in order to call yourself a professional auditor. If you did that, why great â€“ great, see? Fine. But you take someone who's being trained in 1964, to ask him to do that would be silly. Right now, to â€“ this stage of study, for me to go and get some chemicals of some kind or another and some old horses' hooves and boil them up, and â€“ so as to have some gelatin and put these things all together so as to make one of the original forms of wet plate, and ex-pose it wet in one of my cameras â€“ which was the way they did it, you see and so forth, well, it'd just come out at the other end. I â€“ what would I say out of this? \"Well, I've done it.\" So what? I'm not going to do it. Not again. That would wreck the camera, of course. Do you see what I mean? That can be overstressed. Now, we get to the overstresses. The doingness can be terribly overstressed. I've already showed you significance can be terribly overstressed. \"Pliny did write on the â€“ ye old wax tablet, which he wrote on with a stylus, which that day had a dull point, because his slave had a headache, that sturgeons...\" See, you can go crazy on this subject, see, of significance. You can go nuts. You can wildly overestimate what a student has to know. You can also underestimate it. But the wildest shot, when they get to formal schooling, is to shoot the moon with this thing. Just go overboard with it, just go crazy with it â€“ make â€“ drive everybody around the bend with it, see? It's sort of a method of forbidding somebody the subject, see? See? \"If you can't tell us all the papers of Sigmund Freud, you can never be a diplomate in psychiatry.\" It's a fact, the total examination for the highest rank of psychiatry is simply the title, the date writ-ten and the place of publication of each one of Freud's papers. I know I exaggerate and a psy-chiatrist, if he were here right now, would say, \"Oh, how you â€“ rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr,\" you know? He'd sound like Vixie out here when you kick her. [laughter] But he'd be lying in his teeth, because that's his diplomate examination. I know â€“ I knew a psychiatrist, nursed him through a psychotic break, because he was taking it. [laughter] And I don't think you can get much closer to the examination without, in actual fact, taking it yourself. And that was what was driving him around the bend. He was preparing for that exam that way and he took the exam that way and that was it. It was very funny watching him prepare for the exam, he'd keep rolling up on a ball, sucking his thumb; rolling up in a ball, you know, in the fetal position on the couch so he could study this. It was very funny. I"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 11 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 111 MCSC never did tell him, \"You know, brother, I think you're keyed in.\" [laughter] But overweighted significance is a way of defeating a student, way overweighted. Now, you can err to the degree that you're giving him a subject which he's never going to do. Now, let's take it over into Scientology. You're giving him all the data, necessary to run Standard Operating Procedure of July, Elizabeth, New Jersey and so forth. And the mistake is to give him all of it. He's never going to use it. All you want to know, you â€“ all you want to give him is enough so he can identify it. If he collides with this thing again, he said, \"Hey, that's Standard Operating Procedure of July,\" you know, \"back there, Elizabeth.\" \"Early days, Elizabeth,\" is about all you want to get through there. \"Yeah, that sort of thing. Finger snap, yeah.\" Something like that. \"Oh, yes. They did that, early days.\" Have some dim idea where this thing fits, you see? That's about all you want to get across to him. He's not going to do it, see? So therefore, if he's not going to do it, you've got to strip the significance off of it. You got the idea? That's the way these are kept in balance. If the guy isn't going to do it, take the significance off of it. See, you've got to keep these things in balance. If he's going to do it, pour it to him, man! Let's take an esoteric process like bromoil. Well, they didn't use to have panchromatic film, so it drove them mad. They didn't use to have a film that responded to color, so it drove them absolutely stark, staring mad trying to get a tree light enough so that it looked like a tree, you know? When they made a picture of a tree, they had an awful time with this sort of thing. So they did this fantastic process, like photolithography. I won't burden you with any of the details, because â€“ ohh â€“ horrible! It makes me shudder to remember it. Nobody's ever going to do a bromoil, unless he's a doodle-daddle type of darkroom bug, you know? See, he's got to be a real darkroom bug, because there's much simpler methods of producing the same result, do you see? Well, some old-time photographer that is a real purist and so forth, in New York, would listen to that statement and he'd say, \"I don't know that you'll never do a bromoil. You can't be sure, you know. I myself have done bromoils and so forth. Only took me thirty days one time to do one bromoil print.\" That's about the length of time, see? Oh! Cruel! And right when I was coming down the home stretch with my course I had a half a textbook on how you did bromoil prints. A half a textbook! It is there in its most painful excruciating detail, but not, incidentally, in such a way that you could really do one by referring to the text. It goes like this, the order of action, which is another point down here which I'll get to â€“ the order of action is all wrong in it. That is to say, \"Now make sure that you lay this wet picture,\" you see, \"this wet print out on the back of the tray that will fit it, or glass, and make sure that you lay it out and pin it all down carefully. Now, before you do that, make sure that you have the other print ready, because you're going to need it in a second.\" Oh, no, see? You're on what I know as order of. You've got down to this line, and you're slavishly going down the line men-tally doing the action, you see, and then you find out you've made a mistake, see? He tells you now that there was another action you should have done before the action he tells you to do, see? Zzrrrrrrr! And you have a feeling like you've made a terrible mistake. But bromoil is there in its most excruciating detail and has not been done seriously for a number of years. You could probably win a salon exhibit with a bromoil print. You proba-bly could today. Judges would stand there and they'd look at it and they'd say, \"What's this?\""},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 12 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 112 MCSC They're quite beautiful. \"Uhh, what's this? My God! A bromoil, you know? Gee, you know? Give him first technical prize.\" That's about all you'd get for it, see? \"Somebody has actually done a bromoil print â€“ wow!\" See? And they'd say, \"Gee,\" you know? They themselves would know what this involved â€“ being trained people, see? Public would go by, look on down at the rest of the pictures; wouldn't stop any eyes. But it would have meant about thirty days, or something like that, of pure, dripping sweat. But to be taught how to do it, down to the last comma, down to the last bit of tempera-ture, down to every mistake that you could make in doing this thing which you're never going to do, absolutely takes the cake right off the top of the oven. Wow! See? There is all this do-ingness which is never going to be matched with a doingness, you see? So all this significance is then built up with an undone never-will-be-done doingness, so it all becomes significance. So, the doingness all but moves over here into the significance department, don't you see? And it doesn't just unbalance it; it winds you up with some ghastly headaches, I know. I say, \"Well, I've got to get through this to get to the end of this course or I don't get any di-ploma. Got to make it. 'So you take a stipple brush.' Now, let me read that again. 'You...'\" Ghastly, you know? You're never going to take a stipple brush. You couldn't care less. So they couldn't make prints in 1890! All right. Great! We don't happen to be having that trouble today. Like asking you to study the aspects â€“ you are studying to some slight de-gree, but they are very useful â€“ but studying some of the aspect of a \"pc lists that were made in 1950\" â€“ they weren't published â€“ but what could â€“ you know, no meters, see â€“ so what could the auditor detect without any meter? What would the pc do that would indicate this, see? And then giving it to you in total, painful detail. All you're going to do is read your tone arm, see? But giving you this other in total painful detail, \"You sit there and you audit with your fingers on their pulse,\" you see, and now give you the whole rundown of the Japanese or Chinese system of pulse counting by pressure because that's the more complex system. That was actually what I used, the Chinese system of pulse counting, trying to get up on it â€“ how... oh, you'd be surprised, man â€“ you sit there today â€“ you were absolutely at the beginning of road nowhere in the â€“ just about 14-15 years ago, there was no way to tell what the reaction of the pc was; there was no way to tell what a hot subject was; there was no way to look into anybody's mind; there was no way to record it, if you did. Just a nowhere view, see? Grim. But now, for you to be taught, who are never going to do it, how you detect a tone arm response without any meter because of the various physiological manifestations of the pc, the motion of the chest â€“ very important, see, the change of breath, coloration; eye coloration. There is a whole subject of how do you know if a process is flat by the eye coloration. Very interesting subject! How would you like to learn the several thousand words that were written on this subject? All you have to know, if you were taught this, is that there was such a subject. You see? You could very easily learn there was such a subject and there is the subject, which is what makes the E-Meter important, see? This other subject is so complex that the E-Meter solves this other subject, which is \"How do you tell what's going on in the pc?\" And that sub-ject had many ramifications, see? And if a process is really getting to a pc, his eye color will"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 13 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 113 MCSC change, you see? Or his pulse will smooth out, you know? That's about all you have to know. The rest of this is bric-a-brac. All right, somebody can spend his whole life, whole life working in the field and realm of bric-a-brac and have a good time. There are fellows who study the history of bro-moil â€“ not do it â€“ study the history of it â€“ as almost a full-time hobby or profession or some-thing, see? So, you can get these incredible significances built up in a subject which actually don't amplify the doingness or the expected action of the student. Then this is giving him do-ingness which becomes a significance. So we get to the next point of the line which is the conversion of doingnesses to only significances. And if a subject does very much of this, you've just about had it. If you convert all the doingnesses of a subject over into significance â€“ that's how you do it, is you take some subject which is not going to be performed and you describe it far beyond any necessity. Then you've got a conversion, see? Now, if you can go the reverse, you can say the significance is convertible over to the doingness. And you have just had an example of that â€“ the fellow is never going to make a bromoil, so you make him make a bromoil. See, it's properly merely a significance today; it's just properly a significance. There was a thing called a bromoil print. Fine, it existed, see? What it was, was it depended on the same principle now used in photo-lithography. Gelatin holds water and water repels oil, see? Uses these various principles. In-teresting to know, see? You can cover it in a paragraph or two, see? Now, if we go too far on this particular line, by making some person do some ancient, old act, which he is never again going to do, we've taken something that should have just re-mained there as a significance and we have pushed it over into a doingness action. And it again upsets the student most ghastly. I'm sure he would have â€“ I'm sure it'd be cute to grind some wheat with a millstone, you see? It could be a hobby, don't you see? It could be very nice, but there would have to be some good reason why you were doing it. Do you see? A good reason why you were doing it, see? And if it's just that you want to see how they did it primitively, well, maybe that's a good enough reason, see? But that's if you want to do it. Did you notice the choice of words? To make a student do it is a fantastic error. Silly! And his reaction to your effort to teach him is an ARC break. He can't figure out why the devil he's doing this in the first place. So we come to the conclusion that the doingness and the mass of a subject are the cur-rent, applicable and useful doingnesses and masses of the subject and those are what should be taught â€“ hard. They're applicable â€“ the applicable doingnesses and masses. In other words, the student should be taught what the student is going to be doing. And the significances that should be taught to the student are â€“ don't compare to what I just told you. The significances are enough background so as not to get â€“ and this is something they've all missed, and this is how an engineer gets to be forty years old and goes old hat â€“ is enough significance so that he doesn't get stuck in the mechanical doingness he's been taught â€“ and you've got to give him enough significance. In other words, that's a little bit more significance than you would expect to give him. And that's why you give him the history of it, to show that it was developed and give him some sketch of its development. And that's why you show him how the thing evolved and what the doingnesses of it were."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 14 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 114 MCSC So you see, it becomes asinine to make him do these old things. You're just trying to show him that there were some other doingnesses, don't you see? And you're making him conversant with the principles with which he's operating and if he's sufficiently conversant with those, then the doingness and the other action which he is being taught don't become obsolete because he can think, see? And that's the difference between a pro â€“ that's the differ-ence between a \"pro\" and a \"practical man.\" It shows up quite additionally, is a pro always does it by the textbook, with a difference; always does it by the textbook, a bit better. And when the thing shifts, it doesn't look like a shift to him, it looks like simply the same thing with its face slightly shifted. Do you see? It doesn't look all that brassy new. Now, you'll hear people around â€“ you've just shifted how you do a repetitive com-mand â€“ and you will have people around that tell you, \"We've changed all of Scientology.\" Well, they had learned the practical action â€“ they'd learned the doingness of giving a practi... a repetitive command, but they had no theory over here of why they were doing this, or what was â€“ what one was trying to accomplish with this, such as flatten the mental comm lag, do you see, that the guy's going through, or anything like that, flatten the process. They just knew this thing of a steady grind, so the second you changed one comma in it, they thought you'd changed all of Scientology, don't you see? But the guy who has grounding on the subject and who knows what processes are and what they're supposed to do, he would say, \"Yeah, well, that â€“ that...\" He'd give it the proper significance, you see? He'd say, \"Well, ah â€“ that's an out... slightly out of ARC, so it should be shifted slightly, see? That knocks the pc a little bit out of ARC. But this other wording, that's very clever. That doesn't knock the pc. See, that doesn't give him a 'no ARC,' you see?\" Yeah, nothing changed, see, to him. Everything looked calm, normal, so forth. Now, a professional then is able to advance and a practical man quite commonly can-not advance. A theoretician, then, would be well taught, but seldom educated. Somebody who is just dealing in theory and nothing but theory, and so forth, could be absolutely beautifully taught, he could be wonderfully schooled, but he would not be educated in that subject be-cause he would have had the doingness missing in that subject. His doingness would have been gone. He's just an expert on the painters of the nineteenth century, that's all. He knows the theory of all of their paintings â€“ just the theory. It's not being done anymore, nobody ever expects to do it again. But you'll find odd bits of the society and culture get parked like this and he can be-come important, just because millionaires these days are trying madly to save their cash with art. Art and land increase in value. So, there's guys walking into salons today who know noth-ing about art, but have just got that 100,000 bucks that they want to get deposited fast before inflation eats it up and they feel if they bought a big, nice, good, solid piece of art, that would be known into the future, then of course, it's worth a 100,000 now, but when money inflates, it'll be worth 200,000. Like land, it would have increased its value with the inflation, so there-fore it's like gold, you see? So he walks into the gallery and he looks at this painting, \"Huh! It's a girl holding a what?\" That's the total knowledge he has of any of this, so he's got experts and the expert can't paint, but he can tell him the real from the false, something like that. But if that guy himself had no doingness of detection or doingness of anything else, his opinion wouldn't be worth"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 15 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 115 MCSC anything either. He wouldn't be able to see and he'd be able to palm off everything. But you've got quite a culture â€“ winds up in some very odd spots and you occasionally look into some of these spots and you'll think you have a total theoretician or something like that, that you've got a totality and you may very well have. But there's nothing sadder than an expert on steam-driven road equipment. I imagine there is one in England today. He's an expert, the last practical expert on the subject of steam-driven road repair equipment. Did you ever see any of these things in textbooks? They're steam engines that have rollers, and they go up and down the roads and â€“ in the days before the internal combustion engine. He's the last â€“ he was the world's â€“ he was a good practical man. He never had any theory of any kind on the subject of steam, or propulsion or anything else, but he's awful practical on the subject of these things, you see? He was all doingness and no thought. Well, he antiquated. He became antique. He became unemployable, actually. So, when you break up this balance in an education, then you haven't educated the bloke and you haven't safeguarded his future. A fellow is betrayed, then, to the degree that he is not educated and only schooled; and that is most of the protest of the young: that they are being schooled, not educated. They're not being fitted for life. I'll give you an idea how far adrift it can go. I asked my kids the other day to write something, write their names, sign their names. And boy! Of all the tongue-between-the-teeth actions, you know! Oh, that was grim! They had no signatures. I came down on their teacher like a ton of bricks, you see? They've done â€“ do lots of â€“ lots of exercises in the field of writ-ing, they couldn't sign their own name. Marvelous example, don't you see? Yet I'm sure that they've been very busy making circles and very busy making slant exercises and very busy doing other things and very busy doing everything but write. And somewhere or another, if you wanted to know what was wrong with that and why that occurred, somewhere or other the doingness moved into the field of theory or significance, see? The doingness moved, be-came just a significance. But it isn't a doingness, don't you see? I mean, writing words has very little to do with traveling ovals, as they call them and so forth, see? So, you can just go just so far with traveling ovals and you get no â€“ there's no doingness there. So the guy is actually in motion, but it isn't an educational doingness. And that's where an Instructor could make his mistake, you see? Because people are busy or active or acting, then he thinks they are doing. It all depends on what they are doing. If they're not doing some-thing that is immediately going to add up to an action applicable by them in life to the accom-plishment of a result, they're in the field of significance. And they react like they are in the field of significance. They become very stultified and bored and protesting and annoyed. See, they themselves have recognized that they've exceeded the doingness, that this doingness has nothing whatsoever to do with what they'll be doing. So they fall back then, and they just treat it as a significance because it's purposeless. It doesn't go anyplace, you see? Nothing's hap-pening so it might as well just be a significance and therefore all the motion is no motion at all. So, all the motion being no motion, really, they get this funny, bored, you know, feeling, like, you know, they're not moving. Here they see all the motion, but they're not moving. And actually it's a significance, which has some motion in it and it doesn't have anything to do with going anywhere. And they get this funny sensation â€“ it actually develops a physiological"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 16 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 116 MCSC sensation. It's being up against something, but not being able to move through it. Funny, funny sensation. It's identifiable. Well, those fundamentally are the basic balances of proper education. Whatever else you want to say about it, those are the basic balances. There are a lot of very specific things, there are a lot of odd and very sharp and very true and very positive and very practical aspects of all this. But education is the â€“ should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another, in such a way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof. And that's about all it is. You could add to it that it permits, then, the other fellow to think on this subject and develop. He should be able to think on the subject and develop on the subject. In other words, he takes this idea that you've given him, and it applies only to murals. You've given him enough background and so forth, and you've told him this applied to mu-rals. And one day he's looking at a miniature and he says, \"For heaven's sakes, that also ap-plies â€“ for this particular job that I'm doing â€“ that other principle applies to the miniature.\" I'll give you one, I can think of one right offhand. A photomural should never be painted until it is actually assembled on a wall, if you're going to paint a photomural, see? Well, I can think of an association that a guy would get in his skull, if he was having any trouble doing miniatures. Supposing for some wild reason or another somebody came up and wanted him to do a miniature on ivory. Well, this is feasible, you can do it. So, if he knew photomurals, and he knew a lot of other work, and he knew lantern slides and so forth and then also he knows how to go back and find how to make an emulsion (you know, one of the basic emulsions that â€“ make it out of egg white or something) he knows what textbook to find it in. He'd probably whop all this together and then he would also know that you certainly better not paint it until you'd totally finished it, see, and in other words, the information is loose in the guy's head. It's flexible, he can use it, see? It isn't jammed into his head crosswise so that it just associates just with one thing, see? Don't give it â€“ don't â€“ education shouldn't give people the technology in such a way that the technology is not useful to them. They've got to be able to think with it. You've got to remember that when you teach this engineer in a university all there is to know about nuclear physics, that in just about a dozen years, through the investment of national governments and other things â€“ and particularly since it's very destructive, we know that national governments will invest, very heavily. And we know that this field is going to change. And we're going to teach him all there is to know on the subject. Well, we could make just a technician out of him for common, ordinary, garden-variety actions of reading meters; or we could teach him current technology or current theory as a biblical fact; or we could teach him in such a way that he could think in the subject. And of them, the only fair thing to do is teach him in such a way as he could think in the subject because it's an advancing subject, and he won't become an antique in a dozen years, see? If we did anything else, he would become antique because this thing â€“ after all, governments are in there shoveling the money into atomic development and so forth, left, right and center. They've got guys on pure mathematics and they've got guys on this and guys on that. And they're â€“ I don't care how they say they're â€“ but I always get suspicious. They say they're \"abandoning the production units of Uranium 235,\" and then the following sentence is added onto this. We take it â€“ yes, they're abandoning the manufacture of 235, we'll buy that."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 17 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 117 MCSC Now, the \"because\" is what you â€“ what you wince on. \"Because there's already sufficient quantities of it to answer all possible needs for the next 500 years,\" see? There's that \"be-cause.\" The first sentence, all right. All right. So they're going to abandon this development. But their \"because\"? Maybe so, but we don't really think so. They've discovered something else, brother. They've discovered something that makes U-235, you know, look like last sea-son's high-button shoes. And of course they're not about to let it out. Every time somebody discovers one of these secrets, or the secretary of state, or somebody like that, of the United States gets on a plane hurriedly in order to tell the last atomic secrets to Khrushchev. I don't think that's his job, but that's what he's been doing lately â€“ this bird, he goes ramming across and around and about and screaming about this and screaming about that. No. There isn't any of these secrets that have been stolen such as the Fuchs and that sort of thing, as damaging as they were, that didn't excite the government into a fantastic internal convulsion on the subject of \"Develop something new, something better, something that hasn't been stolen yet.\" And their best prevention of espionage is not political because that they're sour at. Their best prevention of espionage is just being newer. So, I imagine the poor kid being educated right up now in Birmingham on the subject of atomic physics is probably already 10, 15 years behind the mark. He'll probably get out and he will look very bright and he will say, \"All right, now we take the riga-bongs,\" and so forth. And the fellows on the place say, \"The what? Oh yes, yes. We remember that. We â€“ it's â€“ we... that's historical.\" That was his last course, see, was in riga-bongs, you know? Oooh! \"Well, what are you fellows doing?\" \"Oh well, we haven't time now, but there's a pile of textbooks over in the corner. Those are our more recent notes.\" Well, education, then, to fit this fellow for life would have to fit him for this operating atmosphere. It would have to fit him to think. At the same time they'd have to teach him that disciplines are disciplines and actions are actions but at the same time they'd have to teach him to think with these actions and advance these actions and carry them out to a finite and final conclusion. They'd have to do these things. Well, that's quite a trick, to teach somebody, on the one hand, that this is an exacting discipline, and on the other hand that you should have a loose and flexible attitude toward it. Quite a trick, isn't it? Well, you recognize what the strain is. You're trying to make a practical person who applies it to a result, who can give it that extra fillip, you know, that extra little zing that pushes it on through. He can think on his feet, in other words, and â€“ so that he won't anti-quate. Give him all this so he won't antiquate. Well, that's quite a trick. Actually, that is being demanded of Scientology as in nowhere else. And anybody studying in Scientology is under considerable stress and strain because of these various fac-tors. You have a madly advancing subject, which is advancing beyond the expectancy that it was â€“ its expectancy keeps rising, don't you see? And which is already taking off from the â€“ from the basis of having exceeded all former expectancies. See, and now it is still advancing and its expectancy level is rising, see, consistently. I mean, more and more is developed that broadens the view more and more, see?"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 18 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 118 MCSC And so therefore education in Scientology becomes a much touchier proposition than in any other analogous subject and it's very rough. It's very rough. That is why I undertook to find out what are these various balances and what do you do and so forth. And how do you bring somebody up to a point where he can study this thing without too much casualty and upset. And what are the touchy points, then, of education? And of course, education is a sub-ject that has not been worked out. By definition â€“ there isn't even a definition, you see, such as I just gave you a moment ago. They don't operate in a school with a definition. Well, that's wonderful because what trouble do you get into if you read a paragraph beyond something that you haven't got the definition of? You get into trouble, promptly, instantly and immedi-ately, catastrophic trouble. Well, education's been in trouble ever since it started to do some-thing which it never defined. That's the basic thing wrong with education, see? Let's call somebody who is being educated different than somebody who is being taught. Let's make that shading of difference here. And then let's get the technology of school-ing and understand that the technology of schooling somebody does exist and that man has had that for quite a while, but it doesn't necessarily have too much to do with the technology of educating him, which has been relatively undeveloped. So just because one is going to school is no reason one is getting educated, see? But there's terrific technology wrapped up around school. And that the success of any taught subject is to the degree that it keeps its significance sensibly balanced with its action and the masses associated with it. And that's a sensibly balanced subject. And the odd whip-around can occur here that actually a person can think he's engaged in a doingness when actu-ally he's engaged in a significance because the doingness is never going to be applied, see? And he can actually be engaged in a significance which is really a doingness, on the other side of the fence, naturally. If it balances one way, it'll for sure balance the other way. He can be engaged in a â€“ in a significance of the action of contemplation. And it's as silly as that, don't you see? It's too silly to require very much stress. What is the significance of an action? Well, if an individual was terribly significant about everything under the sun, moon and stars, you could, of course, work up significance into some kind of an educational subject. Don't you see? So the significance itself would lean over and become a doingness. Sounds silly, but it's true. I'm now talking about the \"expert on art of the nineteenth century,\" see? And there are fellows who make a terribly good living, which is the achievement of a final result of educa-tion. After all, I don't care how much communism we've got amongst us, you know? The guy is making a living by simply being a walking dictionary, see. Memory expert on something or other â€“ he's somebody or other. He knows all the formulas there are to be known on the sub-ject of paint. He never mixed any paint, he wouldn't know what to do if you showed him a paint can, he actually abhors the smell of it â€“ it makes him quite sick. But he can sit there in a little cubicle and be an expert on the subject of paint. So his, of course, has become â€“ his sig-nificance has become his doingness. Perfectly allowable. The society has that."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 19 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 119 MCSC So, somebody writes him a letter and they say, \"Dear Expert Jones: We are working with the formula of rosin and â€“ uh â€“ su... and â€“ uh â€“ amber, and we are trying very hard to develop the â€“ so on. Could you please give us the background music to this here paint?\" And he says, \"Well, that paint was originally used on the Tyrrhenian Sea and uh â€“ so forth and their amber was different than anybody else's amber,\" and he goes on and on and on. At the other end of â€“ the guy, the practical bird, takes a look. \"Hey, no wonder it won't paint! Their amber was different. There's a different type of amber â€“ that's Russian amber and Russian amber, it has an awful lot of beeswax in it,\" or something, you know, whatever it is. \"Ha! This paint requires wax.\" So we dump some wax in. All right, now it paints things. See? But this bird didn't have any idea of applying this to anything. If he said enough on the subject then somebody who was doing the subject, you know, could make some sense out of it. So there are experts. There's guys like Einstein. He sat around and did a wonderful... he had a total doing-ness that was of significance. He figured and figured and figured and figured and figured and he figured everybody into a hole. But he sure stimulated guys. More mathematicians were made trying to understand Einstein than any other single man that ever worked. The joke of it is, there might be nothing in his work at all. It's sort of idiotic to say that â€“ somebody comes along and tells you that the speed of light is c, and it's never any different. What's he talking about? What light? Well, now, I don't even think he says it's the light between 3,600 ang-stroms and 5,600 angstroms. I don't think he got that definite. He just said, \"The speed of light.\" Well, that's great. Does he mean light as we normally see light? Well, light, in actual fact is simply the light vibration that you see, don't you see? By definition, that's light. Well, then he must have meant that light, visible light. Well, great. I'm glad he did because when it goes through a prism, it no longer travels at c. Well, what do you say? It could no longer travel at c for this excellent reason: It emerges from the prism at different speeds. Otherwise you would never have a spectrum. Oh yes. But now, you're only talking about wavelength and you're only talking about the amplitude of the wavelength and that sort of thing and that's why it turns the corner. No, I'm afraid that that can't be true either. It must be at a different speed because if you've ever watched soldiers in an evolution, the fellow on the outside is going faster than the fellow on the inside. Have you ever noticed that? Well, light, to bend and fan into a dispersal when it goes through a prism, must be handling something that has to do with speed. But because everybody has gone stone-blind on this because Einstein has said quite the contrary, don't you see, now they've got to have some weird idea, and actually it might interest you to know that they have finally abolished light. I thought that was mighty nice of them. They've now got it worked out that color is only something that is manufactured by the eye to relay to the brain and doesn't exist in actual fact anywhere. That's actually told to you â€“ that's being taught me right now. I think it's a wonderful idea. But if the guy hadn't read a psychology textbook before he wrote that textbook, I would be happier about it. There's something wrong with all of this, for this excellent reason, is, a vibration is a vibration. I don't know why you have to get psychology into it. That's the influence of Locke and Hume, you see? These old birds."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 20 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 120 MCSC \"If there was a sound...\" Descartes, yeah? \"If there â€“ is there sound in the forest if there is nobody there to hear it?\" [laughter] Well, what do they want to chase themselves up those blind alleys for, man? Because they're very easily answered. They are confusing the role of a thetan because they haven't got him. And of course, he's the wild, missing variable in all of their equations. So, all right. So the thetan builds the universe. Now of course, he can experience it. You can experience what you can build, so therefore there would be such a thing as light. It all depends on how you're looking at it, and from what mental science you are looking at it, as to whether or not you make pronunciamentos concerning it one way or the other. But you might get an idiocy that would go something like this: \"Now, light doesn't exist because you aren't. Now, if you were, then light couldn't. Because, you see, if light really does come through the pupil of the eye and excite the brain into various sensations known as color and so forth â€“ but if these things do not exist in actual fact, then of course nothing is behaving outside of your skull at all. Nothing is happening outside of your skull.\" You are saying such things as, \"A cook can never eat the cake he bakes.\" See, this is the plea for total introversion. You follow me, don't you? Therefore, if we've got to have an argument about \"If the tree falls, is there a sound if nobody's there?\" If we're going to have an argument of that character, then let's have some real arguments like \"Can a cook bake a cake and eat it?\" See? But you'd have to go upstairs into the role of a being in this universe, or a thetan. You'd have to come off the kick of the \"Big Thetan\" idea, see? You follow me? \"The Big Thetan built light, and you can only experience light and you don't have anything else to do with light except experiencing light, therefore you're a total effect, brother. Lie down.\" See? You get how these tricks are worked? Well, in education and so forth, you'll find out that it's very safe to advance from a ba-sic premise or a basic assumption, and to make it very clear what basic assumption you are advancing from, and then not try to spread this assumption over into a thousand different things. They have assumed, in physics, the conservation of energy. Well, let them talk about that loud and clear and then let them not talk about the organization of mass. Because they've merely started from the conservation of energy. They haven't said anything about mass. But now they try to drag in mass by saying mass is merely a bunch of energy. Why did they do that? Because their basic assumption is the conservation of energy. \"Energy can neither be made nor destroyed, by anybody, particularly you.\" See, that's the basic assumption of phys-ics. So this naturally is energy, see? Now, it's not the conservation of space, it's not the conservation of time and it's not the conservation of mass. So now everything, then, has to become energy because they've started out with their basic assumption. Therefore they themselves become blind to where their sub-ject took off, and therefore where it'll err. It's going to depart, see? The second something comes up which is not energy, it's going to exceed the basics of finite physics and that's all that's wrong with that because they didn't start with anything but energy, don't you see? So, they're not going to go anyplace but energy."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 21 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 121 MCSC We're in a very safe relationship to this. We start with the being: you, a thetan. We can prove that you, a being as a thetan, exists. We can prove that, and we can back you out of your skull and you can stand without a body. So you're not a body. That's very simple. We don't do this very often and don't require you to do it as one of your class exercises because it makes people sick and unhappy. But it does happen and it does work. All right, so we start out with the basic building block of the universe: a thetan. Now, we're on fairly solid ground there, but of course having done that we are now exceeding all former basic assumptions which start subjects. Now, in trying to communicate this idea, then, we collide with all preconceptions. We collide with everything in the background of people, we collide with all of their upsets in the past, with practically everything under the sun. We can only go, then, in the direction of proc-essing. We can't go in the direction much of the theory and philosophy of the universe be-cause the only way we will really win is in the direction of processing, handling and doing something with the unit because the unit is not educatable at a degraded state. See, that's ele-mentary. So, unfortunately then, we have to know about all there is to know and know it bet-ter than anybody has ever had to know anything before, particularly about education because we can't teach anybody to do it. You're tackling a very tough subject. It's a very easy subject. You're tackling essen-tially a very tough subject, in Scientology, which has been made as easy as possible. And my efforts have been devoted to, in the last few months, in studying study, to make it even easier. Now, I haven't told you very much in this lecture that you can use, but I've told you something that you might have some inspective relationships with, you know? Well let's say, a whole school system of a country miseducated all the youth of this country with malice aforethought. They would get to a point where they couldn't receive a datum. So, they're in a war, and, the enemy â€“ the enemy sends them a despatch and says, \"We are going to attack tomorrow morning,\" but they can't receive a datum. They've got it that plain and clear, see, and they are all in bed, and they all get shot down in flames and that's the end of the country, see? It gets down to the reductio ad absurdum of not being able to observe anything, not be able to perceive anything, not be able to understand anything and have no ARC with anything, which looks to me like a sort of a \"thetan death\" situation. So, it looks to me like there is a great deal of comparison between miseducation and aberration. And it also looks to me that a great deal of work could be put in on this field from a standpoint of deaberrating people at the lower levels. I'll give you an example, just offhand: \"Tell me â€“\" this would not be a repetitive process â€“ but, \"Tell me a word that you have not understood in this life.\" And then you make the guy go ahead and clarify it. I think you'd get some of the most interesting resurgences. I think some of the many of the personal problems of the individual would blow up in smoke. But here, just on this other subject of study â€“ of studying the subject of study â€“ one walks forth with a brand-new avenue of lower-level disentanglement and lower-level therapy lines which look quite promising; they look quite promising. But what I'm mainly interested in is you, a Scientology pro training people, have to know something about this subject. I'm"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 22 4.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 122 MCSC interested in your education right now as you exist. And I'm trying to make it as easy as pos-sible on you and teach you something about it. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 123 MCSC STUDY: GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE A lecture given on 6 August 1964 Well, what's the date? Audience: Sixth of August AD 14. What? Audience: Sixth of August. It is the 6th of March. Audience: Sixth of August. Somebody back there says it's the 6th of March. It's the 6th of August AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And we have another lecture today on study. Now probably, just to get off in high gear here, so the taxi cabs won't run up too big a bill out there this evening â€“ just to get off into high gear, let me tell you at first that, of course, no field of study including Scientology texts of earlier times includes these principles. So this is a very adventurous thing I'm doing because it can rebound on a critical, you see, at Scientology texts because they are not written this way. They are written in an effort to make people understand what you're talking about but they do not go according to these prin-ciples and future Scientology texts, on the other hand, will go according to these principles. And you will see this suddenly entering and coming over the horizon. However, you have at this time only a bulletin or two which represent this. You probably have noticed of recent times that the more recent bulletins are much easier to study and that is a direct result of this study of study. Leave it to me to study study. But it's very interesting that your grades on examination, since I have been talking to you about studying, have increased from five percent in the nineties â€“ five percent of the class in the nineties â€“ to sixty percent of the class in the nineties. That's one of these astonishing leaps, you see? It is too astonishing to â€“ well, it would be totally unlooked for. Now, you are already being trained above the level of modern education, that is to say modern education as she is taught. One shouldn't be grammatical about low-grade things, you see? I've been amus-ing myself lately by making grammar agree with the disrespectfulness with which something should be regarded. That's very interesting â€“ the mood with which you use grammar, you see? And you do that, too, you say, \"She ain't a-gonna come.\" Meaning, of course, that you had a highly disrespectful attitude towards what she said about it, don't you see? A lot of unex-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 2 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 124 MCSC plored nuances in language and that sort of thing which are quite amusing. But of course, that's just amusing. In the field of study to improve the ability of a student to learn by altering the charac-ter and methodology of teaching is the exact aim here. Now, this is quite an interesting aim: that is, just to alter the ability of the student to study and to learn and improve it by simply altering the teaching methodology. Now, you see now, that in itself is rather adventurous, because you say, \"Well, I could make the subject easier to read,\" or something like that, but how about changing the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method of teaching which is employed? So, you see how far we have reached here. We are now handling in this subject the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method we use in teaching it. So, if you want to see some pan-determinism at work, that's it, don't you see? Now, study normally would simply be, you told somebody something and he was sup-posed to study it, you see; and if he didn't like it, why, you reported him to the headmaster, you see? That was how we achieved subjective reality on the student. In universities it's done by mechanisms of expulsion, a grade system whereby if somebody doesn't make a grade he is expelled. This lightly goes on â€“ he's not permitted to go into the next grade. You see that very commonly, but this goes up to a point where somebody is expelled. Now, that was how they tried to give the student subjective reality on the subject he was studying by, of course, pun-ishment. How else would you expect, don't you see, the thing to conduct itself in the physical universe? So actually, beyond an effort to present the facts and say a subject was there and then provide a school technology which made the individual guilty if he didn't know it, the whole subject of study and training had not really much advanced beyond that point. That was about the high tide of study. Now, quite accidentally someone with intuition or insight â€“ some professor, some teacher someplace, in some school â€“ would depart from this rationale. He would depart from this method of teaching and he would try to invite the understanding and the interest and the participation of the student; and such people were very rare and people really tried, students really fought to get into their classes. And that was about as far as it had advanced. Now, when we recognize that education is not very successful we have made an enormous stride forward. Now, the educational authorities who are responsible for the educa-tion of children and adults refuse to recognize this fact and so they really don't really try to improve it. But when you are down against a practical subject such as Scientology where you have trained this auditor as best you could and then you see him sit down â€“ you have an ele-ment there which is missing in most educational technologies. They teach the engineer to build a bridge but then nobody in that university is forced to sit down and watch him build a bridge, much less go across the bridge he has built. So you see, they do not in actual fact get a very good look at whether their educational methods are successful or not. We teach some-body ancient Greek. There is nothing wrong with learning ancient Greek but the teacher then"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 3 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 125 MCSC never really is a witness of the student speaking to the ancient Greeks, see? He doesn't pay too much attention to this. So therefore, in studying study, I avoided all those fields where observation of the stu-dent was not easily attained, the actual doingness of the student was not easily viewed. That ruled out a field for the study of study, you see? So immediately engineering technology, we could learn nothing from that because, of course, nobody ever sits around and watches whether or not the engineer builds the bridge, you see? So it had to be something as intimate as Scientology, which is, the Instructor teaches the student how to audit a case and then, oddly enough, is able at that very minute to have him turn around and audit the case, see? So this, of course, has a tendency to force progress and advance upon us and we are able then to make a further advance because we have an instantaneous inspection of the results of our study. So, perhaps one of the reasons why the civilization has not made considerable pro-gress in this line is because very few subjects are in this category, whereby the subject in-structed is not instantly practiced before the professor. Do you see that? So that therefore gives us â€“ gives us you might say the driver's seat in this subject where â€“ of study â€“ because we can see instantly with no comm lag at all. We don't find out whether or not this fellow turned out to be a great and famous barrister, don't you see, twenty years hence. We don't find that out, but we find out whether this person became an auditor before the day is out. Can the person use this principle? Well, we walk right over into the auditing section and there is the same auditor that we've just had in practical and we've just taught him something in practical and there he sits, you see? There he sits with his bare face showing. Right there! And when the Practical Supervisor also does auditing supervision, he continues to work very, very hard to put his practical across to a point where he sees it all of a sudden in a session. You see? So, we probably have a closer look than anyone else. Now, there's a great zone of tolerance in most studies. They expect the student to be very amateurish. Let's say we're teaching a craft like silversmithing; now, we don't expect he is going to heat up any silver without burning his fingers, see? So we get a big gradient win: He heated up some silver without burning his fingers, see? Well, that's all very well and that's fine but we don't expect him to make a tea service that is going to please the general manager of the British Silver Trust in his first few weeks of silversmithing. We sort of would expect that fellow to go out and hang around silversmithing and improve his design and work with a master and gradually get there and when he is about fifty, why, turn out some cracking marvel of a piece, you see, that the general manager of British Tea Services, Limited, or something of the sort, would approve of and buy and use as a standard design, you see? There's always this comm lag. But there was a field, not to stretch it too far, there was a field where instant inspection was feasible and so that field lent itself peculiarly to study on the subject of study which would be analogous to Scientology and that was the field of photography. Now, when you tell a student to take a picture of a tree and he goes out and takes a picture of a tree, you in very short order are going to see a picture of a tree. And if it is upside down and if he has cut it in half and if he didn't hold his camera level and if he had camera shake, all of these things are immediately and distinctly visible. Furthermore, we have a direct and exact result of a combi-"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 4 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 126 MCSC nation of actions which, of course, is important. Can he put a sandwich on a tray? Well, all right, he can put a sandwich on a tray, but that's not a very complex action. Can he make a sandwich and put it on a tray? See? All right, well can he make the bread, you see, and make the filler and make the sandwich and make the tray and put it on the tray? You see how this field â€“ you could suddenly start broadening, see, out a subject. Well, I'm afraid that we're in â€“ very close in â€“ to that kind of a subject in Scientology. It's a subject of complex actions. It's not a subject of simple actions. No matter how hopefully a person in a co-audit when he first comes in â€“ I'm talking about a HAS co-audit â€“ believes, no matter how touchingly he believes that all it is, is he has to sit there and nod, he very, very soon becomes aware that he is engaged in a complex action. He is expected to say something and this probably strikes him with the greatest of shock when he finally realizes he is ex-pected to say something and that it is up to him to get the person he's auditing to say some-thing. Now, we've got a double complexity: he not only himself has to say something but the person he is auditing has to have something said to him which will cause the person he is au-diting to say something. Do you follow this through? Then he's got to hear this and then he has got to acknowledge it. Well, he probably finally masters this, off a canned piece of paper or something of the sort, and he finally masters this and he feels very triumphant, only to dis-cover that the person who sits opposite him in the co-audit, as it changes around, is not the same case. He gets different pcs and these pcs have different cases and this is pretty grim, because we knew all we had to say to somebody was, \"Well, how is your mother-in-law get-ting along.\" and we had a good session going. But this next fellow hasn't got a mother-in-law, [laughter] so that is a total stumbling block and you would be amazed how big a stumbling block that might look. Now he has to enter the technology, if he's told that he has to do some-thing with problems, he has to enter the technology of problems. What the devil is a problem? In order to talk to somebody about problems, or dream up things about problems for the fel-low to talk about, we have to know something about problems. Now, he's away into the sig-nificance of the mind, added to the actions which he is performing. Now, the normal way we go about this is to get him to perform the simple actions and then add the complexities to them one after the other, on the basis that the person would be-come confused if given too much too fast. So, we have a new discovery which we have made, long since, called gradient scales which applies in the field of study and that you teach somebody on a gradient. Well, what is meant by \"teaching somebody on a gradient\"? Well, a gradient of course refers to a grade which is sort of an uphill looking sort of picture, don't you see? It's a little bit more so each successive step. What we mean by a gradient: It gets steeper or it gets more complex or it takes in more the further you go. Well, that's a gradient and as long as we attack a gradient â€“ as long as we attack the subject on a gradient of complexity, we give him this cycle. We move along into more and more numerous actions, but we try to teach him each action that we're going to add to â€“ we're going to add to this action â€“ so we're going to teach him that action so well that it doesn't worry him. And then our next action that we teach him â€“ this has its own complexity, but it's"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 5 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 127 MCSC done in combination with this first action. But if the first action is still worrying him and he hasn't got that down, then our next action is going to throw him. When you see somebody getting confused, then he hasn't gotten down the more fun-damental action he should have gotten down before he advanced into more complex action. It isn't that he doesn't understand the more complex action â€“ he's not even confronting that ac-tion; he's still confronting this more basic action. See, he hasn't learned that basic action. Well now, the only place you can err in this area is trying to start in too high on the gradient and you can make that mistake and you can make that mistake with the greatest of ease. It's the easiest mistake to make because nothing else is done in the modern university except make this mistake. They don't educate â€“ they make that mistake. Modern education is really the art and science of making the mistake of too steep, too quick, before anybody has learned anything about it. For instance, I've seen German taught with ferocity and velocity and the next thing you know, we were learning all about Schiller, whoever the hell he was. \"What's Schiller, where are we? How come?\" \"Well, that's just in the lesson text. See, that's the fourth week's lesson text.\" \"Yeah, wait a minute. What happened to the alphabet?\" Nobody can read a German alphabet in the â€“ that's used only to English Alphabets. You can't read one of those Gothic Alphabets. It's just gobbledygook! Looks like bird tracks! [laughter] Well, all right, you're going to teach somebody about the nuances of Schiller, are you? When it doesn't even look like words on a page! He's not yet convinced there are words on the page, you see? He thinks the printer spilled some ink. He thinks his book has been damaged. Nobody bothers to teach him the German alphabet. Where was he supposed to learn it? We look in vain for where he was supposed to learn the German alphabet, because it's not any part of the syllabus of that course. Ah, but it's German 1; where the hell is German 0? Well, they must assume that that must have been in your last life. So, you can make with the greatest of ease the mistake of entering a gradient too high. A multimillion pound activity was carried on in Africa teaching a number of tribes down there \"Soil Erosion: The Techniques of Preserving Soil and Preventing Erosion.\" Par-liament up here was just appropriating money, along with peanuts, and so forth. It was back in the days when we were all comrades. And they were appropriating money for these ground-nuts â€“ peanuts to you Americans â€“ which never grew and nobody could do anything with them after they'd grown them because there was other things they did it with, see? Same time they were pouring this flood of money, as a support program to groundnuts â€“ they got into soil preservation and preventing soil erosion. And they poured the money into this and they poured people down there and they had people in an airlift going down to Central Africa to solve these staggering and fantastic problems they were having in trying to teach these natives how to not erode soil. And the native was taking this in just about the way oil takes in water. I'm sure he was being polite and gentlemanly about listening but brother, he was really paying no attention."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 6 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 128 MCSC And it took a Scientologist in the middle of the program to straighten it out. He did it with gradients which we already knew about. He just decided that the government had cut in too late. The native didn't have any reason to not erode soil. Well, there was all of Africa full of soil â€“ how come we were preserving it? It seemed to be the most bountiful substance he ever had anything to do with. And this dropped back to the fact that he had no idea of future. So this Scientologist sat down patiently and ran around and wrote them up something that they used in the program and one has never heard about it since, so it must have been very successful. No more billions are being promoted in that direction anyway. Just this: That you had to teach the native that there was such a thing as the future and that his future welfare of his children and tribe depended to a large degree on his still having pastures to graze and areas to grow things in. And they taught them this very carefully and considerable enthusiasm greeted soil erosion. Now, you very often make a mistake in a Comm Course when you find a new student comes into that Comm Course and you are teaching him this and you're teaching him that and you're teaching him this drill and you're teaching him that drill and he doesn't know how to sit in a chair, man. Now, you could go more fundamentally than this â€“ you could go more fun-damental â€“ maybe he didn't know why he was there. Maybe he came in by mistake. Maybe he still has some weird idea about how come he's there. Now you're teaching him a Comm Course. Well, you're not teaching a Comm Course to anybody that's there, so our basic gradi-ent on education is to get somebody there. That sounds too simple but almost every elemen-tary teacher in the world is making that mistake today. They are teaching children who aren't there. And you'll find the most marvelous increases in IQ and learning rate take place under that very, very funny simplicity and most of their big educational strides made with Scientol-ogy are simply based on that one little tiny factor of getting the student there. Well now, they don't know what they're doing, some of these teachers. They think they're doing something esoteric or wonderful when they tell the student class â€“ when they tell the class each morning to \"Look at the front wall, look at the back wall and look at the ceiling and look at the floor.\" Maybe they're doing it \"because Ron said so,\" but it seems to work and this seems to have a great deal of workability and the children all appear to have an enormous increase in intelligence even though this is only used for five or ten minutes each morning. Well, that's quite marvelous if it's only used for five or ten minutes each morning be-cause the process obviously isn't run long enough to even get into the zone of having to be flattened. Nothing is going to happen here to a case to amount to anything. What they haven't noticed before is that the children weren't there to be taught and of course they look more in-telligent if they are there. Try and run an IQ test on somebody who is not sitting at the desk taking one. So, actually this is completely aside from the ramifications of havingness and other factors that would be involved in this â€“ that first step is just to get somebody there. That's the first step. Now, maybe in a Central Organization somebody up in the Academy may be saying to himself, \"Well, the Letter Registrar already got the person here. Getting the person here is"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 7 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 129 MCSC the duty of the Letter Registrar. The person came in to take the course, didn't he? Well, the Letter Registrar was supposed to have written him letters, so obviously, then, the person is there.\" I've already had this explained to me. Do you see the rationale? No, they've got a body in class. They've got a body in class. Now, why the person is actually there? They don't know that. Well, the fads hit this course. Yeah, once in a blue moon we'll have a new fad â€“ not once in a blue moon either â€“ everybody will get on a fad thing. For a while, a year or two ago, I've forgotten exactly when it was, \"the problem they solved by coming to Saint Hill\" was in vogue and for a while, why, everybody was just making marvelous TA and gorgeous case gains and so forth â€“ \"the problem they solved by coming to Saint Hill.\" \"What did coming to Saint Hill solve as a problem for you?\" See? And then they would run this out and they'd square it up and it's marvelous, and so forth. And I don't believe I ever thought about it very much, but my laughter on this situation would be based on this very elementary fact: That they weren't really running a Problems Process at all, see? They were simply making the per-son aware of the fact that they had arrived at Saint Hill. So, we don't do that anymore because we've got a little checksheet which goes in and out and is sometimes skipped and sometimes put back in again, which has to do with getting the person to go around and spot the locations of everything around here, see? We take care of it with a little checksheet. They're supposed to get this and supposed to get that and they're supposed to look over this and supposed to that, don't you see? So, there is a Touch Assist familiarity, so that â€“ that wipes out two things: the vast mystery of where they have arrived at and the fact that they have arrived. So, your first gradient in education is to get somebody there. It doesn't much matter how you solve it. I have shown you here â€“ get the little kids in school to spot the ceiling and spot the teacher and spot the floor and so forth. You've got them there now and they respond by appearing to be far more intelligent than they were before, so you say, \"Well, look at the tremendous IQ gain this gives.\" No, nobody is smart where he is not. All right, so there â€“ there is the idea of education by gradient and the â€“ repeat â€“ the mistake you can make in education by gradient is a big mistake and that is: failure to undercut the gradient, failure to get simple enough, failure to get the primary action. You must get the starting action that the person can be made sure of so that he can then go on to another action and become sure of that and go on to another action that he becomes sure of, you see? Well, now if you haven't ever gotten a low enough or simple enough first action for the person to become sure of, then the person advancing into the next zone finds that very, very complex and starts to feel sort of spinny and then the instructor starts going mad trying to explain to this student what this is all about â€“ this step two, see? Well, he has never gotten to step one and from there on his education is a complete mish-mash. And if you want to un-scramble anybody's difficulties with training, and so forth, then you will just have to find the gradient that they overlooked or skipped or missed, after which they entered into a confusion. And this would be very easy to find on an E-Meter, extremely easy on an E-Meter and that is simply: the E-Meter would register an early moment of confusion about study or train-ing and it would register it repeatedly, that is two or three times if it's never been resolved. It"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 8 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 130 MCSC would only go flick, or something like that if it had existed and then been resolved, you see? There would just be the residual charge left on the time track. But if it's repetitively reading, if it reads several times and seems to read very strongly as he discusses it â€“ gives you in other words tone arm action â€“ why, then you know that it has never been resolved to this day. Now, the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden for-ward with them into the present. Those are the difficulties that have to be treated and han-dled â€“ the difficulties which they have had in the past which have ridden forward to them into the present. You can always get a registry on a difficulty somebody has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the time track as having had a difficulty. But if it is not riding for-ward with him into the present, you are simply using auditing to contact it again and it will blow. It won't restimulate particularly, it usually just blows. For instance, if you have had somebody get a deep, a very heavy surge, let me put it this way â€“ if you get somebody got a â€“ get a heavy surge on a meter in a session, you can ac-tually put them back into that moment of the session when they got the surge and you will get some ghost of that surge. That's not riding forward with them in the present time. You actu-ally took them back into the past to find the surge. But you can get that surge back again be-cause what you did was get the impression it made on the session. You didn't get the original reading â€“ that blew. But then the fact that it did do this in the session is still a matter of record which can be picked up. So therefore, accordingly, you could go back into the time track of an individual and you could get an emotional reaction for everything a person had ever been emotional about. Or you could get heavy reactions â€“ it isn't that the reactions are necessarily heavy or soft â€“ but you could get reactions about what a person has been emotional about that he is still emo-tional about. Now, get the slight difference here. One is simply the impression on the time track of having been emotional. Well, you'll get a â€“ you'll get a needle read on that. And the other one is a moment on the time track when he has been emotional that he is still emotional about. The thing has never been cleared up, in other words. And the difference between those two reactions is one will fade instantly, the first one â€“ he has simply been emotional about some-thing; he is not still emotional about that thing, that's long since gone, you will simply get the whooh on the needle â€“ that needle's going to move, just contacting the earliest point or the point when it occurred, see, you are going to get a needle reaction. But the other thing that you're going to run into, if it is still current, it will repeat. It doesn't blow through just being contacted â€“ it now repeats and you can get more repeat. Well, that means it has ridden forward in time and has never been resolved. I just make this point to you. As an auditor you are only interested in those things which the individual has never resolved. You're not interested in just those things which he didn't resolve. You get the shadow of a difference between? He didn't resolve it, so what? He never did find out how to get along with his commanding officer, but â€“ he never did â€“ but it's not riding forward in time with him. It isn't even capable of being restimulated, therefore it will read once and go bvop and it flattens; see, it's right now, it's out. Now, you could revivify him or regress him to that moment in time and start running him through incidents which are"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 9 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 131 MCSC not in restimulation and oddly enough you could get some built up that would go into res-timulation. As an auditor you have considerable power over the mind, you see, you can do some interesting things with it. So, there's two reactions here that you are interested in: There's the reaction that simply was there and isn't bothering the fellow â€“ it hasn't ridden forward in time with him, but you can get him back to it and it reacts on the meter; and the other action is one that has not only been active at the time but is active now without any difficulty whatsoever. You don't have to go back in time to find this thing. It's going to react right away and the only meter difference that you will see between those two reactions is that one, the one which is still with him and is riding forward in time with him, and so forth, that one is repetitively reading. It will read and it will read again and it will read and it will read again, you see? When you are checking out things you have to make sure that you've got something that will repeat. One of the main faults that you make in R6 is that you do not ever ask for the repeat read. Well, I wouldn't give you two nickels and a collar button, anytime, ever, for a one-read checkout â€“ achto! Now, do you see why? Is maybe you checked it earlier and it read. Well, when you check it again, you might get the earlier read, you might get the moment in the session when it read before. Do you understand? So you are only interested in a read that will repeat itself. Reads that don't repeat themselves have either blown, or they haven't ridden forward in time, anyhow, so the devil with them. If you can't get something to read twice, skip it. If you can make it read twice, realize that it's riding forward with the pc and is therefore worrying him. Still worrying him to this day. Now, all of this is necessary technology, as elementary as that may be, that's necessary technology to an understanding of how you would locate somebody's early confusions with regard to an educational subject. Because of course he was confused; he was confused every time he attacked a new point on the gradient, but he unconfused afterwards. The meter will still register those moments of first confusion, but they will register as only onces, so they're not important. This, then, I have to tell you so that you can see and evaluate the observation. And then you get used to this and then you get some subjective reality on it, you realize what I am telling you is true. \"Yes! Oh, he was very confused the first time he looked at the letter 'A.' He didn't know what that was â€“ that was â€“ yeah.\" Well, you get a read â€“ one shot, see? You get a small read there on the needle, the needle moved. \"What about the confusion about the alphabet?\" \"Yeah, the letter 'A'.\" Whoom! â€“ the needle moves and you say, \"All right, now about the letter 'A',\" and there is no motion. He isn't still confused about \"A.\" But let's take this bird now and we say, \"What about the letter 'A'?\" and it goes whoompf! Now it's done it once. \"What about 'A'!?\" Whoompf! \"Well, how about â€“ how about â€“ can you tell me something more about being disturbed about this formation of the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 10 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 132 MCSC letter 'A?\" Whoompf! Now, you suddenly realize this bird can't write, see? You just â€“ from your various observations of the pc, you've suddenly remembered having observed this, see? You didn't need the observation until that moment, but this guy can't write. Well, you want to clean up his writing. Well, let's find out what underlay that confusion. Now, ARC must have preceded all misemotion and bad reactions. You don't have a bad reaction unless there has been ARC in the first place. There's got to have been ARC with something in order to make a bad action occur. You've heard me say that often enough. Well, all right, how about this â€“ how about this confusion? Do you address the confusion in itself? No, it's just sort of an out-of-ARC subject. It's never the confusion that the person is supposed to be in, by himself and the Instructor and that's why education breaks down. Now, let's go over that again. It's not the confusion that the student is trying to learn and the Instructor is trying to teach him. If they are having any difficulty with that at all, then that's a guarantee that it isn't the right confusion. You can just chalk that up with a great big red mark. Student can't learn it â€“ you follow me? We're talking now about a heavy reaction here, not just a little old light brush-over â€“ the student can't learn it, and the Instructor can't get it through the student's head. Now, what are we looking at? We are looking at a lower point on the gradient which was skipped, getting back to what we were talking about in the first place. Here's this point on the gradient that he didn't master and then went on to the next point. With that next point he had enough confusion to cause him to be overwhelmed and he never did get that point. And when you look it over on the meter, that's the point you're going to get. You're not going to get the original point â€“ you're going to get the next point on the gradient. So, one of the sneakers that made this very difficult to solve was the fact that the thing the student is apparently having trouble with is never the thing the student is having trouble with. And you can save yourself a great many Instructor hours if you recognize that and get a good grasp on that, in actual fact. Now this, of course, follows the pattern of the mind, doesn't it? If the pc knows what is worrying him and if he is worrying then â€“ if he's worrying â€“ then that isn't what he's worried about. See, we know that. If you know all about what's wrong with you, that isn't what's wrong with you, brother, because of course, that would as-is and cease to be wrong with you. That's elementary, see? So, this applied to education gives us this other weird look â€“ that this same set of data applies in the field of training. And what the student is very confused about and unable to move forward into and what the Instructor can't seem to teach this student is not then the right point of address for instruction. That must then immediately, just by that adjudication, that must be the wrong point of address. And the Instructor just pulls off of that and takes a better, longer look at this situation. See, that's elementary, see? Let me give you an example â€“ this becomes â€“ this is terribly elementary, very, very simple stuff. You can very easily overlook it: one, very easily not credit that this has got this much jolt in it. I know an Instructor in a slight state of shock at some of the results that he's suddenly getting applying some of this material, you see, on a student. \"And did you know...?\" You know, that sort of thing â€“ didn't realize it was that strong. A Theory Instructor is checking out a student on a bulletin and gets to paragraph three and decides the student"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 11 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 133 MCSC can't pass it. But the student has been having such a dreadful time that the Theory Instructor decides that this student had better have a little bit of instruction. He's not going to give him a pass on this but he just â€“ quite ordinary â€“ he's just tired of having him foul up on this particu-lar point. The student there can't ever seem to get beyond this point, see? So he says, \"Now-now-now-look, look-look-look-now. Can you get the idea that bla-bla-bla-bla,\" and he takes up, you see, the third paragraph. And the student gets all foggy, and the Instructor says, \"Now, just a minute. Let's see, how can I put this a little simpler? How can I put it a little eas-ier?\" See, the Instructor actually is reaching in the right direction, but he's still staying on what the student is supposed to be confused about, that's the mistake he's making. \"But how can I get this a little simpler? Now, how can I get it a little lower on the gradient?\" Now this student can't get it and the Instructor can't teach him. Now, the first thing you should know at once is that we're one or more steps beyond what the student was really confused about. Now, it goes this elementary; you then go back and find what word in the second paragraph â€“ which obviously has been handsomely passed â€“ the student didn't understand. And it may not be a Scientology word at all. It may be some common English word, just like that. And all of a sudden, why, the student says, \"Oh.\" You see, this is not prior in time just because it's the earlier paragraph in the bulletin, it just happens that bulletins happen to be written more or less on a gradient. That's why you get the apparency of the earlier moment then. But they've actually gotten to this point then and they didn't grasp the lower point of the gradient, so the upper point of the gradient is just bvuuurrr! And the moment they get into this upper point of the gradient it's, \"God! \" You know? And the walls are getting closer and there's little bright spots appearing in front of their eyes and they feel sort of headachy. It's physiological. It's no wonder the French over there â€“ of course in a harder time, during Napoleonic times we could have said, \"Who cares how many Frenchmen get killed?\" do you see â€“ but today we shouldn't have that calloused attitude and we ought to do something about the French educational system because they drive more students to suicide than you could easily count. They're specialists, specialists at making students commit suicide. The American uni-versity leads in as a close second. They just disgrace the fellow and send him down to skid row, if he errs. If they've made the mistake of too fast a gradient, then they condemn the fel-low. Crazy! You get how severe this is. This gets into â€“ here is another salient point, I should not just interject in here, but I should give you full blast, is: Study can produce a physiological reaction and it can produce some pleasant ones and it can produce some confoundedly unpleasant ones. You can have some of the wildest physical reactions just from the fact of study that you care to have any-thing to do with. And this isn't just studying Scientology, man, this is studying how to paint barns â€“ and it's not for nothing some student will be sitting there at his drawing board or something like that and he'll be getting more and more â€“ he'll be getting more and more and more and more spinny, and he feels sort of weird and he's making himself spots in front of the eyes. And he's making himself sick trying to study any further. And of course, if he's being pressured forward against time, for a final examination, he cannot sit back and go for a walk"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 12 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 134 MCSC in the park, he can't do anything like that. He's got to sit there and wrap the towel around his head, don't you see, and swill up the coffee and of course he's just keying himself in like mad, he's tearing himself to pieces, and so forth. It's no wonder. Well, what is the trouble with him at that moment when all this happens? Well, the trouble with him is not what he is studying, it's what he has failed to study, just before. This is always his hang-up. When you get a physiological reaction you've got a skip on the gradient, that you can be absolutely certain of. You've skipped the gradient. You are all of a sudden going into something or other, and you are studying how to lay sticks of wood across a path in order to subdivide the thing and measure it up to be concreted or the number of grains of po-tassium bichromate that you're supposed to pour in if it is a British manufacturer as opposed to American manufacturer and you say, \"What's this?\" Now, it isn't just a missing datum. Don't get that idea, see? It isn't a missing datum. It's something on the subject of the mixture of chemicals or â€“ see, it can be an analogous â€“ it can be an allied subject where a more fundamental datum is or exists on... See, the gradient was skipped on an allied subject, see â€“ or it was just the paragraph ahead of this in the text. See, it's not always the paragraph ahead of this in the text. Sometimes the fellow all these years has wondered, \"How do you really measure something when it's of irregular shape?\" you see? And, \"How-h-ow-ha-h-o-w?\" And then all of a sudden he's got this thrown in his teeth, you see? \"Well you measure out this concrete walk and you so forth and so forth and now the calculus which is superannuated on this sub-ject, is so on...\" and he's trying to understand the calculus â€“ he's trying to understand the cal-culus â€“ and trying to understand the cal â€“ . There's nothing wrong with the calculus. He doesn't know how to measure a walk â€“ and he's been keyed in by some sentence that went right along with what he thinks he's wor-ried about. It's right there next door â€“ only it's a blank. And you know, the whole subject goes blank? The whole surrounding area goes blank. It's like you shoot the top off one skyscraper and the whole town disappears. I mean it's that peculiar a phenomenon, see? You say, \"Well, how could that whole page disappear?\" You know, or \"How could that whole textbook disappear?\" If a student is having very heavy going he will have words vanish off the page. I just had an experience a very, very short time ago; I was trying to look up a word in the dictionary that was included on a page which I was having a hard time coming to grips with, and you know, the word had disappeared out of the column and I said, \"Come off it now, it couldn't possibly be missing out of this column. It must be in this dictionary!\" And â€“ specialized dictionary, and so forth, and I just sort of gritted my teeth and concentrated me eyeballs on it and, by George, it was right there. And, you know, it hadn't been in the column a moment before? [laughter] In this particular instance, I however, know what I don't quite understand, I know what I have skipped doing and I've got to go ahead and do something about it, because it's just get-ting more and more and more into my road. I do not know so that I can bark them off, the complementary absorbing colors by rote. I can't tell you every color combination which ab-"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 13 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 135 MCSC sorbs every component of white light, except one, you see? That sounds very complex, does-n't it? It is! But it's this kind of an action. But going on and studying beyond this point, which I went ahead and did, because I just didn't sit down and figure out a color wheel and get it all down within an inch of its life â€“ it's lost back there. See? I crowded on past it. Now, somewhere in the vicinity of that is a non-comprehend. I have got that bit of noncomprehend pretty well spotted but that isn't what I'm studying now and that isn't what I'm having trouble with. I'm actually running into a point where things are disappearing off a page, much less headaches. But just going beyond this, beyond this â€“ well, there's something back in that area. It is very easy and so on, but nobody has made one of these wheels; there isn't an illustration of one which gives it by complemen-tary colors in this textbook. And there are no wheels that give you primary colors in terms of what absorbs \"not them\" from white light, see? What absorbs \"not them.\" No list of what doesn't absorb them, so that would sort of have to be compiled and I'd have to sit down and draw this whole thing, I'd have to memorize all of these points of the thing and then I know I would have it straight. And about that time when I started to do this, something would fly up and hit me in the teeth like, \"What the hell is cyan?\" see? \"What's this cyan? What shade is cyan? I always thought cyan was blue, obviously it is not blue. I have all my life been told by medical exam-iners that when you fed somebody cyanide they turn blue and...\" See, here is a big bunch of confusion going on here and there is probably some foolish word like that kicking around in that area someplace, so I'll just have to go back and look over this area, because I know when it began, you see? That is I know the point that occurred before it began. See, you can get clever enough to spot where are you at. And all you have to ask your-self or all you have to ask a student, \"Where weren't you having trouble? Now where are you having trouble? Good. It's at the end of where you weren't having trouble.\" See, that's very simple, isn't it? So the formula is that you find out where the student wasn't having trouble with the subject and that meant that he had gone that far on the gradient successfully. And then find out where he began having trouble and you pick it up right at the tag end of where he wasn't having trouble and it lies in that immediate area. You can actually circumscribe it within a few words. I mean, you can do it that precisely. You can pinpoint. You'll have the half a paragraph that it's in or you'll have â€“ sometimes you can get it down to the half a sen-tence that it is in and then you start plowing it out. But don't expect the student to be able to tell you exactly what it is that he is having trouble with, because that's why he is having trou-ble with it. So, instruction would consist of guiding a student along a gradient of known data. It wouldn't be inventing new solutions to the student's confusions. You start inventing new solu-tions to a student's confusion, you're just going to get in more and more trouble. Why? Be-cause you are already giving him â€“ he has already got something he doesn't comprehend, now you're going to give him an incomprehensible that solves it. Good instruction is a system of backtracking. A student will go forward â€“ you can al-most leave that on automaticity. He will go forward like a shot bear. Zarroom! He'll go into a subject. And all of a sudden you'll hear these â€“ you'll hear this loud screak and the paws are"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 14 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 136 MCSC smoking, you see? Then you hear a thud you know? And then you feel the atmosphere around you shake. There's something happened. Well, exactly what did happen? Well, he went right over the top of one point on the gradient, thought he understood it, didn't understand it, went into the next point of the gradi-ent and ran into a brick wall. So the trouble with him is, it wasn't the next point on the gradi-ent, the trouble with him was that last point on the gradient that he thought he understood, but didn't. So therefore, it becomes very difficult with a student sometimes to spot this, because he's so positive that he understood that last point. Yet the evidence that he didn't is sitting in front of your eyes: He's having trouble with the next point. See, this fellow says, \"Oh, I learned how to sit in a chair, I learned how to sit in a chair.\" You're teaching a Comm Course, see? \"I learned how to sit in a chair. I know all about that. It's sitting in a chair and looking at somebody in front of me that is absolutely impossi-ble! That's terrible! I can't do it anymore!\" You say, \"Well, let's see.\" Here â€“ here's... In the absence of this technology, one's re-action might have been, \"Well, let's see, how can I fix up a drill here to get him to look at that student?\" Now, you see how that would lay an egg and extend his training? See? \"Now, how can I figure out something whereby he can confront this bird?\" Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah â€“ this is not â€“ you are at the wrong point of the gradient, see? Here's just a practical application. You say, \"Well now, it's about sitting in a chair, see, that was â€“ wasn't that the drill you had immediately before you had the drill of confronting the pc? Wasn't that the drill, huh, wasn't that the drill?\" \"Well, there was a little thing that came in between there,\" he suddenly remembers. \"What was that?\" \"Well, that was sit in the chair comfortably and of course that's impossible.\" \"Oh, oh, there was something else in this thing.\" \"Yeah, well, anybody can sit in a chair, actually you can force yourself to sit in a chair for hours.\" \"Well, how do you go about sitting in a chair?\" \"Well, you sit in the chair and you bring your heels together, you understand? And if you bring your heels together hard enough and press them in, you can press the calves of your legs out against the outer sides of the chair and you can keep yourself awake and erect.\" What the hell is all this? See, knowing the principle of undercut on the gradient, you see, you would find that out. But if you didn't know the principle you would just keep knocking your brains out, trying to train this person how to confront another human being. And they haven't â€“ they actually wouldn't have any trouble confronting somebody else except they are trying to confront two things at once. They are confronting keeping their heels together and they're... See, they ha-ven't learned how to do that and now they're trying to confront something else at the same time. Their attention is split and they are starting to get very headachy. And then you find out"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 15 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 137 MCSC there's something wild about it they haven't understood, like: \"Well, why do you audit in a chair?\" \"Why? How should you audit?\" \"Well, couldn't you audit lying in a bed? I get very tired auditing.\" You see? All kinds of wild little things come up. You don't pay very much attention to what they've got to do. You don't try to solve those things. But these considerations have got to get into the fresh air. Now, all of a sudden we've got this fellow â€“ he suddenly looks this over: \"Oh, you mean you just sit in a chair? Oh, you â€“ oh, wait a minute, that takes some doing! Oh! What do you mean, just sit in a chair? Just sit in a chair! No, you can't just sit in a chair! Impossible!\" \"All right. Now, just tell me what's impossible about it.\" You don't even have to be an auditor to instruct, see? I mean you don't have to do a lot of clever auditing: \"What's so im-possible about it? What's impossible about it?\" \"Keeping your back two-and-a-half inches from the back of the chair, and so forth, is impossible because you have to keep â€“ well, actually, you have to keep measuring if it's two-and-a-half inches, don't you?\" [laughter] It's pretty hard to believe until it has happened to you, but the whole next paragraph after the sentence which contained the word one didn't understand, can just disappear right out of this world. It can do the wildest piece of disappearing anybody ever saw. It just van-ishes. Almost a white piece of blank page and try to check the student out on this and you can check him out on the whole bulletin, but, by George, there's no paragraph there; no subject matter there of any kind whatsoever. You run that back, you'll find out there's something just prior to that collision they didn't understand. And if they didn't understand that with great vio-lence then you must realize that it's just before that; and you start running some student back, I don't know quite where you're going to wind up. Well, I wouldn't try to wind up outside this lifetime, but I don't know quite where you would wind up. Become interesting what would go on. Now, there's the primary mechanism of study. A study is a con... a study â€“ I almost used a five-dollar word â€“ I will use a five-dollar word â€“ is a concatenation of certainties. It's a string of certainties. And these are a string of confidences and competences. There are many, many ways to promote these feelings of competence and confidence, and so forth, but the best way to do it is just a head-on thing of just making sure â€“ not that the student walks slowly, but to make sure that the student walks certainly. Don't hold somebody back because you're not sure he's walking certainly. The other point is, is always let a student get into trouble before you help him out. Don't ever help out a student before he's in trouble. This guy is doing his Comm Course drills right straight through to the bitter end, he does them like a little wound up doll, everything is beautiful and smooth and so forth, well, what are you trying to do â€“ find something to train? I mean, what are you going to do, rack this guy over until you can find something â€“ till you create something that can be wrong? Or why would you â€“ why would you do anything with"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 16 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 138 MCSC it? See, I'm just making the point: Why would you do anything with this? Your participation is not invited there by any difficulty. You see, why worry? And that is one of the reasons why study uniformly spread across a group is a mistake. See? Students run into trouble that the Instructor doesn't detect and other students aren't run-ning into trouble and they just try to make a medium average of trouble for the whole course, the whole class, you see? Well, the way to do is to let a student run into all the brick walls he wants to run into and the only thing you've got to be alert for is a student who has run into a brick wall. Now, when he has run into the brick wall, recognize that he has hit a gradient, hit a stage or a point beyond where he didn't understand something; that elementary. And the next must is: Don't ever take up with him what he doesn't understand. It's a waste of trouble â€“ waste of time. He doesn't know what he doesn't understand. Always cut it back. \"What were you studying immediately ahead of this?\" Same formula I gave you before, \"What moment there weren't you in trouble?\" \"Oh, I wasn't in trouble over this and that, and so forth, that was all easy.\" \"All right, what moment did you get into trouble on it?\" \"Oh well, it's â€“ oh-oh-oh â€“ terrible and terrible and terrible, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...\" \"All right.\" Now, you've made a bracket there, haven't you, you've got parentheses; you've got the point of no trouble and you've got the point of trouble and now you must recognize that in the dead center, between, you will find the real trouble. Now, the clever Instructor, knowing this, could spot it right on out. Actually he doesn't have to be terribly clever, but it's a matter of \"All right, you say you were doing fine with this bulletin right up to this,\" and we finally spot it. I would even go so far, if I were having a lot of trouble, to slam the guy on the meter. Meters are made to be used. And I'd say, \"Now, you're doing all right on this first paragraph, you're doing all right on the next paragraph and you say you ran into trouble here about para-graph five. Well, let me look at paragraph five; yeah, there is a typographical error there in paragraph five. That's perfectly correct, there is one. Now, let's see, you had number four â€“ number four, you didn't have any trouble with number four, paragraph four here, which starts so-and-so and so-and-so; you say you didn't have any trouble with that?\" \"No, no, I didn't have a bit of trouble with that.\" \"All right, now let's see, let's get down toward the end of paragraph four â€“ paragraph four here; now, will you please listen to this sentence: 'So-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so...' clang! What is the meaning of the word 'disability'?\" \"Oh, well, Christ! Nobody could define 'disability'!\" [laughter] You got the idea? It isn't even that any big mental quirk sits behind it. No vast amount of case has to be taken into it. He just doesn't dig this word, man! Why he doesn't dig it, we don't even care, but he doesn't."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 17 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 139 MCSC Now, what's very interesting is this is one of the first points of research, 1947, is the influence of a mislearned word on a life and that was the point of research. I'd picked up some of this from Commander Thompson on association of words and there are numerous other things about this, but I had jumped to an unreasonable assumption about this. As far as I was concerned it was relatively provable or unprovable, but it was relatively nowhere. They talked about association, they talked about this, they talked about that. Then I assumed, \"Then it must be that a word will make somebody sick.\" Well, what could be wrong with a word? So I started tracing backwards and getting people to redefine words and that sort of thing. I won't say I had any remarkable luck because there was no auditing technology that went along with it, but believe me people were sure interested. I wasn't using any method of testing at that particular moment that would have given me what the result was if it was. I lost a lot of people I was working with. I know that's a direct result. That is to say, they walked out and went back to work, and so forth, and didn't turn up in my office anymore. But that still didn't demonstrate very much for that period, because it wasn't well followed up. I didn't have somebody on a telephone to call them all up and say, \"Well, why didn't you come back the next week?\" You know? But those that I did contact on the thing, \"Oh, I feel fine now,\" or \"You know, it's really something else that's worrying me these days, it's the fact that I haven't got a job in Mexico,\" or something, you know? Certainly what was worrying them ceased to worry them, that was about the only thing I established out of it. Now, we find GPMs and the tremendous mass and significance mixed up with those and we must assume then, that all significances expressed as symbols â€“ words, that is all sig-nificances expressed as words, which of course are a symbol of a significance â€“ are locks on the GPMs. We know what's at the middle of this hurricane now. Now, we walk back and we take a look at this thing and we are going to find out that any word that you handle which is not in the GPMs is in actual fact to some degree a lock on the GPMs. And if not on actual GPMs, certainly on implants. They got the best of all worlds cov-ered. Very heavy locks, capable of producing a considerable amount of commotion in some-body's skull piece. Your skull bone could throb for quite a time. See? So when you got a â€“ when you get yourself a â€“ when you get yourself a good look at this, you recognize then that this is a symbological effort and one of the first reactions is simply become afraid of all words; then the next immediate action after that is to â€“ well, to say, \"To hell with it,\" and be-come very stupidly adventurous about it; then eventually fall back into something sensible, like don't stand around and chant a known end word at somebody's face for half an hour. Not that you will do much to them, they might be stuck elsewhere on the track, but you certainly louse yourself up. [laughs] So, when we â€“ when we examine this broad subject of teaching somebody something, we are examining the subject of relaying data to a person, which he can receive and under-stand in such a way that he will be able to use the data â€“ the definition I gave you the other day just stated to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now â€“ and of course all of those are being done with words â€“ words, motions, actions or examples. But there's some words mixed up in this."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 18 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 140 MCSC So, when you get words on a bulletin, when you get words on an Instructor's comm line, when your words are going over to one of your students, well, don't be so sensitive about the Scientology vocabulary because, listen, you can make as much catastrophe in not naming a distinctly different part as you can in naming one too complexly. I ran into an example of this in this parallel course of study: \"Basic lighting\" and \"ba-sic profile lighting\" and I got toward the end of the book on portrait lighting with which I'd had terrible trouble. All the way through I was just running into trouble on this thing, trou-ble â€“ trouble and somehow or another getting through and getting it crosswise and getting it straightened out, and so forth. And I found out the sin there was that they had called two dis-tinctly different things with the same word, \"basic.\" And I was called upon, I said, \"Now wait a minute\" I said to myself, \"before I take this exam, I better review what I've got here. The â€“ let's see, there's three types of lighting, and one of them is Rembrandt and one of them is but-terfly and one of them is... I can't think of it! Now let's see, let's go over this again,\" and then I remembered that all the way through I had sort of dimly been... this is just different patterns, positions in which you put lights, not to hang you up on those things. Fancy names, aren't they? Rembrandt and butterfly: makes a butterfly because when the nose comes down it leaves a little shadow underneath the nose and you could imagine it to be a butterfly, see? [laughter] And when the photographic lighting makes a little shadow underneath the nose, why the pro calls it butterfly lighting. And Rembrandt is the face plane nearest the camera is less lighted than the face planes further from the camera but not line lighting â€“ but this one is less lighted. It's very pretty â€“ very pretty lighting, but those are â€“ there are not very many â€“ there are not very many ways you can put lights together. Here's these two; and what's the other one? What's the other one? I can't think of it, what's the other one, you know? Oh, well, I'll go back and study it over again, so I study it very, very carefully, study it all the way through, study it, study it, look it over, now I've got it all, I've gone back, good. \"Now, there's three kinds of lighting there. Wait â€“ Rembrandt and butterfly and... where did it go?\" I look down into me head, have I got a 'ole in me skull these days? And finally I said, \"There's something very funny going on here,\" because I didn't quite know anything like at that mo-ment, because I was studying study, I didn't know the power that a messed-up definition could have, you know? And I went back and I looked and I looked and I looked and I looked and I looked and I finally found what it was. It's â€“ there's a whole school of lighting, a whole system of lighting, known as basic lighting. It's just elementary lighting. You've got two lights and you shine one on the front of the being and you shine the other one on the side. That's all! And the ways you do that and the way his head is turned or shoulders are turned, while you're doing that, gives you this whole school of lighting. There's nothing fancy about it. The other two are the fancy lightings, but this one, which you simply â€“ almost says, \"Turn light on the subject,\" I couldn't get and that was because under butterfly lighting there is a type of lighting, called \"basic profile light-ing,\" which everybody realizes is a butterfly lighting, but all professional photographers call \"basic profile.\" So, under butterfly lighting we have a kind of lighting called basic profile, but over here, under this other, this whole class of lighting is called basic lighting. And because they hadn't sufficiently had a differentiation in their nomenclature, they didn't have enough terms in other words â€“ louse up, total confusion, see?"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 19 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 141 MCSC Well, that was the Instructors' confusion that was the people who were teaching you's confusion, because you obviously were going to fall into that trap. They just dug a pit, put a stake at the bottom of it and covered it up with leaves, man. And you've got one right now. Now, prepare for a little line charge. You've got an in-sufficiency of nomenclature. I know you'd never dream you had, but if you figure how many things there are in the mind that you â€“ that you already have, you realize there's not much nomenclature for it. When you realize the few little things in the mind that the medicos had and the vast array of nomenclature; we've got a tremendous number of parts and things in the mind and not much nomenclature. And actually we don't have enough nomenclature and that would be the last sin in the world you'd think you would accuse Dianetics and Scientology of, but it's true. And you will agree with me in just about a split instant. There is a thing called an ARC break assessment and there's a bypassed charge as-sessment and hardly one of you monkeys have ever been able to tell the two apart or do either one of them. And I've lately watched you falling and falling in more pits and walk into more bear traps on this one subject than you can shake a stick at. Because a bypassed charge as-sessment is not an assessment. It's an auditing by list and the name of it should be \"Auditing by Bypassed Charge Lists\" or \"Auditing by List for Bypassed Charge.\" It's not an assessment. Now, you've begun to believe, you see, that an assessment is something that doesn't have anything to do with auditing and that's true. An ARC break assessment has nothing to do with auditing. You simply sit there and you reel it off, with your pc usually gritting his teeth to powder. And you finally see your meter react and you indicate the bypassed charge and you don't answer and you don't acknowledge and you jolly well had better not. If you value his sanity or yours on R6 material, you just sit there, man, and you reel this thing off and you find the bypassed charge and you indicate it right now. It's usually done in the middle of an ARC break. If you audit a person in an ARC break you will put him into a sad effect. So of course it can't be auditing! But unfortunately we have instantly, immediately afterwards, called a thing a bypassed charge assessment by which you take the same list but treat it differently and the person is not ARC broke when you have done it, so that is auditing. And this has been a source of enormous confusion to one and all, apparently. Why? Because both terms have the word \"assessment\" in them. So it's an inadequacy of nomencla-ture. There's a missing word, you follow? All right, so that's all the trouble you are having with regard to it. There isn't â€“ the trouble isn't any worse than that, see? You can see that you could audit â€“ auditing by list has to do with cleaning up each question, after all that's the Joburg and that's these things and you just read the question until it's clean. Read it and get it answered till it's clean and you go to the next one and you read it and answer until it's clean. Auditing by list. You can take the R6 list and you can do this with it. So, we had the same list, which gave a confusion and we had the same word attached to a process which gave a confusion, and so forth. So it's very, very hard, oddly enough now, to get auditors to do this. Well, that's funny, that it gets hard to get auditors to do this. There-fore, it must have a subtractive or a detractive action in excess of merely being misdefined."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 20 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 142 MCSC They couldn't do it; Auditing Supervisors were walking around in circles, \"Now, look! Please do an ARC break assessment on this pc, because he is blowing,\" and so forth. Come back, here is the fellow busy auditing by list, you know, doing a bypassed charge assessment, you know, cleaning up everything, listening to the pc, you know and so forth, all this sort of thing, you know? \"No, no, no!\" You know? \"Read the thing down the list and when you find the charge, and so forth, why, indicate it to the pc and that's all there is to this.\" \"Oh-oh, I see.\" So, in other words, a term can be confused by being used for two different distinct purposes. You could enter confusion then with not enough nomenclature. As a matter of fact it's probably, in the field of the mind, has been a more serious sin than too much nomencla-ture. Because the things were named in identification with one another. Do you follow me now? You've got this type of response? So of course, that will very shortly, as soon as I get around to pushing out a bulletin, that will very shortly become, of course: ARC break assess-ment is done so-and-so and so-and-so and not auditing; and then there's Auditing by List for Bypassed Charge and that becomes a completely different action. Now, you'll find out that's teachable. So, we've covered now two things here and these two things are: If you take a person up the gradient too steeply he will get lost at some step always because he is confused about the prior step and he will blame the step he is lost in, while being stuck, in actual fact, in the step he really didn't get out of â€“ , and that's what makes it a masked area and which makes it upset; and that the responsibility for the subjective reaction of the student in a very large measure lies with the Instructor. Boy, that is a new departure, see? The student's attitude, and so forth, is really today with Scientology and what I am teaching you here, right in the hands of the Instructor. If you want to, you can almost produce the mental reaction you want to at will. You could blow a student off a course. It would work both ways â€“ I'm not saying you'd do this, but this fellow is on course and you blow him off the course. You just with malice aforethought say, \"Well, all right, we're going to blow him off the course.\" One of the ways to do it is say, \"All right, now this is two people sitting in the chair there; they are actually both preclears and they are actually both at the same time auditors and there is no particular difference between the word 'auditor' and the word 'pc,' and so forth, and they really don't mean anything different at all. All right, very good. You got that straight now? Good.\" You won't have him there in about 24 hours, if he's green grass off the street. See what I mean? You could overtly produce that reaction. All right, now some guy is blowing and just as he leaves and you say, \"What word was it that I didn't get there?\" You will find out he'll stop moving, because you've already got part of the charge, see, just by indicating it's wrong with the words. All right, he'll stop exiting, in other words. \"Now let's trace it back. At what moment did you get confused?\" \"Well, it was in the last half-hour.\" \"Good, what happened in the first half-hour?\" see?"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 21 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 143 MCSC \"Oh, well, it was that word.\" \"Very good. All right, thank you very much.\" \"Oh, is that what that means?\" \"Yes.\" In other words, there's handling of the guy stays or the guy goes. There's the Instructor creating that effect or result with just the method of teaching he is using. Pretty sneaky, huh? You can get further along this line â€“ there's more to learn on this particular subject but that is â€“ but those things stand out like a beacon. The earlier gradient â€“ the earlier part of the gra-dient â€“ is the one he's fallen down on. Now, we get to the other section of it is â€“ it is really always a word or phrase. Now, of course a word or phrase can be inadequate. I've got one going right now. I â€“ nobody has both-ered to tell me why they use a yellow filter in a certain combination and in all the illustrations here sits this yellow filter. What is it doing there? What does it have to do with something?. I don't know. I haven't been told. I've not been demanded â€“ it's not been demanded of me: Why is a yellow filter there? But yet, that is serving as just a little bit break there. I know there is something about this I don't know. So, you see the sentence could be inexplicit or it could omit the data or accidentally deprive somebody of the information. A typographical error will do this. The word \"cat\" is missing in the sentence: \"The dog chased a.\" All right, now we say to the student, \"Now, all right, let's tell us what that action is.\" Well, he's confused. Well, you certainly don't have to go very far afield to find out what he's confused about. So, the fault actually could be with the text, as well as with the student, if the text is not explicit by reason of typographical error or by some other reason, and so forth, the infor-mation is not relayed to him in an explicit form, so then he gets confused. So, it isn't always his fault that he is confused, don't you see? You can sometimes take a hold of the text he's been studying and just take one glance at it and all of a sudden see that two paragraphs have been omitted out of it. They are the paragraphs that define somebody. You see, somebody made a mimeograph copy and didn't copy two paragraphs, you know? This corny. You see that all words in an auditing session are defined, except \"auditor\" and \"pc.\" This is liable to bring about a certain amount of confusion. So, the upshot of the thing is that your confusion is not necessarily the fault of the text, it's not necessarily the fault of the student. We're not trying to fix blame in this particular line. We're just showing you that there was something not understood. It might also have been the fault of his first grade teacher, see? She never told him what some little word like \"reciproc-ity\" meant, or something like this. And we've got â€“ we've got ourselves, then, a good look at this. It's treated on the basis of \"these are the factors which you must observe as an Instruc-tor.\" Now, you can put those things together. You can see why he didn't attain the gradient or you can ask him why he didn't. You can locate the point where he didn't move from one point of the gradient to the next point, you can isolate why he did this. We can see that nomenclature and other things could be responsible for this. Lack of definition could be responsible for this. We can see lack can be responsible for it as well as an"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 22 SHSBC-397 â€“ 6.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 144 MCSC existing thing can be responsible for it. And we see also that the individual would not have really a clue about what he was confused about or he wouldn't be confused and we see that the Instructor who is doing the best job of instruction is actually never trying to solve the problem of what the student is confused about. We see the good Instructor would never do that. Why? He's already one gradient late, so he just gets more confused than the student, be-cause he can't understand why the student can't understand, see? It says, \"Cats are sometimes white.\" \"Yes, but I don't know why they are white, and so forth. Actually didn't â€“ didn't Ben Franklin say something like that? I'm not sure whether Ben â€“ I â€“ uh â€“ where â€“ what is this â€“ where-where-su-sa-su-dah...\" \"Well you see, cats â€“ well, did you ever see a cat? Did you ever have a cat? Uh-uh-uh-do-do-do you â€“ do you know anything about cats? \"Uh â€“ let's-uh â€“ let's go get a dictionary and look up a picture of cats.\" It's all a waste of time because it happens to be in the earlier paragraph where it said \"feline.\" See, he doesn't know what that is, see? He didn't know that applied to cats, but he hung up on this earlier one. So the apparency of his confusion is almost never the confusion he is actually in. An Instructor knowing this won't have any real difficulty answering the foolish questions he is asked, and so forth, because he just never bothers with them. He wants to know what's going over the top. But somebody asks the Instructor the definition of something: \"Yes, yes,\" he says, \"a caterwump is a â€“ ba â€“ and that's all.\" Okay? Audience: Okay.

All right. There is no particular reason then that knowledge should get in your road because the casus belli (as the hootch dancer said) is a very, very deep-seated thing called \"words.\" Now, you may even think there is an end word called \"words,\" or something of the sort. But of course, all GPMs are composed of words. They're actually not composed of Eng-lish words; they're composed of significances which are connected to masses. These masses are very capable of pushing somebody's 'ead off. And where you have precise significances â€“ and it's quite interesting how precise these significances are â€“ where you have very precise significances, you don't get too much upset. In other words, don't look at it the other way to; don't look at it on the basis that if you avoid end words a hundred percent you will make it, see? That's actually the incorrect look; it's the locks which do you in. The offbeats, do you see? Now, you really shouldn't be terribly concerned of â€“ about this as a Scientologist. The electrician gets used to handling 10,000 volts, the circus performer thinks that it's quite noth-ing to pat lions on the nose â€“ I call to your attention that the public at large look at an electri-cian handling some voltage lines, or something like that, and they're horrified, see? And you look at a lion trainer in a cage â€“ they hate to be called lion tamers because those lions are never tame; a tame lion is the last thing you want around, you see? So they want good, savage lions. Patting those on the nose and so forth, the public looks and they say 'Aaghhh!' But as a matter of fact, they would feel rather uncomfortable if they didn't have some big cats around to snap whips at, you know? I mean the lion trainer would. This is the life he lives. And the public at large, not being initiated into this, of course, is horrified and properly stunned by the lion trainer's association with the big cats in the cage. Clyde Beatty, for instance, used to fight forty lions and tigers simultaneously, mixed. And I should imagine that he lay off of that for a few days, why he would have felt very, very poor, you know, he would have felt bored and life would have seemed uninteresting to him. Now, there are many other professions and many other activities, and so forth. You wonder how in the name of God a dentist can stand there pulling teeth day after day after day after day. Fantastic, but he can. You wonder how a surgeon can stand there cutting out guts and throwing the offal in the garbage can hour after hour, you see? Year after year. How come? What are all these things? Well, these things are what is known as professional famili-arities. And if you get familiar enough with a particular subject, it may look terribly danger-ous and upsetting to somebody else, but is not really dangerous or upsetting to you. This is quite remarkable. In any particular field or activity one is apt to become quite superhuman. That is what's being demanded of you in Scientology. I'm not talking about whether you get better or whether you become Clear or OT or anything else; I'm just talking on a very down-to-earth, rock-bottom sort of an approach. GPM words are the lions, the high voltage, the various other professional danger points with which you live in Scientology: the words, the words of the GPMs and that sort of thing. Now, you take these words and you go out and throw them in the teeth of the public out here, see?

And he's liable to get quite ill and that sort of thing. All right, well, he's just not used to lions, do you see? He couldn't even trace it back to why he feels so ill; he knows nothing about this. Well, this is a rather happy area to be a pro-fessional in; because life is â€“ consists of livingness, and livingness has a lot to do with the mind. In fact there wouldn't even be anything here to live in, or any living to do, unless a mind was around, you see? So the business â€“ the business of being in the business of the mind, and so forth, has liabilities. But it has, of course, a great many things that are very good. And when you start fooling around with GPMs, you know very well you can knock your head off â€“ you know very well that this is not something to lightly fool with. You know very well what they can do to somebody. You see somebody around on crutches gimping around, he's got arthritis â€“ ar-thritis exclamation point, you see, and so on. What's the matter with him? Well, he's just all wound up in a GPM someplace; that's really all that is wrong with him. If even â€“ even if it's an engram, why, it's held in place with a GPM. That's the way he lives, that's what's going on with... All right, why is this couple having an awful hard time maritally? Well, they've just got a couple of end words crossed up one way or the other; one is riding one hobby horse and one is riding the other one, you know, and that sort of thing. Well, if you tried to explain it to them that it was an end word that was doing this sort of thing â€“ you could probably slip it off of them on a meter, if you didn't try to explain it to them. This â€“ well, just let's take a couple of hypothetical end words: let's say that he was \"conservative,\" you see, and she had an end word \"wild.\" Now, these two end words won't mix and they are both in high-blown howl, you see, on this subject. So he's being conservative and she's being wild. All right, never the twain shall meet. So the upshot is that they're going to lead a very unhappy life. Now, you could probably, without their ever finding anything out about it really, pick up that it was \"conservative\" on the meter; probably get his considerations about being conservative, have this end word blow. You could take ahold of her, you could proba-bly pick up \"wild\" on the meter, particularly if you had the total prearranged list of end words, you could probably key it out, get her considerations on this, and so forth. They'd walk out of there perfectly happy with each other and a miracle would have been performed. They would never be able to trace it even back to a word. Their ability to recognize what has happened to them â€“ even that is far below their familiarity level. They have no familiarity with this thing, you see? You've heard people go around and say: \"Well, it doesn't matter, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never...\" Oh yeah? [laughter] Now, the liability â€“ the professional liability of the Scientologist â€“ is the fact that he's dealing with significances and he's dealing with masses; and you connect the right or slightly"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 4 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 148 MCSC wrong mass with the right or slightly wrong significance and you get this mismatched one way or the other and you get catastrophe, and that's the way life â€“ she is lived. And you want to know about \"What is human behavior? What are the basics â€“ ele-ments of existence? What makes matter stay here?\" The con... physicist out there, he is busy studying conservation of matter â€“ or conservation of energy rather â€“ he's busy studying con-servation of energy â€“ conservation of energy. He is just going on with this, on with this, on with this. Oh, he's just riding an end word, man. And he's riding himself into the ground. Sooner or later â€“ why he's going to strike \"to kill all energy\" or something of this sort and â€“ as his interpretation of a GPM and build an atom bomb â€“ something like this. He's got to do something, you see, in this particular line. He gets â€“ he becomes obsessed along the line. There are GPMs that have to do with pictures. I am very well aware of the fact that there's a whole series of GPMs that I haven't run, that have to do with pictures. And since I became aware of this, they don't have anything to do with me skull. You know, they don't knock my head off at all. Once in a while I find myself studying something and they have said \"pictures\" about five or six times too many in the paragraph and I find I have a tiny headache begin to grow on me, and I say \"Oh.\" Look at the paragraph: \"Oh!\" you know, gone. The â€“ this â€“ this situation, then, that could have wrecked empires â€“ one end word crosswise, you see, could have wrecked an empire â€“ to you becomes a minor discomfort. You find you have a bellyache and you â€“ something like this â€“ and you've been processing somebody or doing something â€“ you find that you have a bit of a stomachache and you wonder what â€“ \"What's the stomachache?\" you know? Afterwards you notice you got a stomachache. You suddenly realize you've been invalidating an end word. That's the quickest way in the world to get yourself a stomachache. You think, \"Maybe there is an end word 'women'?\" Well now, if you invalidate that you're probably all right because there isn't one; GPMs predate the idea of men and women, but there is one \"bodies.\" And supposing you've got one \"bodies,\" don't you see? And you invalidate the idea of bodies, well, you're going to have yourself a nice stomachache. You say there is no end word \"bodies,\" when there is an end word \"bodies,\" and of course, about that time â€“ it sometimes takes minutes or even a half an hour or two, for this to begin to sneak up on you. \"What was going on, what was going on?\" you say to yourself. \"Well, let's see, about a half an hour ago I was studying about bodies, I said they didn't exist. Tuh-huh! Well, I now know there is one end word anyway called 'bodies'.\" Total reaction. Somebody else's reaction: \"Oh my God! Call Doctor Cutwin! Ohhh! I've got to have an operation on me esophagus or me stomach, or something of the sort. I've got to have some-thing drastic done to me, because look how drastic â€“ in what drastic condition I am in!\" Don't you see? And an incomprehensibility way down below any level of knowingness on this thing, they become the total effect of these things. For instance, we just upset numerous Scientologists down in Australia because we had to fight back against the Laborite Party. The Laborite Party was the one who proposed the bill to outlaw Scientology in the state of Victoria. So I decided that they had lived too long and they don't come to the inquiry very much anymore. They as a matter of fact found out that Scientologists could cause them to come within an ace of losing all the seats they had. I wrote"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 5 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 149 MCSC out a little pamphlet and I've carefully put in it the exact proper end words. [laughter] This was circulated â€“ this was circulated â€“ they came within an ace of losing their lives in this election and that was it. But of course, some Scientologists down there who were afraid to shoot at somebody and who weren't in the know, and so forth, continued to write me on my Standing Order Number 1 line: \"That was a terrible thing to do.\" They didn't know anything about the end word, that was â€“ see, they are not trained up to this â€“ not oriented in this area yet, \"That was a terrible thing to do, because you really shouldn't put entheta, you see, on a theta line, like a nice Scientology magazine.\" And it's all â€“ and they're sort of protesting, you know, that this pamphlet that came out and was generally issued in Australia against the La-borite Party â€“ was issued at all. They don't realize what they're protesting against. Some of those end words hit them; they aren't trained, they aren't in the know, and so, of course, it made them feel kind of queasy and they want to know who wrote it. Well, I haven't told them yet, I wrote it. But it produced the exact effect that it was supposed to produce, which, \"to drive those dogs back in their kennels,\" and it did exactly that. They are much less enthusiastic these days. As a matter of fact, they are becoming sorrier and sorrier that they ever started this inquiry and that is the proper effect to produce on somebody who is attacking you is just make them very, very sorry that they attack you. That's the proper way to handle it in this universe, see? United States government is getting into that frame of mind now on the E-Meter case, see? They are beginning to sit around and wonder why in the name of God they ever lost their wits to such a degree as to start this thing in the first place, because they can't prepare a case, because none of their facts are correct and their charges are all wrong and they're silly, but if they let this case go to court, they let themselves in for a recovery of damages that may run into the millions. They're now in trouble. Well, how do you make people in trouble? Well, you just make them sorry they done it, that's all. Now, the psychiatrist and psychologist and so forth, are very busy in the world today on the field of motivational research, what they call motivational research; very interesting subject. I recommend to every Scientologist and particularly people who are engaged in pro-motion activities, something â€“ in organizations, to read a book called Hidden Persuaders. Now, that is a very interesting book. Although it tries to make mock of the idea of \"hidden persuaders,\" and so forth, down in between the lines it gives you a very thorough dissertation on the techniques now being used by modern advertising agencies and other people engaged in reaching the public. And they hire these days psychiatrists and so forth, to do motivational research and find out a bunch of goofy facts. Well, most of their facts are goofy because they don't know why people are. They don't know what make people tick and that sort of thing. But if a Scientologist reads that, particularly a Saint Hiller and particularly somebody who is moving around in the vicinity of Class VI, see, he reads that â€“ now just reinterpret that whole thing. They've laid a foundation, they've got a beautiful piece of music, they've got no words to the music, don't you see? They've got a marvelous idea that maybe they can influ-ence and affect people one way or the other but they don't know what words to put to the tune. They're still groping around in their Freudian analysis and trying to motivate soap by getting a libido complex going on the age of three, see? They're trying to restimulate some-thing one way or the other in order to sell their soap. And they haven't got the buttons, let me"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 6 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 150 MCSC put it this way, you see. They're playing a piano without any keys. They're still making noise on it. I don't know how they're managing it but one way or the other they're making noise on it. Now actually, that is one of the highest paid activities in the world today â€“ is the world of advertising and merchandising. That is the high â€“ one of the highest paid activities in the world today. They are pouring out a terrific avalanche of money into the pockets of psychia-trists and so forth these days in order to find out what makes people tick. Of course, they're not on basic â€“ really basic research. They're still flying around in kindergarten stuff, don't you see? But here these fellows are, trying to reach the public, trying to sell products and so forth and they have turned to the psychiatrist and psychologist in order to give them the answers. Well, they turned the wrong way and like any other boot soldier in an awkward squad, why, they'll probably get booted for it. They lose money on this every once in a while and they make mistakes. But you start adding that up â€“ if you really know the mind â€“ and you wonder then that anybody would ever have any difficulty with dissemination. Now, this material, of course, is a debased â€“ I mean, this type of use is a debased use of this information. It would debase your knowledge of the field of the mind just to use it to sell somebody some preserved piglets or something, see? This is silly, see? This is something like using a Mercedes car to crack walnuts. This situation, then, is not â€“ not recommended to you as an activity. I'm simply pointing out some minor activity that's going on in the world today that is absorbing a great deal of money from the manufacturers â€“ that has a bang â€“ tremendous bang from each magazine. You turn on the TV set, you are looking at motivational research. You turn â€“ open a magazine, you're looking at motivational research. You open up a newspaper and read its ads, you're looking at motivational research. You can look at an election, you realize those candidates in that election are running by motivational research. As a matter of fact, Eisenhower won the campaign in the United States when he was elected president be-cause of the work of an advertising agency in the field of motivational research and they found that the country was starved for a father image, so they set him up for a father image and of course he got elected. Actually he was a pretty good father image, if fathers do nothing but read Western stories. But they set this boy up in that fashion. Now, that's the way the world is moving. Now, if you want to know â€“ if you want to know how to live calmly in the midst of a tremendous confusion all you really have to know is the answers â€“ the basic answers; and if you know the basic answers, these things ninety percent of the time don't worry you and the other ten percent of the time you can do some-thing about them. Do you follow me? Knowledge is something that is achieved â€“ end word or no end word â€“ it is something achieved through study. Now, the whole subject of words booby-traps a person's effort to find out what's going on, to find out what the world consists of. Words â€“ it's a boobytrapped line: significance. What is this? How do you find out about anything? Well, you're going to find out something about something these days with words. Information is going to be relayed with words; you're"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 7 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 151 MCSC going to find out about things with words and those words are booby-trapped. They match up the GPMs â€“ the woof and warp of the mind. They've got the mind pushbuttoned. Now, the mind is terrifically push-buttoned so that if you are reading: \"The cat was black,\" and feel queer or feel repelled by this statement, \"The cat is black,\" if you don't know what you're doing, you simply are repelled by the subject of studying \"cats,\" or of studying or acquiring knowledge about \"cats,\" or anything of that sort of thing, see? In other words, you've got a barriered line, because you read the statement, \"The cat is black,\" you feel odd, therefore you say, \"I mustn't study about cats,\" see? Actually, it has nothing to do with cats; it's the word \"black\" happens to be an end word. You nearly always find yourself assigning to the wrong part of a sentence or the wrong part of the study material the reason why you can't study it, because the other is some-thing one isn't confronting and one doesn't feel he can confront, so therefore he disperses and confronts something else. Now, that is the basic principle you should know about knowledge and study: One, that even if you are simply looking at a tree to find out something about the tree, you are studying a tree. I don't care how briefly this is done, study isn't something being used here in connection with being very, very thoughtful and thorough, and so forth. You look over this tree to see what kind of a tree it is. Well, in that brief instance you've studied the tree, don't you see? In other words, you observed it to find something else out about it. Now, you can pick up observation from the printed page; that's a secondhand observa-tion but it nevertheless is the route on which almost all knowledge travels, since if you, indi-vidually, were called upon to re-evolve all the knowledge there was from the beginning of the world until now, all by your little ol' lonesome, you'd wind up stupid in this lifetime. I don't mean to be harsh, that's true. If you were called upon personally and individually to evolve all knowledge there was about anything, in one lifetime, you would get so little way upon that route â€“ you understand, that's without having any other person relay anything to you, without having at your fingertips any works, texts, any reference books of any kind. That you were just going to have to do it all on your little ol' lonesome by thinking it up and evolving it, and so forth, and you were going to evolve all the knowledge and you weren't going to have any receipt of information from any other secondhand observation. In other words, you want to learn about volcanoes, well, you have to go and find a volcano. You would get so little done on this project that you would die stupid, I can assure you of that. Or you would be a ruddy fool and believe that you knew everything there was to know about the one room that you had been in that whole lifetime. Do you follow me? So there is a value to secondhand knowledge. Now, firsthand knowledge, of course, is acquired by direct observation and experience. But even to achieve direct observation and experience, it is really much better to have the fruits of other observations and experience with which to profit and only in that way can you maintain and carry forward a culture of any magnitude. Illiterate cultures do not survive and they are not very high. The natives of the tribe of the Bugga-Bugga Booga-Boogas down in Lower Bugga-Wugga Booga-Woog are mostly no longer with us or they are around waving red flags today and revolting against their central"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 8 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 152 MCSC government. They're having a bad time. Well, the British Tommy that went down there with his Snider or his Lee-Enfield and brought them higher education in the first place â€“ was only occasionally followed by anybody who taught them anything. And they didn't learn fast. Their literacy was not up to absorbing culture rapidly. So, of course, they can be victimized by any-body who comes along. Once the line is open, if literacy doesn't follow and if secondhand observation is not available to a people, they stultify, they die, they go to pieces, they degrade. They are struck by this tremendous volume of exterior culture. They've been very happily down amongst the bong-bong trees, you know, dancing up and down amongst the bong-bong trees and the high-est level of their interest, and so forth, was their own back yard. They could tell you all about bong-bong trees and they could tell you all about you mustn't step in bug-bug bushes, because you step on a thump-thump snake and this was their direct observation. The second they're hit with things â€“ particularly the abstract ideas of organization â€“ the abstract ideas of political philosophy â€“ the abstract ideas of, really, engineering â€“ things of this material nature where knowledge is moving in close to the MEST, you see, where the significance is immediately, directly applicable to the manipulation of matter â€“ when they move in on that, of course, their culture fails. They are not able to turn out Lee-Enfield rifles. They are not able to organize themselves into a proper democratic civilization, no matter how many lend-lease payments are thrust into the paws of their greedy politicians. They can be victimized, they can be turned into slaves and they can be degraded. What's happened? Well, they've been overwhelmed and presented with this tremen-dous cultural image. Here's this great, shiny civilization, you see? It's full of Cadillac cars and jet planes and electric razors and all kinds of wild things; and they look at this material ani-mated world; they see people have conquered their environment to the point where they can live at leisure and where they can do various things and where some girl can â€“ with a few push buttons can control 125 horses as the most usual thing that she ever did in her life. You understand? In other words, she can drive a car. All right, all of these miracles all of a sudden hit these illiterate fellows, see, all these things! They don't know the words, see? They see the tune, but they can't sing it. And they go into just overwhelm â€“ boom! They just cave right in, see? They just back right up. Somebody who is fully trained in Moscow has also been trained: \"Your brethren at home are pretty uneducated and if you push this button and that button and that button, they will respond and all of a sudden bring down the house and then we will be able to seize the whole place and get all the jute we need.\" I mean, the ethical and spiritual nature of communism is very interesting, you know? They're out of jute, so they put their political mechanisms into â€“ run to get them some jute. Their interest in South Africa is simply and entirely the fact that they need diamonds and they want gold. I mean it's very spiritual. They love mankind for what they can get out of him and the way they play their violin is just about as cold-blooded as anybody ever did, see? But it's mainly based on the fact that people don't know the words. And you look at a communist array of vocabulary, you look at a communist vocabu-lary, it's very interesting vocabulary, it's very tricky. Their technology â€“ their political tech-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 9 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 153 MCSC nology â€“ is worked out to one of the finest hair splits you ever heard of. Boy, they know how to talk to this one, they know how to talk to that one and they know how to argue with some-body else and they know how to put together this and they know the parliamentary control of a small meeting. And they're taught to do this and they're taught to do that and they know how to shuffle the motion down to the bottom of the pile so it never gets heard and only the motion which they want heard is heard. They're just taught this very carefully, you see? Technology â€“ technology â€“ they're all taught this with words. They weren't in on the 1917 Revolution. They got the whole technology right straight on up the line by being taught it, by it being relayed to them with words, much as I'm relaying to you information and ideas with words. But it's all secondhand, it's all hearsay and for those boys it really works. They are taking the world. I see people standing around with their hands in their pockets in these Western gov-ernments, and so forth, not knowing what is going on, and it's something like a big, strong bull being chewed to pieces by a pack of small dogs. And this bull â€“ he knows that a small dog can't do anything to him and so he's tried to ignore him â€“ he tries to go on â€“ he tries to do this. The next thing you know, he's going to be down with his throat cut. Well, he doesn't un-derstand what they're up to and he's above knowing. Something like this, you see? All kinds of attitudes mix into this. He's deficient in knowledge of communist technology, so therefore he is being defeated by communist technology. It's very, very interesting that this technology is relayed by word of mouth. It's taught. It's not by direct observation, but it's material that can be put into direct observation by the communist â€“ trained communist here and there. The world today is being overwhelmed on the basis of illiteracy; the illiterate people of the world are being overwhelmed. It's always this, see? It's the fellow who doesn't know, it's those who do not understand, it's those who haven't got it taped who get knocked into the wastebasket. The death of a civilization is based upon its accumulated not-understandings â€“ not-knowings â€“ its ignorings â€“ its failure to grasp the situation. It can also drift back into too many yesterday's clichÃ©s like: \"Well, the barbarians always come down on the northern fron-tier and go home at harvest time,\" you know? And one time they didn't go home at harvest time and that was the end of Rome, see? Rome at that time was illiterate on the subject of illiteracy: the barbarian. They didn't realize that their people had become very effete. Part of their information was missing: that a people who wishes to be free must not just know about the latest wine. They've got to know pretty well across the boards about most everything in sight. They've got to keep on the ball, they've got to keep on the qui vive, they've got to be right up there and alert. The day that marks your death is the day that you sit back and decide you know every-thing there is to know about everything there is around you, so there is no reason for you to observe anything anymore. Now, between the two points then of \"no observation necessary because I know every-thing,\" you see, and \"no observation possible because I don't know any of the words,\" there is a mean which makes life livable. You get what these two extremes are now? One is: \"I know there is everything to know. I know everything there is to know â€“ I needn't observe anything. I needn't really experience or do or look at anything because I know all there is to know.\" Now, that would be the end product of a dying civilization or a dying individual. And on the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 10 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 154 MCSC other extreme we have the: \"Don't know any of the words, don't know anything, don't under-stand anything that's happening in my vicinity,\" and so forth, and that's a very fast route to death, demise and decay, see? So the thing to do is to know the words and to stay alert. That's the motto one reads out of this thing. And you'll find out there's always some new technology being boiled up someplace. Well, be curious enough to find out about it, see? Stay alert. Never become com-placent about what you know and you'll go right on surviving very nicely. Now, this is particularly true of somebody who gets up to a point of eminence or prominence, somebody who moves up to a point where he is superior to the ordinary or more average individual in his vicinity â€“ he tends to become very complacent. A fellow is living in the vicinity of the natives of Ugga-Bugga and he can read and they can't. Well, he feels very superior, so he really doesn't even bother to read. Do you see? Now, if Scientology faces any danger, it is that danger of stultifying because they no longer believe they have to observe, no longer have to apply, no longer have to get on the ball. Now, you want to know what's the difference between the successful individual and the unsuccessful individual: It is just that one can understand and do and the other one doesn't understand or doesn't... There are two ways of not understanding, as I've just told you. One is to suppose you know all about it so you don't have to observe; that's one method of not under-standing. And the other is just not know the words, you see? Those two extremes are there. So, the individual doesn't understand and he goes off into a â€“ in other words, he doesn't un-derstand, so he quits trying â€“ or he understands all there is, he thinks, and so doesn't bother to observe. Now, those two actions there amalgamate into a fellow who â€“ either one of them â€“ who is going to fail. This individual is going to go by the boards. Now, who won't go by the boards, then? Well, it's somebody who can observe and un-derstand and do â€“ a person who can observe and understand and do. Now, in view of the fact that the greatest body of observation is actually secondhand observation, realize that that is perfectly valid observation, when coupled with understand-ing â€“ but that is particularly and peculiarly liable to having to be understood. Now, the less direct the observation then, the greater the understanding has to be. In other words, your un-derstanding has to increase to the degree that you're not directly observing. Understanding has to increase in the degree that the observation is indirect. If your observation of a tree is indi-rect, you'd better jolly well understand about that tree, pretty confounded well. As a matter of fact, much better, oddly enough, than if you were standing there looking at it. Now, understanding then is a substitute for mass and you have the answer to under-standing in ARC. Understanding adds up to ARC. In study, understanding is a substitute for mass. Now, let's go over that again: If you haven't got a tree to observe and you are being told about a tree, then you'd better jolly well understand what you're being told, otherwise you're going to misobserve the tree. Now, if you don't understand what you are being told about the tree or you don't understand how the information is being relayed to you about the tree, you will wind up not understanding a tree and have been denied that mass, because the informa-tion received on a via. Do you follow this?"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 11 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 155 MCSC This is very complex material I'm giving you here, but is quite useful. If you can't â€“ if you haven't got a tree to look at, then you jolly well â€“ if you are trying to study about trees on a second relay, then you damn well better understand that second relay. Now, there are two things to understand about what you're being told or what you are reading or what your secondhand observation is. See, secondhand observation can be after the fact because of time, too, you understand that? You say: \"There must have been a tree here, because here is a stump,\" you know? \"And there's going to be a tree here, because here is a sprout.\" Do you see that? That your understanding also can go forward and backward in time and it can be direct or indirect in terms of view. So understanding can be direct or indirect in terms of view. You can be there looking at the tree or somebody can be telling you about the tree. So there's two â€“ there's actually several different understandings all in a packet. Now, that's not to our purpose, right now, to examine how many types and brands of understanding there are, but I'm just warning you on this fact with regard to study and this is the only point I'm really trying to make to you. The other is just window dressing and cake frosting. It's interesting, the whole subject is very interesting, but it's this: If you are not ob-serving something directly, if you are reading about trees â€“ you got that? â€“ you're not observ-ing it directly, then your understanding has to be superior to the understanding which would be required in a direct observation. You've got to be more â€“ you've got to understand it better, otherwise you're going to lose yourself a tree. Now, this is quite interesting, because the difficulties of secondhand information are innumerable. You've got four men trying to describe an elephant, four blindfolded men that have felt all over an elephant and they're trying to describe this elephant or whatever that old saw was, don't you see? And the wise men that give you all the dope of what an elephant is all about, you know? And they didn't observe the elephant because they were blindfolded and they gave the most wild dissertations on what this elephant was. So now, let's realize that part of our understanding when we are engaged in secondhand observation â€“ which is to say study on a via or something â€“ we are engaged upon this â€“ then our understanding must include an evaluation of the reliability of the information we are being given. You follow that? Our un-derstanding must include the understanding of whether this is good dope or bad dope, whether this is the straight data or this is â€“ got a â€“ data with a curve. In other words, we have to be capable of evaluating the truth of the relayed observation. Understanding then, must include that. And there is where the bulk of sentient beings â€“ I won't just say man, because there are other sentient beings â€“ fall down, and there is where they get crosswise, there is where they really have a time. Well, I'll give you a marvelous example: There are people walking all over the place today and so on and so on and they think that everything in the field of the mind is all cared for. \"See, when a little child is three years old, why he got â€“ he got excited about something or other, he's been sick and that's why he's in the insane asylum and doctors understand all about this and everybody understands it and so forth and yah, yah, yah, the problem's all cared for.\" Well, we're in that state of the civilization where they say they're not only saying, \"we know,\" they're also saying, \"somebody else knows, and we don't have to know.\" Hey-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 12 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 156 MCSC hey, what's this? What's â€“ what kind of apathy is this? \"We don't even have to know anymore. It's all right that somebody else someplace knows, that there are some authorities someplace on this subject.\" I quote Eisenhower. He always depended on having an authority. The best source of information was always an authority on the subject and he never did anything without â€“ he consulted an authority and it went along with this that he didn't have to know a blessed thing about anything. There was never even a communication signal corps unit to keep him advised on mo-ments of national crisis or anything else, when he was out playing golf or anything. There was no information lines ever run through this man. He got his national policies out of Newsweek. He did! He'd gotten to a point of where the expert was a newspaper reporter. Well, I admit newspaper reporters are pretty good and they all think that if left up to them, they can straighten everything out in a minute, but it seems rather interesting to have newspaper re-porter policy being the dominant policy of a nation. They might really be trying to sell soap, you see? It might be motivational research entering in here, you know. You couldn't really trust that piece of information. So, part of your understanding is what you're understanding â€“ the falsity or correctness of your data sources â€“ or what you're trying to understand. So, study has as part of it, comprehension of the accuracy of your source of informa-tion and you've got to have some idea of that. And that's an experiential line itself. You say, \"Well, this fellow tells me what he believes to be true and if he no longer believes it to be true or if he finds something else is true, why, he will tell me.\" Something like that. You say, \"All right. Well, that's that source of information and that's a good source of information. There's this other source of information, if he tells me something, why, he's just confoundedly certain that he's got to shove it down my throat in some particular line. It might be right and it might be wrong, but he will continue to tell me just because he has to be right.\" Something like this, you see? Since I've just gotten through three textbooks â€“ three textbooks written by a professor at Columbia University who never had color film in his hands in his life, I'm sure, who was writing on color photography... I had to study these and I had to know my business. I was going to be examined on this. I shot more color film than this man ever heard of. But here was a case where I had to study something to get a grade. I understood that. See, I understood the fact that I had to study this in order to get a grade. You get the subtlety then of the study that went on. Also began to be understood this guy loved to show off. He loved to show off; he would introduce some ninety-dollar word of a technical nature, which wasn't included in any dictionary, into the middle of a sentence where it didn't have to be. Oh, boy, if that doesn't throw you. Now, right in the middle of that sentence you've got a word like \"colored cou-plers.\" He says, I quote, \"We are now going to introduce a new term, 'colored couplers,' which I will explain later.\" He never explained it. You look up in the photographic dictionary. \"What is this thing: a 'colored coupler'?\" And you can't find it. It's not in there. You look eve-rywhere and you can't find it. What are you supposed to do? Just lie down and die at this"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 13 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 157 MCSC point? No, your understanding has to embrace the fact that the silly ass didn't know what he was talking about, if nobody can define it. Well, maybe someplace somebody's going to de-fine it but it includes you don't have to know what it is in order to continue. Now, that is also a very interesting thing to do, because you go past one of these points of understanding and you know you're going to have trouble; but part of study is to know the technology of study and to know if you start developing a headache in the next half page it's because you didn't understand that word. Do you understand? In other words, your understanding of understanding can get very subtle indeed. You can get very, very tricky. You are reading about the engineering works of the early Egyptians, which have been written by a modern engineer who is also a lecturer at Massachusetts Insti-tute of Technology and should have been flunked for English. He can't write â€“ maybe he can build bridges, but he can't write. (If he's teaching at MIT, he probably can't build bridges ei-ther.) But anyhow, there he is and you want to learn something about the bridge building of the early Egyptians, see, and this thing is strewn with words that have to do with stresses and strains of various kind and torsional â€“ gahhh! And then when he really wishes to be clear, he all of a sudden gives you four paragraphs of solid integral calculus, without giving you what any of the letters he's using in the integral calculus refer to. I've got a book on color reproduction upstairs, written by some Englishman that did this. It's marvelous. You get simultaneous equations, of all things in calculus, and this is sup-posed to explain something. Of course, what I did was not worry about the fact that I didn't understand it. I just laughed in his face via his textbook. In other words, I wasn't so obsessed on the line that I couldn't skip it and I was sufficiently informed on the subject of study that I knew if I ran into a liability of having skipped it, I knew what the liability would be, see, so I could go back and run it out if it got in my road. In other words, I could walk through this bunch of bayonets. Do you understand? Audience: Yeah. Well, you could get that clever about study, see? All right, well, that's actually going to high school before you get to kindergarten, really, on the subject of study, but I'm showing you about where it extends to. You can get clever enough to read an MIT lecturer's dissertation in full panoply of engineering terms on the bridges of the ancient Egyptians without actually looking up a single blasted one of his confounded technical terms and survive right on to the end of the dissertation and, what do you know? Know something about the bridges! Now you're clever. The latest editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica require this as a fine art, because all they're doing is showing off to the people of the profession. They've been so criticized by landscape architects for their articles on landscape architecture, that they now have written a professional piece on landscape architecture. Nobody can understand it but a landscape archi-tect. Well, a landscape architect isn't ever going to look it up in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. [laughter] And that applies to nearly all of their very professional dissertations. That's why I... They've changed their style."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 14 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 158 MCSC The modern style is to become incomprehensible and to say, \"Somebody else knows about it,\" and then try to impress it and leave it all skipped and then, you know, say, \"Well, if you're not an expert you're nothing â€“ and there are experts around, so we're all perfectly...\" It's all kind of a mishmash â€“ decadence is what you're really looking at. Now, I use an old 1890 edition. You read about landscape architecture in the old 1890 edition and it knew it was written for some fool that didn't know their nomenclature, see? You can find out what you want to know; but later editions, you can't. Soon that 1890 edition will become so antique, why, it won't be of any use anymore and then I won't have any encyclope-dia left, see? I'll have to do something desperate by that time, by â€“ I don't know, substitute for it with some vast library of stuff. Oh â€“ oh, yes. I know. Quentin's getting a whole bunch of text-books and I'll keep collecting those. I've just solved it. He's getting all kinds of textbooks: The Boy's Book of Electronics, you know? The Boy's Book of something or other. You open these things up, it's actually \"Integral Calculus Made Easy for 6-Year-Olds,\" you know. [laughter] Actually, they're way over his head. I don't know how anybody did that, but he does all right with these things. Crazy business! Yes, they're â€“ they've got a penchant going that it's all right to make it easy for children to understand it, so I can collect a child's library and I'll be all set. That's what I'll do. Maybe the children can't understand it, but I will be able to. Anyway, sources of information all add up, then, to comprehensibility and words form the woof and warp of any professional or technical area. Specialized words are used for spe-cialized observations. Now, we move off into the field of specialized observations, as a spe-cialist, which is perfectly fine. But where you are lightly tapping some field for just a mo-ment's understanding and you collide with specialist vocabulary, you are lost at once. Now, it gives you an idea at once of the very unserious student of Scientology. One of the first things he does is complain about the nomenclature. Well frankly, we have less no-menclature than we're entitled to as a specialized field. Because nobody understood anything about the mind, how could they have any vocabulary about it? And they didn't have any vo-cabulary about it and if we'd used their lousy vocabulary, we would have misunderstood eve-rything, because those words meant other things. So actually, this bird stands around and starts complaining about our vocabulary. Now we know at once that he's not a serious student of Scientology. That's the first thing we know about this person: he's not a serious student of it. He's a dilettante; he wants to hang around the edges and pick up a few scraps. You recognize the brute now? He wants a few scraps. He really doesn't want it, because you've got to sweat for nomenclature, because the nomencla-ture is carrying with it a specialized understanding and unless you've got that specialized un-derstanding, you will never get the technology. Now, there's the difference between knowing about something and being a pro. There's a vast difference. And there's many a chap today walking around who is pretending to know a great deal about something who oddly enough isn't even vaguely educated in that par-ticular field, and so forth. But it's sort of a \"thing\" to be a sort of a dilettante â€“ that's a modern trend."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 15 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 159 MCSC For instance, what's a medical doctor but a dilettante in the field of the mind? Really very much so! He's just â€“ he's superficial â€“ nobody. The effrontery of them! Six hours of lec-ture, they get up here on some hospital alongside of the Thames, as I have mentioned before; and this is their entire education on the field of the mind. But because they have a general practitioner's license it gives them carte blanche in the field of the mind. It sounds crazy, but it is true. That's what it is. So, the society at large is not â€“ has gotten so dispersed that it does-n't mind calling somebody an authority who doesn't know anything about it at all. Because that is the authority on the field of the mind â€“ he was taught for six hours. This is their skeleton in their closet, by the way. This is why they raised the devil with us for so many years about how well we were trained, and so forth, and we actually â€“ in any given week an Academy student anywhere in the world was learning more about the mind, in that week per hours of invested time, than a medical doctor got in his entire career. In one week! Now, the effrontery of these boobs in trying to tell us that we were untrained in the field of the mind and so forth. No, no, we are not untrained in the field of the mind, we are practically the only people who are trained in the field of the mind. Now, there are other fields that are trained in the field of meat or neurones or something like this, as in psychology or brain surgery or something. But they are trained in the field of meat, they are not trained in the field of the mind. I'll give them that they are specialists on meat, all right! Somebody gets a bullet in his skull and so forth, they can probably do something about it. Well, all right, don't â€“ let's not though pretend, because we can take a bullet out of somebody's skull, that we now know about the mind, because in the first place it didn't go into his mind â€“ it went into his skull. Now, this was a slight difference, you see, in nomenclature. Now, what I'm trying to bring home to you here, is there are various grades at which a subject can be approached. You can approach it as a dilettante: \"Oh well, I know all about painting. Yes, yes, I had a course in art appreciation in junior high school, one whole semes-ter. And the teacher stood up and showed us pieces of lithography on a piece of cardboard and â€“ I got so I could call Rembrandt nearly every time. I got very clever at art appreciation, so I know a great deal about art.\" Well, that must have consisted of what? One or two or three hours a week, for maybe â€“ I don't know â€“ what's a semester? Sixteen weeks, something like that. Which made a total â€“ he looked at pictures for fifty or sixty hours and now he's an art specialist. Well, of course, that's better than somebody out in the street that never heard of them; not much, but it's better. But it gives somebody the interesting idea that he now knows something about it, when he doesn't know a ruddy thing about it. It gives him a curious and very dangerous attitude to his own future knowledge. It gives him a false understanding. He now thinks he knows something about it. No, he knows the nomenclature of pictures. He doesn't know anything about art, he's never been taught anything about art. Nomenclature of pictures was what he would know. It isn't really the amount of time invested that gives you this, although I've been men-tioning time. It is more the seriousness with which it is approached. How much do you want to know about this? Do you want to know enough about this so you can talk about it? As would be very common on a Park Avenue debutante, don't you see? She could discuss art â€“ how cute! At her coming-out party, if somebody happened to say, \"You look like a"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 16 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 160 MCSC Madonna,\" why she would know they weren't necessarily talking religion, you see? [laughter] See, art, see? All right, now let's move a little bit further into the field of art. Now, how seriously do they wish to approach this subject? Do they wish to understand something about this subject so that they just won't appear to be a dummy or do they want to understand enough about it so as to do something with it? Do they want to know how to use art to decorate a home? That is to say, how do you choose and match and hang pictures, and â€“ you know, what do you do with these pictures, you know? We could go, not necessarily further in that direction, but along another path: A guy wants to know about art because of the threatened inflation of the world, see? Threatened in-flation. You can buy land and you can â€“ which isn't very movable â€“ and you can buy gold, if you can get your hands on it and you're not an American citizen, and it will grow in price as the money of the community inflates. Or you can buy art. And art today is big business amongst people who know nothing about it as an artistic activity but as a financial invest-ment. And you would be amazed how big this business is. Well, does he want to know enough about art so that he knows whether or not the experts are cheating him? That's how far that fellow would want to go, see? He'd have to know enough about art to know who knew about art, so that he couldn't be tripped up in the field of art. Otherwise he'd lose his shirt, you see? Or do you want to know enough about art to move over into the field and maybe teach people art appreciation. Let's go a little bit further; we'd have to know a little bit more about art, wouldn't we? Now we're getting the lower grade instructional levels. Or do we want to know enough about art so that maybe, if we were very good, we could sit down with a piece of charcoal and a piece of paper and draw a vase with a narcissus in it? Now, we say, \"We've started back at the beginning again,\" because any kid in kindergarten is trying to draw a vase with a narcissus in it. We're back to the area of doingness. I'll call to your attention that that little kid in kindergarten almost never connects. It's wildly wonderful what comes up that is supposed to be a vase and so forth, but they have what is called an \"artistic talent\" or they have this or they have that and nothing is more easily destroyed because it isn't based on knowledge or understanding. This knack will leave him. It will fly out from underneath his fingers if he does happen to draw something. Very easy to trip him up. A thetan is very naturally creative, but he's actually handling certain media that he doesn't know much about. Now, you go into this again; you take yourself up a piece of black charcoal; you take yourself a white piece of paper and you set yourself down to draw a vase. Now your educa-tion begins. You know that if you change the position of your paper and the position of your head while you are doing that, you have changed the proportion of the vase. Well, now that takes some knowing, doesn't it? In other words, if you look at a vase close and then draw it for a while, you'll be drawing a big top, let us say, and then you sit back to relax and do the bottom and you've now got a small bottom; big top and a small bottom and it doesn't look right. But it looked all right to you. Well, your education on the subject of art began at that point: \"You 'old your 'ead still. That something has to do with the point I view from and the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 17 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 161 MCSC distance I view to, has something to do with what I'm doing over here on this sheet of paper.\" Yeah, all right. Now you are heading for the long run, and you actually at that moment have begun the path of becoming a pro. Now, even if you did it for fun, you would still be on the path of becoming a pro. What's the next thing you're liable to learn on the thing? Well, you're liable to learn that if you draw one for one, it's dead easy, but if you try a reduction or an increase in size, that is if you draw size for size, if you draw the vase on your piece of paper the same size as the vase you see on the table, this is pretty lousy easy. But how do you make a one for one? Well, you mustn't change the relationship of the paper or tablet to the table. It's easy as that, you see? Now, most people can't draw still lifes for very interesting technical reasons: they are trying to do a reduction. They are trying to draw a big vase while looking at a little one, or draw a little vase while looking at a big one; and as they shift, they swivel their eyeball from the big vase to the drawn vase, they don't get a one for one size. See, they look at a big vase and try to do a little vase and of course they can't get the proportion because the size is al-ready wrong and this throws them. They don't know the easy route out, they don't know that, \"My God! That requires all kinds of wild mechanical and mathematical actions to take a big vase and to do a little miniature vase of this big â€“ oh man!\" Now, you are getting \"creak, creak,\" see? Ah, dead easy. You set a vase over there and you get your paper here, and you get â€“ so the paper looks now the same size as the vase â€“ and you take out your charcoal and you draw the vase lines which you see there, the same size as you see here, you keep your 'ead where it belongs and you keep your tablet where it belongs and you keep your vase where it belongs and you go scroomp-scroomp, put in a couple of highlights, scroomp. And if you're not shaking with palsy, you will wind up with a nice sketch of a vase. I'm just showing you, there's these little pieces of technology, don't you see? Well, you're now on the route to being a pro. So, you might say that study which winds up only in understanding is not without value and is a large part of the cultural pattern which a society has. Study with no activity, let me put it that way. You don't intend to do anything about it, you're not going to do anything about it, that's just cute, that's interesting, isn't that nice? A tremendous quantity of the culture in which you live is understood to that degree and it's nice to know those things â€“ if you've got to know a lot of those things. For instance, you don't know how to â€“ have to know how to prepare or do the action of preparing an automobile, in order to know about automobiles, see? But you jolly well better know something about the action of repairing automobiles before you start paying somebody to repair the automobiles. In other words, you're at a point of regulated doingness, don't you see? Your understanding of it is sufficient so that you won't get gypped buying a \"Mona Lisa,\" because Joe just bought it yesterday, see? Now, therefore â€“ therefore, your understanding â€“ widely in life can embrace a great many things which you never intend to do. There's nothing wrong with that. But don't make a habit of that, see? Don't make a habit of that. If you're going down some line, go down some line, see? Don't stand around, for instance... Don't let some student â€“ let me talk about Scien-tology for a minute â€“ don't let somebody who walks into your PE, and so forth, keep standing around the edges of it. You'll find out they'll go hold meetings and they will talk endlessly"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 18 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 162 MCSC about Scientology, see? They couldn't define an engram if you held a pistol on them, but they'll talk endlessly about Scientology, see? In fact, there are groups all over the place that do pract... that do nothing else. They never audit, they never go into action of any kind what-soever. Their command of the subject is merely an interest. Now, this is perfectly all right, perfectly all right, but don't leave them in a state of believing that they now know the subject. That would be the cruel thing to do to them. They don't. They don't and they get con-fused to the degree that they think, now, if they do so-and-so and such-and-such, why, then this somehow or another fixes them all up, so they know all about it. Now, it's at that point that a person's education starts to break down, because these people have dropped into what trap? It's just that one trap: \"They know all about it, see, so life can go on.\" Well, they don't know all about it, they don't know your level of understanding of it. My God! You've been grinding away at it and slamming away at it and delving in it and getting comprehensions of it, and so forth, and you know how much there is there to know, man! This character is saying, \"Well, I...\" so on. Well, if you followed through some of his logic, you would be fascinated. See, if you followed through some of his think and some of his statements and some of his doingnesses on this subject, if he did do anything on this sub-ject, you would practically cave in with laughter at times, because it's so far away from any-thing you could imagine anybody interpreting anything like that as. It's just a gone proposi-tion. Somebody will say, \"Well, I settled the dog, and I was using Scientology processing, and so forth. You know, I beat him.\" How the hell did we get over there, see? It's that goofy. But to let that person go on believing now, that he knows all about it, so therefore does not have to address it directly and seriously in order to achieve any doingness level in it, would be a very, very cruel thing to do to this person because he'd just have nothing but a failure. Here's this broad subject which is there, which if he did it at all properly, would give him results and he could go someplace and he could do something with this, do you see? But to have him sit there and think he knows all about it when he doesn't know anything about it, of course, is letting him fall into this other category. Also, to put him in the position where he thinks he can't know anything about it be-cause it's so vast and so difficult and â€“ also is equally cruel, because you've artificially created the two reasons for the demise of an individual or a civilization. You've put him into a state of \"He is not only illiterate, but he is going to go right on being illiterate.\" \"Well, of course only a specialist could know that and so forth. And I don't see why you're asking for the definition of a word like that, because it really doesn't apply to what you are doing anyway. This is all pretty difficult, you know.\" I never follow such an approach. Some guy â€“ if some guy comes up and asks me hos-tilely about something or other, I can't guarantee what he'll get back. I'm â€“ it all depends on how I felt right at that moment. If I felt puckish about it, he's liable to go off packing a head-ache. But if he â€“ if somebody asked me and they really want to know something â€“ of course, you know me â€“ I tell them, bang! like that, the best I could. Even though I didn't have any hope of their really understanding what I was talking about, I would still give them anything I"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 19 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 163 MCSC could tell them that I hope might assist their information or understanding of it. I always do something for them this way and usually, if somebody's just asking for information, why I let it go at that. But if they're asking for help and so forth, I always give them something to do, not only give them a piece of information, or an insight into it, if I possibly can, but I always give them something to do, too. You know? And you'd be surprised how workable this type of an approach is. Of course, if they ask you something hostilely or be nasty, or something like that, why just pull the trap, you know? I don't care what you do to them. Nobody de-mands of you that you be polite. Don't compromise your own communication lines. The only time I ever get embarrassed or anybody get embarrassed, is this person was asking me a silly question which sounded like a hostile question, but they really meant it and they were quite serious about it and then you find yourself immediately in the position of hav-ing been very nasty and very mean back, don't you see, when they didn't intend to be. You sometimes can get that one crossed up. That's rather easy to do. But doingness requires, of course, much, much, much more understanding than just lookingness. Doingness requires an awful lot of added understanding and when you go into doing a subject, it is sometimes very, very disappointing. Your first results â€“ very disappoint-ing. Your understanding wasn't up to match the doingness that you were doing, you see, and so forth. And what you learn out of this is â€“ what you should learn out of this is that you should understand more about it, in order to do it, you see? That's the lesson you should learn; and the lesson you shouldn't learn out of it is: \"It's just too difficult.\" But on some subject lines there is another lesson you could learn, is that \"It never worked anyway.\" Oddly enough, I don't think that is applicable except in the upper levels of supereducation and in the upper levels of supereducation, they've got a lot of stuff that doesn't work but is just hoped for, you know, which they're putting straight across the line. It was never intended to work â€“ it leads to no final result at all. I mean, that sounds rather peculiar, but it is true. It's like doing the equations of aircraft propellers â€“ or buggy whips, about the same category today, propeller aircraft and the buggy whip â€“ with integral calculus and pain-fully sketching out all of the various contours and curvatures of aircraft propeller blades or buggy whip curvatures, with integral calculus. Why would you do such a stupid thing? Why, for instance, learn the tremendous complications of some very esoteric activity on a doingness basis which hasn't been used for three centuries, just to do it? Well, it sometimes doesn't work at all. Sometimes nobody ever did it. That must enter into your calculations, too, when you're going up at that level of thing. Maybe nobody ever did it, see? Maybe it's too tough. Maybe it isn't too tough â€“ maybe it just isn't, see? Maybe there is no integral calculus curve to a buggy whip, you know? I mean, you can go that far, that silly about it, you see? This sort of thing is all part of your understanding of the subject of study. Where are you going with this study? But if you're going up the line with any study on a basis of doing-ness you should go up the line on a basis of gradients. And my first lecture to you on this sub-ject had to do with gradients. And you will find the first time the individual's doingness caved in was right after, right after he had hit too steep a gradient. He didn't cave in on the steep"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 20 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 164 MCSC gradient, he caved in instantly before he hit the steep gradient. I'll talk to you more in a later lecture about processing people using this exact principle of too steep a gradient. It's quite interesting, but it'll be the gradient that he failed on, was the gradient which came after the gradient he hadn't understood. He's one step late in recognizing this thing, see? Now, what you want to do is give somebody a series of doingnesses on a gradient that they can do and that they can achieve. And in Scientology you have a rather marvelous thing called a \"Touch Assist,\" and it is so workable that some people sort of park right there with the Touch Assist and that's only one little level of doingness which if they do, why, it gives them some confidence and they can go on to higher levels of doingness, you see? But it's something like having invented too good a kiddie-car. You know, this is too good a kiddie-car; and you'll find it sometimes hard to move people off on to the next step. But a confidence and understanding goes along with the doingness, so a doingness is just another method of achieving understanding. In addition to accomplishing something with it, and so forth, it's also a method of getting understanding. Doingness is a method of achieving understanding. And if you find yourself too bogged and so forth, well, you want to go do some of it and that sounds rather interesting. Now, I know myself, I have just gotten through three books of archaic yesteryear's color films. I'm studying color photography on textbooks, that even though they are written by this institution, and so forth, have long since antiquated. They are dead and there is very little left of the actual materials they are talking about. And it's writ... was written by a profes-sor at Columbia University who probably had never done any. And the directions, and so forth, were mostly taken out of the literature released by the companies that manufactured the stuff at the time. And they intended just a happy result which they didn't ever think anybody would have any trouble with. The net result of this amounted to a tremendously interesting, basic theoretical approach which was absolutely vital to an understanding of the subject which departed wildly on to a series of doingnesses which were no longer of use and were completely disrelated. So if this wasn't the world's worst mish-mash I ever had anything to do with, I'd like to know about it. They... a real mishmash. Here's vital basic technology, basic historical technology, basic put-together, basic chemical technology, all of this stuff is not only true now, it's going to hold true from here on out in this particular field, don't you see? Basics, fundamentals, and so forth. Well, I got those down with spikes in spite of learning them from a professor. And the next thing, all of a sudden you collide with films you will never shoot and which you have to know all of the literature concerning. Oh, that's pretty grim, because in the first place, I have already learned that a manufacturer's table of use on the subject of any piece of film, much less color film, is something that you carefully don't litter the street with. You put it in the garbage can. See? Useless! Forget it! He isn't the user of the film in the first place. He's the seller of the film, not just its manufacturer, but he's selling this stuff, so he wants to put a very happy face on it. So he says its speed rating is up in the stars â€“ when it isn't. And he says it won't do this, when it does. And all of this stuff, and how this stuff is handled and all of this â€“ not even germane."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 21 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 165 MCSC Why would anybody have even included it in the text in the first place? He already knew that color was an advancing field. It was advancing so rapidly that to expect of the indi-vidual, without modernizing the text, that he would have to know all about autochrome â€“ ha-ven't had any autochrome since 1920 â€“ it didn't even take a picture then. Whoever heard of this stuff? Well, it's nice to know that they had some film like this and what its basic theory is, but now go and get the lens stops and settings for autochrome â€“ oh come now! Well, what lens stops and settings for autochrome? In a camera system, perhaps, that isn't even used anymore. That's just gobbledygook then, isn't it? Well, your understanding has to embrace this fact and you somehow or another have to survive through the subject and still retain intact the basic technology and the vital fundamentals of the subject which you have learned without being so upset about the later enturbulences which you got into because that's now been over-ridden and developed. Now, you are all faced with that merely because of the advancing line of Scientology. I've just experienced it in the wildest way possible. The third book was totally devoted to printing methods and I wouldn't be seen dead in a color darkroom anyway. See, I â€“ bluh! Who wants to doodle-daddle like that? See? Well, there are lots of guys around that like to doodle-daddle like that and I'm happy there are, because they're going to do all of my doodle-daddling! [laughter] All I have to know in that is also an understanding of what I have to know. I haven't got the time or the inclination to spend forty or fifty hours on a salon exhibi-tion print to get it registered properly. I haven't got the time or the inclination. Who would â€“ who'd do such a thing? One of these doodle-daddlers. They work happily. Marvelous! Could-n't live without it! Don't you see? Well, I have to know enough to know whether or not they know what they are doing. That's, once more, an understanding of what I need the information for, an understand-ing of what I'm going to use this information and, an understanding of its value and precision; understanding of what I have to have out of it. It's an understanding of what do I want; it's an understanding of the proper practical use or application of this information; and if it's for drawing room conversation, you would study it entirely differently. If you were studying art for drawing room conversation but not commercially, I assure you, the thing to do is to get ahold of a catalog that was published at some outrageous long date ago that lists all sorts of painters of the period of van Eyck or something like this and get all the contemporaries, see, get all of those and what they were noted for, you see, and memorize â€“ just grind, grind, grind like you're memorizing this â€“ an amateur play script, all of this stuff, you see, and so forth â€“ drawing room conversation: kill everybody dead! They can't open their heads about â€“ they say something about seventeenth century painters, you know, and you say, \"Like Van der Dobin.\" And they say, \"What?\" You say, \"Yes, Van der Dobin.\" In other words, you can play \"one-upmanship\" with this thing, see? Mow 'em down, you know? \"Well, Hobbema, after all â€“ too blue.\" And everybody says, \"Gee, boy! He's in the know.\" [laughs]"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"STUDY â€“ EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 22 SHSBC-398 â€“ 11.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 166 MCSC So anyway, the nonsense that you could run that one into and the various lines is still included under the heading of \"What are you going to use this information for? What degree do you have to know even inside one single subject?\" Now of course, some of the teachers I had on the subject of antisubmarine warfare, were busy teaching me how to build â€“ how to build, if you please â€“ there was a war going on. I didn't have any time to build anything. I tried to explain it to them â€“ \"a QCB-1 antisubmarine electronic echo device, an ASDIC QCB-1. This is the way it is built.\" Fortunately, it was a lovely, lovely warm classroom and I was shipped for a very short time down into the south of Florida to learn about this sort of thing and that's one of the things they taught me, and boy, was I able to catch up on my sleep, be-cause I just knew somehow, that out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with my hands full of Jap submarines, I was not going to have to build one of these things. I was merely going to have to know how to use it and at most repair it and to know when it was in operation, when it was out of operation. I figured that would be about all, in the middle of action, that I would be able to need. That's all I would need to know about that equipment, so I had myself a nice sleep. But the evaluation of what you want it for â€“ how are you studying it â€“ which direction it's going, and so forth, is all part and parcel to the whole subject of study. And if it is not in-cluded in the field of study, why, your use of the information is minimal and you can become very stultified and you can become very horrified and you can hang up on a lot of words and things that are getting in your road and upsetting you and that you don't understand, and you get into an obsessive \"I've got to understand everything I read perfectly or I will hang up,\" and this is taught to you by the fact that if you don't understand what you read, a half a page later you're going to get a headache. Well, you also must include the idea that after you've read that half a page more and gotten a headache, that you've now got to be smart enough to know there was something back of you, find out what it was, spot it, get it out of the road. Say, \"Yeah, that's a word I don't know,\" and go on reading. In other words, in order to study, you've got to have a lot of the technology of study or the use of the information which you are getting is going to be minimal. Now, I've given you a lot of stuff in this lecture today that is largely theoretical and that sort of thing â€“ All of this, however, has very practical applications and it has a practical application to what you are doing right now. So having increased your grades very, very nicely after every one of these, why, please increase your grade again. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 167 MCSC STUDY AND EDUCATION A lecture given on13 August 1964 What's the date? Audience: 13th of August AD 14. Thirteen Aug. AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. We've got another lecture here on study and education. You probably have realized, going down the line, that we've got this pretty well wrapped up. But we didn't expect some of the bonuses that we got. This was actually quite an astonishing and adventurous thing to do as I've already mentioned and so forth, is all of a sudden pick up an analogous field of practice and study, in order to study that, in order to find something about study, so that you're not interiorized on your own subject, don't you see? So get an exterior view and study this as a lowly neophyte that is tyroing his way up the line. Both of those mean \"beginners.\" And then carry this subject of study out through, not on a dilettante, but on a professional, hammer and tongs basis, you see? There's a great deal of difference between these two types of study. And what remains undone of that now, of course, is the professional practice of what one has learned. And that will have to be added into it to help you out in that particular field and sphere. That doesn't seem to be too much but here is â€“ the whole subject of education has as its end product the accomplishment of certain doingnesses, the accomplishment of certain ends or aims, and education which doesn't lead toward this, of course, is just sort of doodle-daddle, monkey business, you know, sort of stuff. It's pure dilettantism, by which could be best defined as \"one doesn't intend to do anything about it except annoy his friends.\" The difference in these two fields of the doodle-daddle type of monkey business sort of and so on â€“ I really wouldn't call it education. I wouldn't dignify it with that particular field. I would say it's acquaintance â€“ it's acquaintancy. It's getting a nodding acquaintance with some data or a field to find out what is in it. In other words, it's just becoming acquainted with it slightly and doing a light skim around its edges and that would not, in my estimation, be education. Education would be in the direction of accomplishing certain actions professionally. Now, that is my own word introduced into there, \"professionally,\" but if one is educated in a subject, one expects him to be able to accomplish certain things with that subject. I don't care if this is merely a theoretical line of education, one is still expected to come out the other end being a good theoretician."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 2 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 168 MCSC So education â€“ education I would define as something that is for blood and I would say that many things pass under the heading of education which aren't. I'm not talking if â€“ this is a good English dictionary definition, you see? Education means learning or knowing or accomplishing the knowingness of a certain subject, you see? Well, let's take that as a flat-out definition. If one is educated in a subject, then he knows that subject, you see? See, you know, exclamation point, he knows the subject. He's able to accomplish the actions which are taught in that subject, he's able to accomplish the results which are taught in that subject, don't you see? That's education. Now, to call the modern school system \"education,\" then, is quite laughable, because this poor little kid gets in there and they â€“ they keep the kid's time occupied. Let's go down to that. Well now, that doesn't seem to me to have to have anything to do with education what-soever, to keep the child's time occupied. And yet a survey of this field demonstrates that the best reason for formal education of youth and so on is to give their mothers a break. That's the fact. That's the way they look in that direction. Well, what is this kid being taught to do? And right away, then, you see what your quarrel with young schooling is. He's not being taught to do anything, see? VoilÃ ! So it isn't education. You see, if you just took the word in its pure definition, with an exclamation point, you know, \"educated!\" well, this has come to mean a sort of an esoteric fly-around that he â€“ well, what? So you say, \"This fellow was educated.\" You say, \"He was educated at Oxford.\" Well, what is this? All right, good, he was educated at Oxford, fine, he's an Oxford man. Good. We expect certain stamps and social reactions and so forth. All right. If he was edu-cated to be a gentleman â€“ good! So he's a pro gentleman. See? Fine. Fine. But you can't really disassociate education from an active doingness and a role and a professionalism, you see? It's not possible to disassociate this, to take this over, so we say, \"Well, we wanted to give him a good education, not so that he could do anything, but...\" Well, that is immediately a contradiction. That's saying, \"We must pick up all the white peas by leaving all the white peas on the ground.\" You can't do that, you see? You can't just \"edu-cate\" somebody without any end in view. It â€“ because then he wouldn't be educated, don't you see? And that is the modern quarrel. We have the largest budget, next to armaments, in the world, is child education. That's a big budget. And I don't care if the teachers all say they're underpaid and everything â€“ which they are. It is, nevertheless, a fabulous piece of money which is spent in this particular direction. When you look at it all the way up the line and when you include under that heading of expense all the training, all the educational actions that are done in this world, you see that there's a terrific investment. Now, practically everyone in the Western world has had a considerable sum invested in them to become educated. That's a considerable sum. It runs into the thousands of pounds; whichever way you want to look at it. It runs into the many, many thousands of dollars. By the time a young man has gotten through college, for instance, he stands, educationally, at something on the order of the ten-thousand dollar mark, or did ten years ago; that's an old figure. And he probably stands at a higher figure today. That's a lot of money to invest in a man â€“ for maybe no result."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 3 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 169 MCSC All right, so a lot has been spent upon his education but has he become educated? Male voice: No. Yeah, and that's the quarrel. See, there was â€“ a lot is spent on his education but he did-n't get educated. I was rather shocked to find, the other day, that my young'uns couldn't write their name. They're being \"educated\" (quote) (unquote) at a remarkable rate of speed, but they couldn't sign their name. I wouldn't say that then they were being taught to write. They were not ed... being educated in how to write. No matter what they were doing, no matter how many \"traveling ovals\" they were making, if it didn't wind up with the end product of being able to sign their names â€“ well, I should think that would be one of the first things that some teacher would think about. They'd say, \"Well, you know, a kid should be able to sign his name.\" Because, frankly, that is almost the basic test of literacy. The fellow that stumps aboard ship and has to make an 'X' on the articles is instantly and immediately considered to be illiterate. Well, maybe he could write in a flowing, copper-plate hand everything else, but if he couldn't sign his name he'd have a hard time convincing people he wasn't illiterate. So it would seem to me to be first things first, and when I found this out I caused quite a storm by insisting that they learn how to sign their names. They â€“ even the children got quite upset. It hadn't occurred to them that if they knew how to write they should be able to sign their names. They couldn't do it. So there's a lot of holes left along the line. Now, you take arithmetic. Well, this is sort of taught as a handy, handy thing that is â€“ you need so that you won't get shortchanged. I think that's just about the wildest short look at any subject I ever had anything to do with. And yet I'm sure that that is the basic reason why it is taught, because I've had children explain to me, patiently, this one point. So this has been taught to them as the reason they were learning arithmetic is so they wouldn't be short-changed. Nobody ever tells them that there's another way not to have to worry about that, is also make enough money. Well, look at it. If you â€“ if you made enough money, you wouldn't have to know arithmetic, because it wouldn't worry you if you were shortchanged. See, there are other ways to get around this. I mean â€“ so therefore, there is some other route on this business of being shortchanged, although I offer that one as simply a ridiculous one, it's nev-ertheless quite a factual one. Midas never worried about being shortchanged. So, what have we got here in terms of arithmetical education? Well, I defy the bulk of the teachers who are teaching arithmetic to give you much of an end product for knowing arithmetic. They'd say, \"Well, uh-uh-uh-um â€“ well, of course, he has to have it because it's a fundamental in so many other subjects.\" Well, all right. Now we're talking about teaching other subjects. Well, we're not inter-ested in other subjects, we are talking about arithmetic. How about this thing called arithme-tic? Well, we wonder why people don't know arithmetic. Well, he can't be educated in it be-cause it has no end product. The fellow says, \"I don't want to be an accountant. I don't want to be a bookkeeper. I can learn to count on my fingers so I don't get shortchanged.\" Elementary. Why learn arithmetic?"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 4 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 170 MCSC \"Well,\" you say, \"well, you have to have it to learn other su...\" \"No, no, no, no. Let's talk about education and arithmetic. Let's not go worrying about other subjects.\" \"Yeah, well, if you put a restriction like that on the argument,\" they would say, \"of course nobody can argue with you.\" And you say, \"That's the point. Who wants to be argued with?\" The point I'm making here is that arithmetic, having no finite end in itself â€“ of course, it has â€“ it has finite ends, and it could be described â€“ but having no described, finite end in itself is therefore almost impossible to teach. And you have nearly everybody doing very badly in their grammar schools on arithmetic because it itself is not a subject, so therefore no one can become educated. It's become more and more â€“ this is very manifest in the university â€“ I'm not talking over your heads here, this is something that's very, very bang! It's very obvious. You get into a university, you're all the time having problems being shoved under your nose in engineering schools that you're supposed to do by algebra; you're always having problems shoved under your nose that you're supposed to do with calculus, any one of which is solvable by sight arithmetic. That's something to think about. Now, what has happened here? Well, arithmetic, not being a subject in itself, and be-ing a somewhat degraced and degraded subject, has gradually shrunk and is ceasing to be a subject, but is simply an auxiliary subject which moves up into higher mathematics. And if you don't know arithmetic, you can't do higher mathematics. That's the way it's represented, more or less, to the engineer. Well, I was quite interested in old McGuffeys Readers at one time to find out how adept at arithmetic somebody was expected to be in 1888. The problems which they were expected to solve in arithmetic were the problems of algebra. And they were expected to solve these with arithmetic. And what do you know? It was a great revelation to me that it was very possible to solve these algebraic problems with their \"Xs\" and \"Ys\" and all that sort of thing by common, ordinary, garden-variety arithmetic. And it made a lot better sense â€“ made a lot better sense. I looked at this and I've run into some old-timers who could take a column of figures about five figures wide and about ten figures tall and add them up in a pe-culiar way, which was very peculiar to me, of some kind of a crisscross addition that I would be quite at a loss to explain to you how it was done, but arrive with almost an immediate an-swer. And you say, \"How did they do that?\" \"Well,\" they say, \"it's very simple. You see, nine added to something gives you itself, so all you do is go down the column and find all the combinations which make nine and for-get those, and you add the remainder and you get the total.\" What do you know, you know? Well, of course, that's just tricky stuff, but all this at one time was part and parcel to arithmetic and it's not here anymore in arithmetic. Where did it go? Well, you must have a dying subject. Why is it dying? Nobody is delineating its pur-pose to the student of it. No matter if some â€“ no matter if some purpose does exist in it, that's"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 5 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 171 MCSC beside the point. Yes, you could figure out lots of purposes of it, but all you have to know is, is nobody is delineating, marking out, showing the purpose of that subject to the student so one doesn't consider that he becomes educated in arithmetic. Arithmetic is just some auxiliary subject that keeps you from being shortchanged. So that as the purpose of a subject deteriorates in its advertisement or rendition â€“ as the purpose of a subject deteriorates â€“ the subject itself also falls away. Sounds like a very â€“ a very strange sort of a thing to give you, but as the purpose of a subject falls away, why, so does the subject disappear from the ken of man. Manufacture of buggy whips? Go around and try to find somebody today who knows all about the manufacture of buggy whips. There's probably a couple of boys sitting around in England who know the subject backwards and forwards and who make all the circus whips. See, there are practically no more whips made. Dying, because it has no purpose. Nobody's got any horses to flip buggy whips over, see? So becoming educated in how to manufacture whips today would sort of be an end â€“ a dead end. It would not be a very productive career. Now, that doesn't sound very amplified, but let's take it in reverse and at once it will make a great deal of sense. Then, a subject for which the purpose is not delineated will die away, not only in the society but in the individual. Both of those two â€“ those statements are true. The first one is so true that it's almost nonsense. But the other one is not nonsense and it's not been detected. If the individual to whom you are teaching this subject has not got the purpose of this subject, then that subject will die away in that individual. It might have a tre-mendous purpose, but if the purpose of the subject is not being taught to the individual, he's had it. Do you see? So you can get the difference between a live study and a dead study. A live study is one which has purpose, has a use; and a dead study is one that hasn't any use. And the way you make a live study into a dead study is dual: Its use dies away as in buggy whips or one simply omits it as part of the educational process. And it will make the subject die away, not only in the individual but the society; not only in the society but the individual. Do you see that? And we have to assume that a person cannot become educated, just by the definition of the word \"education\" as I have been stressing it here, in a dead subject because it has no end product. So you find these things become obsessive. Somebody starts to study \"miniatures painted in Holland by blind painters.\" Well now, miniatures painted in Holland, we've got some use for that. But \"miniatures painted in Holland by blind painters,\" well, we would sort of look around for quite a while before we found any use for this particular subject. Oh, you could find uses for it, but don't get yourself all cluttered up on â€“ on introducing your ingenuity to supply the lack in an educational system that â€“ because by being reasonable, you cripple yourself. It's a question of \"What is there?\" not a question of \"What could we dream up to put there?\" Oh, we could dream up some subjects, but let's just say this boy is studying this eso-teric study â€“ strange, weird, useless, nowhere. Do you know that he can easily become ob-sessed with it? He has no purpose for it, no use for it and so, of course, it's impossible for him"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 6 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 172 MCSC to become educated in it because he can never display his virtuosity. He can never display its use. Who would listen? He can't even tell his friends. They'd say, \"This, guy is a ruddy crank! He goes around talking all the time...\" Somewhat like your families and so forth have occa-sionally regarded you on the subject of Scientology. You're over their heads, you see? But much worse than that â€“ much worse than that, we would get it on this sort of a basis, see. No-body knows what he is talking about and nobody knows why he is studying it and it isn't of any use and it's not of much interest anyway. Well, this poor bloke can never communicate it. He can never communicate it for the best reason that communication becomes difficult: No-body will listen. Did you ever think about communication being difficult because nobody listens? Well, just run this into the field of education. If the subject doesn't exist and has no use and has no application and has no this and has no that, well, to that degree their listening ceases because it isn't of any use to them, either. He's studying miniatures painted by blind painters in Hol-land. People sort of say, \"Well, I could understand his studying miniatures painted in Hol-land... I think he's nuts!\" That would be the immediate conclusion, don't you see? Well, your families look at you sometimes, where you have run into this and collided with this head-on, and people wouldn't listen to you on the subject of Scientology or were impatient with you for studying it, and that was because you weren't talking to them about the purpose of Scientology. And you didn't talk to them about the purpose of Scientology within the framework of what it could do for them personally. Now you are coming right on close to home. Your mother might have been interested if she heard what it had done for you personally because she's interested in you. But even your mother would conceive it to be a subject only when a purpose was delineated. Now we'll go a bit â€“ a little bit further: when the purpose that was delineated could be executed to any degree. You know, the purpose you've given it could be executed to any degree. Now, your next stage is, is they don't believe it. See, you could give them the purpose but they don't be-lieve it. In other words, the purpose isn't real to them. So you not only have delineated the purpose but you have delineated it to them in such a way that it is â€“ seems to be an attainable purpose. An attainable or doable purpose. So we walk up to this bird and we say â€“ we say to this bird, \"Your â€“ your interest in this subject should be very great because this subject will make you a Clear.\" He immediately says, \"What wall?\" because it's not an understandable purpose, see? The purpose ceases to be understandable when the goal does not seem to him to be attainable or valuable. And it can cease to be attainable or valuable merely because it isn't understood. So for an educational subject to exist and continue to be a subject in which one can become educated, or if you ever expect anybody to ever be educated in the subject â€“ let me put it that way â€“ for it to continue to exist, for it to survive, it has to have a purpose which can be seen to be an attainable action. It has to be attainable. The purpose must be attainable. Now, the value of a subject â€“ the value of a subject depends, simply and utterly, upon the value of attaining that stated purpose. How valuable is it to attain that particular stated"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 7 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 173 MCSC purpose? Is it valuable to be able to accomplish this or is it not valuable to be able to accom-plish this? And to that degree a subject appears to be a fringe subject or a vital subject. So the woof and warp of the culture is made up of educations which are subdivisible â€“ that's the woof and warp of a culture... (Woof and warp: rug term. Try not to put too many words on the line, here. The woof goes that way and the warp goes that way, see?) It's â€“ the make-up of a culture is subdivisible into two general types of education. A culture is held together solely and only by education. Whether that education is accomplished by experience or by teaching, a culture, as a whole, is the summation of its education. And those are two divisions to the educations of a culture, and one of those are the vital ones and the other one is the \"nice\" ones. Now, an education achieved is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable. An education is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable. And it frankly is not remunerated one penny more. Sometimes they falsely remu-nerate, but not often. And that tells you that there must be some mighty funny, funny things, because there are some things in the society â€“ because this rule I've just given you is true and the society at large then must be misunderstood to some degree because there's several educa-tions in the subject at large which are remunerated to an enormous extent which are not held by certain educational authorities to be valuable. Public must like to be fooled. They're always paying con men of some kind or another. There must be some real value in having hope shot up to the moon in the stock market be-cause those birds are very often paid off heavily. You could reevaluate the society on the ba-sis of what I've given you. Yes, you could say, \"Well, the society makes mistakes in this di-rection. Yes, the society is lied to.\" Well, I don't think the society makes mistakes in this di-rection. That's a new thought, isn't it? Do you know that the most valuable prof... single tech-nical profession in the United States is burying people? Hm, very highly paid! They've man-aged to convince everybody that the loved one should be in sealed bronze caskets and in con-crete and steel vaults outside the caskets so that seepage won't trouble your loved ones. And they had the whole country absolutely convinced that this was Congressional law, that it was local law. And a recent Congressional investigation disclosed this fact and they found out that there isn't any statutes in the United States that compels anybody in the United States to be buried even in a board coffin. There are statutes that require them to be buried, but there is not even a statute that requires them to be embalmed. So you roll Aunt Agnes up in a blanket and dump her in a hole. [laughter] As long as you've got a death certificate, man, that's all you need. So, this particular profession â€“ this particular profession was selling what? They were sort of selling some weird life after death, weren't they? They were akin to some religious cult or something like that. And it was obvious that people did buy life after death. And we find out that one of the most expensive things you could do in Egypt was to die. That was a very expensive thing and that's gotten that way in the United States today. It's very costly to die. By the time they get through with you, man, well, you've got no estate left. But this is very peculiar. The society remunerates this and rewards it. Well, it's just about the most educated art you ever had anything to do with in your life. Undertaking is a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 8 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 174 MCSC supereducated art and the society of undertakers themselves â€“ \"morticians,\" they like to refer to themselves â€“ these birds run their own schools and their own technology and that sort of thing and they really hammer-pound it in. And the final end product is very visible. But these guys are quite sharpies. I know, because back in the days when I was having a ball around New York as a writer, why, the medical examiner â€“ that's what they've begun to call the coro-ner around New York now â€“ they changed their names, too â€“ the medical examiner of New York was a particular pal of mine. He was the coroner of the city of New York and one of the nicest blokes you ever had anything to do with. He'd embalmed personally, with his own paws, 15,000 corpses. I got interested in this particular field by being sent in his direction to do a series of stories about undetectable crime and of course I wound up in the lap of the medical examiner of the city of New York and he started my crime education on the subject. And of course, this was in the field of what they call forensic or legal medicine. And this boy, he had it all at his finger tips and so forth. But the casualness with which he could roll off all of these various things showed a great familiarity with the subject. This was not an esoteric subject. This had to do with lots of dead bodies which had been strewn all over the place in various states of dishabille, various states of knocked-about. They were untidy at times. This was quite a boy. And oddly enough, he conceived that he was not acceptable socially. And I was very acceptable socially, so he and I formed a very good partnership, because he always liked to â€“ if I was going anyplace and asked him if he'd like to come along and so forth, he was there on a rocket plane, you see? Right away, quick! But there wasn't anything â€“ there wasn't anything that was wrong with this bird. He had perfect manners, he was a perfect gentleman and so forth. But part of his education was that his sub-ject was looked down on and therefore he felt he was socially unacceptable and so forth. Well, I don't know. A lot of people â€“ lot of people look down on â€“ street sweepers think they're looked down on and so forth, but street sweepers keep the streets swept clean, don't they? Hm? Well, this guy obviously was keeping the streets of New York from being littered with decomposing corpses. And oh, I used to see him every once in a while. When I was president of one of the writing societies there and so forth, why, he used to come over there quite regularly and he'd give detective writers talks if I'd ask him to and so forth. And they would go away from the luncheon or something like that the weirdest shades of green. [laughter, laughs] But man, here was â€“ here was data. Here was data. And it had a very definite end product, if only in the field of detection. A guy like that could take one look at a corpse and he'd say \"Carbon monoxide, been dead about three hours.\" \"Cyanide.\" \"Arsenic.\" This, that, the other thing. Brrrrrr, boom! \"Oh, I'd say that was botulinus poisoning, Joe. Yeah, yeah. Well, put him on the slab and we'll run a â€“ we'll run a test on it, do an autopsy. Well, I'm pretty sure that's just botulinus, you know some â€“ eating green beans in the wrong time of the year that had been in the icebox too long. That's â€“ looks like that's what that is to me.\" Almost always just dead on the button, you see? This was art, the art of observation, the world of death. But even in the days of Egypt this art was not accorded any social status. The boys who embalmed the bodies down in the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 9 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 175 MCSC deadhouse and so forth were actually never even permitted to leave the deadhouse. They were held in. But here's this terrific, terrific amount of art, terrific amount of detail, terrific amount of technicality, terrific amount of stuff and it's come right straight down through these cul-tures from the days of ancient Egypt, and it is totally uninterrupted. It's interesting that such a bird as this could sit down and discuss the relative preservation qualities of modern embalm-ing and Egyptian embalming. And he was certain he was doing better these days than the Egyptians were. It's the first time I'd ever heard that, because we've seen these Egyptian mummies in univer... in university museums and that sort of thing, and we've seen these things around and they're still there, all wrapped up and so forth. But his attitude toward it was the attitude of a true professional: \"Well, their features hadn't been preserved and their coloring was bad.\" That's what he said to me one day, so forth. \"Yeah, the next time you're down in the museum, Ron,\" he said, \"if you don't believe it, if you don't believe that we're way ahead of them these days, you just take a look at one of those mummies. Features haven't been preserved and coloring is bad.\" And I said, \"But man! Those guys â€“ those guys have been dead for thousands of years!\" And he said, \"Well, in a few thousand years one of mine will have been, too.\" And he said, \"His features won't be bad, and his coloring will be good.\" He said, \"We can do a better job than\" â€“ almost â€“ \"we used to do.\" Well now, here's a steady â€“ I'm talking to you about a relatively debased profession, but a highly remunerated one. And keeping the bodies off the streets and prettying up the loved ones and so forth is very highly paid. Preservation of memory and so forth is a very highly paid profession. And it has been continuous â€“ it has been continuous for a very long time without its know-how dying away. Wherever there's been a civilization, they seem to have known the data of the last civilization on this, no matter how many wars have swept across the top of it and they deal it off the cuff and so forth. Why, even the ancient tribal rites, they would go find a dry cave that would automatically embalm the corpses of their loved ones. So here's this â€“ here's this very interesting technical line. That's a technical line, man. What you have to do in order to keep a corpse from going bad and what you have to do to and know about what killed this person and what he died of, so that you won't get all mixed up in your embalming activities and what you have to do in order to straighten all this out, or so forth. And how you're supposed to bury them and exactly how you're supposed to handle the grieving family and exactly how you were supposed to sell them the most for the â€“ for the most, you know? These are technologies, no matter which way you look at it. They are very broad and they are very prec... exact and boy, do they wind up with a finite result! You know? You've got the body, you embalm it, you bury it, you collect your money. Thud! Very easily understood. So that we would say that the subject is â€“ a subject is not only remunerated to the de-gree of its need but also to the degree that it is understood by the public at large. It's remuner-ated to the degree that it is understood. All right now. How about this longevity? How about this longevity? The continuing need of a purpose can then preserve a subject. The continuing need of the subject can preserve"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 10 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 176 MCSC the subject. If the subject continues to be needed, it will be preserved; that's a corollary of what I just gave you a few minutes ago. But the length of time that it gets preserved is entirely dependent upon the need of and the relay of its technology. You see, you must have the tech-nology continue to be needed and the technology must also be relayed. If it continues to be needed it will be also relayed, which is all very â€“ very fascinating; rather obvious. But where you get a subject coming on down the line â€“ where you get a subject com-ing on down the line across the millennia and so forth, it is only because its purpose is carried with it. Its purpose has gone along with it and its purpose is understood. Now, one could de-stroy that subject by destroying its purpose â€“ no longer needed, you see â€“ or by destroying the relay of its technology in some fashion or another; or in being too insistent or too â€“ too force-ful in relaying its technology and tacking lots of other things to its technology which didn't belong on it. In other words, \"Before you can study engineering, you must have had a gram-mar school education, a high school education, gone to finishing school and learned how to knit.\" I can expect that will be about the next one, see? You're not going to have any engineers after a while; all the bridges will start to fall down. Well, one of the reasons why you won't have any engineers after a while is very ele-mentary, and it's contained in our own technology, but only in our own technology, the reason for this. And that is, you've given him too much takeoff. He's had too much of a run on take-off and â€“ and the longer in an â€“ in education â€“ let's get back on education now â€“ the longer it takes to approach the education, the more opportunity there is for tacks on the runway. We could probably state that in a much more easily expressed way, but that's about the way it is. If this character is taking off, taking off, taking off, taking off, he's running on the runway, he's trying to get up speed, everybody is saying, \"Well, you mustn't pull back on the stick yet. You must stay there on the runway and keep running on the runway, ready to take off, ready to take off, ready to take off, ready to take off.\" Well, by the time he's done this for about forty-five years and finds out he isn't off the ground, he doesn't take off. The reason for that is, is the number of opportunities to fail are directly proportional to the length of the approach. That's a law: Number of opportunities to fail are directly propor-tional to the length of approach, or length of time that it is going to take to get up to where you're going to study this thing. Now, that law is balanced by the fact that if you don't study something by gradients, a person can get into a mess by going into too high a gradient as I was talking about the other day. He went too steep, too quick. So there's â€“ somewhere there is a proper length runway for any subject. It's a runway of the right length for the subject. A runway of the right length for the subject, then, would not be so long that it need-lessly multiplies the opportunities for failure and it had better not be so short that a person jumps a gradient and gets himself into a confusion. And what is the right length of a runway for any given subject? How much preparatory action should there be or how long should a course of study be and all of those things, those questions, are answered in this: Well, it should not be so long that it needlessly oppor... multiplies opportunities for failure and it should not be so short that it takes a person up too steep."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 11 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 177 MCSC He'll fall off on his nose, like we used to do when I was in flying clubs in college. There's many a sad young man would pull back on the stick too quick. The evolution there was a \"whipstall.\" Called a \"whipstall\" â€“ technical term, aviation â€“ you come up the line and you â€“ there isn't enough forward speed to sustain the vacuum on the top of the wings, and you have just never seen an aircraft do anything quite as sickeningly funny as it does in a whip-stall. It's flying along very, very nicely, and all of a sudden it's flying too slow, there's no longer any vacuum above the wing and it goes \"Whooof!\" It is fast! It's not for nothing it was called a whipstall. And of course, when you're only about 100 feet above the runway or some-thing like that, and the edge of the field and so on, why, it â€“ you don't develop enough speed in the process of falling to then be able to pull back on the stick and pull out of it. What they do is send a notice to your folks and get in touch with my old friend the medical examiner of New York. Anyway, that's what happens to a student, see? He gets himself into a state of overcon-fidence or something like this and he pulls back on the stick and he hasn't had a long enough runway, he hasn't developed his speed, don't you see? In other words, he goes into too steep a gradient. Now, Mary Sue did it the other night. She's studying typewriting, of all things. She typewrites pretty well, but she's decided â€“ started to do touch-typing. And she's going to make the grade on the subject of touch-typing, hammer-pound â€“ bang! And it's quite interesting. I ran an educational process on her for a very, very short period of time on this subject and busted the dam on this. I don't know that she's noticed it and â€“ she isn't here just now; she wound up with lawyers, so â€“ but she probably hadn't noticed that there is a coordination be-tween her sudden interest in learning to touch-type and breaking the barrier on one of the old \"too long a runway\" propositions and \"too short a gradient,\" too. I broke that with a process and now she's very interested in learning touch-typing and she's spending about an hour a night, with everything else she's got to do, sitting there hammer-pounding on a machine on a touch-typing basis. This is very difficult, because at the same time she uses the typewriter during the remaining hours to hunt and punch out notes, you see? So on the one hand she's busy touch-typing, you see, and the next, why, she's hunting and punching it out, you see, doing her work. And then she'll get back and she'll be touch-typing away. I threw her. I gave her a metronome the other night and she suddenly conceived that her rhythm was off, which it was, and so forth. And she couldn't do anything with that metro-nome running. She said she had to shut that off right now. It was too high a gradient. But she went onto the gradient of two rows of keys before she had licked one row of keys. Now, you see what I mean by too tight a gradient? This was too tough, see? And boy, did she whipstall! She whipstalled right now. And she just went into a total confusion. But knowing, now â€“ yesteryear she simply would have quit; that would have been that â€“ but knowing, now, the technology that we â€“ that I've managed to get together here on the subject of education, she sits back and says, \"Now, let's see, what did I do? Oh, yeah. Well, this is just too tough a gradient. I just went up on too high a gradient.\" She went back to one row, patter, ta-patter, ta-patter, ta-patter and then went over onto two rows and she had it, see? See, she â€“ in other words, she moved up over that gradient smoothly."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 12 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 178 MCSC So a person knowing this can actually guide his own traffic through very nicely. No-body had to tell her that, don't you see? All right. Then an educational subject is simply that something that winds up in a do-ingness and is approached by the process of getting educated in it. Now, that's a hell of a thing to have to say! But you know, hardly anybody really knows this. They don't really know it. They give it lip service all the time, but they're always engaging in activities which they do very badly and fail at like crazy and it never occurs to them they've never been educated in the subject. I'll tell you something used to drive me stark, staring mad, down in Hollywood. Every director, every supervisor and as far as that's concerned, every actor on the set, they all knew how to be a writer. They knew â€“ knew how to â€“ they knew writing. They could all write sto-ries. The place was just lousy with writers. You want to know why Hollywood never got out of kindergarten on stories; that's just because of it. They never recognized that it's a technol-ogy; it's a professional technology which is studied like crazy. It has more ins and outs and ramifications; actually it has quite a terminology. But all these birds knew they knew how to write. It wasn't anything you ever had to study, so of course if they did get a pro in their midst â€“ and Hollywood developed very few professional writers, in fact it developed no pro-fessional writers. They come in from elsewhere and go to pieces. Well, the process is done by everybody there knowing the profession of the fellow who just arrived. See, he's a writer, he's a professional, he arrives, everybody else knows his profession. Well, now, he won't give the movies the beingness necessary to realize that maybe movie writing has a few tricks of the trade, too, so of course he looks a little bit stupid to these people, whereas he's not stupid at all. He just hasn't learned that particular specialty of his own subject, which he could learn rather rapidly. And Hollywood, not realizing this, never bothers to teach him how to write for Hollywood. And they have never found out that it's nec-essary to be educated to know how to write. So here's this wild profession which is sometimes remunerated to a fantastic degree and in which you can very easily starve to death and in which people grant you fantastic quantities of beingness and in which people ignore you utterly. So it is through all kinds of contradictions. What is a professional writer? Well, by test he's somebody who is successful and is getting his stuff published or at least read or viewed. But of all the subjects of the arts, this is the wildest one to have anything to do with because nobody grants it the beingness of having any technology. And yet the boy who succeeds â€“ you would be very interested â€“ the boy who succeeds is not just somebody who wandered in with an idea. You go up to the Screen Writers Guild and you for â€“ you find out that the reason education in writing has gotten a bad name is be-cause it's taught in American universities. They have gone out and hired a bunch of failed writers. And failed writers either become editors or professors. And they dramatize their fail-ure, by the way, and they try to make a writer fail. And I've never seen one do anything else. I beg your pardon, there have been a few that worked like mad, they were tremendously suc-cessful, whatever they had to do with succeeded and that sort of thing. But they weren't under the idea that they were writers. All these other birds still had this wild idea that they were"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 13 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 179 MCSC kind of writers, but here they were, editing, see? They weren't trained in it or if they had been trained in it, they'd failed at it. Here's a chance subject. The whole society seems to run, to some degree, on the ro-mances and imaginations and so forth of the writer. But you talk about a hidden piece of technical training. Well, the technical training of this field doesn't exist. If a professional writer wants a good laugh, if he wants just to lie right down in the aisle and laugh and laugh and laugh until his sides are sore, all he needs to do is read the curriculum of the professional writing classes of Princeton, for instance. You just double up in a ball. I mean, you â€“ you can't help it. And I took the â€“ a professional writing class at Harvard one time, and put them into paralysis. And I was told by the professor later, they never did recover. I made the mistake â€“ I was very young and very brash and of course when you're in-vited to lecture on your own subject, you see, at some very esoteric institution of this particu-lar character, it rather goes to your head, and you chuck your weight around, you know? Par-ticularly if you're very young and brash and me. [laughter] And so I stood up in front of this writing class, and I said to them, \"I noticed your current subject here is style. Now, no writer really knows whether he has a style or not until he has sat down,\" and I was being very rea-sonable, \"until he's sat down and written a couple of hundred thousand words. And by the time he's done that, he can probably detect in his work whether or not he has a style.\" From the professional writer's viewpoint this is the most reasonable statement ever made by any-body, because a pro, even â€“ even Dickens would just think nothing of getting out a hundred thousand words in a month, see? Nothing! I don't know where all this idea came from that they all write painfully with their blood while twisted in agony, see? They don't. They don't at all. If it took somebody seven years to write a great work, it's because he was drunk six and a half. [laughter] They write well, they write easily, and they write facilely. For instance, most of Dickens' stuff was writ-ten at the rate of 5,000 words a day. At one time I worked it out and handed it over to the press and it got national press. You saw that story kicking around and so forth. They thought less of his work then, of course, I suppose. But a writer can write. What better definition do you have for it, see? He can write easily, facilely and rapidly. Well, all right, I said this to those poor blokes sitting there in their classroom and I no-ticed there was a sort of a shock went through the classroom. And it was very shortly after that, that I concluded my lecture and I didn't get hardly any applause. They were all sitting there sort of like statues, stunned. They didn't even bother to get up at the end of the bell. And finally one or two of them turned around to one or two of them, they muttered something or other. And the professor, who was a pretty good bloke, he came back and got me off the ros-trum and walking out with me and so forth, and he said, \"Well, you sure raised hell with that.\" And I said, \"Why? For pity's sakes, why? What is this all about?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"they â€“ they write 1500 words a semester.\" And those people were upset, man! I was back there again, and that whole class, no-body even would speak to me. They were upset! They had thrown me overboard. I couldn't"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 14 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 180 MCSC possibly be a pro, you see? But yet my stuff was on the newsstands. But this must be a fluke. Something was wrong, because the data I'd given them must be wrong. These birds had never been told that they should have to write! They were all being taught to be writers, but nobody had ever said to them: \"Brother, write!\" You understand? And I was the first one to announce to that class that were going into their fourth year that a writer should write. I don't know what a writer was supposed to do. He was supposed to dis-cuss or he was supposed to do this or supposed to do that, but they â€“ commercialism has a dirty word connected with it to such people and so forth. Why? It means hard work! They don't disdain money. Never get those people wrong. They don't disdain anything that goes with it. They don't disdain being commercial or being anything else. It isn't their art they're holding on to. It's hard work to produce, to them. This is just too tough. So they had studied for four years and had not covered their first gradient, which is that you do it! \"We are now teaching you about ceramics. In the field of ceramics you make pottery and glass and other such objects. By the end of this course it will be expected that you will facilely and easily be able to make bits and pieces of pottery and tell things that are wrong with pieces of pottery that are not well made and so forth and you will know the technology of making pottery.\" Somebody comes along and says, \"Well, you're â€“ you're really teaching a polytechnic subject,\" or something. No, no, man. Writing is simply cutting down trees, running Bulldoz-ers, there's many a man out there digging a ditch that hasn't got the physical energy it takes to write. That's right. It's just another job. And when approached in that fashion, becomes rea-sonable and comprehensible and understandable, and you â€“ then you sit down. A writer isn't somebody who wears a red fez hat and blue slippers and smokes a pipe and gazes out the window. A writer is somebody who sits down to a desk with a pencil and a piece of paper or with a typewriter with some paper in it and he writes. What does he write? He writes what will be published and what will sell and what people will look at, because by definition a subject has to be accepted by the society in which it exists for it to be a profes-sional subject. Now, this is awful cold-blooded, hard-eyed looking. That's right down to earth. Now, I don't exaggerate when I say in a university they don't say this. The best professors will stand around and say, \"Well now, when you're out in the field some day, and you're looking down that transit, don't blame me if you haven't got it level.\" No, they don't teach that way. They hand them a transit after class and tell them to go survey something and don't even give them a lecture on what the transit is, because it's some nasty object. No, the tools of the trade are transits. Engineering: the tools of the trade are levels; the tools of the trade are big pieces of drawing paper and blueprints and bricks and pieces of steel and machines and bulldozers and tough foremen and shady contractors. These are the tools of the trade. They don't teach any course in \"How to Keep Your Own Ethics While Working for the Bide-a-Wee Construction Company.\" They're not real, in other words. They've gone into some other never-never land."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 15 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 181 MCSC So that was how I shocked the short story course at Harvard. And I never could figure out exactly why and how I had shocked them. It wasn't that I had told them too many words. That I assumed for a long time, but I know now, in studying education, what I had done. What I had done is simply told them that, \"If you're studying writing, you write. You're expected to write. You're expected to turn out wordage.\" And it probably wasn't even in the phrase, \"You won't know a style,\" because my whole talk was devoted to this single idea. But it was when I finally gave them a quantity, right after what I meant by \"words on a piece of paper.\" I remember standing up there on the rostrum calculating it rather rapidly. I said, \"Well, I'll get some low figure that anybody in his right mind would be able to do in a few weeks, you know, and it won't buffalo anybody.\" So I said: \"A couple of hundred thou-sand words,\" you know? \"Gaaargh!\" see? Well, that was what they went: \"Gaargh!\" But that isn't what the shock was contained in. The shock was contained in the fact that my whole ad-dress to the subject of writing is that you wrote and that a writer writes. And that was what the shock was in. If you're going to be educated in a subject, you should be able to do it. Now, it's not a dirty word to do things. Now, you don't have to go on obsessively doing this the rest of your life. It is very confusing in this course that I've just taught. I've just been taught. The very best of these teachers have been thoroughly grounded in theory, and have worked like madmen with lots of doingness and lots of ramifications of it in their own field. Now, when you've got that combination, you've got a fellow, when he said something is so, there was something very believable about it because it was very right. It was very recognizable â€“ he might not even know how to write well, but he could express this because it was his own subject and he knew what he was talking about. Now you've got somebody who couldn't do it and that would show up â€“ gahhh! Huge lights going up in all directions; the impracticalities of it, don't you see this? This bird â€“ it's not the right emphasis. He doesn't tell you about the right things in the subject. He tells you about something that he thinks might be interesting, but he himself, through experience, doesn't know whether it would ever be useful or not, see? Makes a big thing out of some little thing, don't you see? I had one the other day â€“ it slips my mind right now, on â€“ in this course. It had some-thing to do with the fact the guy was just tearing â€“ oh, yes! Yes! It was projection. It was the projection of transparencies. And if you had a screen six feet away, why â€“ and a screen twelve feet away, then your light and density of the transparency â€“ your light was, of course, much less on the screen twelve feet away for â€“ not only because the footage was increased, but be-cause it was more distant and therefore the density of the transparency was very important for projection. And transparencies had to be very, very carefully developed and printed and so forth, in their positive form, in order to overcome these differences of â€“ I was â€“ it was one of these boys. He was a little more esoteric than the others. Well boy, he was talking right up a... and Reg, did we have any trouble projecting any old kind of a transparency over there at the circus in the dead black of an open room at an unthinkable distance, up to a size of twelve by twelve?"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 16 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 182 MCSC Well, if you'd listened to this guy very carefully you would have gotten the impression through... he, of course, didn't have the experience; he never had probably given a lantern slide in his life. You know, it's an old technology, lantern slide shows. It is the immediate grandpappy of the cinema, see? But this boy had probably never given one, so he gives this terrific stress of how careful you've got to be to get this point at which â€“ it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how thick a transparency is, as long as it's a viewable transparency. It doesn't matter how dense it is or how thick it is or how hard it is to look through, if it's too far away, get a brighter light. And the thing has a solution. That's all. Put another lamp in it. You don't do it in the darkroom, in other words. You do it while you're projecting it, but he didn't know this fact so he makes this big, labored halfpage that you have to sweat through about printing transparencies and making sure that you know beforehand at what dis-tance they're going to be projected, because it makes so much difference between the â€“ oh, no! You get the idea? Now, if this bird had been â€“ had ever done this or had had much to do with this, he wouldn't make a mistake like that. So you â€“ what you do is get wrong emphasis. So true knowledge will give a correct emphasis and only a theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis. And I imagine the universities by this time are absolutely strewn with wrong emphasis. And you can keep moving something farther and further afield with wrong emphasis, up to a point of where the technology practically gets lost. Wrong emphasis, wrong emphasis, wrong emphasis! Maddening! In other words, \"Be very careful, now, about the varnish on your E-Meter. Now, E-Meters are varnished and we're going to go through, now, the next three weeks of study on the manufacture of varnishes for E-Meters.\" Well, it's a matter of how unreal can you get? It doesn't have anything to do with the subject matter at all. Just because there is some varnish in a session â€“ it probably never oc-curred to you till this moment there was any varnish in a session. [laughter] Somebody makes a big deal out of this, you see? He says â€“ he figures out, because varnish is shiny, he figures out that light falling on this might possibly influence the preclear into being distracted by the meter. He's read someplace that something or other, you see? He's figured out that this must be true, but actually an experienced auditor would tell you that he has never had this com-plaint from any pc every place, so it's not a problem, so why solve it? So these unrealities simply consist of this, and this is a very precise definition. Unreal-ities enter when an educational activity teaches solutions to problems which don't exist or fails to solve problems that do exist. And the mean between those is what should be taken up. And the one thing that gives this is experience. Some bird has the â€“ he has the activity of carving stone heads out of the mountain: Gutzon Borglum. He... this is it. I imagine you could go up and you could learn more con-founded things from a bird like that. I imagine he's got it down. But he'd expect you to have a whole grounding in the field of the world of arts and sculpting before you even got there. But nevertheless, there's probably a lot of specialized doodle-daddle that he would tell you all about, like, \"You can tell whether that particular piece of rock that you're going to go into has a crack in it by the fact that there's discoloration of the pattern of it,\" and so forth, and this would all be very good, you see? Well, he's solving something real. You start to carve a"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 17 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 183 MCSC cracked rock and it goes \"crack.\" And this is very disastrous, particularly when you've only got one mountain to cut up. You can't order another mountain. So this is probably a very important problem. And you go out there again and you look it over and he's got a new assistant who has been taught all about how to fix up faces and heads in mountains by somebody who never did. And now, Gutzon Borglum is faced with the fact that he's got to train this â€“ first he's got to untrain this assistant and he's got to train him again, so he's just got about twice the job on his hands, you see? This bird's been taught that it's very, very bad to smoke at heights because it destroys your aesthetic sense. Has nothing to do with carving faces out of a mountain, see? Carving faces out of a mountain doesn't require very much aesthetic sense. It requires a lot of leaning on these great big \"widow maker\" pneumatic drills and blasting powder and it's a very violent activity. There's lots of motion and mass and doingness connected with it, you see? But somebody that would never do it, he'd teach, \"Well, you have to be very careful of your aesthetic sense,\" and so forth, and blyehhh! see? He'd try to extrapolate a subject with which he had no acquaintance and that would be a very difficult thing to try to do, to teach a subject with which you had no acquaintance. And yet, apparently it is not â€“ it is very difficult to do, but it is always being done. And it's given higher education a bad name today in many areas â€“ it's given it a very bad name, because they're always being taught by people who ha-ven't done it. And I have really learned my lesson in this photography course. Boy, I can see one of these birds coming up in the textbook a mile away now, and I â€“ ahhhh! I say, \"Ronnie, here we gooooo! Wharooom! We are now going to solve all sorts of problems that don't exist, and we're going to not have any solutions for the problems that do exist, but all of this will be stated in such a way that it's impossible to extract any meaning out of it anyway. But you will have to extract the meaning out of it unless you want to get barriered or blocked on this par-ticular subject.\" Now, isn't that an interesting problem? So it makes about seven times the amount of study, just easily seven times the amount of study that should be there. He doesn't know what he's talking about, but you have to know what he's talking about, so you have to read his subject and then sort of dream up one and figure it out for yourself against your practical applications. It's a bum show. So all subjects, regardless of whether people call them \"pure mathematics\" or \"pure art\" or something like that, all subjects wind up in a finite doingness, a very specific doing-ness; all subjects wind up in a specific doingness if they are educational subjects in which a person can get educated. And if they do not wind up with a specific doingness, a person, no matter how long he studied them, couldn't become educated in them. Now, this isn't just for the definition of the word education. I haven't given it that meaning. I mean, you could go on and on and on, and feel more and more baffled and more and more baffled by this particular subject and so forth. Well, it is not a subject in which somebody could become educated. Do you follow that? Well, that's your bafflement. You're trying to become educated and it's impossible, because it doesn't wind up in a finite doing-ness."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 18 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 184 MCSC So, anything that winds up in a finite, specific doingness â€“ that's a measurable, you know? It has limits and actions. Anything that winds up in a finite doingness is susceptible to being educated. In other words, you can educate it. But if it doesn't wind up that way, a per-son cannot become educated in it, no matter how hard he studies it because there isn't any way he can ever check out if he ever learned anything. So it becomes a total significance for which the mass is absent; and education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is hard on people. Education attempted in the absence of the mass is hard on the student. It's very tough on the student. It makes him feel â€“ physiologically, it makes him feel squashed; actually, actually makes him feel squashed, makes him feel bent, makes him sort of spinny. It â€“ these are all physiological and mental reactions; makes him feel sort of dead, makes him feel bored, exas-perated, makes him feel a lot of different ways. This isn't the only way a person can become those, by a long ways, but that is the result of studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent. The mass of it is absent. Do you understand? You could understand that you were studying nothing, and therefore you would not expect any mass, so that probably wouldn't upset you; but you're studying tractors and you ain't got no tractors; no tractors and you're studying tractors. Photographs help. Motion pictures would help. They would do pretty good, because they're something of the mass. They're a sort of a promise or a hope of the mass. But the printed page and the spoken word are not a substitute for a tractor! Remember that. And this isn't the old argument, \"Of course, we know that a person has to have some-thing of the stuff they're studying around them.\" No, no it isn't â€“ it isn't even into the area of your â€“ your practical, and so forth. Don't look for a further explanation for this datum, be-cause you have to understand this datum in its purity. And that is simply that educating a per-son in a mass which they don't have and which isn't available produces physiological reac-tions. That is what I'm trying to teach you. I'm not even saying it should be done or shouldn't be done. I'm just saying it produces physiological reactions. That's just a fact. You under-stand? You're trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and you're not giving him any trac-tors. Well, he's going to wind up with a face that feels squashed, he's going to wind up with headaches, he's going to wind up with his stomach feeling funny, he's going to feel dizzy from time to time, his eyes are very often going to hurt and so forth. Now, have I got this datum across? It's a physiological datum. It has to do with proc-essing and the field of the mind. So therefore you could expect that you would get the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses. Clever, huh? And therefore I can tell you, knowing that datum, exactly what the French educational system con-sists of. I don't even believe they would be permitted to have a desk in the room if they were studying desks. I think the teacher's first action would be to have all desks removed from the room and then he would teach them the theory of desks."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 19 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 185 MCSC Now, one of the ways you get away with it, I talk to you, for instance, in these lec-tures. You are looking at somebody who does have a mind and you're looking at a body and it's very live, so you've got more mass actually, in a lecture, than you have in a bulletin. You'd probably much rather be lectured to, live, don't you see, than you would be to a bulletin. All right, your second best is you've got the mass of the tape and the sound and that probably isn't so bad, but it starts reducing on down to a silence and a nowhereness, and a â€“ so forth, and about that time you'd start to feel bad. And then if you were studying somebody without ever having them there â€“ have you ever read a bulletin, for instance, and suddenly recognized something about the pc you were auditing? You actually have an impulse to go find him or her. Well, to the degree that you don't do that, you get upset. You've got an applied mass now, but you haven't got the thing there that it directly and immediately applies to, so your ten-dency is to go find it. All right, one must understand that this phenomenon exists, because there is another series of phenomena that exists which are physiological, which are based on the fact of too steep a gradient. That's another source of physical or physiological study reaction, because too steep a gradient. And this is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness, goes on this and it's probably â€“ a distinct physiological reaction, distinct from the other. Now, I confess to you, I haven't bothered to make a table of which gives which, but I'm just telling you that there is a distinction which could be drawn between these two things. And then there is the third one of the physiological reaction brought about through â€“ an entirely different one now; an entirely different set of physiological reactions are predicted to exist in this field â€“ a bypassed definition. And the bypassed definition gives you distinctly a blank feeling, a washed-out feeling, a not-there feeling and a sort of a nervous sort of an hysteria will follow in, in back of that. Those are some of the physiological-mental reactions that follow this definition. In other words, I'm talking now about the fact that you'd know whether somebody was jamming you in the arm with a pin, or hitting you on the toe with a hammer. Well, these are two different physical reactions, two different physiological reactions, see? Well, I've just given you three sources of physiological reaction to aspects of study and they are three differ-ent areas of study and they are three different sets of symptoms. And I haven't bothered to bring it out in a table form, but â€“ I haven't read it or studied it enough to bring it out in a table form, but I recognize the differences which exist. There might be a fourth and fifth, you understand? I'm not giving you this as the total grouping. These are the three I know, and know exist, and know that are important. You've got the one, where â€“ this is the least upset ones of the thing but it produces the most distinctly recognizable actions, and you'll wonder in vain at what is producing this if you didn't know it, and that is, it's just studying something without its mass ever being around or its space ever being around or something. Let's say you're studying a sky and nobody ever lets you look at a sky. You've never got a sky to look at, don't you see? Something like that. You can study a mind because you know that the mind has an invisibility and contains certain amount of masses and that sort of thing but you understand that and you do have minds around and it's quite obvious that you have a mind in front of you when you're auditing the pc,"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 20 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 186 MCSC don't you see? But if you were studying this all off in some ivory tower in Austria or in Belle-vue Hospital or someplace else where they don't have any minds, you would very soon find yourself experiencing these reactions, see? They'd be \"zuuuu!\" and so forth. The manifestation of \"blow\" stems from the third one of the misunderstood definition, or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word and so forth. That's what produces \"blow.\" A person doesn't necessarily blow on these other two. They're not pronouncedly blow phenomena. They're simply physiological phenomena. Well, you could therefore make a child feel sick or well in the field of study. Now, that gives you a whole table of what you could do. Little Johnny is having an awful time in school with his arithmetic. Well, obviously, let's get him some apples and give each one of them a number and he's got a number of apples in front of him and there are no longer a theo-retical number of apples. Let's give him the mass of what he is studying, see? See? We find out, suddenly, that he had a problem that involved apples and by golly, he never had any ap-ples on his desk to count. You understand? You know, we'll trace it back to an absence of mass, see? Or we could supply the mass, which is â€“ I'm trying to give you the positive rem-edy â€“ we could supply mass, we could supply an object or a reasonable substitute and we'd find out that first one I gave you there would cure up. The remedy for the second one is cutting back. Find out when he was not confused on the gradient: what new action he undertook to do. Now, that's a â€“ that's a doingness level, that gradient. Or what action he understood well and let's find the missing point right in what he understood well. Just before he was all confused, what did he understand well? And then we find out that he didn't understand it well. See, it's really â€“ it's really at the tail end of what he understood well, and after that he went over the gradient, see? All right, but that is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness. The individual is suddenly asked to learn handling his sensitivity control and he has been get-ting along just dandy watching the needle of the E-Meter swing to the left and right and now he's all confused about the sensitivity control. Well, there is something wrong with the E-Meter's needle swinging back and forth. Don't go over and try to explain the sensitivity con-trol. Because he doesn't misunderstand the sensitivity control. You have hit too steep a gradi-ent. It was too much of a jump, because he didn't understand what he was doing and he jumped to something next and that was too steep and it went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulty to this new thing. So that's true in this gradient, see? That's true of gradients. Now differentiate, because gradients, here, sounds terribly like definitions. But re-member that they are quite distinctly different. Gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness, but they still hang off in the field of understandingness. But it is the action that we are interested in, in gradients, where we have a plotted course of forward motion. See, we've got a plotted course, he should go through this, he should go through that and then he's sup-posed to go through that. And we find out that he was terribly confused on the second one he went through. Well, we must assume that he never got out of the first one. That's the gradient approach. And that is one whole set of phenomena accompanies that and it looks awfully like this other one."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 21 SHSBC-399 â€“ 13.8.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 187 MCSC But this other one is so much more important than the gradient approach â€“ which you only run into the intimacies of actually training somebody â€“ this other one is so much more important, the last one, than gradients, that it's the woof and warp and the make-up of human relations, the mind, subjects. It establishes talent, it establishes aptitude, lack of aptitude, it's what the psychologists have been testing for years and it's all of this balderdash. And that's just the definitions of words: the misunderstood word. That's about all it goes back to: the misunderstood word. And that produces such a vast panorama of mental effects, that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity, the prime factor involved with many other things. If a person weren't this way, his talent might or might not be present, but his doingness would be present. See, he might not paint a great picture, but he'd be painting pictures. So, his aptitude in being able to do it would have something to do with his sensitivity, have something to do with a little bit more, you see? You know? We're â€“ we can't say that Joe would paint as well as Bill if both of them were unaberrated on the field of art, see? That's an unreasonable assumption. But we can say that the inability of Joe to paint compared to the ability of Joe to make the motions of painting, is dependent exclusively and only upon defini-tions. I'll go over that again; exclusively, only upon definitions. There is some word in the world of art that the person who is inept didn't define or understand. And that was followed by an inability to act in the field of arts. That's very important, because it tells you what happens to doingness. And the restora-tion of doingness depends only upon the restoration of the misunderstood word; the misun-derstood definition. This is very fast processing, it's a very swift, wide, big result is obtainable in this. It has a technology which is a very simple technology. It enters in at the lower levels, because it has to. It'll probably be discussed at Level I, and it will be memorized and done at Level II. And it will be followed on up the line, but because it is low grade does not mean it is unim-portant. It means it has to be at the entrance gates of Scientology, that's all it means. But it is a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education. And don't neglect it. You can trace back the subject he is dumb in or any allied subject he's got mixed up with it and you'll find out why the psychologist cannot understand Scientology. There is noth-ing wrong with Scientology, there was everything wrong with psychology. He never under-stood a word in psychology, so he doesn't ever move over into Scientology. Got the idea? Audience: Yes. Well, that opens the gate to education, so although I've given it last along that line, that is the most important one. Okay? Audience: Yes. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 189 MCSC A Review Of Study A lecture given on 22 September 1964 Thank you. All right, I like you, too. Thank you very much. And this is the what of what? Audience: 22nd of September. Twenty-second of September AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Is that cor-rect? Audience: Right. [part missing] All right, today's lecture is a review lecture on the subject of study â€“ a very rapid re-view lecture â€“ and it doesn't mean that if you hear this lecture, why, none of the other lectures need be listened to or something like that because this lecture doesn't necessarily contain all that they contain; but I want to give you a fast review of this subject called study. I've been meaning to write a textbook about it and I will do so in the very near future, but the textbook for this is not the type of text that you just dash off, because if I do a good job of writing this textbook on this material we now have here, you recognize that it goes into an area where there is no textbook or data or technology of any kind, which is study â€“ how to study. Now, you can look in vain up and down the corridors of the libraries at big universities and so forth for a book which simply tells the student how to study. I know that sounds, sounds fantastic, but that's all they teach, basically and foremost in a whole course on educa-tion, but they haven't got any book on it that says how to study. Not even in their â€“ than their major courses of education do they have this textbook. But here are all these poor blokes sitting around in a university being told at every hand that they don't know how to study, but there is no textbook on the subject. Now, what do you suppose is going to happen with a textbook like that? If that just â€“ textbook just sits down very calmly and goes about the business of what study and education are all about and how to study and how to approach this subject and what the bear traps are in it and what to avoid and what a good textbook is and what a bad textbook is and all this sort of thing, and if it just took this thing up, chapter by chapter, and shook it all out very nicely with no fancy terms and said, incidentally, as it went along, that this was data derived from the subject called Scientology, where do you think that book would land? Probably land in the hands of every student who enters a university anyplace."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 2 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 190 MCSC Courses of education would have to be pulled down and thrown away, because they haven't got a course of education. One of the things wrong with education of children in the United States right now is there's nobody has any technology of education. It's something on the order of trying to fix radios when you have no instruction book of any kind and you don't even know what it is. And trying to fix a radio in that state of mind would be a rather exasper-ating situation since you wouldn't even know what the radio was supposed to do if you did fix it. To show you that the technology is out in schools and universities, a series of tests were given to children over a number of grades in school. This happened in Johannesburg, accidentally, and it â€“ children in one grade and in the next grade and the next grade and the next grade, in various groups, were given graphs, and it was very apparent that the longer they went to school, the dumber they got. Now, I couldn't figure out why that was, except I could figure out there must be some-thing unknown about all this, if this could happen and nobody was doing anything about it. And sure enough, that was â€“ that was the data that emerged from it. In other words, the longer they went to school the stupider they got. Well, what's this about \"education is supposed to make bright people\"? Well, there was obvious stuff there that it wasn't true. Here was the grade for the eight-year-olds and they got a certain IQ and a certain graph, and here was the grade for the nine-year-olds and they got a certain IQ and a graph, and the grade for the ten-year-olds and a certain IQ and a graph, and the eleven-year-olds, they had a certain IQ and a graph. And after these things were al-ready graphed out and the factor was added that some of them didn't know as much language as another and that sort of thing, it made a terribly steep curve. Their IQ was going downhill. The highest IQ that we have ever registered on any student was on a schoolboy in Jo-hannesburg who was twelve years old. It was not on Oppenheimer or Einstein, see? It was a twelve-year-old kid â€“ highest IQ ever registered. Well, that's an optimum age. He knows enough language so that he can read the test and he doesn't know so much language that he can't understand it. So this showed me clearly that there was something amiss in the field of education if the longer you studied something the more stupid you got. Well of course, the longer you study something, we know now, the more chance and opportunity you have to run into words you don't know and there we go. Now, in the field of the arts it is peculiar â€“ well, it's just the longer you study the more chance you have of running into words that you aren't acquainted with and can't get defined. So in the fields of the arts â€“ since it is just misunderstood words which bring about this condition â€“ in the field of arts particularly â€“ and this is a field with which I'm very, very well acquainted â€“ the working, workaday artist, the boy who's out there making his coffee and cakes with the drawn line or the airbrush or the paintbrush or something of the sort, you know? And whether he's selling it to Mr. and Mrs. Gotbucks or whether he's selling it to the local studio or he's making a sidewalk exhibit someplace or another, that's immaterial. The point is this boy is in the workaday world; with the writer, similarly; with the â€“ oh, heavens! â€“"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 3 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 191 MCSC poets; even â€“ you could even include various of the fine arts: architecture and that sort of thing. All of these boys have certain peculiarities which I never quite understood. Peculiarities were these: When you reviewed a tremendous number of writers who were pros and who were good, and who were landing on the mark every time, you found no-body who had graduated from a course in writing. But nobody! I mean, this isn't â€“ this isn't even the exception that makes the rule. He just wasn't present. I remember sitting up in Riverside Drive at one time â€“ sitting in a big, swanky apart-ment â€“ Riverside Drive, New York â€“ and the whole place, the whole salon of this apartment was jampacked with some of the best stellar names in the field of American fiction. There they were â€“ all of them, practically. And scattered in amongst them were some of their agents, you know, sort of keeping to the background and trying to look like the radiator or something. And this subject came up, not just the subject of writing but the subject of education in gen-eral. And a census was taken on the spot and noses were counted on the thing and nobody there had ever finished the university amongst those writers â€“ much less writing. They had never finished the university. They had all been kicked out â€“ almost uniformly had been ex-pelled â€“ or they'd never gone near the place. And that was it, and then a check-over demon-strated, clearly and conclusively, that not one of them had ever taken a course in writing, from anyplace, from anybody about anything. Well, this was also quite startling, too, and it's not something that you would write in a writers' magazine about, because it would be very unpopular with the magazine because of its advertisers and their fond ideas they have and their advertisers who sell courses in story writ-ing and that sort of thing. So it isn't the kind of thing you have written up. And I was about ready to dismiss the whole subject, you know, and say, \"Well, that's it,\" because I had been sitting there keeping the notes for two or three other eager beavers who had been taking this over. And I was saying, \"Well, I guess we've just about got that taped\" or something like this you know, and everybody was laughing about it. And all of a sudden here was a very faint voice over in the corner that said, \"Well, your figures are not quite correct.\" \"What?\" you know? \"Wha-wha-what? Who was that?\" And \"Well, I â€“ I have a P â€“ PHD in literature, and a â€“ a couple of other degrees, and finished â€“ fini â€“ finished the university and several other universities, and I've taken a lot of courses in writing, and â€“ and so forth, so it's not true of everybody in the room.\" And everybody turned around looking at this guy trying to find out who it was. And of course, it was a literary agent! [laughter] He wasn't a writer. He'd never published a line in his life. All he did was sit around and tell other people what was wrong with their stories. But he had tried to be a writer and he'd failed. So about this point I said, \"There's something very peculiar going on here. There's a bunch of swindlers selling courses in writing that don't teach people how to write. Won't name any names because you don't have to. It's every big, brassy university in the United"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 4 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 192 MCSC States. What's going on here?\" Well, could have been a lot of things, could have been a lot of things going on. But in the years following I ran the subject down. I got that interested in it that I ran it down a bit further, and I found out that no writing course teaches writing. They don't teach writing. I'm not sure what they teach but none of the technology which they employ and say is a writers technology, is the writer's technology. You get the point? See, they say there is this piece of technology but it isn't that piece of technology, you see? Writers don't use this tech-nology, period! If any of you have ever taken a writing course, I'm sure you heard about foreshadow-ing? And I'm sure you've heard about other writing gimmicks of one kind or another? And writers don't use them, and when they do use them, they don't call them that. Do you see here? There is a technology, then, which writers use but it is not taught in universities and it's not taught in courses in writing. I remember with a horrible start one time, getting up to make a talk to a short story group, and I was about ready to draw a long breath and say, \"Well, ladies and gentlemen, how are you this evening? Is there anything I can tell you about?\" So I was just â€“ and right in front of the desk, lying there, was one of my stories, wide-open, which they had been using as a text. And every paragraph of it had some weird symbol or word written opposite it to show what I was doing at each one of these points. [laughter] Why, I would have wrapped myself around four telegraph poles if I'd ever tried to think of all that at the same time. This area was a foreshadow and this was a characterization and this was a this and that was a that, you see, and it was a tzsa-tzsa-tzsa and it was all sup-posed to have been laid out. It just stopped me cold, see? And I found myself looking at a piece of technology which I never used. And this was the pretense, you see? And here were these poor blokes trying to study writing, you see? Well now, there is a subject called \"writing.\" There is such a subject. The trouble is writers are professional liars and when they start telling people how they write they just go on and create. [laughter] The most weird dissertation I ever read in my life, I think, is by Edgar Allen Poe on the subject and it's used in every textbook, I think, in short story writing I have ever collided with, and I think it's Poe writing about how you write. Why, I think it's the most marvelous piece of stuff you ever read in your life. If you want to read that â€“ I did one time, just for kicks. And you don't find anything in his stories that agree with what he said. They either want to be the only ones and cut down the competition or do something, but they never really say what they do. So no technology is â€“ exists in this particular area, but there are a lot of pretended technologies in this area. I'm just talking to you about a field which is offbeat which I happen to know well and which is a noncodified field which is one of the arts. And there's that field, completely uncodified. Only when it starts to descend into technical application, like the graphic arts; the graphic arts are just a cut down from the arts, you see? They're the mechanical representation"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 5 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 193 MCSC of the arts. They're \"How do you take a painting and how do you handle this painting in order to reproduce it in a magazine?\" It's not a creative art, in other words; it's a graphic art. Now, that technology â€“ boy, boy! You start doing something a little bit haywire with that one or you start doing something a little bit offbeat in the way you take your separation negatives â€“ you know, the red negative, the green negative and the yellow negative that you've got to take of this thing in order to get three printing plates to run through the presses, you know, so that each one superimposed on the other one and â€“ ooooooh, boy! You've got to have the patch of gray that can match from each negative. It's got to be on every negative, and it's got to be at least a quarter-of-an-inch square, and it's got to match exactly on a densitometer. Boy! There's technology there, man. Wow! There's technology. There's exactly what is the factors involved in this: there's the various types of ink, there's the various types of pigments, there's various color charts, there's various systems which are em-ployed. There's all types of reproduction equipment on the subject of fine lines and dots and â€“ oh, my, my, my, my, my! Wow! There's a terrific, terrific technology â€“ the technology of the printer. The technology of â€“ well, you take retouching. Bears about the same resemblance into photography. There's somebody who can take a picture and he can take a various type of ink or sauce or something and he can take this photograph and he can alter the features of the per-son in it. He can do this, he can do that. Terrific technology involved. Applied art, but very applied. Big technology. Well, how come you have to know this when right next door to it, the thing it's a cousin to, which is the original writer, doesn't have any codified technology. Has actually a false technology. And the second that this thing that is written or the thing that is painted moves over into reproduction, moves into the high channels of communication, moves over into that field at all, drops into one of the most complex and exacting of technologies. It gives one to wonder how these things are even cousins. Here's this whole area of writing; there is no technology. Everybody pr... it's worse than that. Everybody pretends there's a technology, that if you just studied it real hard, why, you, too, could starve to death in a garret, see? So â€“ and right next door to it, here's this other. Well, it bears some kind of a resemblance between â€“ I mentioned retouching. You take any photograph that is a portrait of anyone, I don't care where or who or how or why. The number of times you get a perfect negative that you can print and make a copy of, you know, and frame it or enlarge it or do something with it and enlarge it and give it to somebody so they'll say, \"How nice Izzybelle looks these days.\" You have to retouch it and all your big studios retouch. Sometimes they over-retouch. Sometimes they practically take out all the features in their excess of enthusiasm to make somebody look good. But any picture you've ever had taken in a studio which was ever framed and enlarged and presented to you as a presentation piece, it had to be retouched. Well, this retoucher is not the photographer. They bear the same resemblance as the duke and a steward, see? The photographer's definitely the duke, you know? He's the boy who goes through all the stuff that gets the picture and so forth, and nobody much pays much attention to the retoucher. The retoucher is rather heavily paid, but he sits there quietly drawing his heavy pay, you see, with his very exacting work."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 6 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 194 MCSC Well, the number of tricks you can do in retouching are absolutely almost unlimited. You can do one of the wildest things with retouching. You take this negative, you know, and you take a fellow who, or a girl â€“ girl doesn't like to be plump, you know â€“ and you can take this thing and you can thin her down, man. And this fellow doesn't like to look so old. Well, you can't take too many lines out, because his character disappears, but you can take a few lines out if you're very good â€“ and boy, you can take about fifteen years off his age, you see? Thud! And he thinks that picture's beautiful, because he's â€“ of course, the people who are buy-ing these pictures are the people who are having them taken and naturally they only buy something that flatters them. So the whole world of photography is â€“ in portraiture â€“ is bent in the direction of making somebody look better â€“ not more dramatic, but better â€“ and... because people don't like dramatic photographs, really; they like pretty ones. I read a dissertation of why they don't let the public judge an art exhibit the other day. It's because the only paintings or the only photographs or anything else exhibited would have to do with cute little kittens falling out of baskets or wearing babies' clothes or little children with jam all over their faces and those would be the only pictures that would ever get a win-ning award. And they have another penchant: If it's not sharp â€“ the public at large has an in-dex by which they judge a photograph â€“ if it's not sharp, why, it's no good. Well, think if you took an expert picture of a mist, a very misty morning. Of course, it's not sharp but it's a beau-tiful picture, and the public would turn it down. So judging has been taken completely out of the public hands for these particular rea-sons, you see? But portraiture is never taken out of the public hands, see? So it's got to be retouched within an inch of its life. Everybody's really got to look prettied up, you know? Tsk! It's wild! Some of those pictures don't any more look like the people they're taking a pic-ture of, you know, than the man in the moon. Well, what about this? What's this relationship? How come? Well actually, the re-toucher steps in when the photographer fails. You can do everything the retoucher does with your camera and the lights. You can do the whole lot with the camera and the lights. But when the photographer falls down, the retoucher picks it up. Well, they have various things â€“ not to give you a whole bunch of nomenclature; don't pay much attention to this nomenclature. It's just, it's just words. They've got things like barn doors â€“ very expressive, beautiful word. They put them on the sides of a spotlight and â€“ so the spotlight won't shine into the lens or so that you can flap them over and keep the light from hitting somebody in certain portions. And then they have things called headscreens which stand up here on a big â€“ like a square cardboard â€“ and that restrains the light from hitting somebody's ear, see? You can tip the edge of this board in so that this person's ear is not well lighted. You see, his ears are too big, let us say, see? Well, you can take that shadow and throw it just exactly across his ear, see? And his ear looks smaller. Any part you want to emphasize, you put light on, the formula is. The parts you don't want to emphasize, why, you just let it drift away, and the parts you want to practically take out of the picture, well, you just hold the light off of them and there they go. And because photography, of course: photo â€“, light; â€“ graphy, writing â€“ it's just writ-ing with light. And when you've written well with light you get a perfectly retouched picture."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 7 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 195 MCSC You can turn people in certain ways that make them much thinner. You can make their noses longer and you can make their forehead shallower and their chins stop jutting and so forth. Of course, you can just easily make a strong-jawed person into a weak-chinned person and so forth. You can do all kinds of wild things. But when the photographer doesn't do his job, why then, somebody's got to step in and straighten it all out. And there's where the technology builds up. And the technology builds up in the area of correction. So I think you'll find in the field â€“ this is a broad statement and might be subject to a great deal of modification â€“ in any heavy, heavy technical subject, but if very, very, very technical, I think the technology is built up around an area of correction. It's dissatisfaction with something and the correction of that dissatisfaction. Do you follow this now? All right, the photographer doesn't do his job. He doesn't put the head screen over right so this guy's ears look like a pair of donkey's ears, See? Well, all right, nobody's going to buy that picture, so when the thing is all finished and so forth, well â€“ I mean it's been developed rather, not completely finished â€“ and it's in its proof sheets, and so forth; they don't even show him the proofs. They won't even show the customer the proofs. Retoucher takes ahold of that thing and he cuts those ears down and he subdues those ears and he makes that look better and they reproof it. Then they show it to the customer and the customer's very happy with it. Correction. Correction. Now, you can say when it isn't done right in the first place it's got to be corrected. And where it is going to be corrected a great deal of technology will arise. You follow this? Audience: Mm â€“ hm. Yes. All right, if it was done right now, then there would have been no further technology. But where it's done right you would then have something moving along the line very smoothly and very easy to get along with indeed, if it was being done right. If you had the technology of how to do it in the first place, in other words, everything would move smoothly from that point there on. But let us say there's a bunch of technology missing at this point or it is not known or it's not practiced. Now we're going to get a very heavy complicated technology arising just on the other side of this thing which we're going to call a lower-scale subject and it will simply be totally corrective of the upper-scale subject. Where you â€“ ever you have tremendously heavy technology, then that is all of a corrective basis. In other words, it was based on a cor-rection. There had to be something corrected at this point. It wasn't running right in the first place. Now, let's get on this subject of bodies. Let's take it a â€“ a finite line. All right, the pho-tographer didn't do his job well and so therefore we had to pass it over into the hands of the retoucher. And the retoucher had to go all over this negative and take out pieces of it and do this and that before he printed it, and so forth. Well, let's not stop there. Let's move over just a little bit further, and how about building these bodies? Well, somebody didn't build them right if people are that dissatisfied with them. There's something"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 8 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 196 MCSC going wrong over there. And I'm merely pointing this out to you â€“ there's no technology known there. There's geneticists, there's all kinds of \"Eat Wheaties,\" there's various types of false technologies. But they frankly â€“ there's a second dynamic, Freudianism, and so forth, but they really have nothing to do with making bodies. I don't know what the second dynamic has to do with making bodies. It's just because they get connected and they are inevitable in sequence, but they do not necessarily proceed from one, two, see? Now, what's all this? And we're into a totally unknown body of knowledge, aren't we? And there's a lot of false superstition and other things connected with it, so there's some bird down in Vienna in 1894 could say, \"The whole trouble with the human race is they have no technology of building bodies,\" or \"They've got it all in backwards,\" or something like this, you know? There's something wrong, see? Freud, he builds up then psychoanalysis which has proven very popular. It isn't effec-tive, it's popular. See, it depended upon the communication cycle of the analyst whether it was good or bad, not on Freud's theory. Surprise? If you had a good analyst that knew how to communicate with the patient and so forth, why, somebody would get better. Accidental though â€“ they never studied the technology of communication. They didn't know anything about that and they thought they were dealing with the second dynamic. And they weren't. Funny, you can read over Freud's records and you find out every time the guy got off an overt, he recovered. And you know, Freud never noticed it. You know, that's so remark-able. It will be buried somewhere in the notes, because it's not emphasized, and then he's â€“ you're given the wrong reason for the recovery and that makes it very hard to relocate what was going on in this particular thing, and we're not riding a hobbyhorse trying to apply Scien-tology to it. It's one of the wo... it's one of the places we got the overt. And there seemed to be one present in every recovery; a disclosed overt and a recovery. They seem to go hand in glove, so a further study of this particular zone and area brought about a resurgence of tech-nology in that particular field. And the importance of this thing was able to take place. All right, but look-a-here, look-a-here. Here is the only thing I'm leading up to, rather circuitously, but to give it to you â€“ more thud, to show you there's some background to it, with the idea of you understanding it a little bit better. Do you realize that all of education as it is practiced today is a complicated corrective technology? It's a corrective technology. It isn't education at all. See, there's no effort to relay an idea from point A to point B or mind A to mind B. See? There's an effort, however, to keep the fellow from or to keep him at it in some way or to do this or to do that. In other words, the educational system is built around the fact that education has already failed. So you have this fantastic technology and some poor bloke could go to school for many, many years learning how to be a teacher and all he would ever learn is how to correct the corrections. Now, it isn't that that data is un... is useless. Let me tell you, when an engine has gone into the ditch it's a very good thing to know how to operate a wrecking train to get it back on the rails again â€“ very complicated technology, but it's a very good thing to know. But this doesn't make all of railroading lifting trains back on rails that have gone into a ditch, because"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 9 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 197 MCSC railroading done right has the train on the rails all the time! It's only when railroading doesn't go right. Well, so how about education where the students are committing suicide all over the place the way they do in France, and so forth? I don't â€“ I don't know what this has to do with â€“ education's somehow or another linked up with something or other and survival or something and they got it all in backwards and crosswise. And the poor students over there in France come up for an examination, you just start reading the roll call: \"Pierre,\" you know? \"Oh, he's dead,\" and so forth. [laughter] \"He took cyanide last night. He couldn't con-front it any longer.\" And they have a heavy, heavy suicide rate, because apparently in France if you don't get through this particular type of examination, or something like this, they execute you any-way. I think you're executed socially or something, and France hasn't any colonies anymore to ship anybody off to so you just have to stay home, in total disgrace or something. Corrective. Well, look at the amount of force and duress which must have been on this student. Terrific force, terrific discipline, heavy! To what? Well, to keep him at it and make him study his examinations. Well, I don't know, I never had any trouble getting anybody to study some-thing they were interested in. So I think that if this much duress can exist in a field to drive students to suicide â€“ and very often in England and the United States they go off their rockers, and so forth â€“ if there's this much duress to get them to learn, then I would say it must be some kind of a corrective technology that moves over into this field so hard only because â€“ it moves over into this field â€“ only because the students missed it all in the first place. Now, what kind of duress do you think it would take to get Johnny to learn what B was when he'd already missed what A was? Now, you're getting accustomed to this in han-dling it with definitions and that sort of thing and I'm talking to a rather informed group here. Supposing, supposing somebody came up to take his examination to you and you were check-ing him off and so forth and you stuck in on the second paragraph. You couldn't get past sec-ond paragraph, he couldn't seem to remember anything in the second paragraph or so forth. Well, your technology now says that you should go back up and look just a little bit earlier to find the word he didn't understand. And sure enough, you'll find one just before he went blank, in other words â€“ just before he went blank, there was a word he didn't understand. When we trace this back we find this word; we get this word defined and straightened out. All of a sudden, magically, he understands that paragraph. Well now, supposing we didn't straighten out the word and supposing we told him that he was going to be expelled if he didn't learn the paragraph. Now, supposing we compound this with about ten â€“ somewhere between ten and fifty thousand instances and texts and we did this every time. I would say we'd have an adequate explanation of why the child at nine was dumber than the child at eight, the child at ten was more stupid than the child of nine, the child of eleven was more stupid... See? In other words, this amount of duress became necessary because nobody would ever have understood anything, they wouldn't have been educated at all and perhaps better than"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 10 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 198 MCSC nothing â€“ perhaps. I don't think so, myself, but you could add it up this way. And if every time this fellow hit a rough spot on the road you simply applied the lead boot or the pincers or the brass basket full of rats or some other interesting medieval torture and said, \"Now, if you don't get that next paragraph, you're going to have had it, bud.\" Now, what do â€“ what do you think he would finally wind up? Well, he'd be in â€“ he'd be in an interesting state, wouldn't he? He'd be far removed from any idea of what he was doing. He'd be far removed from the subject and he would be treating the subject as something entirely different than the sub-ject, certainly. He â€“ you know, well, he'd say: \"Well, there's this thing called physics, and I'm just trying to fix these weights here, and of course that physics, it doesn't have anything to do with these couple of weights I'm trying to fix on the counter here.\" It'd wind up in a nonappli-cation. There'd be a â€“ he'd have to short-circuit. He'd have to get all that duress out of his pe-rimeter. He'd have to get all this stuff out of his circle of understanding. He'd have to move it all over here someplace and just squash it and suppress it and say, \"Well, the devil with it. I'll have to make up my own mind about this,\" or \"I'll have to try to walk my own way through all this,\" don't you see? You would leave him on a total only-one basis with regard to his subject matter and his information. And instead of helping him you would have taken away all the information that could have helped him. So I would say modern education was making it im-possible for a person to utilize his training. Well, this then should indicate to you that a decline of IQ could be expected to follow a misunderstood word. That sounds absolutely wild, but the longer you went past that and the more you had to know that, the stupider you could be expected to get. Do you see? Of course, we have all the corrections for this, and so forth. We've got clay table and clearing and definitions and all that sort of thing now. So we're talking from a point of view of considerable savvy. But I'm just trying to show you what the world must look like. Here you got engineers out here putting up skyscrapers. Man, I'm â€“ after I've learned this about education and so forth, I hope they were put up by the foreman who was never near the college because otherwise I'd expect them to fall down on me head, I would. I don't think I'd trust one very good. I've noticed a peculiarity in this particular field to get unreal or kind of revengeful toward the subject or to do weird things or to slough off when they got near their trained area. Now, here is another datum: How does the state suffer in various terms from misedu-cation? How does the state suffer from miseducation? Well, there's a country, you might not have heard of it, called Russia and it went by the boards a number of years ago and it im-ported a German philosophy called communism and it had a ball, and it nevertheless is trying to go forward and make something out of itself, and so forth. It probably would have gone forward as fast as the Western world if it hadn't adopted a squirrel, offbeat philosophy. The Western world has advanced exactly the same distance and further during the same period of time. See, they were not mechanized either back in 1917. They were pretty bum. If you don't believe it, one of these museums, go into one of these motor museums and so forth; look at a 1917 model â€“ stuff. Well, that's a modern Russian car. I don't mean to be"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 11 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 199 MCSC catty; they did copy a jeep. They got a lot of jeeps in there during the war and they copied them. But they're pretty corny; and what they're trying to do, over there in Russia, is spread a civilization out into a very, very, very backward Asian world. Russia is basically Asian, it's not Western. And I will say that with all their handicaps â€“ political and otherwise â€“ they are making some progress of one kind or another and they've got an awful lot of virgin territory to spread all of this into. They've got the whole of Siberia to spread stuff into it, see, and they're really in a state of a sort of a pioneer country. And people have said, \"Well, they're really en-tering their Victorian Age,\" and I imagine that they are. They're way behind. They're almost a century back of anybody else. Oh, just because Great Britain sells them some machinery and they change the labels on it and export it to Japan as Russian field tools or something is no reason why they're good in this department. They're not. These boys are up against a tremendous frontier, and they have the frontier of igno-rance and the frontier of this and that. They've got a vast wilderness. They have millions and millions of uneducated, backward people to try to do something with, you see? Their prob-lems are fantastic! They're trying to solve them with education, and here's the outcome of their solutions with education. Of course, you can imagine a Russian commissar operating over a Russian student. This would be pretty grim. And the figures are these: That on-the-job training of a great number of students who were trained at the full expense of the government and the industry which was training them to take future key posts in there left it one hundred percent at the end of their on-the-job train-ing period, which was a two or three year period. One hundred percent took no further activ-ity in that plant or that line of work. In another plant and an area â€“ this is one specific plant â€“ another plant, two out of several thousand did stay with the plant. And these are not just se-lected figures. These are the broad coverage estimates for the whole of Russia. These are young people who have been educated under communist duress and have been moved out into a plant to be given on-the-job training to take over future posts in that plant. And at the end of that time, because things are milder over there now, they had some power of choice as to what they did now. And they all left. That was the exercise of power of choice. Now, if you know education â€“ and you know our technology of education now â€“ you will see at once exactly what must have happened. Way back here in kindergarten or some-place the communist love of the reevaluation of words caught him. The favorite trick of the communist is not to change anybody's vocabulary but to make it mean something else. They change the meaning of words so therefore everything sounds familiar. The next thing you know a person finds that the word means something else entirely different. I'll give you in lump example of this: Orwell's 1984, wonderful changes of semantics, the change of mean-ings, of words which went through 1984. \"Freedom is slavery,\" you know? Well, even Roosevelt was at it. We had freedom for a long time. Everybody knew what \"freedom\" meant. Roosevelt, he made it \"freedom from.\" You had to be freedom from something. That was what â€“ the freedom we were now fighting for, we were fighting for \"freedoms from.\" Well, that's an interesting way of looking at it. \"Freedom from.\" Well, that"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 12 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 200 MCSC means you must be fighting it so you couldn't possibly be free of it. \"Freedom\" means \"free-dom.\" It doesn't mean standing up against something and pushing it away from you or worry-ing about will it catch up to you again, or something like this, or working day and night so that it won't happen to you. That's not freedom. So, here's a change of semantics. Now, the Russian, of course had this entire Asian population, this huge mass of people, 200 million â€“ one of the bigger populations of Earth in one country, all divided up into different lingual groups and different customs and so forth â€“ and he moved in on them and then he had to change everything in order to get it all lined up and get them to work together at all and he had to reevaluate all their words. So that in 1964 we find he's lost his revolution. How did he lose his revolution? Well, he trains several thou-sand young people to take over the Pujas River Project and they're going to be the executives and the big shots on the project and they're go â€“ they too are going to be able to drive around in Model T Fords. And at the end of the on-the-job training they all leave the Pujas River Pro-ject. That means he's going to run out of people to run things. Material which we've got right now in Scientology, oddly enough, was of great inter-est to the old man Stalin himself because he smelled that it might exist in the studies which I was doing and was â€“ I was in contact with Amtorg in 1938. And the whole line of â€“ is, \"How do you evaluate the relative ability of a person to work? How can you find out which person will produce more than which person?\" And I was engaged in a study of that at that time and had some rather revelatory information regarding it. I was extremely pleased with this infor-mation and it got noised about the Explorers Club. The next thing you know, I was backing up at a mile a minute trying to keep my foot off that boat of going to Russia and talk to Stalin about it. He had problems. He had worries in 1938 â€“ plenty of worries. He was looking for help from anyplace. But where was his missing technology? The missing technology was \"How do you get people to understand something and how do you get people to do things?\" Those were his areas of no comprehension. How do you get people to understand things, how do you get people to do things? Well, he thought he had solved \"How do you get people to do things.\" \"You set up enough machine guns in front of enough walls and give them enough examples, they will work.\" Only you can't keep it â€“ keep at it forever that way. That'll play out sooner or later. Now, when you start working that along an educational line, you run out of educated people fast. They just get stupider and stupider and stupider and stupider. So that I think that the way the leisure class and the upper class was wiped out in England and suborned was not through any political revolution. I just think they educated them to death. [laughter] I think actually they got too stupid to hold their position. Something to think about, huh? I mean, as a class they were just educated to death. Everybody had to go to college. Of course, what did this leave? This left a bunch of commoners around who didn't have to go to college, so it didn't matter about birth or anything else. It left these boys who were on the outside smarter than the guys who were on the inside so the guys who were on the inside lost. I mean, it doesn't take much to understand that. That must have been what happened."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 13 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 201 MCSC So we can make a further point; we can make a further point here. We could say, then, that the continuation of a culture is entirely dependent upon possessing a technology of study. Russia is going to lose hers! We have an example of the upper class of England having gone through Oxford into oblivion. We have examples of â€“ all around us â€“ of changing face of Earth and so forth and that hinges basically on people; the future of the human race hinges oddly enough on people. And if you don't make people who are good people, you're going to have trouble. And in the field of study if you don't have any technology of study, then the poor little bloke who goes into kindergarten and who starts running into incomprehensibles and who then is threatened with being flunked or shot or whatever they do to children in kindergarten if they don't get their blocks piled up in the right pile, moves on into the first grade and here he is shown a word which is cat and he says it's tac and everybody looks sad; the teacher paces up and down, writes notes to the parents, the father goes into a decline, holds his head in his hands for a half an hour, you see? This is the standard accepted procedure, you see? \"What is going to come of you?\" you know? That is the question which is left burning in the middle of the air, you see? \"You will never succeed in life,\" and all that sort of thing. Why do they have to put this much du-ress on? Well, it's because they don't know how to teach the kid to read cat instead of tac. So you get this terrific cultural pressure. You get a bunch of cultural technology on \"How do you keep a kid in line?\" Then you hire a whole police force all over the nation to try to sit on him when he becomes a teenager. And then you have a real ball, now. You get the Mods and Rockers and so forth and your this and that. Well of course, these people by now have been taught thoroughly that they're no part of anything and that's the way they act. They act as though they're no part of anything, they don't own anything and that's it. It's quite interesting to watch some young boy and so forth who's been catapulted out into the responsibility of the care of a family or something like that at ten or eleven, twelve years of age. It's very interesting to find. Today you can â€“ in spite of child labor laws â€“ occa-sionally find such a specimen. And he bears no more resemblance to the modern teenager, and he won't because he's already had to wrap his hands around this thing called life, you see, and carry on somehow and he hasn't had time â€“ all the time necessary to sit in school and be made stupid and he's liable to become quite a success in life or something weird like this is liable to happen to him, unlooked for. They're trying to bring in law and order while operating in the schools to create illegal activities and disorder. They're operating in schools to create it. And the last person in the world that would stand up and take any responsibility for it is Miss Prince-Nez, there at the â€“ Public Local Number 18: \"Well, we just try our best,\" you can see her now, you know? \"We just try our best.\" [laughter] Christ! Why don't they hang a sign across the door and say, \"Ju-venile Delinquent Factory â€“ \" Well, all right. So once more we have this experience in Dianetics and Scientology in this line of work. Once more we have this experience of colliding with a zone or area of the society in which there's a pretended technology where actually there is none.

I don't think there's going to be too much upset, but I could foresee there's going to be some upset about it. Anything we write on this subject is sooner or later going to be challenged in some quarter or another. But this isn't a codified field that is returning a great deal of money. Teach-ing is not really a vested interest because it doesn't make enough money and that's about the only reason why. Medicine, however, is a vested interest and drugs are a vested interest because some-body is making money out of it. The multibillion-dollar drug empire and healing empire and so forth will be defended to the last stethoscope, see? Those guys will be standing around there â€“ you'll still â€“ I mean, twenty, thirty years from now there'll still be some bloke down here trying to cause trouble, you know? He says, \"Rowr-rowr-rowr.\" And you say, \"Well, you don't understand some word in healing.\" \"Yeah, I understand all the words in healing.\" \"Well, you don't understand some word in Dianetics and Scien...\" \"Oh, yeah, I understand all the words in Dianetics...\" \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" \"I'm broke!\" Well now, the teacher doesn't make any money and the school contractor doesn't care what's built in those buildings that he's contracted to build and the state doesn't really like to shell out this much money, because kids don't vote. It's not an area where you can buy many votes. You can buy them â€“ buy the votes of their parents somewhat but people really never connect the school to the administration. They're always somewhat disconnected. So you have no active vested interest there to go up against and I believe the whole area can just be gob-bled up because nobody has ever seen it as a profitable area. We're not looking at it as a profitable area, but they won't defend it because they don't see it in a profitable area. If medicine were a lot less profitable today, we would have no trou-ble taking over the field of healing. It's just the self-interest in the thing which keeps the op-position raving. I don't say that bitterly. I mean that's just a completely considered statement. There isn't such an area in the field of education, so therefore I think a proper textbook which just goes down the line rat-a-tat-tat and doesn't find any fault with anybody and does-n't shoot anybody down in flames, you know, but just goes right down the line and takes up the whole subject from the word scat and carries it on through â€“ why, it's pretty hard to get over the chapter of how you can reduce IQ in a person because somebody would take that as accusative, but I imagine that that can be â€“ not glossed over, because it's a piece of the tech-nology that'll have to be presented. But it'd be presented gently enough so that it won't have people fighting that point. And the next thing you know, why, you'll be in another business. But it's not in an-other business that you've ever been absent from. Your part of the business is making people brighter, you see? Processing people, clearing people, that sort of thing. Well, that fits hand in glove with this particular type of activity. Then you have Scientologists to teach so you need"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 15 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 203 MCSC the technology and that was the only reason the technology was developed in the first place â€“ just to make it easier to teach more Scientologists â€“ that was why it was developed. But it's going to go further than that, you watch it. Now, if we don't take some responsibility for how far it'll go, we're liable to be in more trouble than if we just released it and forgot about it. Therefore, I'm not releasing any small book on the subject. I have to release a definite text. And I think you will find out that gradu-ally, as this starts to roll, that it will be necessary for you in your area to make it possible for teachers, on a Saturday and a Sunday or something of that sort, to drop around and have some lectures on this subject. And I think that you'll find that it sort of will tend to stand separate and distinct from anything else which you're doing, and you will say, rather faintly, \"Well, you know, we can raise people's IQ.\" \"Oh, yes, yes. Now what did you say about...?\" and some educational question will come up, you see? And you say, \"Well, you see, you can process somebody in order to...\" They'll say, \"Well yes, but now in teaching a child, do you.... And you'll say, \"What the hell, which way is this cat jumping.\" Well, I think you'll eventually see which way the cat jumps, and the way the cat jumps is the fact that they want to know all about education. And you better let them walk all the way through education be-fore you start showing them that they actually have entered the field of philosophy. And I don't think they'll route any other way because in education what you're actually studying is the difference between a Level 0 and a Level 1. And what sits there is this band called \"education.\" And that's what's been established here is â€“ that's of importance to us in-timately and immediately. All these other ramifications, all these other complexities of educa-tion are not terribly important to us. So the society of Russia will not be able to perpetuate itself. I'm afraid that would cause me to yawn almost wide enough to dislocate me jaw. So it won't be able to perpetuate itself in history. Too bad! Oh, that's terrible! The various other political regimes and so forth won't be with it. I'm afraid I just â€“ that the state of mind I'm in with regard to these blokes, I'm afraid that I wouldn't even pick up a shadow for them if they dropped it. They're just not im-portant. But people are important and their systems are not important. Now, when their sys-tems are built on lies, those systems must therefore be destructive. And the whole educational system as I see it of total duress, of total squash on the individual, in view of the fact that it's a system that's full of lies, I think it's about the most destructive thing you could have around at all. I think it would be very rough to have to live with this kind of a thing. It's definitely incor-rect â€“ wrong. But you're going to find yourself in this business and the only real point I'm trying to make to you here is: don't then consider â€“ because you can't talk to them about processing when they're busy studying study â€“ don't then consider that you have moved them over into some other field. Recognize that you're moving them up through the top of Zero into the bot-tom of One. Recognize that this is a necessary step.

So you come in and talk to a group of them and you say, \"Well, study is so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so â€“ and the IQ of your child could be increased by study, not de-creased. And you could have a brighter child,\" or something like this or, \"Your school could run with less upset,\" or to a group of police, \"Juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation. Proper education would reduce juvenile delinquency.\" This will all sound to them like good roads and good weather. And they'll be very happy to cooperate upon this particular line and so forth. And you don't have to say anything else. And they won't really ever wonder, \"Now, how the devil does this person know all this? Yeah, where is this information from? What's this all about?\" Unless, of course, they're totally ARC broke and then that's out the other end. But it never really occurs to them to ask intelli-gently, \"Ah, what part of the information and so forth? It says throughout this textbook that this is part of a body of information called Scientology. But then it just says 'Scientology' and everybody knows what Scientology is. It's a study of science, of course, naturally. Truth, and that sort of thing. And it's so on and so on and so on and...\" See, they wouldn't even think about it. And why wouldn't they think about it? I want you to get so you can see this one little point. They can't think about anything! See? You're wondering why a fellow with blinders on can't see. See? What you haven't recognized about this individual is the most fundamental thing about this individual, and that is he can't see at all. So you ask yourself, \"Why can't Joe and Pete see this and this and this?\" You see, you're asking yourself too complex a question. See, you're asking yourself, \"Why can't Joe and Bill see that so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so? And why do they always argue, and so forth and so forth?\" Well, you yourself are just being too complex with your question. Your question is based on the fact that you haven't recognized that they can't see! Do you follow this? You're trying to stretch it out into, \"Why can't they see something?\" see? Well, your basic thing is, is just, \"Why can't they see at all?\" Well, they can't see at all because they've never been â€“ they've been trained into stupidity. And you're talking to blind men, that's all. Well, how do you talk to a blind man? Well, you talk to him damn carefully! You get smart about it. You know this guy's blind, so you â€“ naturally he's sitting there, he can't see at all, and you're trying to talk to him about the rose garden, which you can see right outside the win-dow. Well, you say â€“ you wouldn't say to him, \"Well, you silly ass! Why don't you look out-side the window and look at the rose garden?\" Well, you wouldn't say that to a fellow who couldn't see at all. See, you wouldn't. You'd say, \"Well, over there to your...\" You'd have to think it over, you see? You'd have to say, \"Well, over there to your right there are a certain number of windows. You pos-sibly can feel a cold draft coming in on you occasionally. Well, that's windows over there and there's light which makes things visible and show up so that you can see things back of things.

Now, you can hold those up and you can feel it that way,\" and you gradually infiltrate it into his experience, don't you see? And you'd have to sit there and figure for a while on \"How am I going to give this guy some dope so that he can get some idea of there's a flower garden outside the window,\" see? And you gradually build it up, and you'd say, \"Well, outside the window there's a lot of space. You know, the last time you went out of the room, why, you walked for quite a ways before you got into another door. Well, that was all space and that's the outdoors. And you've noticed sometimes that you've gotten rained on and so forth while you were in under some spaces, but not into other spaces, see?\" You know? And you take it up like this, \"Now, there's a big wide space outside the windows.\" And then you'd probably recognize, \"Good God! The next thing I'm going to have to explain to a blind man is the aesthetics of color. Ooh! Well, let's see. How can I do this,\" see? \"Well, all right. Be brave. Let's do this. Let's attempt it.\" You get the idea? And you eventually find yourself â€“ and the guy would be sitting there saying, \"Yeah, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, well I now know what a flower garden is,\" see, something like that. You really would have communicated something because you recognized in the first place you were talking to a blind man. But when you fail to communicate, you do so for one big, awful reason. You don't recognize that you're talking to a blind man. And when you start talking to people about Scientology, you are actually talking to them above the strata where you should be talking to them to. Somebody says, \"Well, on this new PE Course, how do we get in ARC?\" Well, you don't! ARC is too high. That's very ad-vanced data; you've got to undercut this. You've got to give them the idea of a datum and you've got to give them the idea of the comprehension of a datum and you've got to give them the idea that there are data in exis-tence. You've got to give them the idea that they can learn something. Sounds incredible but this is your leg up, this is your edge in. Then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge, because 99 percent of the people you're talking to have had the experience of \"The technology taught did not operate.\" Most of them do not expect anything to happen even if they know the technology. So they're not able to give that extra little push that makes it work. When you run into these failures it's because of this, see? It's that little extra thing. They don't expect â€“ what I'm trying to tell you is they don't expect anything to work because nothing ever has. So they really â€“ don't really know what knowledge is. Knowledge is some sort of a fakery that people think is, see? If you gave them the task of describing what is knowledge, you're liable to run into something like that. Well, these people don't know there's anything to know. Look at the arrogance of the medical profession. They don't think there's anything to know about the subject of the mind or the spirit or healing. They brush all this off, they â€“ wow! You know? The arrogance of these fellows! They're not producing any results, yet they think they've got it all wrapped up. Well, where do you suppose that comes from but Latin?

Well, he wouldn't ever do anything else, don't you see? You've said, \"This is the tibia,\" and you've looked for where the tibia is. It's this word in the book: tibia. Actually, education is getting worse and worse. In desperation recently, Great Britain has taken a fantastic turn in the field of education, about which you're not reading any articles and with which you're â€“ probably aren't getting much data. You've probably heard something of this, but I've just been getting it hot and heavy over the lines because I was working out to find out where Quentin could go to school and what he had to do to figure out some various things, so of course, typically me, I just got in touch with everybody on this subject and got the gen down. A lot of interesting data is pouring in on the lines. The British college does not expect, within four years, to teach any degree course which goes consecutively to school. They want nothing to do with it. They consider this is a total failure and they want nothing more to do with it. And they tell you consistently, \"You want to know what the expectancy of enrollment is in 1968. I wish we knew, but one thing...\" one or several have said, \"...that we can tell you for sure is the courses which are now available to enroll in will no longer be enrolled in.\" \"Sandwich training\" is what they're using today in all technical fields. They say, \"The arts â€“ who cares? Any of these old, dead-language subjects, and so forth, and dead degrees and so forth, who cares about those? But we have found out that our engineers can't build bridges and we're jolly well doing something about it. And we're upset in the field of educa-tion, and we're just tearing it to pieces.\" So all the big companies and the governments and the local councils and everybody else who can put his shoulder to the wheel is knocking out anything that has resembled engi-neering education in the past here in Great Britain. They are just knocking it in the head left and right. They found the school room was no place to make any engineer, and the future of this culture depends completely upon the quality of their engineers. They have recognized that entirely. So they're just reforming the whole thing. And by 1968 it won't even look the same. They'll go six months to school and they'll work for six months. That's what's going to happen to the student, and he's going to go six months to school and he's going to work for six months. And he jolly well, damned better be working in the subject he's studying or he can't enroll in it. A whole new face has been given to the field of education. Well, that is a corrective measure which is a recognition of the fact that educational methods have failed. But it's a cor-rective measure in the right direction and we may even have had something to do with it be-cause, remember, we've been teaching an â€“ we used to teach an awful lot of teachers up in London, and it was our idea of the familiarity of things and so forth. We may have more to do with the evolution of the culture than we believe. Perhaps we could overestimate it, but I think we commonly underestimate it. I see a lot of things happening. I noticed the other day something or other happening. It was straight out of our textbooks."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 19 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 207 MCSC Oh, yes. There's somebody drew up the profiles of Home and Heath and whatever its name is â€“ Mr. George something â€“ anyway, drew him up and printed our personality analysis in The Guardian, and plotted these boys on our personality analysis, somewhat alter-ised. But they never took one of these things down and gave it to somebody â€“ typically the psycholo-gist at work â€“ never gave it to poor Home or Heath or Wilson or any of the boys, see, but went around and asked some students what they thought of these fellows and put that down as the results, and then advertised this as the actual graph of these people. I think it's very inter-esting. It's only something that they would do in the field of psychology. You understand what I mean? They just asked some people their opinions of whether these fellows were, you know, this or that or up and down, you see? And then they put down whatever anybody said and then released to the public that this was the personality of these blokes. I thought it was fascinating. But nevertheless, that was our graph sitting there staring us in the face. We've already infiltrated this field to the degree that they're already out the backdoor and playing in the yard and don't even realize that we're sitting in the parlor twiddling our thumbs. That's about the way the situation is as far as command and knowledge and technol-ogy is concerned. But we are at a very â€“ we're a very unreal group to these people and we're unreal because any further knowledge is unreal to them, don't you see? They recognize in-stinctively that there is knowledge somewhere, and when we talk to them they recognize that we are talking that way, but it's all on a sort of an unconscious basis. And then they don't really connect this up and they're sort of hunted about the whole thing, and we make them nervous. But frankly, our command value over such a person is rather fantastic. It's almost an hypnotic command value which is sort of interesting. They recognize that you're talking the truth but they are not quite able to add you up to it, so the words which you're saying as you speak to them are engramic, almost, as you speak them. It's all very interesting. Scientology could be in this state and simply put the whole society into some kind of an obedience basis without even trying. But that isn't what we're trying to do. The way that you would follow this through â€“ you'd have to get somebody into a state where he could learn. This is the way you'd bring somebody into Scientology, see? You'd get him into a state where he could learn and you'd show him there was something to be studied and then you would show him that there was a body of information about study and then you would show him that there was a body of information to study. And it's about in those â€“ in that sequence that you would make a big win. And you have never really tried to approach it from this particular angle. Your normal approach to the individual is, \"We can help you, we can make you smarter, we can do this for you, we can do that for you, we can make you well.\" We have tried to talk to him and so forth and we're talking to somebody who can't learn. All right, if this individual can't learn, why, then of course he can't learn even the words we're saying to him. So he's in a nonreceipt. It isn't that we're even talking dully or un-cleverly. He's simply not receiving. See, if he can't learn in general, why, he couldn't receive your â€“ even your sentence."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 20 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 208 MCSC So your approach isn't failing, it just isn't reaching. Big difference between those two points. So all you have to do is move the person up to where it reaches. See, you take your first step first. You pull him up to where it'd reach him. Well, so he'd be very happy to learn that there was ways of studying. He'd be very happy to learn this. He'd be very happy to learn there was ways of broadening his information about the world, about things. But right away, of course, you recognize you're dealing with a present time problem. He has a lot of things that he is having problems with, that, if he could learn more about, he would be able to handle his problems. So you must be at that point colliding with a present time problem on the part of the person you're talking to. Do you see that? His basic present time problems have to do with not knowing. See, if he could just learn more about women, he wouldn't have so much trouble with his wife. I mean, let's get it down to that simple an index, see? But of course, it never occurs to him that there's any way to go about learning that he isn't going about. So if he were just to know that there is some way you could learn more about women or learn more about anything or if there was some way of approaching this field of gathering data or becoming more learned on certain subjects and so forth, why, boy, he'd be on your side right now because he would be applying them to his present time problems, not on a direct processing basis but on just a direct indoctrination basis. You say, \"Well, there's something you can do about your life. There is some hope for it.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, you can find out more about it.\" \"Is that so?\" See, not that you become clever or anything else, but \"You can just find out more about what's going on around you.\" \"Oh, I can? Isn't that interesting? Hey! How do you do that?\" \"Well, there's techniques, various techniques of learning more about things that are quite surprising, quite surprising, and so forth. And one of them is to observe.\" \"Is that so?\" Well, you get how fundamental this gets? You observe. You think you have to be clever to teach somebody something like this. No, just be obvious; observe. \"Now, you â€“ you say you want to know more about your wife? All right. Now, there's a good example. All right. Now, has it ever occurred to you to observe your wife?\" \"No.\" [laughter] \"All right. Now, I'll tell you what you do.

How do you look at something? Hell, you look at it! That's the answer. And that's the answer he'd finally come up with. But how does he look at something? Well, he looks at it, see? And that would be his problem for the day, you see? He'd think there were trick ways of looking at things. Do you look at them through various colored glasses, you know? Do you look at them cross-eyed? Do you use eyeballs? All kinds of things, see? Let him solve that one. How do you â€“ how do you observe something? Well, let him draw up systems of observation. If he wants to know more and have less trouble with his wife, well, he'd better learn how to observe his wife. Now, that would be a primary method, then, of handling his personal affairs and his personal life. That would be right there or right down the middle of Main Street. He'd learn all kinds of things that just never occurred to him before. He's taken it for granted that observa-tion is going on, don't you see? You've taken it for granted. You say, \"Two people are living together, they both look at each other.\" The only time a wife ever looks at him is when he comes home with a smear of lip-stick. She can see lipstick. She puts it on her mouth all the time. In fact, she put that lipstick on him that morning when he left for work, but she's for-gotten that so now she has grounds for divorce: He came home with lipstick on his face. All day long nobody happened to tell him he had some lipstick on his face, see? But she can ob-serve â€“ lipstick on his face. End product. You talk about observation. In any very big city â€“ in any big city you can pull some of the wildest tricks to demonstrate nonobservation you ever cared to have anything to do with. The wildest things go unobserved in large cities. You wouldn't believe it. I, myself, used to make a gag out of this. I used to make a very amusing gag out of this; it paid off in many ways. Why, I used to tell some girl â€“ if I were ever walking down Broadway in the vicinity of 42nd Street, you could always count on me to tell the girl I was walking with, you see, \"Do you know that New Yorkers never see anything?\" \"Oh? No!\" \"Oh yes, you can do almost anything. I mean a fellow could drop dead out here, some-body could pull a gun out of his pocket and shoot somebody dead and the passerbys wouldn't even pause in their stride. You'd have to actually actively block the pavement. If there was a fight in progress, they would only stop if the pavement got blocked so they couldn't go by and then they'd stop and eventually watch the fight. You can excite curiosity by blocking the pavement and looking up, but you have to block the pavement before you look up and then they will also look up. But it's very, very funny but they never see anything. They don't pay any attention to you and if you don't actively block the pavement, why, they never notice.\" \"Oh, I don't believe you!\" You see, you get some girl from the Corn Belt or something like this. \"Do you know that I could stand right here on the corner of 42nd and Broadway and kiss you and there isn't one single person would even glance in your direction.\" \"I don't believe it!\""},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 22 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 210 MCSC \"All right, I'll show you!\" [laughter] Yeah!

[laughter] Anyway, the score is that you take such â€“ take such very unexciting words as \"obser-vation\" or \"inspection\" or \"familiarity,\" you see, the very unexciting words. You can actually build them up into mountains. They become very, very startling indeed! And when you're teaching somebody about this, what you want to do is take the obvious and expand it. Don't go going overboard to give them all â€“ well, we're sitting in the driver's seat now. We've got the technology of education, do you see. It's contained in these lectures and so forth. There hasn't been very much to add to it, either. It appears to be quite complete. Now, you're going to say, \"Well, am I supposed to teach somebody education, huh?\" Oh, no, no, brother. You're not supposed to teach anybody your technology of education. Let's teach them the introductory aspect of education. Which is what? How do you learn about things? Well, you could sit down and ask yourself that. Well, how do you learn about things? Well, you learn about things by looking at them, by feeling them, by hearing about them, by reading books about them, by seeing what they relate to. You could lay all this down very easily, but of course you get out of it such things as \"feel\" and \"observe\" and so forth. Now, if that's the breakdown that you make on your very, very introductory and ele-mentary approach to learning, you see, if that's the breakdown which you make, realize that all of these things can be applied to all of the problems which any person at Level 0 or Level I has. You could give all kinds of gratuitous information about all kinds of gratuitous things which are being brought up with regard to this. Let's look at that. So, it isn't for you, then, to say, \"Well, let's see. I'm going to teach this fellow about Scientology. Well, there's such a thing as ARC. That's affinity, reality and communication and they form a triangle and so forth, and so on...\" \"Where am I at? What â€“ what's going on?\" see. Well, he doesn't know there's any knowledge in existence anyplace that he doesn't know. That's one of the first things he doesn't know. He thinks everything in the world has already been found out. He doesn't know that the society is in any way deficient. Look at the way somebody out in the street will complain about a past life or complain about a something or other. You can take some bird who's howling like mad about the fact that there's no such things as implants and start to say, \"Well, say this word,\" give him an item in a Helatrobus line plot, and the meter goes bluu, and he goes bluu, and give him the next item, \"Say that word.\" Bluu, bluu. Well, if there's no such thing as an implant where's all that coming from? Meters don't run for the fun of it, see? But to teach him something like this? So what you in Scientology are up against is actually not the meanness of the society or the cussedness of the society nor the unwillingness of the society to be helped or any of those things.

In other words, you're talking to a stultified even ossified individual who has been carefully and systematically â€“ but accidentally and unintentionally â€“ destroyed since the first day he set his foot on his mother's knee and said, \"Mama, what's a cat?\" And then she said, \"Don't bother me now.\" \"Let's see. Cats are 'don't bother me nows. '\" He's the product of an educational system which has threatened to shoot him against the social brick wall with all the social machine guns if he doesn't get \"A\" in every subject and graduate out of the top of his class where he didn't even understand what the word \"school\" meant. Everything has militated â€“ everything has operated against this individual ever becom-ing brighter or more educated. And now you expect to come forth with a great body of knowledge that this individual would welcome with open arms. Well, in the first place, he's been shot down in flames on the subject of study to begin with and this would just mean more study to him. Furthermore, you couldn't possibly exist because all study materials are bad because you get shot if you don't know them or something weird like this will be going on in his head. In other words, the communication line is jammed. What's the communication line jammed on? The communication line is jammed on study. So this is study in dissemination. And do you see that the study itself is an excellent dissemination tool and would work like a shot and I'm sure that you will find yourself, if you start to use this, being pulled in faster than you know. And I will only give you one little caution with regard to it, is don't get too studious about study in your address to the subject. Just pick the very obvious points of study and make them very studious points because it doesn't matter how studious you get about the ob-vious. A person can still see it. Do you see? So that you say â€“ you â€“ some person, he wants to get things built up into some tre-mendous tower of complexity on this subject. Well, you just let him build it up on the subject of observation until it likes to reach the sky. He isn't going to get anyplace but observation, is he? He's going to get, in the final analysis, the fact that you observe by observing. This is what final conclusion he will have to reach. No matter how many systems he develops in or-der to do the observation, he will eventually reach that point. He can't help but learn things and learn things about learning if he observes things. So you've got any broad, fabulously simple point of this character which, if you put across and got it across, you would all of a sudden get tremendous agreement with. And you'd get that little \"Hey! What do you know?\" you know? \"What's â€“ yeah! Yeah! If I observed my wife â€“ ah, yes! What is she doing? How does she look when I'm talking to her? Why, I have to check up on that.\" [laughter] And by the very familiarity of reach and withdraw by observation of his wife, he'd have less trouble with her. He'd become more familiar with her, he'd understand her better. You're talking to people who have withdrawn totally from life."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 24 SHSBC-403 â€“ 22.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 212 MCSC Study, of course, is one of the best methods in the world of bringing them out of it.

Yeah, you think you got it all solved, you know? How did you get in this much trouble? How did I get in this much trouble? Yeah, man, you try to take the postulate of a 190-mile-high being and while you're only five foot ten and a half; or something like that, take it apart â€“ it's \"Where's your head?\" you know? This is very interesting. When you get Clear, I've got a little piece of advice for you: Why, get enrolled in the OT Course and do it step by step, politely and quietly. Don't get am-bitious. I'm the only one that's expendable around here. [laughter] Every time anything hap-pens to me they say, \"Well, it serves him right,\" and any time anything happens to you, that's my fault.

I want to make a little bit of a â€“ well, I want to make a little bit of a correction. If you, as I did after the last lecture, go and look up Dharma (D-H-A-R-M-A) to find out what has been preserved of all that, why, save yourself the trouble. Dharma is anything from \"supreme law\" to \"the total caste system of India\" to \"fate\" and respelled \"love\" and rephrased some other way, it is something else some other way, and so forth. And in no authoritative refer-ence book that I've looked at to date that I have around at this particular time, is there any correct definition for Dharma. Boy, that is really great, you know, it's really great! And in Buddhism it means \"the way,\" see."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 2 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 214 MCSC Now, I tell you, you go around getting your name synonymous with things, you know, and then your name becomes the thing, you know. If you make very good Frigidaires, why, eventually all iceboxes are known as Frigidaires, you see. But it's worse than that, it's worse than that. The name becomes identified with the product rather than the source of the product, which I think is very fascinating. I just thought I would give you that as a little side note on the last lecture, because I thought, \"I wonder what they're saying about that these days,\" you know. \"I wonder if there's any record of it around,\" you know. By George, there isn't! I no-tice, however, in many books such as the theosophy texts, and so on, that it is bounteously mentioned, but it doesn't really say wherein. Well, the age we're in, by the way â€“ the age we started, by the way â€“ already has been named. This might also be an interesting side note to you. It's the Age of Love. There was the Age of Reason and the Age of Science and the age of a lot of other things. But twenty-five hundred years ago, why, Gautama Siddhartha said that in twenty-five hundred years, the Age of Love would begin in the West and this is an interesting prediction because the first thing that Clears start talking about is love, you know. It's interesting. Of course, nobody ever made this before, so how was he to know? But, anyway, this is supposed to be the Age of Love. No longer the Age of Reason â€“ thank God! [laughter] Well, there are probably a lot of things I could talk to you about â€“ I don't know any of them at the present moment that would be more useful to you than another. Completions are up so I don't have to worry about that and you seem to be doing fine on the course, so I don't have to worry about that. But there is a lecture that I think you could use in a high degree of generality and that is a roundup of the study materials. There was never really a final lecture on the study materials and in this lecture I will not for a moment adventure to give you a summary lecture which includes all the salient points of the study materials. There are quite a few of them. But there are some additional materials about the study materials in general which I think you might find of great interest. And that is the basis of intent â€“ intent during study. Now, this is a very; very important sub-ject. As you study, what do you intend to do with the information? Very important point! There are points on the basis of faulty source, as you are studying. This we haven't really looked at. We have presupposed that all sources that we are studying are themselves perfect, you see, and have â€“ (1) have information to deliver and (2) are delivering it in a way that it can be assimilated. We've more or less assumed that and the student is always asked to take the effect point and assume that he is studying comprehensible, worthwhile material. This fact, all by itself tends to knock the whole subject of study appetite over tin cup because very little of the material you are asked to study has any value or comprehensibility out in the wog world. And it is a rare textbook which actually relays the information and subject matter which you are supposed to assimilate â€“ a very rare textbook. Now, when you get study gone mad, you really have a mess. This is one of the reasons why there are such a tremendous number of suicides in universities â€“ and there are a great many suicides in universities. The proportion is fantastic. It is not as high as psychoanalytic"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 3 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 215 MCSC practice suicides, which amount to one third in the first three months. Did you know that? Well, for some reason or other, it's never been advertised. The source of that is the psychoanalytic bureau, or whatever they called it, in New York. We've more or less finished that subject, by the way. Very little of it left. But the suicides which occur in French universities is probably the highest in the world and French students blow their brains out and jump out of windows all over the place come examination time. The number of failures in a university do not, however, have anything whatsoever to do with the product turned out by the university. None of these things are related. Because their examinations are very hard does not make it a good university. You see, the ones with the hardest examinations are not necessarily those that produce the most brilliant students. It's not a coordinated fact. There are many other facts which don't coordinate with regard to this and that is be-cause study is a very fruitful field for a suppressive. It, like government, attracts suppressives like honey attracts flies. And you can get all types of suppressive reactions found in textbooks as well as behind the lecture rostrum. As a result â€“ as a result, we have to, when we speak of the subject of study, discuss whether or not the subject itself has a clean bill of health. Is the subject an ethics â€“ or the rendition of the subject â€“ is this an ethics subject? Now, I will tell you a field which, without any doubt whatsoever, would keep a thou-sand ethics officers busy a thousand years and that is the field of navigation. Now, I'm some-what expert in this particular line, but I very seriously doubt if I could walk into a Board of Trade or Bureau of Navigation and pass today my master's examinations in the field of navi-gation. I doubt this very, very much, because it has so little to do with navigation. And I have had the unfortunate experience of having had to navigate in many oceans off the cuff; on my own â€“ inadequate equipment, stopped chronometers, and all of this sort of thing, and missing tables, and so forth. And somehow or another these barriers would not put you into a posi-tion â€“ must not put you into a position where, of course, you lose the ship. So you navigate. And the method by which you navigate is the all-important thing in an examination on navigation and that you navigate is the only test that Old Man Sea requires of you. And I usually â€“ usually when some chap has just passed his navigation examinations with \"A\" and walks aboard a ship that I have anything to do with, well, I get very alert. Be-cause this doesn't say to me that he can navigate at all â€“ has nothing to do with navigation. I've had such a chap walk aboard, take a look at the helm and say, \"So that is a wheel! Well, I've often wondered. And that is a binnacle, that's a compass! Oh, goodness! And that's an engine room telegraph! How interesting!\" And I thought to myself; \"How interesting!\" The man had his ticket; he must have passed his examination. But he hadn't even reached the point of where he knew the environ-ment in which he was supposed to do his navigation. And you break navigation down to its basic principles, you just have certain elemen-tary principles which are just the facts of it, and they are very, very streamlined, obvious facts. For instance, the whole subject is dedicated to the location of where you are on a"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 4 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 216 MCSC sphere. And in view of the fact the sphere also has rocks, shoals and land masses, also has somewhat tempestuous areas which are less safe than others and has calm areas that you jolly well better stay out of; it becomes somewhat important that you know where you are. And in view of the fact that the sea is a water surface which obscures the things even a few inches below it... I remember one time sailing along in a perfectly beautiful flat calm and doing all right and looking over to port and seeing a sea gull walking on the water! [laughter] You don't think at that moment I went slightly pale! Because of tide-races which had been caused by a storm or were going backwards according to the tide tables, and so on â€“ the depth of water over a shoal just alongside of me was not twenty feet, but was one inch! So you see... It was supposed to be high water at that time. Now, therefore, all navigation performed with mathematical activities only can only be counted on to do one thing: wind you up on the rocks. That you're fairly sure of. Because the whole subject is dedicated to knowing where you are. And the next thing is not running into, on or colliding with objects which you're not supposed to frequent or associate with. That's easy. And then we have some other facts: that the stars don't move very much; and cliffs and headlands don't move very much; and the sun, it moves pretty regularly; and the moon moves erratically but very regularly â€“ you can predict its erraticness. And so you can look at these things and if you have a chronometer which happens to have been wound up or can get a time signal from some place, you normally can locate where you are on the sphere by its reference to stellar bodies or, in case of piloting, by recognition of land masses. That's actually all there is to the whole subject. Now, do you understand something about the subject? Audience: Yes. I assure you that you now understand far more about the subject than a first-year mid-shipman at the Naval Academy. Because he's given a book that is named Dutton. Dutton is the bible. Now, Dutton might have been a good textbook to begin with, but it has gotten into the hands of admirals; and it has been ceaselessly rewritten. Now, the Primer of Navigation by Mixter was the elementary textbook which kept the officers who stayed off the rocks off the rocks in World War II. He published it in 1940; it became the bible of the young officer of World War II. And it now â€“ Mixter is dead â€“ is now in the process of being rewritten by the admirals. And when I read it the other day, I just picked up a copy of it and looked â€“ read it â€“ \"This doesn't sound like Mixter.\" So last night, I got ahold of a copy of my World War II copy of Mixter, and a brand-new copy of Mixter's that just came off the press, and I read them page by page against each other and it's considerably different! The words have gotten longer. Now, Bowditch has undergone this process for so many years that from a little tiny textbook published at the end of the eighteenth century in simple language â€“ so that even Bowditch's cook could navigate after a cruise to China â€“ has become a textbook about three or four inches thick which is staggeringly full of sines, cosines, haversines, tables, traverse tables, equations and all kinds of mad things. And it's become an enormous book of tables. If"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 5 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 217 MCSC they don't know what to do with a navigational table, they put it in Bowditch. It is now an official textbook of the United States Navy I imagine there are things in the Royal Navy which have gone this same evolution. But the main point I'm making here is that you would have thought somebody would have paid attention to such a subject â€“ lack of knowledge of which kills men. See, you can die awful quick through an absence of navigation, you see â€“ and not â€“ sometimes not so quick, sometimes rather messily. You'd have thought they would have made every effort to make it simpler. Well, it's true that they've evolved simpler methods of taking star sights, but their textbooks are so complicated that the first time I ever picked up a copy of the Naval Academy textbook on navigation, Dutton, I read the first four sentences, I read them again; they still didn't make any sense. I read them again. I put the book down and that's as far as I've ever gotten with Dutton. Many years later â€“ many years later, I read the first four sentences again and I found out that if you were an expert navigator and needed no information of any kind on the subject, the first four sentences of Dutton made sense. Well, I think that's very interesting. The Encyclopaedia Britannica, in its earliest editions, is a rather simple encyclope-dia â€“ very interesting. I don't like editions later than the eleventh, because you find all sorts of things in editions up to then. They're rather simply written. They're written on the basis that a person owns an encyclopedia because he doesn't know certain things, and he'll want to look them up and find a quick rundown on them. Well, more recent Encyclopaedia Britannica, I'm sorry to say, publish articles on the subject of landscape gardening that only a landscape gar-dener could comprehend or be interested in. We've gotten into the world of the expert. Now, the expert, in writing a textbook, very often goes mad. Last night I picked up a textbook on the subject of... I'm using navigation at this particular time instead of photogra-phy, as I was using in the subject before, just to get a parallel subject. I picked up a textbook on the subject of yacht equip... yacht cruising equipment. Oh, very, very authoritative text, very modern. And there was a chapter there on binoculars. So I looked into this chapter on binoculars and it's just page after page after page about binoculars. It's very interesting be-cause it takes it up from the days of Galileo. It tells you how to build â€“ without being specific about it, but being very complex with complete formulas â€“ a Galilean telescope. I think it's very useful; I can see me now out on a yacht in the middle of the Pacific building a Galilean telescope. I can see this now. So anyway, it goes on from this â€“ which is comprehensible â€“ you say, \"Well, anybody would put that in the first paragraph.\" No, he puts that in the first two or three pages. And we go on from there to the assimilation and â€“ of light by glass and various types of glass and how the glass is made, and we go on and on and on about the formulas now by which you grind glass. I can see me now, you see, just outside the Diamond Head at Waikiki, wondering which binocular to pick up and, \"Let's see now, what is the glass formula that ground the glass of that binocular?\" you see. Silly!"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 6 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 218 MCSC So anyway, it just goes on at this mad rate and at the end of it finally concludes, with-out any preamble of any kind whatsoever, that a yachtsman needs a 7 x 50 type pair of bin-oculars â€“ an authoritative conclusion based on all of the optical formulas. A yachtsman is not an optician; what's he got the formulas there for? Completely batty! Now, the truth of the matter is that that chapter does not contain the following: how to preserve, waterproof and clean glasses being used at sea. And you can wreck a pair of glasses just that fast if you don't know that. How to set a pair of glasses to your own eye prescription and be able to set up any binoculars that you pick up instantly so that you can use it instantly without fiddling about â€“ didn't contain that. Didn't contain the fact that in small vessels, the vibration and the bounding about is such that the shake of the glass makes it impossible for you to detect numbers on buoys, or identities of or names of ships at any distance if you use too high a powered glass, and a 7 x 50 will inevitably blur out on the motion of a small yacht. It is not the glass for a yacht at all. What you want is a three- or four-power for a small boat, and then you can read the numbers on buoys. So even his conclusion was wrong. Fascinating! He spends all these pages, see? But somebody comes along that's had to live with binoculars, knows all the things that dumb, brandnew, untrained quartermasters can do with binoculars â€“ you see, he's used binoculars under all circumstances and he finds out that what the fellow wrote has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject. But wait a minute, wait a minute. A fellow that's been using them for years under those conditions doesn't need that textbook, does he? And if that textbook doesn't inform the user of any of the data that he will require in order to use... What is this? Wow! There's more to this than meets the eye. Considerably more to this than meets the eye. Let's read a few books picked up at random off the shelf on the subject of the sea. And unless you are very clever â€“ and a Scientologist â€“ you will not notice that all it speaks of is disaster. It just tells you, consistently, page after page after page after page, how disastrous it all is, how you must do this and that because this is going to happen, how you must do that and this because something else is going to happen, how you must not do so-and-so because something else is going to happen. You read in vain how to get another half a knot out of your sail set. But you read all about how the tracks to the front of the sail as they attach it to the mast â€“ not to go technical on you â€“ how these little gimmicks that they put on the sail to go up the Marconi track, how they tear loose in storms and jam sideways and make it necessary for people to get up and climb up mast, which is impossible. And if you read very much of this, you would not go to sea; you would be scared stiff; just scared stiff! And even on a person of considerable experience this creeps up on him and he doesn't notice it. And eventually he starts going to sea, and he gets in a sort of a half-hysterical frame of mind. Beautiful calm day, he's out in the middle of a channel fifty miles wide, there are no ships in sight and he's worrying about his azimuths, or did the subpermanent magnetism of the hull change the last time she was in dry dock, and is his compass reading right, and will he pick up â€“ oh, just worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry. He'll never sit back, you know, and say, \"Great!\" you know?"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 7 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 219 MCSC Now, if you want to go into hysterics sometime, read coast pilots. For light reading, for those who like horror stories, that is what one recommends. I remember one time considering taking the big jump down from Alaska â€“ just going outside all protection in the middle of winter and tearing on down across the wide reaches of the Pacific and fetching up at a California port as a direct bang! you see, with an expedition-ary vessel â€“ without going behind anything, and so forth. And I sat there and the mate I had was sitting there, and we were both reading â€“ we had two copies of the same coast pilot. And we were looking it all up â€“ and it wasn't â€“ but it was not the same coast pilot; his was British and mine was American â€“ and we read it. It seems that five hundred miles off of the coast there are fantastic currents which, when the wind and fog come together â€“ because the wind comes with the fog at the same time in the middle of December and January â€“ you can absolutely count on being torn to pieces, sunk, engaged, involved, becalmed, messed up and in general finished. And it was so bad â€“ it's much worse than I'm saying â€“ and it was so bad that he and I, sitting up... It was already, you see, complete black dark outside at high noon, you know, and we were going to take this run and somehow or other we were going to get the hell out of there. And we all of a sudden simultaneously broke into hysterical laughter Nothing could be that bad, you see, but nothing! The British pilot, American pilot â€“ nothing could be that bad! One time I read about a terrible tide-race. And it was a tide-race. And it told all about how it had sunk a Canadian gun boat and lost two hundred men, and that this tide-race went sixteen knots and â€“ every time the tide changed, and there was a huge rock in the middle of it that split vessels apart but was visible at night because of the spray leaping into the air. Well, normally you would go through these things at slack water anyway. I went through it at slack water, and the cook, all the time we were going through it, was cooking up hot flapjacks and pushing them up on the bridge, because I was sitting there eating my break-fast the entire distance through this mad tide-race. I shot another tide-race one time, a narrows, where \"anybody that entered it was prac-tically sunk, but sometimes the ships caromed off the sides of the cliffs and kept afloat some-how.\" And I was in the middle of this thing in the middle of the night, because there was an error in the American tide tables â€“ a two-hour error â€“ and I'd hit the thing at race instead of at slack. And the water was going through there just boiling white and, man, I came near that in a sailing ship and I was into it before I could do another thing. And the lights of the cabin were shining through ports on the cliffs, so close up that you could see the moss. And the tiller broke, and left us with no tiller. So I rigged an emergency tiller in the middle of all of this and steered her on out the other side and suddenly realized we'd gotten through it. And I realized something else about it: I never really at any time ever had to know anything about that millrace at all, if I'd hit it at slack water, high water, or any other way, it didn't matter if it was fast; it always sends a boat through. What was I studying tide tables for? So it runs fast. You get the idea? Well, of course, it's very nice to know all these cautions, but what did the captain of the Indianapolis... He was a US Naval captain. And they have stripes, you know, that go clear up to their cap. This fellow took the cruiser Indianapolis through this first narrows I was talk-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 8 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 220 MCSC ing to you about. And the local pilots cautioned him about it and he'd read all the tide tables and he was a graduate of the Naval Academy and he was a man of great experience, I'm very sure, and so forth. And he had all this information, because every time they graduate, you know, up â€“ I mean every time they get promoted they have to pass complete examinations on everything, you know? I'm sure he had the information â€“ \"A\" student all the way. And he got the USS Indianapolis crossways in that channel at full race, with its stern stuck on one bank and its bow on the other. This he managed. I can't for the life of me know how he could pos-sibly have done it. But if you look very carefully through these textbooks, you will find the bulk of them simply tell you not to go to sea, that it's very dangerous. And a person who studies them very, very hard and abides by them totally, eventually loses all the fun of going to sea â€“ and doesn't. So, there is suppression throughout that field. Now, of course, it is very nice for them to tell you that if you let the boat flood with butane gas and then strike a match, the boat will blow up. We're glad to know that! It's very nice to know where the rocks are. But let's not concentrate on them for the rest of our lives. Let's also point out where the open, easy-sailing water is, but we never hear about that; we just hear about the rocks. And we could, then, take any subject and write it up for study purposes as a suppres-sive subject. Now, you want to tell people the dangers â€“ sometimes you can tell them too lightly, that's true. For instance, it â€“ I'd hate to tell people... There's two extremes here: I'd hate to have to omit the idea that if you do an incorrect Search and Discovery you can make your PC quite ill. You get the wrong SP, the person can be sick; he can now get sick, because you've restimulated the right one, you see. And that is what's making him sick. You're not making him sick, the right one is. Now, I can tell you that, but now to go on raving and ranting and describing S&D as only how not to get the wrong one because you're sure going to do it, I could get you into a frame of mind â€“ I don't say I would â€“ but you could be gotten into a frame of mind whereby you would probably never do an S&D because it's too dangerous. Interesting! You could be scared right off of doing the right thing because it's too deadly. Well, now, that would be how you would curve a subject and make it suppressive. That's a suppressive rendition of the subject. It's not the subject that's... But we could just go on talking about \"People get sick when you do an S&D on them if you do not so-and-so and you want to set up your meter because people will get sick. And your meter has to be trimmed, your trim knob has to be so-and-so because people are going to get very sick. And then it's your fault as the auditor, you see? And then so on,\" and we never talk about anybody ever recovering because of an S&D; we just talk how sick they'll get if you do it wrong, do you see? Then it becomes too dangerous to do. Now, they've done this about the mind, and they managed to have scared off â€“ the SP on the track managed â€“ has managed actually to scare off all intelligent research on the sub-ject of the mind and soul. You've heard time and again how dangerous it is. \"You mustn't fool around with the mind!\" Perfectly all right to take a meat ax to the brain, but you mustn't fool around with the mind!"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 9 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 221 MCSC I got my belly so full in 1950 of psychoanalysts telling me how dangerous it was to fool around with the mind. But I finally more or less rejected it with laughter, because I looked at who was talking. And when he said fool around, man, he meant fool around, be-cause I found out he could not study Dianetics; he could not do it. And do you know our main departure from training psychoanalysts and psychiatrists and medical doctors is not really based on the fact we are antipathetic toward them at all. It's the fact that they can't seem to duplicate study materials. And it's just so hard, it's so tough. A person comes off the street; you can teach him a Comm Course in a week. Well, you'll teach a psychologist a Comm Course in something like six or eight weeks. Rough, see? Because the guy has been very suppressively taught. He can't duplicate anymore on this sub-ject. And it's contra everything else he has been taught, you see. So it's all going in sideways and backwards and he's got preconceived notions and he's actually in Remedy B of The Book of Case Remedies. That's what he needs. Now, the suppressive subject then is something which booby-traps study, and all of the work which you put in to get somebody to know his algebra, and so on, might be all lost because he hasn't got a textbook which teaches him algebra. You see? Now, what is needed is an appreciation of the study materials by the people who write materials to be studied. Now, blokes will try; they'll try very hard. I was reading a book on ocean cruising the other night. It was very fine. It was not ocean cruising but Coastwise Navigation Wrinkles. And he said, \"But what you should use if you have a crew who isn't trained,\" something like that, \"and it's much safer, you should always have a grid compass.\" A grid compass. He starts it out with the fact that everybody must understand his work. That was the condition under which he wrote it. And in the first few sentences here is this phrase \"grid compass.\" There's no further explanation of any kind whatsoever. So, just for fun, I picked up various naviga-tional and equipment texts to find if I could find a grid compass: a picture of one, a definition of one. I picked up two or three nautical dictionaries to try to find a definition of a grid com-pass. Didn't exist â€“ very hard, very rough. Now, there was a guy who was honestly trying to do a good job and he skidded because he didn't know that he mustn't put in a word that people wouldn't know. Now, in Dianetics and Scientology we've been consistently up against the fact that we're beyond the limit of language. The English language does not include the parts of a sub-ject which was unknown. You understand, I mean, if you don't â€“ if nobody's known anything about any of these things, you see, well, they have to be named, which unfortunately gives us a lot of nomenclature, and so on, which we could be very happy without. We have to have it because it isn't in the language. Now, once in a while a psychoanalyst tries to turn it around, or a psychologist tries to turn it around to his own nomenclature, and you get the real reason why some things which could have been called by old terms aren't â€“ is because he's got an entirely different definition and his definition is in argument with the other definitions in his own field, so they don't know what they're talking about. So, it's a completely messed-up area. Now, where they did have some words, the words didn't mean what they're supposed to mean, do you see, and then there's argument about the definition of those words."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 10 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 222 MCSC So the solution to this was actually to turn verbs to nouns where possible, to use no-menclature which was expressive to some degree of what it represented. Now, not knowing the study materials when the material was originally written, it was not possible to apply all this and go back to the beginning and sort it all out up the line. Now, this would be a very, very long and rough passage. This would be a tough passage to try to rewrite everything all the way down the line. Now, we suffer to the degree that we don't even have a dictionary; we do not have a real dictionary at this time which would give â€“ and that is because every time I get a copy of a dictionary, and so forth, I have to, myself; check the whole thing. And I find myself making changes and corrections in it. And then I have to work very hard, you see, on it, and then somebody else has been working on it, and it's a major project. And just about the time I will get started, you see some â€“ a lot of it's been done, and then I've got to carry on through with corrections â€“ something will come up, something will be totally demanding of total time, and it doesn't get done. And this dictionary â€“ we've been on dictionaries for I don't know how long, trying to get you a dictionary. Well, it's a rough job. It's a rough job at best. But you will find nearly everything is defined in the text where it originally appears. Therefore, were you to cover all of the data, you would get all of the language. And that is one of the reasons why I said that a Saint Hill student had better go back to the original method of study. And the original method of study is you covered it all lightly. You covered it all lightly and you wound up then with a good grip on the entirety of the subject. And then, what you really had to know, well, you then studied that hard for star-rate. But volume was what it took. Now, of course, you're up against not knowing where the word was originally used and there are probably a great many tapes missing. I don't imagine we have many Wichita tapes, and I know we have few or no Elizabeth tapes compared to the lectures. There were eight hours of lecture a day there on many days; five hours was routine, teaching different classes and units. But this gives us a difficulty right there. But we're clever enough to know we have that difficulty. And now what I'm going to tell you is going to solve this to a very marked degree, and this is the subject of the intentions of study. For what purpose are you studying? Now, until you clarify that, you in actual fact cannot make an intelligent activity of it. Now, most students study for examination. That's folly! Complete folly! You're not going to do anything with the examiner. You're sitting there studying for examination, study-ing for an examination, studying for an examination, \"How will I regurgitate this when I am asked a certain question? How will I respond? How will I pass my checkout?\" Well, it's very hard to keep \"demonstrate\" and \"example\" and \"clarify\" into examina-tion. It's so much easier to fall back on \"What did it say in the bulletin,\" you see, and get di-rect quotes of the material itself; when in actual fact that's really not proper examination. Be-cause the fault that can be found with education in the university, the argument the practical man has with the academically trained man when he first gets him on the subject and has to make him fully acquainted with it â€“ you know, like the guy who's been out there building"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 11 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 223 MCSC houses for a long time and he all of a sudden gets an assistant who's just been trained in the university to build houses. He goes mad! Guy doesn't know anything about the subject at all. He's been studying it for years, yet he knows nothing about it and he doesn't know why this is. Well, I can tell you why it is, because the fellow who just went through the university studied all of his materials so that he could be examined on them. He didn't study them to build houses. And the fellow who's been out there on a practical line is not necessarily supe-rior in the long run at all, but he certainly is able to get houses built because all of his study is on the basis of \"How do I apply this to house building?\" Every time he picks up an ad or lit-erature or anything else, he's asking the question throughout the entirety of his reading, \"How can I apply this to what I'm doing?\" And that is the basic and important difference between practical study and academic study. Scholastic or academic study is not worth very much. Why you have a fellow go through a course and wind up at the other end of the course unable to audit, it's because he in actual fact studied for the examination. He did not study to apply it to people. So he winds up with the material unapplied. That's regrettable. This is why you get failures in practice after certification, and is the whole reason. Now, if a fellow were just studying for the examination, he would not have to know the exact meaning of all of the words. He could sort of gloss over it and pass it off because he could include the word in the totality of its sentence and merely quote the sentence if he was asked the question. And he wouldn't really have to know the meaning of the word. So he tends to move out the material over here and have sort of nothing to do with the material while he is busy studying the material, because he can just rattle it off. And this explains the student who can rattle off his material so beautifully but doesn't know anything about the sub-ject. See, you say to him, \"Fulcrums.\" He doesn't know what a fulcrum is. He hasn't a clue, but he knows it fits in a sentence that says, \"The law of the fulcrum is rat-a-tat-tat tat-a-tat-tat,\" so he can write it all down rat-a-tat-tat. And he knows how to solve fulcrums because those are the formulas by which you solve them: distance, weight, so on. So he just applies it for the problem he's given, \"Rat-a-tat-tat-a-tat-tat trrm-pa, there we are.\" One fine day he's got to move a barrel. And he stands around and he looks around at this barrel and he scratches his head and he doesn't know how he's going to move that barrel, because he can't get one end of it picked up to slide anything under it, and he couldn't hold it up if he did, and so forth. And finally somebody who doesn't know anything about fulcrums at all comes along, takes a pole, sticks it over the top of a stump and sets up a \"fulcrum,\" see, and moves the barrel with the big lever. The person watching this is not likely to connect his lessons in physics with what the workman did. And therefore, we can get very educated dumbbells, and that's how they're made. It's on the intention of the study. He's studying it to be examined on, or he's studying it to apply it, and it's just those two different things. Now, where a subject is booby-trapped and suppressive in the extreme, it can be stud-ied for examination but can't be studied for application. Doesn't matter how complex a study is, no matter how suppressively written, no matter how badly organized, it still can be memo-rized. It can be spat back on the examination paper, if you work hard enough and your mem-"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 12 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 224 MCSC ory is good enough. But you can't apply it. You can't begin to apply that subject, because there was no understanding in it with which to apply it. Isn't that horrible! There was nothing there to be understood and if there was nothing there to be understood, of course, it couldn't be applied. I imagine you could write up a whole textbook on the subject of \"weejacks,\" and no-body would ever know what they were, you didn't know what they were, or anything else. You could write a very learned text that was full of mathematical equations by which the whole situation of \"weejacks\" could be completely fixed up, and wind up at the other end of it with a subject on which some students could get \"A.\" Totally synthesized subject. Now, on the other side of the picture â€“ the other side of the picture â€“ if you studied that subject for application, every time you hit a bump that was incomprehensible in the text, you yourself would require clarification. If it wasn't in the text to be understood and if it was-n't in any parallel text to be understood, why, in order to apply it you would have to clarify it. And you wouldn't run into a bunch of misunderstoods, because you would stop at them when you arrived at them, and you would get them clarified. Do you see? Now, your difficulty in studying Dianetics and Scientology is basically the lack of a dictionary. But I call to your attention that I just got through turning you out two tapes and a bulletin which, if you look through them very carefully, you will not find anything in them that isn't defined in them. You noticed that about them? Well, that's the Dianetic materials which is directly being applied at this moment in the practice of Dianetics. Now, that's totally defined for total application, and so therefore, the application is possible and you can study it for application. And we notice that students who are auditing in Dianetics are getting rather interesting results. Now, in addition to that they're told to study this material so they can go audit, right now! Do you see? Now, that would produce this other frame of mind of studying it for appli-cation. Now, if anybody is making any â€“ having any trouble with the Dianetic materials at all, it is simply that they have not studied the Dianetic tapes or bulletin for application. They have studied them for examination. Now, if you were to go back, brand-new, as though you'd never heard of it before and study it for application, and every time you got a single sentence of it, wondered how you were going to apply this to a pc or what this had to do with your perform-ance as an auditor in the application of Dianetics to the pc, you would wind up at the other end with no case of indigestion. You would wind up with a complete grasp of the subject, able to get results. Bang! Bang! Bang! Do you see? But one is taught very bad habits of study in universities and in schools in this society at this time, because so much stress is put on examination. The stress on examination is so terrific that one can become a social outcast through failing his examinations. I notice in the United States, now, they call them \"dropouts,\" \"Rrrhh! Dropouts!\" Guy flunked, he's finished. But it's also interesting to note that of the four fellows who dropped out (I think it was Princeton) in one semester â€“ now this is very paraphrased data, I'm not going to try to give you their histories â€“ four \"dropouts\" in one semester at Princeton, from the lower classes of Princeton (you know, freshman, sophomore, and so on), all were making in excess"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 13 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 225 MCSC of twenty-five thousand dollars a year within the year. Wait! What! Whoa! What's that? Those weren't the failures; they were the successes in that class. Now, we check in vain to find a single philosopher, except Mills, who ever got a pass-ing grade in school or who stayed in school to its end. Read the list, man: Bacon, Spencer â€“ just read them off. Bang! Bang! Bang! This one, that one, the other one, oh yeah, well, he was kicked out. He was in there seventeen days. He was at Oxford and they gave him the deep six, and so on, so on. Why? Why? Well, man for a long time has just avoided this. He knows it exists. But he's avoided it totally because it's a complete assignment of failure to his educational system if it can't teach the bright boys. And he's given many explanations to it, and so on. But the explanation is simply that the study materials that are given are not for application, and these birds are doers in life and they want material for application, and the university texts are not arranged to ap-ply anything to anything. Now, I'm not riding a hobbyhorse in my own resentments, but I will tell you this brief anecdote. I was flunked in analytical geometry, and I was flunked resoundingly! I was given a great big \"F.\" I know it sounds like a mathematics, and unless you're acquainted with mathe-matics in general you've probably never even heard of it. And that's because it's a dead mathematics. It has no possible use â€“ according to the professors. But I'd sat back at the end of â€“ the back of the class and I got intrigued with this stuff because it could be applied to aerial navigation. And I found out that you could draw up a formula out of it which would solve the drift of wind â€“ you know, wind drift, and a few other things could be applied very easily â€“ and I found out that it might be a jolly useful mathemat-ics. Oh, I made a mistake, man! That finished it. I made a mistake! I told the professor â€“ name was Hodgson. If you ever saw a flame light in any man's eye, it was to see this beautifully dead mathematics being given purpose and application. I told him rather indifferently. I didn't try to push it through. I wasn't doing anything, not arguing, very polite. He flunked me just like that â€“ the whole course. Well, fortunately, I was able to go over to the chair of mathematics of the university. His name was Taylor, he was one of the twelve men in the United States at that time who could understand Einstein. And I don't think he knew whether he was talking to me or not talking to me, but I told him that I required a reexamination on the subject. So, he ordered Hodgson to take off and make a new examination. And so Hodgson put every formula in the book â€“ you had to know every formula in the entire text verbatim, you had to know every theorem in it verbatim, and so forth. And he said, \"I'll fix him â€“ trying to make a live mathe-matics out of a dead mathematics.\" I got ninety-eight on the examination. But this was a direct assault on the citadels of \"We've got knowledge nice and dead, let's keep it that way.\" And I erred there by telling him there was a use for the stuff. It was a fatal error on my part. I should never have opened my mouth. I was also flunked one time in a class on free thinking, and so forth, because I'd decided that you could think freely. [laughter, laughs] The entirety of study materials depends, then, on the material to be studied and the at-titude with which it is being studied â€“ the purpose and intention of the student."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 14 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 226 MCSC Now, if you were to go over Dianetic materials and Scientology materials just on the basis of \"How could I apply this, and how can I use that, and how can I apply this?\" And if you examined principally on the basis of \"All right, we've got bulletin number 642...\" I would expect people to know the auditing commands verbatim, but \"How do you apply this? HCOB blankety-blank date,\" you know, and the Examiner said â€“ he didn't say, \"What's in this bulle-tin?\" see â€“ he said, \"How do you apply this bulletin?\" You just read it. I bet you would get an awful look of horror in many a student's eye. He has read it to be examined on; he hasn't read it to apply it. But now he, in actual fact, will have no use for it of any kind whatsoever if he has read it to be examined on. But if he has read it to apply it, then he will find it is useful information. Got that? Now, I say you have the liability in the fact that you're dealing with a subject which has no tradition in its vocabulary; its vocabulary is new. There is â€“ singularly horrible to have it missing. There's a missing dictionary, and so on. But most of the materials, if you're study-ing them broadly, are defined in the text themselves and you can gather what those things are. Also, your Instructor generally will know what it is, and you can ask questions to clarify them, and you should clarify them. Well, now, these materials concerning study amplify, of course, the other materials we had about study. And I'm very amused at one particular subject, which is one of â€“ probably the biggest football and causes more trouble to man than any other single subject, and that is the subject of economics. And the subject of economics has been used to forward political ideologies. So for every ideology there is an economics written up to fit it, to a point where people no longer believe there is a subject called economics. But the odd part of it is there is a subject called economics, and it has certain raw, fundamental basics which, if violated, wreck the works. But these things have all been carefully set aside and a brand-new facade has been erected in its particular position in order to forward communism or fascism or some other -ism, -ism, -ism; and then you, of course, you get the socialist using capitalistic economics, the capitalist using socialistic economics. I don't know how they do that, but they do, you know? You know the Labor Party right now uses nothing but capitalistic economics. They're dedicated to the destruction of capitalism, but they're using capitalistic economics. I don't know how they're going to succeed with that. The Conservative, on the other hand, who is dedicated to capitalism, is using nothing but socialist economic proposals to remedy things. I think it's the most wonderful mess I ever saw. But there was where a subject was taken to fit a certain, to use a crude word, pitch. You see, the subject was written up to have a curve. \"This is communist economics,\" see? \"And the rudigadders of the whuterbuds all go whir-whir, and the formulas are 'for every man according to his bla-bal',\" you know? Yuck! The second you start applying it, it violates the subject that there is a basic subject. There is a subject called economics and it is a very simple subject indeed, and it's been ob-scured."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 15 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 227 MCSC So there's something else you can do with a subject: You can pervert a subject to such a point that the subject is no longer applicable or assimilable, or if applied, becomes catastro-phe. So, that's something else that can be done with a subject. That's what they did with Freud's work. I'm sure Freud had a lot of workable technol-ogy. It's â€“ doesn't survive in the practice of psychoanalysis, I assure you. Because what I was taught in 1924 as Freudian analysis isn't in any textbooks anymore. I know it seems a long time ago to be taught the first time about psychoanalysis, but it is true, that was when I first got this stuff and it sounded very interesting. It's all gone. I haven't heard any of that for years. I've heard other things. I've heard how the \"autoerotic economic system very often recoils upon the society because of the perversion of the id.\" You want to take one of Horney's books, or something like that on psychoanalysm, and to â€“ read it to a party sometime. Just take a paragraph at random, read it out of context. There's nobody at that party will believe that that is in that book; they will be sure that you are just quoting gobbledygook. They're absolutely positive that you will be quoting gobbledy-gook, because no textbook could be like that. But that's how you could take a subject. Now, all of man is being caught up in an economic web. He's being caught in an eco-nomic net at this particular time. Every hour of his day is being monitored by economics. It isn't â€“ interesting that the subject of economics has been so overcomplicated and so bent and so badly defined and turned off and made so suppressive that nobody can get at the root of what they're doing. The most beautiful obfuscation, the most beautiful obscuring of motive which I have ever seen. Now, you are studying a subject in which there is no curve. If it errs in any direction, it's probably you aren't warned enough at certain places. But there isn't any curved intent in this. You're studying, actually, along the line it was researched. So that if you were to study this subject for application, you would quickly find out in it what was not applicable and you would find out what was incomprehensible to you, or just is there but is incomprehensible. You would find these things out. And gradually you would get any kink shaken out of your materials, whether I sat down and wrote a dictionary or not. You see? So anyway, the next time you want a good laugh, pick up some text on some subject, you know, like \"Landscape Gardening for the Beginner,\" and find out whether the book is an ethics case or not. It's quite interesting. You will find amongst the texts by which man is ho-ping to carry forward his culture and civilization, you will find the SP very well represented. You will also find perfectly good blokes who go right along fine. But you will also find that some of these chaps, who are very good and have done a good job, are the most damned peo-ple that anybody ever heard of. For instance, Will Durant in writing The Story of Philosophy and attempting to clarify philosophy, and so on, if he's still alive, actually spent the entire latter part of his life in seclu-sion in California in shame and horror because so much hell was raised with him for writing that textbook to make philosophy simple and comprehensible to others. Interesting, they hounded the man till he just didn't want to do anything but die."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 16 SHSBC-439 â€“ 18.8.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 228 MCSC There's a fellow by the name of Thompson that â€“ nearly every calculus student in the university will sooner or later get ahold of this fellow Thompson's (oh, it's either Thompson or Carpenter) little textbook; and it begins with what calculus is and explains calculus. And you read the book, you find out what calculus is. And it's sufficiently simple that you wind up laughing, you see, and you go ahead and you can do something with calculus. But that isn't the calculus textbooks in the university. I have had professors who severely warned their stu-dents against this book, because it permitted the mathematics and its very abstruse language to be communicated to the student. So you will even find teachers who warn people against simple textbooks, and you will find large stratas of the society get a \"down\" on simplification. Well, study materials â€“ study materials needed a few other remarks. Maybe this lec-ture has helped you out a little bit; maybe it's clarified what you're doing. The next time you're studying something, why, take a look at it and you'll find yourself up â€“ \"And the Examiner is going to ask this,\" and so forth, and you just haul yourself up at that particular point and ask yourself this question instead, \"Does this have application? Does this amplify my understand-ing of the mind? Does this broaden my grip of the subject? And if so, how? How can I apply this, if I knew this datum, out in life?\" and so forth, \"Of what use would it be to me?\" And you all of a sudden will find yourself recover from any indigestion you have from studying too much too fast.

A lecturer starts the evening off with a discussion of Scientology. What it is, what it means. This lecturer also gives the definition, a description and a demonstration of the 'Thing' for the evening. This lecture is different every night. (The 'Thing' is Secondaries, Engrams, Locks, or whatever is being covered that eve-ning.) These lectures should talk about Scientology plus or minus 15 minutes; demonstra-tions, etc, of thing 25 minutes. At this stage the lecturer pairs off the students and has 50% of them find the 'Thing' in the other 50%. This takes about 10 minutes at which stage the lecturer will reverse them and then B will find the 'thing' on the first set. The class now has a 15 min-ute break from 9.00 to 9.15 and then comes back when the lecturer conducts a seminar getting comments, and ideas from the students on the 'thing'. The Lecturer ends the evening with a question like 'Does this knowledge have any value in life?' and sends them home. This eve-nings are kept short and with punch so that the students have great reality on one thing only and an then sent home. Do not let a student leave who is confused on definition. The Reactive Mind - many examples are given of the Reactive Mind and then a dem-onstration is given. The following examples could be used: Decisions are not sticking. Stu-dents could be told how people try to make decisions to give up smoking, to give up drinking, etc. and that some part of their mind over which they have no control influences them other-wise. It should be stressed to the students that there is part of the mind which they don't have any control over and this is called the Reactive Mind. Another example is: 'don't think of an elephant'. Students immediately reactively think of the word elephant. A couple of students could be asked what they like doing such as eating cream, etc, and told to decide not to do that and they in that way become aware of the Reactive Mind. On the assumption that interest will fade first and then communication and then con-trol and lastly help, it is probably easiest to demonstrate this Reactive Mind by somebody's interest falling when his Reactive Mind is restimulated. The example I am going to give now was found very, very workable and demonstrated very clearly the presence of the Reactive Mind. I asked a student to volunteer to stand on the stage and talk to the group. I spoke to the student encouraging him to tell the group about something which he was very interested in. The student chose the subject of girls and discussed this with the group becoming more and more interested in girls as he got on. I stopped the student at this juncture and made the class criticize him. Made them criticize him one at a time making cutting remarks about him for about 10 minutes. After this I told the student who had volunteered to talk to us again about girls. He found it absolutely impossible to address the group and tell them about girls. Here I took the opportunity of telling the group that the Reactive Mind had now been restimulated and had cut down his abilities. After this was clearly indicated I made each member of the"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 3 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 231 MCSC group say something nice about this person which they sincerely felt, and I made them keep this up until the person felt good again at which time he was very able to talk about girls. Another small demonstration you can do on the whole group is to get them to mock something up - something nice - and then change part of that mock-up to something which they cannot confront. Tell them now to get rid of the mock-up. You will find that the part of the mock-up which they cannot confront tends to stay around and doesn't vanish. The second evening (Engram) started off the same way with a discussion of Scientol-ogy, etc. Then I told them briefly that the Reactive Mind was a part of their mind which was out of their own control and explained that engrams as well as certain other things go into making up the particular Reactive Mind and that I was going to demonstrate some engrams. Again I got somebody to come up onto the stage. I wrote the component parts of an engram down on the board such as unconsciousness, physical pain containing all perceptions and postulates. I proceeded to run an engram on this person. I found the engram and started running it at which time he became more aware of certain postulates he made and as I was running it I pointed to certain things on the board so that the rest of the class could see how the engram fitted in with the definition. I brought the student back into present time and ran a little bit of havingness on him to key the engram out again. I explained to the student that the engram which was in the Reactive Mind obviously could control and change a person's ability to han-dle things in present time. This was fairly obvious as during the engram or just after, before I had brought this person to present time he was unable to do very much more than just sit there and he was in the middle of severe restimulation with headaches, etc. On the third evening I went through a discussion slightly differently on what Scientol-ogy was, etc, for the newcomer. (This should be done every evening in a slightly different way) and then went on to explain what further went into the Reactive Mind was the Secon-dary. If students didn't know what a Reactive Mind was it didn't matter as they would get it the next time around. I got somebody on the stage again and ran them thru a secondary. This was very interesting as we restimulated something where he had almost been killed due to some sort of gas and the smell of the people in the room turned on severe headaches and in-ability to see, etc. Here again I would point out to the students that secondaries and engrams could upset the person's behaviour in present time whether they were aware of them, or not. Then the students found an engram or secondary on each other. They just had to find one not to run one. The intention behind this being that the students would have reality that engrams and secondaries do exist and are not only words found in Scientology. I am sure I accomplished this goal very, very well. I have not yet done Locks with them; this I intend doing this evening. The Locks I will do on a similar sort of basis. I will probably find a secondary, run it a little so that the person has reality on it and then proceed to scout for a series of locks stemming from the secondary and thus demonstrate that the locks do proceed right up to present time and will continue until the secondary is one day run out by Scientology."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 4 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 232 MCSC I hope this makes sense for you. I am afraid I have not set it down in a very systematic manner, as I do not have any notes on it as yet. I think you will do very well if you remember that your main goal is to make quite sure that each and every person in that audience has ab-solute reality that these particular 'things' do exist in themselves and in other people and that all people do have them and that they are not merely words found in Scientology. I will keep you informed as to what we do, how we run this course and will write soon again. Let me know how you are doing. I am sure you will find this course very interesting to run. ____________________ To continue with the Anatomy of the Human Mind Course. Every evening does, of course, use the same sort of pattern, as I explained in the last letter. In the demonstration of Locks I had somebody on the stage, found a secondary on them, then proceeded to find many locks which stemmed from that particular secondary. I did this to a few people and it demonstrated conclusively how there were things right now in pre-sent time which they disliked, etc, which were the result of locks, due to some sort of secon-dary and usually some irrational disability which they now had on account of this. (I used Locks rather than engrams for demonstration of secondaries, as the students contact seconda-ries more easily, engrams being more occluded.) All the students had to do on each other, was again to find some sort of secondary, and prove to themselves that they each had whole chains of Locks stemming from these particular secondaries which was quite capable of influencing their behaviour to some extent. The purpose of this being that they knew that locks did exist in them. Circuits and Machinery. One method I used to demonstrate a circuit, was to play them a record. This happened to be the whistling part of 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. I played this record for a few times for them at odd intervals and it was found that about 80% of them whistled this record during their break. Another thing I did was to start the record, play a few bars and stop the record in the middle of a musical phrase, and it was found that about 95% of them tended to carry on whistling the record in their head quite involuntarily. I explained that the modern system of education is a method of instilling some sort of circuits like the two-times two table, etc. It is quite a good joke about a little boy who was asked to say his four-times table and he sang the usual old tune that children sing when they say their table; the teacher having pulled him up on this he explained that he could remember the tune but he had forgotten the words. A good demonstration was to get somebody to stand up and talk about something to the class. What we do there is to make them just talk and talk and talk and the class doesn't say anything but spot the machines that are used for talking and the circuits that are used. It is found here that as his havingness goes down he pulls in more and more circuits and after-wards says the same thing over and over again and again and gives plenty of 'ums' and 'ahs'"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 5 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 233 MCSC and 'You know what I mean' and that sort of thing. After this I ran his havingness back in by getting the class to admire him again and it was shown that he now used fewer circuits to talk. A good method of demonstrating machinery to the class is to stand behind the person who is talking and imitate his movements, so that they can see what sort of movements he uses me-chanically. For example, he stands on the left foot and then on the right foot, then the left foot, then the right foot all the time while he is talking, or he uses his hands or something. This demonstration goes down very well with the class. Analytical Mind. Here we want to demonstrate to the students that they do have a part of their mind which is under their control. About the best demonstration here is to get some person to build up some sort of mental machinery - learning the tables, 2 x 2 = 4 etc, or 'thank you' is an example of it. Usually people just think thing, they don't decide to think things. In other words their thought is totally out of their control. But here they can be made to decide to think things and then carry the decision through, using this analytical mind. The working out of problems, etc, as found on an IQ test demonstrates the use of this mind. The person will also use an Analytical Mind as a justifier when he tries to justify something he has done, this can be demonstrated by getting the person to recall some experience in which he felt he did something wrong, but wouldn't admit having caused that particular effect and used the ana-lytical mind to justify the particular action, by putting in all sorts of reasons why not, etc. When they find examples on each other, the justification examples as has just been given, is probably about the best. A demonstration that can be given in front of them all is getting them to recall something normally out of their control by working back on some sort of gradient scale, this demonstrates that the analytical mind can be used and that certain pictures of the past, etc, are stored in this mind and that they can draw these pictures from this mind. This is as far as we have covered up to now, but I will keep you informed as to what we are doing and how it goes. This schedule is as yet, of course, still tentative. ____________________ REACTIVE MIND Definition, Description: A part of their minds which is out of their control. Examples: 1. They have made decisions, e.g. to give up smoking, yet they still smoke. 2. Don't think of an elephant. 3. What do you dislike? e.g. snake, spider. Decide you like. 4. Do you ever lose a person's name? 5. Can you change your mind about a sad film immediately afterwards? 6. Did you hear the noise outside before I mentioned it? Alright, decide not to hear it now."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 6 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 234 MCSC Demonstration: Get a member of audience to talk to the group on an interesting subject. Then have group criticize him thoroughly. He can no longer talk to the group. Have group now admire him and sincerely compliment him on good points they feel he really has. He can now talk to the group again. ENGRAM Definition, Description Examples: Person gets knocked down by car, etc, etc. I explain how perceptics are recorded and identified. Demonstration: Get member on stage and find engram on him (this life). Run it a little. Turn on somatics, like postulates, pain, unconsciousness, perceptions, etc, written on board. Point to them as they appear in engram. (Bring to PT and run a little havingness.) SECONDARY Definition, Description Examples: First time girl friend really let you down. First failure at school. First row with wife. Death of a small brother or pet, etc. Demonstration: Find secondary and put person right into it. (I usually take two people.) End by bringing person to PT and a little havingness. LOCK Definition, Description Examples: Every argument you had with wife after major row which you felt was worse than it should have been. Every time you had a fright in the car after an accident. Demonstration: Get member and find secondary on him, then the chain of locks stemming from this secondary. If secondary was with a woman, for example, recreate the scene with a woman from audience, and he will obviously now become very restimulated. CIRCUITS & MACHINERY Definition, Description Examples: Tunes that go on and on through your head. People using the same phrase over and over, e.g. 'Do you know what I mean?' Educational system 2 x 2 =4, 3 x 2 = 6, etc. in South Africa the children sing this to a monotonous little tune. The child to remember his tables usually starts by learning the tune (the words come later). Broken gramophone records. Demonstration: Play record for them over and over at odd intervals. The audience will whis-tle this at break. Start the record and play a few bars then stop. The audience will continue automatically in their heads. Get member of audience on stage, and make him talk and talk"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 7 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 235 MCSC and talk. Write down the phrases and mannerisms he repeats and uses on the board behind him and point these out to the crowd as he uses them. I used the various mannerisms that people have to use in order to express themselves, as a demonstration of mechanical ways. I am not sure how to actually demonstrate the real machines that people have mocked up with them. THE ANALYTICAL MIND Definition Description: A part of the person's thinking which is under his control. Example: How people use their mind to justify or explain something they have done. Get audience to decide to remember breakfast and then do, explain. This mind is used to solve problems. Demonstration: Get person to solve IQ problems with mind, ask person to take something off top of board. They fetch chair, etc. This shows the use of the mind. Get person to remem-ber what he ate 3 days ago be recalling back step by step. Find incident on person where he did something (without apparent reason) and then used his mind to justify what he did. MENTAL IMAGE PICTURES, Mock-ups, Facsimiles and Fields. Definition Description: A description of a Mock-up, a Facsimile and a Field are each given, and the difference is clearly indicated. The audience are asked to recall something, and get some sort of a picture of what they re-called. This is described to them as being a Facsimile. The audience are asked to invent some mental picture and change it about. This is described to them as being a Mock-up. There will be some members of the audience who don't see either a Mock-up or a Facsimile. In this case, they could be asked what they do see. It should be explained to the rest of the audience that what they have just described is some sort of Field. Demonstration: Get a member of the audience to come up on the stage. Give him an E-Meter and get him to recall different things as well as Mock-up different things. The movement on the E-Meter demonstrates that these mock-ups do indeed have mass and energy and that they are measurable by scientific means. A few different perceptics can be written on the board, such as visual (3 dimension and col-our) weight, motion, smell and touch, etc. The student is asked to recall something and these different perceptics are found in this particular recall. It can be shown that when the student mock-up something, these perceptics are also available in the mock-up. The audience will, of course, realize that they don't all see things to the same degree."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 8 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 236 MCSC SERVICE FACSIMILE Examples: Any psychosomatic which the preclear has which he uses to explain away his par-ticular failures is what I told them the service facsimile was. I gave examples of people hav-ing gone to the University, etc, not succeeding and then coming back and saying they didn't succeed on account of tile headaches they used to get, when, in fact, very often the headaches only turned on severely after they had decided to leave the University. Demonstration: A member of the audience was brought on to the stage and a somatic found on the person. Then proceeded to find the first time that that somatic turned on; and it was demonstrated that this was just after that person, in his consideration, had failed in some par-ticular way in his life. It was found that the particular somatic was pulled in and used as an excuse for not succeeding at this particular project. VALENCES Description: The valence is described and differentiated from an assumed beingness on a knowingness level. The different types of valences-winning, losing, sympathy, ally and syn-thetic were written on the board and each one described. Examples of a valence was the char-acteristics that the duck tail would manifest. The political ideas of people were usually stemmed from their fathers or mothers or the rest of their society but were very seldom their own. Very often a person will try and be a certain way in order to impress other people. This is some sort of ally valence that he has got into and he will pick up their characteristics again in order to keep them around. He will sometimes mock them up as being around with him, giv-ing him approval, etc, for what he is doing. An example of father picking out the little girl, and the little girl going out picking out her dolls in exactly the same way, is a fairly good demonstration of this. Demonstration: A person can be asked who he is trying to make survive, or make persist, and it will be found that he has many, many characteristics similar to those of the person he is trying to make persist. The person on the stage can also be asked to describe his father's bad points rather accurately. A further demonstration of this, is a simple bar magnet lifting up a nail. The bar magnet is then touched to an ordinary piece of steel which could not formerly lift the nail and it will now be found that this piece of steel can lift the nail. The piece of steel has gone into the bar magnet valence. SOMATIC MIND Description: The mind that works in a purely stimulus response way, contains only acting-ness, no thinkingness, and can be used to set up certain physical machines. Example: The way a person normally walks down the street is an example of the somatic mind in action. The person being unaware of what he is doing. The way a person normally drives a car is another example. The talking mechanism is a rather good example of the so-"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 9 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 237 MCSC matic mind in action. Playing tennis, dealing cards, are further examples. Constipation and heart palpitation are good examples of the somatic mind going wrong. Demonstration: Simple physical machines can be built into the students on the course. One of these is to get somebody on the stage to rub his stomach and pat his head at the same time; after a short while, it will be found that he can do this. (If necessary, this action could be Tone 40 until he could do it.) The person's talking machine could be broken down by getting him to put his attention on each and every movement that the tongue makes. Another good demon-stration is to take a pin and prick somebody and involuntarily they keep jumping. This dem-onstrates the stimulus response mechanism of the somatic mind. A further small machine that could be built in to demonstrate the somatic mind, is two students clapping hands together in the following manner: clap their left hands together, their own hands, their right hands to-gether, their own hands, both hands, then both knees, and through the whole action again, starting with the left hand. It can be demonstrated that they are able to do this faster and faster and faster and can eventually do this while talking to you about something else; i.e. the so-matic mind has a pattern built into it, and they no longer need keep their attention on it. THE BRAIN AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Description: A sheep's brain from the butcher can be brought in and demonstrated to the crowd; and a puppet, which consists of a cross bar and strings, can be demonstrated as repre-senting the brain (which is the cross bar), the strings (which are the nervous system), and the pupper itself (which is the body). A chart of the human nervous system could also be hung in the room. Demonstration: It can be shown that any movement of the cross bar at the top will convey a motion down to the Puppet below, and move a certain part of the puppet's body. Likewise, a movement of the puppet's body also displaces the cross-bar in some way. There are the pieces of string which act as the communication lines between the brain and the body. These repre-sent the nervous system. The strings on the puppet should now be reversed, and it will be shown that, when the brain is moved, the puppet reacts in a wrong way. Also that when you move different parts of the puppet, the signals that go through to the brain give the wrong types of recordings. A surgical operation can now be demonstrated by cutting one of the strings and leaving that particular part of the puppet's body just totally out of communication. Nerves can be demonstrated on somebody by pricking them lightly within different areas of their body, which will clearly indicate that there are certain parts of the body which have more nerves, i.e. the lips, the tongue, the tips of the fingers, etc, and that there are other parts of the body which seem to have less nerves. It will be found that in the parts of the body where there are more nerves, the person can distinguish between the number of pins that are touching him at the same time, whereas in the other parts, he is just aware of some sensation but cannot distinguish between how many pins are touching him."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 10 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 238 MCSC The action of pain-killing drugs can be shown by slackening one of these strings from the brain to the puppet, where it can be shown that the fault is still there, but that the communica-tion line has been deadened. The nature of the nervous system can be demonstrated by a puppet with thin bands of elastics, instead of cords, where it can be shown that in spite of the body having moved, the cross piece that represents the brain can be kept still, and elastic will tend to take up the shock. THE BODY Examples: Different types of adult, male, female and child male and female bodies. The au-dience should be requested to touch other bodies there and find other people's bodies. Demonstration: The instructor will ask each person to close his eyes, and find his own body, and should repeat this command at regular intervals over and over and over again for the en-tire session. PROBLEMS, CONFUSIONS AND STABLE DATA Description: Problem: Any intention with an opposing or countering intention. Examples: Husband wants to take family out to picnic and mother wants to go see her parents on Sunday. Both husband and wife have a problem. A man wants to open a new organization, or start a new project; he has problem, he has the intention to do it and he has many counter-ing or opposing intentions which he will have to overcome before he fulfills his particular goal. An unwilling child being forced to school has a problem. Demonstration: Two members of the audience can be got up, and given one single object between them. The one person will have to take the object to the left wall and the other person will be told to take the object to the right wall, as soon as possible. Each person here will meet with some opposing intention, and thus have a problem. It can be shown that if either one of these persons relaxes on the intention, both cease to have a problem. Further demonstration would be to get a short person from the audience and ask him to extract the globe from the ceiling. Description: Confusions and Stable Data: A confusion is a problem with many random fac-tors in it and a stable datum is some datum by which one can align other data. Example: A person in a new place gets lost unless he knows where his hotel is, and as soon as you show him where the hotel is he can better line up the rest of the town from his hotel. He gradually begins to add more stable data as he gets to know the surroundings and he can find his way more and more easily and relates more and more found to buildings, etc, which he does understand and know about. A lot of people walking around in some sort of carnival could be a confusion, and a person, having found a friend, immediately tends to find less confusion because they now have a sta-ble datum."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 11 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 239 MCSC Demonstration: Somebody could be given a jigsaw puzzle with many pieces and told to put it together. They will then have many pieces which appear to be misrelated and there will be some sort of confusion. If they are given the picture of what the jigsaw puzzle must eventu-ally be, immediately they find it easier to do the jigsaw puzzle as they now have a stable da-tum. (This can be done with a person in the audience.) Some one from the audience could be blindfolded and spun around and around until they did-n't know whether they were coming or going or where anything in the room was. They would tend to be confused, and their confusion would tend to boil off when they were told where the door was, where the people in the audience were, etc. A person from the audience could be given an E-Meter, and told to work the E-Meter on somebody else. They wouldn't know where to start and would have some sort of confusion. They would now be given certain stable data about the E-Meter, e.g. where to switch it on, and how to plug it in, etc, and gradually the confusion would iron out and they would be able to handle it. A person from the audience can be brought up on to the stage and given about a dozen differ-ent commands, all at the same time and told to do the whole lot all at once. He will obviously be confused by this and not know what to do first. A stable datum can then be introduced, by explaining to him that he must do the particular commands one at a time, starting with the first one and completing that first before he does the second. When the audience find confusions and stable data on each other, they can actually find some confusion that the other person has, ask the other person to list down a lot of stable things that they know for sure about this confusion, and they will see that the confusion tends to mini-mize. Getting somebody on the stage and throwing twelve ping-pong balls at him all at the same time and asking him to catch them would obviously throw him into some sort of a confusion. Marking one of the balls blue and repeating this performance and telling him to catch only the blue one would give him some sort of a stable datum on it. Dropping all the ping-pong balls on the floor and allowing them to bounce around telling the audience to watch all of them at the same time would again demonstrate confusion. Dropping the same set of balls and telling the audience to watch only the blue ball, would prove some sort of stable data. CYCLE OF ACTION Create, Survive, Destroy (Birth, growth, survive or persist, decay and death). Example: A person's motor car having been made and then being ridden round for a while, and then eventually ending up on the junk heap is an example of this type of action. A per-son's own body is an example of this cycle of action, and so are most other particular objects in the physical universe. Demonstration: A large paper boat can be made up, in front of the audience, which shows the creation of the paper boat. The paper boat is then allowed to persist, or survive for a while,"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 12 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 240 MCSC and finally a match is put to the paper boat, when it will be destroyed by fire. A very good example of a cycle of action, is some sort of little toy doll that you have to blow up, and this doll, having a small puncture in it, will gradually start deflating and eventually collapse down into a heap as soon as you stop blowing. This will show the effort and continuous creation required to keep something persisting. Another example, is making some sort of a little man out of water-soluble clay and then put-ting the entire little man into a glass bath, where he will gradually dissolve and disintegrate. CYCLE OF CONTROL Description: Start, Change and Stop. Example: A man starts eating, he keeps eating for a while and eventually he stops eating. A man gets into his car, starts the engine, drives around for a while, finally slows the car down and stops it. Demonstration: A bicycle wheel which is given a turn by the instructor and allowed to spin for a while and then finally stopped would demonstrate this cycle of control. The same cycle of control can be demonstrated by a small top which can be started and spun for a while and then it will gradually slow down and stop. The cycle can be demonstrated fairly well by giving a command to somebody, making them carry it out and then acknowledging them as the final stop. A few examples of bad control can also be given by giving the person many commands or orders, without any acknowledgment, or without any end of cycle or without any particular sequence. Example of bad control within a person would be something like going to univer-sity, failing, not quite finishing, and yet never really deciding that he is no longer going to continue. A chap falls in love with a girl, takes her out, they have a row, and he never decides 'Well, that is that'. He just lingers on. This will tend to trap him as the cycle is unfinished. Many examples can be given of parents who are always starting the children, but never stop-ping them, or else always changing or stopping them without starting them. Quite rarely do they do the start, change and stop. Taking a person from the audience and actually starting their body, moving it around a little bit and then just letting it go will demonstrate bad control. Starting the body, moving it around a little bit and then definitely stopping it will leave the person in a much happier frame of mind. Putting a gramophone record on, playing it for a while and then stopping it would be a cycle of control. Putting it on, letting it play for a while and then just letting it run until the last groove, round and round, would be a demonstration of the cycle with no stop to it, in other words, not in control. A further demonstration of a cycle of bad control, is to ask somebody in the audience to stand up, then just to proceed, ignoring him and carrying on talking, leaving him standing. He feels that there is some sort of unfinished cycle of action in it."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 13 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 241 MCSC Just walking out of the lecture without saying good-night to the audience would give them some reality on the fact that the cycle hasn't been ended. HAVINGNESS Definition: The willingness and ability to duplicate. Description: That which the person as a person is willing to create again, or have again. Demonstration: A person from the audience can be brought on stage and given ten shillings. His difference in having this, I think, will be apparent to the rest of the class. Somebody else can be brought on stage and given plenty of acknowledgment and admiration by different members of the group. His havingness will obviously increase. A person could be told to spot spots in space and go and put his fingers on them and contem-plate a static until he feels very queasy and very sick. Thereafter, he could go around to dif-ferent members of the audience and they could actually touch him, pat him on the back, and shake hands with him, give him plenty of mass and re-improve his havingness that way. A person from the group could also keep looking around the room and finding things that he could, or that he does disagree with and people that he does disagree with, and go on and on and on finding things that he does disagree with until he feels uncomfortable. We could then reverse the flow and make him find things that he does agree with and people that he does agree with and things about people that he does agree with until he feels once again all right. TIME TRACK Description: Facsimiles of events in a chronological order. Examples: Different recalls and facsimiles that a preclear has which he has filed in some sort of order thus being able to tell you which event came first and which event is nearer to pre-sent time, etc. Demonstration: A long string of a couple of dozen different coloured beads which are easily seen, can be shown to demonstrate time-track. Each different bead represents a facsimile on this particular track and they will be in one long order. The time track does, of course, get snarled up, by the overt act/motivator mechanism, in sequence and this can be demonstrated by knotting the string in several places, making loops and tying bows, etc, in the string so that the sequence of the beads is now all distorted and is no longer in order. A discussion can take place with one of the students and thereafter, he can be made to recall the discussion from the beginning to the end and, with a little bit of help, he should be able to recall it in some reasonable type sequence. Next, taking the same student, the instructor could argue with him and confuse him and tell him that he said that first and he said something else first, with the result that he will tend to start distorting his time track to pull in motivators be-fore the overts. When he recalls the sequence now he won't be quite sure which came first or how the particular track has been laid out but will have it snarled up."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 14 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 242 MCSC EMOTIONS AND EMOTIONAL SCALE Demonstration: A secondary could actually be run on the person, whereupon he will come up the scale, and as he hits a different level, these can be pointed out on the blackboard. A small student could endeavour to try and move a large student to the other side of the room and keep failing in this, and he will be seen to go down the Emotional Tone Scale until he hits apathy. Somebody could start off by describing something which they are interested in and while they are describing this particular thing to the class, the class could, in return, just criticize them, and again they will go down each step of the emotional tone scale until they hit apathy, in which case, they will just stop. RESTIMULATION AND ABERRATION Demonstration: An electrical adding machine could be used here, and one of the keys could be taped down with a little bit of sellotape, this would prove that each time the numbers were added up, this particular machine gives the wrong answer. This would be aberration - this would be the via on the line. We could get a member of the audience and actually ask him to remember something like 'all women are bad', and take a woman from the audience and ask him in some way to handle her. If he does everything remembering this phrase all the time, 'all women are bad', it should prove that he is handling her in a different and possibly a peculiar way. Demonstration: Restimulation. During the first part of the evening, I could casually ask people to put up their hands who did-n't like snakes and those who didn't like mice, later call one of those people to the stage and make them do something which they have to spend a fair amount of attention on in order to do it. While they are busy doing this, we drop a rubber snake down the back of their necks, on their lap, or something and they will obviously be re-stimulated by it and less able to do what they were doing before we did this. OVERT ACT - MOTIVATOR SEQUENCE Description: Motivator: Something which the person feels has been done to him, which he is not willing to have happen. Overt act: The creation of an effect by somebody which they are not willing to have or to duplicate. Examples: Two little boys fighting, and when you come up and ask them what happened, each one blames the other one as having hit him first. Demonstration: A person could be brought on stage and ridiculed in some fashion. He could then be asked to ridicule somebody else in the audience. It will be noticed that he tends to ridicule them in the same fashion that he has just been ridiculed. A whole group of ping-pong balls hanging on threads in a straight line would demonstrate this. By swinging the first ball so that it knocks the second, the second will knock the third"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN MIND COURSE 15 HCO IL 2.9.64 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 243 MCSC and so on, and come back, and the second ball will come back and hit the first one, etc. It can be demonstrated that no matter which ball you start with, the sequence remains the same and that you get the motivator-overt act going on automatically. A further example of this is a little boy teasing his small sister about ghosts when the parents are out. As soon as his sister goes to bed in a very frightened state and he is left alone, he will now start being scared of the same ghosts he mocked-up to tease her, i.e. he will commit the overt act and then try to pull in motivators. If in the morning the little sister tells the parents, he will say that she started frightening him first. Mr. Jones, after having poured sugar in Mr. James's gas tank will thereafter very carefully hide his own motor car, in case Mr. James does it back, even if Mr. James never even realized who did it. Kicking a cactus hard with your bare foot is an example of a motivator-overt act. Getting a husband a wife up on the stage, each one blaming the other and saying that what they themselves did was only because of the other one, should be quite a funny demonstration of what the motivator-overt act could do.

You're going to get the idea that this congress is full of gimmicks. Well, it's just today that's gimmick day. You get no further gimmicks after today. Boy, what you will watch out for tomorrow. This happy sound here. You hear it? Audience: No. You didn't hear it. Well, it's just bubbling away merrily. You can hear this one. You see this thing? This is an electrostatic . . . Pretty good, huh? This is a skull. We were afraid he'd get his ears cold. This lecture is simply indicative, no more and no less, than the fact that the natural sciences, the physical sciences, are the basic sciences from which Dianetics and Scientology comes. And in this one hour I am going to show you the bones of a twenty-lecture course called the Anatomy of the Human Mind. I'm just going to give you a light pass over and show you what this type of course is all about because this course is going to be very important to you here and there, throughout the world. Therefore, I feel that you should know something about this course and that you should get some sort of an insight into it. Something new has happened. Something brand-new has happened. Many brand-new things have happened, but this particular brand-new thing is this: The world of the mind for-merly belonged totally to the figure-figure of philosophy. It was owned property of the field of philosophy. It was the boys in the ivory tower who never went down and sweat and stunk in life who figured it all out. So, of course, they made very little progress. Now I'm not that one â€“ kind of fellows. It's sometimes a shock to you that I am not one of these ivory tower characters. I'm not trying to tell you I have lived. But I am telling you that I have been down with the troops in the trenches. Life, life has to do with livingness. It doesn't have to do with figure-figure. Life has to do with environment. It has to do with beingnesses and doingnesses and havingnesses, and it's"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 2 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 246 MCSC not the high and lofty thing of a big â€“ a big â€“ oh, read Spinoza. Read Spinoza. Oooh. Any-body who ever did otherwise than go nuts on such fare, was lucky. Let me tell you. Life is life. Life is livingness and there are things with regard to life. And you want to know what is new about Dianetics and Scientology and what very, very, few people, except the old-timers in this field, fail to grasp is that Dianetics and Scientology is as demonstrable as a foot rule. Now there were many attacks upon the field of the humanities and the human mind. Many, many attacks from the field of the natural sciences. These began in the days of Newton. They tried to take Newton's three laws of motion and apply them to human living-ness. There were several activities in that regard some hundreds of years ago. If you want to know more about them, read up on it in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There are several re-marks in the Encyclopaedia Britannica of trying to apply Newton's laws of motion to living-ness in order to get a direct result. These failed. These efforts failed. They didn't get anything coordinative. I don't know how they missed, but they didn't. And as time went on, there has not been one natural scientist, not one physicist of any note, who has not tried to enter the field of the humanities. What we are doing is not new. The effort and intention is not new. That it has come to fruition in terms of success is new and is the first time that any success has been obtained in this field. You'll find that a fellow by the name of Sir James Jeans wrote endlessly on this sub-ject. He tried to enter the field of life from the field of the natural sciences. He felt that there ought to be something in the field of livingness as precise as we already had in the field of physics. The reason natural scientists tried to do this is they felt an enormous impatience with the wiggle-waggle, figure-figure, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work of the hu-manities. They had a tremendous impatience for the impositive character of knowledge which existed in the fields of the past for the humanities. You see how this could be. A natural scientist has the idea that a mountain exists or it doesn't exist. And it isn't dependent on anybody's opinion whether it exists or doesn't exist. A mountain is or a mountain isn't. And where were we in the field of the human mind? A fellow was nuts or was he nuts? There was nothing positive about it, you see? Anybody could make capital out of it. There isn't a person in this audience who hasn't at one time or another been called insane. Not one of you. That's right, isn't it? Somebody, some time or another has said you were crazy. On what evidence? On what evidence? And by the way, if you're still oppressed by the subject, I think you're sane. Now, if an engineer has to pass a railroad from point A to point B, when he finishes his task, he either has a railroad from point A to point B or he doesn't have a railroad from point A to point B. That's all there is to it. He either has it or he doesn't have it. And nobody can come along and give his opinion on whether or not he has it. You get the idea?"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 3 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 247 MCSC Audience: Yes. This is very different than the way they were feeling and working in the field of the human mind. All right. What we have done that is spectacular is to make a complete breakthrough in the field of the human mind, taking the predictable, practical character of the physical sci-ences and moving them over into the humanities. And that is what has happened in Dianetics and Scientology. You can argue with it for years and it still exists that we have made the breakthrough. We can change IQ. We can change personality. We can alter and handle human inter-personal relations on a highly positive basis. The degree that we can handle them actually is the degree that we are experienced and able in the fields of Dianetics and Scientology because Dianetics and Scientology has the answers. Now, that's a new look. Even to some old-timers, that's a new look. There are twenty items in Dianetics and Scientology that have nothing to do with fig-ure-figure. Twenty separate items which are as solid as one of these test tubes. Twenty sepa-rate, different items are included in Dianetics and Scientology which form the backbone of this new lecture series: The Anatomy of the Human Mind Course. I haven't even written up the course yet. However, it's being given in Joburg and it is fantastically successful. Guys are just walking in off the street, never knew anything about anything, and the Instructor there, giving one â€“ they come in any part of the course, you see? And the Instructor gives this lec-ture right according to a formula, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Shows them the item and then makes them find it in one another and then has a discussion period, and that is the whole thing. And these people are going, wow, you know? Why are they going wow? It's because they're not expected to sit there and figurefig-ure about it. Here is a thing, a concrete thing, and it can be demonstrated to them that it exists independent of opinion. And existing independent of opinion, it therefore and thereby becomes as exact and accurate as the physical sciences. And there is our breakthrough. We have a practical subject that has nothing to do with anybody's beliefs. Every once in a while I am accused of romping fantastically and meanly and viciously over people's personal beliefs. Well, you'll find out that I really don't try to. I don't try to stamp all over their personal beliefs. I only ask them to realize I have mine. Look, today people aren't arrested for murder. The country's full of murderers who have never been caught. People are arrested and tried today for behavior. Is their behavior peculiar or isn't it? Does it agree with the norm or doesn't it? Do you realize that that great un-American activity called the US government has as a basic rule that in times of national disaster, such as an atomic bombing, if they find anybody who was trying to do anything about the situation, he is to be arrested at once! Did you know they had that rule? Well, read their schoolbooks. Read civil defense books."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 4 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 248 MCSC If anybody is trying to do anything or is being active, he is therefore being dangerous. Did you know that? That's behavior; policing of behavior. It'll get to a point finally that if you have a belief or if you behave in a certain way â€“ they used to call them eccentrics, now they call them crazy. You're getting to a point where you don't dare relax because behavior is being policed; because nobody has an idea of what right behavior is or what wrong behavior is. Somebody gets an opinion that something is wrong behavior and that's what's policed. This country, by the way, is one of the great sinners on the idea of trying people in public opinion. They throw it into the newspapers, and the guy's done. He's not tried in courts. He's tried by public opin-ion. That's policing of behavior. But do they find out if the fellow who are policing him are sane or insane; if these people themselves are psychotically attacking or are psychotically critical or anything? Do they ever find out about these fellows? No. Because they don't know anything about that field. Now look, for a people to be free, they must be free to behave as they think proper, so long as that behavior is not injurious to the â€“ a greater number of the dynamics. You got the idea? As soon as they tell you that this is wrong and that's wrong and that's wrong and that's wrong, ask them sometime, \"Well, what's right?\" and stop them in their tracks. No, when the whole of the humanities gets summed up into this figure-figure thing called behavior, based on something nobody knows anything about, the Tightness and wrongness of existence goes by the boards. And people become slaves just on this one thing alone. They are slaves because they are ignorant. What man in the society is right? What man in the society is decent? These are questions that can't be asked. Well, look, what's a government going to do, run totally blind? Well, as long as you don't know anything about human beings, what else is there to do but drive totally blind and hope for the best. Think of that. How would you like to be somebody in charge of this government right here at this moment with no more knowledge of the human mind and human existence than a government official at this time, does have? You'd go mad because you couldn't tell whose heart was in the right place and whose heart wasn't; who did a job â€“ who would do a job and who wasn't; what anybody's motives were or what they weren't. All you could do is guess. You wouldn't know whether your own party was supporting you or not if you didn't know anything about the mind. Now, when it all goes into opinion and when it all goes into theory and when your be-havior is all totally policed, you are no longer free and you can no longer govern and people can no longer live happily. You have to have a practical science, not a science that is a good science because some philosopher with a long, grey beard in some ivory tower has said, \"This is wisdom.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 5 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 249 MCSC Whole nations have gone by the boards â€“ whole, whole nations â€“ because they had a bunch of wisdom, none of which made any sense. India, China, these are countries which right now are almost gone. They're in total tumult. They have been upset with all manner of political flurries. They had great wisdom, didn't they? I knew, as a little boy in my teens, I saw their great wisdom. And I was disgusted with it because it always went with poverty and dirt, and that to me is not wisdom. Yes, anybody in his right mind should be able to tolerate having a dirty face for a while, but not be proud of it! Not have as one of the primary requisites of being a commissar, the fact that one can have filthy, dirty fingernails at all times and bite them. No, no. We have, we have in â€“ on Earth here today, a great many woes and difficulties and a great many unhappy people, a great many starving people, a great many people who can't make it and they all stem out of the fact of ignorance. They don't know. They have no literacy about the mind at all. They're living in a total darkness. And having no literacy, they can't understand their fellows and they don't know which man means them well and which man means them badly. They know none of the rules of the human mind. What this world needs is a practical science, the parts of which are clearly visible. And if you can see this, then you can see into men's hearts and know them and live. That might not make sense to you at this moment. But it will. It will. But let's talk some more about this anatomy course. This anatomy course is fantastic simply because it takes its audiences, raw meat off the street, and they take a look at it, and they say, \"What?\" \"This is the anatomy of the human mind!\" Well, it is, you know. And they just lap it up, and they say, \"That's it.\" And they feel very happy about it, and things go whirr â€“ click in their heads, and they go gee, you know, that's real good, and that's very true, and so forth, because we just show them twenty things that are real, that they can find anyplace. Now, when I say things, I say â€“ I mean things. There are twenty things. They are very concrete things. I'm not going to give you a list of them because I didn't bring my notes. This is probably the one time in history â€“ this is the one time in history that I needed my notes. I'll write all these up and we will be able to actually get into it and do something. Ah! One of Kennedy's appointees. But having no notes, why, I'll just have to play it off the cuff and show you only this â€“ I'm not going to show you these twenty things but I am going to show you this â€“ that we are in possession of things. We are studying things. Now, I want to discuss first some of the things that the predecessors, our predecessors, have been discussing. But this, oddly enough, is one of the things which is taught in this par-ticular course. One of the things taught in this course, The Anatomy of the Human Mind, is an item which I think you had better inspect fairly closely because you probably have never seen one. It's very necessary that you see one, because our predecessors came aground on just this one thing."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 6 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 250 MCSC There is the human brain. Well, you think I'm kidding. There's a brain. And I hope you realize that this is all they study in psychology. They study the brain. Now, this stuff â€“ this stuff is pretty â€“ it's pretty ploppy. Now, it is â€“ happens to be one of the things that is studied in the Anatomy of the Human Mind Course. This brain is a shock absorber which prevents electronic currents from injuring the be-ingness of the person. It's an electronic shock absorber and people have them in their skulls. If you were to touch your skull at this moment â€“ please do, touch your skull at this moment â€“ realize one of these brains is under it. Would any of you like to â€“ to tes â€“ ? Now, this is the brain, and this purpose of the brain is to arrest impulses and prevent them from causing severe pain and injury. That is actually its basic purpose. Various parts of this brain are supposed to do guidance of currents and are supposed to connect up into the inner control mechanisms of the individual. But they do less so than is commonly believed. Those studies in psychology which tended to demonstrate this, were taken from war casualties. If the brains of war veterans were injured in certain places and the war veteran could not move certain portions of the body, they then assumed that the brain controlled those portions of the body. And that is how the brain control pattern was made. However, in Dianetics and Scientology we have restored control of those portions even though that part of the brain remained missing. So there's the human brain and it's in the skull and it's one of the things of Dianetics and Scientology. Okay? Audience: Okay. Okay. If anybody'd like to inspect those, he can later. Okay? All right. Now, that's one lecture, and we're not going to give you the full lectures of these things, but don't you think it makes the man in the street green when he recognizes the situation. No racial prejudice guides this at all. I mean there's no racial prejudice involved in this. This is another lecture of the series of the Anatomy of the Human Mind Course. By the way, these lectures have an exact pattern. They go this way. One is a description and definition of Dianetics and Scientology. Mostly just a defini-tion of Scientology, such as Scientology is the study of knowing how to know and is a study of the human mind, and so forth. Then the second statement of the lecture is that if you finish this course, you get a course completion certificate because they keep forgetting it, and they'll stop attending lec-tures. That is to say they'll miss a lecture or two or something like that, thinking they can make it up later and still get a certificate, which they can't. The next statement is a description of what we're covering, this date. So it'd be the human brain. \"We're going to cover the human brain. The human brain is something or other,"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 7 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 251 MCSC something or other, and the psychologists have studied it, and they think it's this and that, and actually here .. .\" Next is the thing itself, described and demonstrated. That is followed by having half of the audience find in the other half of the audience the thing described, and then, turnabout, have the other half find in the first half the thing described. Then there is a break and then they come back for a brief question discussion period and definitions, just to make sure they found out what this thing was, and that is the end of that particular lecture. Do you get the exact pattern of this lecture? It is a pattern of demonstration of things. It has nothing to do with their philosophic aspect whatsoever. Now, here is one of these things. And this is the way we demonstrate them. The hu-man nervous system. If we were giving this in the lecture, I'd give you the definition of Scien-tology, and I would give you the fact that you would get a certificate if you finished the course successfully. I would give you the statement concerning the nervous system and then let you find nervous systems in each other, probably by hitting the reflex points, or your knees and things of that character. But let us suffice here that we have a puppet. Here is this puppet. And this puppet, of course, in the hands â€“ my hands here â€“ can do various things and jump around and so on, and look fairly live. But here's the human nervous system demonstrated. If you'll notice as I move this bar here, I move two black threads which you can see easily against my white coat. And now as I move those two threads one way or the other, we see the two feet go jumping up and down. Is that right? Now, as I move this â€“ as I move other cords and send messages down these lines, we get an accompanying dancing of the puppet. Now, we can move the head, we can move the arms, and so forth. As we move one of these strings, we move that. Those are control lines. This could be called the nervous system. The nervous system also serves as a warning and a pain absorption system as well as a control system. Those three things are the things contained in a nervous system: warning, control and arrest of pain. Now, a nervous system stops pain from reaching the individual rather than accelerates it. If you didn't have a nervous system that channeled it and slowed it down, it would probably damage the limb area or the body area far more, and so a nervous system is a pain absorption system. As we noticed that we pull a string, something jumps here. Now, if we were giving this lecture full out, I would simply have half of you find in the other half of you reflexes of one kind or another, or get you to move the other fellow's arm and make him move the arm, and so on."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 8 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 252 MCSC Actually, it becomes rather clear to the individual that he is moving the arm, if you get him to do it for a little while, and that he's using some kind of a string mechanism in order to do so. There is a lecture on the human nervous system which of course knocks out about two years of the college. Okay. So much for that fella. Now, you think that â€“ you think that you'd quickly run out of these things. Now, I'm not going to demonstrate to you the most obvious things in the world. One is the human body. Very obvious. That's a thing. The other is the physical universe. That's just a thing. And it's demonstrable. It exists. It is. But, much more important to us, there is the lock, the secondary and the engram, and these are certainly things. If you've ever made one bite somebody, you realize there is something there; not a belief. Oh, it used to drive me mad. As late as 1951, I was still finding old Dianeticists around who believed that an engram was an idea somebody had. And it was just about all I could do to keep my cotton-pickin' hands off of them and keep from throwing them into birth or something, you know? Or roll them up in a prenatal ball, and say, \"Well, it's just an idea you've got. Get out of it yourself.\" Now, we have â€“ we have these â€“ these â€“ these items. They're very demonstrable items. Actually, in the lecture series itself, we'll have an 8 millimeter motion picture of an incident taking place that is a lock, another incident which is a secondary and another incident which is an engram and also another incident which shows the overt-motivator sequence of an en-gram. These are all things. Then we turn the audience around (each â€“ each one of these is a lecture) and we have them find in one another these things. You would be fascinated that on a raw audience, just culled off the street, how â€“ any engrams they can find and how often they curl up in a ball and go through the sperm sequence and do all sorts of wild things just like they used to in 1950. Of course, those are very obvious items, aren't they? Well, a less obvious item is the overt-motivator sequence. It is a thing. The overt-motivator sequence. It is a very low order â€“ let me tell you something about this and give you a demonstra-tion of it â€“ it is a very low order sequence. It falls out when the person ceases to be as reactive, because it is based upon and is a Q and A with Newton's law of interaction. For every action there's an equal and contrary reac-tion. The overt-motivator sequence. If you do something to Joe, then Joe, of course, is go-ing to do something to you, isn't he? Well, the overt-motivator sequence is a little more serious than this. The plain law of interaction is that if I take the red ball and drop it against the yellow ball, then the yellow ball is going to come back and hit the red ball, isn't it? Watch. See? That's Newton's law of inter-action at work. And people who have gone down and are beginning to Q-and-A totally with the physical universe use this law as their exclusive method of operation. Revenge, ha-ha-ha."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 9 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 253 MCSC \"You hit me, I'll hit you. Ha-ha-ha-ha.\" \"National defense: If we get enough atomic weapons, we will, of course, be able to prevent people from throwing atomic weapons at us.\" Think it over. If we got enough atomic weapons, what's going to happen to us? We're going to get clobbered with atomic weapons. Right? Audience: Right. Somebody talks about the fact that you can't lick the commies, for instance. You can use this same thing, this same item to lick commies with. They use propaganda all the time. Just use their propaganda. Commie propaganda? Red. Here it goes. Ta! Right in the teeth yet. And it's true; the one thing they can't stand is propaganda. Anti-communist propaganda, and man, do they curl up in a ball. And there is this thing called the overt-motivator sequence. There is more to it than just Newton's law of interaction, which is why they didn't make it work in the 17th century; because there's more to it. If Joe hits Bill, he now believes he should be hit by Bill. More importantly, will actu-ally get a somatic to prove he has been hit by Bill, even though Bill hasn't hit him. He will make this law true regardless of the actual circumstances. And people go around all the time justifying, saying how they've been hit by Bill, hit by Bill, hit by Bill. \"My mother beat me every day.\" You put them on the E-Meter. You say, \"Did your mother ever beat you?\" The E-Meter never wiggles. You say, \"Now think it over. Well, just exactly â€“ give me one time when your mother beat you.\" \"I can't remember any.\" \"All right. Now, think hard. Think hard. Something about your mother and beating you and so forth.\" \"Oh ho. I just remember, I hit her with a baseball bat once.\" Yeah. But this has ever since expressed itself as a necessity to believe that Mother has beaten him, because this law must exist. Got the idea? Even though it hasn't occurred, human beings on a low reactive basis will insist that it has occurred. And that is the overt-motivator sequence. If a fellow does an overt, he will then believe he's got to have a motivator or that he has had a motivator. If he hits somebody, he will tell you immediately that he has been hit by the person, even when he has not been. Got it? Audience: Yes. That's another one of the things of Dianetics and Scientology. And a very valuable thing it is to know. You hear the wife saying how the husband beats her every day. Look under her pillow for the brickbat that she uses because just sure as the devil, if she's saying that the yellow ball has hit the red ball, notice that the red ball had to hit the yellow ball first. Got it?"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 10 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 254 MCSC Audience: Yes. Well, that's another one of these twenty things. Now, to show you the physical universe, of course, would be too easy, but just re-member that that's one of the things just as the body's one of the things. But we have certain scales, very definite, certain scales and certain cycles which we use in Dianetics and Scientol-ogy, and they are not figure-figure cycles of any kind whatsoever. They are not figure-figure cycles. The truths of the matter is â€“ you know, any one of you could probably do this particu-lar one better than I can â€“ but I want to show you here, here is a no created thing. It's just a piece of paper. (Of course, it's gotten created.) But we are going to show you now a cycle of action in terms of create-survive-destroy. There is such a thing as the cycle of action. Its earliest genus of create â€“ survive-destroy comes actually out of the fourth hymn of the Veda; about 10,000 years old. It de-scribes it much more lengthily, and so on, and we use it today on the basis of the cycle of ac-tion. We call it the create â€“ survive-destroy cycle. That is its crudest form, and actually is only an apparency, but is nevertheless a demonstrable thing. I want to show you how this works. Here we have nothing created. We just have a piece of paper. Now I am going to create something. As I say, any of you could do this better than I. The making of a boat or a hat, of course, has its complications. Some people prefer them larger and some people prefer them smaller, some more complicated and some less complicated. But here, so far, we have gone this far, and now we will go just a little further. (This is probably going to cause an upset with the management when I get through with it.) Well, you see here, I am creating something rather laboriously. Are you with me? All right. I'm busy creating a boat. Having a large sailorish background, and noticing several in the audience who also have, we will make a freighter. There's a boat. Okay? Audience: Yes. Now, we're demonstrating this thing called a cycle of action. And there is a boat cre-ated which is now surviving. There it's surviving. Look at it. It still sits there. It is continuing. After having been created, it continues. There it is. It's busy continuing, innocent as the driven snow. But watch it. What's it doing? It's surviving. There it is. What's it doing? Audience: Surviving. Oh, you're convinced now. Audience: Yeah. Well, all right, in view of the fact that we have this boat surviving, in view of the fact that we have this boat surviving, we have another step which I would like to show you. Be-cause the cycle of action has three steps. Okay?"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 11 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 255 MCSC All right. I hope people have fire extinguishers here. We are now entering the phase of destroy. Correct? Well, at least I have enough inflammable chemicals to throw on it here. Okay? Cycle of action. Create-survive-destroy. Are you convinced that the third stage is destroy? Audience: Yes. That's pretty good. You learn fast. One of the things of the physical universe. One of its basic fundamentals. Some of you out there realize that I am not in keeping with the fire regulations. Oh, well, if it burns up, it's all right. There's plenty of firemen in the place. Burning. There it goes. Now, what's the cycle of action. Audience: Create-survive-destroy. Do you think a green audience would understand that? Audience: Yes. Sure. And they think they understood something there about life, wouldn't they? Now, if each one in the audience was turned to another one, half of the audience was turned to the other half of the audience, and they had to find examples of the cycle of action in the other audience half â€“ you know, plague them, \"Give me an example of the cycle of action,\" see? \"Give me another example of the cycle of action.\" Then they turn about: \"Give me an exam-ple of the cycle of action.\" Actually, it'll move them on the time track. Do you realize that? Now, it moved, didn't it? There it is. There it is. Beautiful white sheet of paper, and we created a boat and the boat became a survival factor. And then the survival factor disappeared and we had the remainder of it, simple, huh? It's rather fascinating, when you look the thing over, that you can demonstrate these things. Now you see why I had this set up as a laboratory setup. The physical sciences: We are looking at the physical sciences, and the practicalities of the physical sciences are right here. Actually, there are twenty of these items. I'm not even going to try to give you a list of these things for the excellent reason that I haven't got my notes. But I'll give you another example, another example, which is probably the hardest lec-ture to confront giving, but is actually the most responsive as far as an audience at large is concerned. And that is to demonstrate to people the existence of a body. I had the awfullest argument with Pete, D of T, Johannesburg, on this subject. He kept coming in and asking me what he was going to say when he got to the body. And I kept tell-ing him, \"Well. . .\" He was trying to demonstrate these things in people. He didn't have this at first. He finally got this thing taped down pretty good, and on a body â€“ but a body, he couldn't get the idea of what he was to do with a body. When a body came along and he was to do something with a body, what was he supposed to do with this body?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 12 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 256 MCSC \"Well,\" I says, \"you get him up on the stage, and you show people a body. You know, here's a body, and you point out various things about the body like, here's a hand, and so on. And then you have people in the audience find bodies. Half the audience gets the other half of the audience to find bodies. And this is what you do in bodies.\" And he said, \"That certainly doesn't sound like much.\" Now, the oddity about all of this is the simplest things are the most demonstrable things are the most neglected things in life. It is because everybody got so fantastically com-plicated that they missed this continuously, on and on and on. The whole science of the mind as it sat there was missed because it was all figure-figure and it was all supercomplicated and it was all over everybody's heads. And one of the things that they tell you today at the univer-sity, they tell you, \"Of course, nobody can really understand anything about it, and it's much too complicated for you to find out anything about.\" Well, that's the first lie. Is there anything complicated in this demonstration of the cy-cle of action? Well, it's all that simple. And that's why everybody missed it. And that's why, if you ever give this course yourself, you're going to occasionally miss the boat because you're going to get too significant. Poor Pete. He had this vast mob of people, all of them green and so forth, and they came into the hall, and so he says, \"Well, you know. I'm a martyr. I'll do what Ron said. It'll probably be all right because he said it, but there's no telling what can happen.\" So he got a fellow up on the stage. And the fellow â€“ he pointed out, he says, all of a sudden, he said â€“ the fellow's hand â€“ he says, \"Well,\" he says, \"do you see that skin?\" (It's a body demonstration.) He said, \"Do you see that skin? There's meat under it.\" A fellow says, \"By golly, there is, isn't there, you know.\" And the fellow says, \"Aw, gee.\" He says, \"I won't dare but be able to look at a girl walking down a street without realiz-ing I'm looking at some meat.\" And Pete made this person â€“ body â€“ walk up and down a little bit and said, \"You see how the hands move and the legs moves, and so forth. And it's a body, and it has a head and it has hips and legs and arms and hands and its head and it moves this way and it is a body. All right. Thank you very much.\" And, well, I think he brought another body up, a female body, and showed that it had similar things, but was different. And then he had half of his audience finding bodies in the other half of the audience. And in the first two minutes of play he had about half of these peo-ple pooom! out of their heads, which, of course, happens every time you ask some greenhorn to look and find some bodies. He's not used to it, and he'll â€“ they saw the insides of their heads, you know, and they saw the backs of their heads and bodies and they found out they were different than bodies and there it was. He had also demonstrated the human spirit which, by the way, is not one of the things listed. Well, this is the brand-new course; will be an evening course of about twenty different evenings at about two evenings a week."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 13 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 257 MCSC Anybody could give one of the things. All you've got to do is look up and find the sub-ject matter of Dianetics and Scientology and show people that they are things and that they exist, and that you are dealing with a practical science. You're not dealing with an esoteric â€“ esoteric, philosophical treatise on thin air. You're dealing with the things of life. Once a person has seen an engram and seen that the thing bites and answers up a lot of his difficulties in existence, once he's seen a secondary or a lock, something like this, he's seen these various things, he knows he's looking at the parts of the human mind and he recog-nizes, completely aside â€“ because in no part of this course do you tell anybody even that you can handle these things or that you can get any results from them or that you do handle them, except maybe to say, \"Well, if you ever want to become a professional auditor, why you'd learn how to handle these various things which we're demonstrating to you.\" And you'd let it go at that. But you just show them the parts. And you say, \"These are the parts of life.\" Of course, these people will go out and they'll run into some old-time 19th-century psychologist and they will say to him, and they'll say to him, \"Well, I'm up in your field now. I'm studying all about the anatomy of the human mind.\" And the psychologist will say, \"Where?\" And he'll say, \"Oh, down there at the Scientology Organization. I'm studying there down at the center; studying about it. Ha-ha. It's pretty good, you know. Pretty good.\" \"Well, did they teach you anything about the brain?\" \"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We learned all about the brain.\" \"Well, did you learn about the human nervous system?\" \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We learned all about the human nervous system.\" \"Oh, well, don't you realize that it takes six years to learn all the parts of the mind?\" the psychologist will say. \"It takes six years and then you don't know anything, you know.\" And your student will say, \"Well, it's what the Instructor told us. Told us that it â€“ you have to study quite a bit to learn more about it.\" \"Oh, you're taking some lay course. Oh, how nice. Well, I guess that's all right.\" Like a psychoanalyst that came down through the test section. Psychoanalyst brought in his patient to get tested and evaluated. And we tested his patient and evaluated the patient. And the psychoanalyst sat there, and he says, \"Well, it's taken me about 2Â½ years to figure all those things out about that fellow. And you figured them all out in about a half an hour. That's right. That's right. That's what's wrong with him. I agree with what you have said is wrong with him. Yeah. I agree with that. Is it all right if I go in and get tested?\" Well, similarly, the psychologist could come down and attend this course and go away thinking well, maybe there was some more for him to learn about the human mind, thinking the course was all right."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE THINGS OF SCIENTOLOGY 14 AHMC-2 â€“ 31.12-60 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 258 MCSC It isn't something that'd necessarily rub him the wrong way, but it'd sure expand his horizon off the figure-figure, and by getting psychologists to teach that course, you of course will do such a thing as probably take the whole field of psychology.

It's the bag of tricks that a thetan has developed to keep himself from getting bored to death in this universe, and has then considered too complicated to understand and has gotten himself into serious trouble with. One of the first things you'll find the public will listen to is an exact list of the parts of a human mind as I've more or less demonstrated them to you here, except there are twenty different parts.

Life is basically a Static. Definition: A Life Static has no mass, no motion, no wavelength, no loca-tion in space or in Time. It has the ability to postulate and to perceive. Axiom 2. The Static is capable of considerations, postulates, and opinions. Axiom 3. Space, energy, objects, form and time are the result of considerations made and/or agreed upon or not by the Static, and are perceived solely because the Static considers that it can perceive them. Axiom 4. Space is a viewpoint of Dimension. Axiom 5. Energy consists of postulated particles in space. Axiom 6. Objects consist of grouped particles and solids. Axiom 7. Time is basically a postulate that space and particles will persist. Axiom 8. The apparency of time is the change of position of particles in space. Axiom 9. Change is the primary manifestation of time. Axiom 10. The highest purpose in this universe is the creation of an effect. Axiom 11. The considerations resulting in conditions of existence are four-fold. (a) As-is-ness is the condition of immediate creation persistence, and is the con-dition of existence which exists at the moment of creation and the moment of destruction, and is different from other considerations in that it does not contain survival. (b) Alter-is-ness is the consideration which introduces change and therefore time and persistence, into an As-is-ness to obtain persistency. (c) Is-ness is an apparency of existence brought about by the continuous altera-tion of an As-is-ness. This is called, when agreed upon, reality. (d) Not-is-ness is the effort to handle Is-ness by reducing its condition through the use of force. It is an apparency and cannot entirely vanquish an Is-ness. Axiom 12. The primary condition of any universe is that two spaces, energies, or ob-jects must not occupy the same space. when this condition is violated (per-fect duplicate) the apparency of any universe or any part thereof is nulled. Axiom 13. The cycle of action of the physical universe is: Create, Survive (persist), De-stroy. Axiom 14. Survival is accomplished by Alter-is-ness and Not-is-ness, by which is gained the persistency known as time."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"AXIOMS OF SCIENTOLOGY 2 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 260 MCSC Axiom 15. Creation is accomplished by the postulation of an As-is-ness. Axiom 16. Complete destruction is accomplished by the postulation of the As-is-ness of any existence and the parts thereof. Axiom 17. The Static, having postulated As-is-ness, then practices Alter-is-ness, and so achieves the apparency of Is-ness and so obtains reality. Axiom 18. The Static, in practicing Not-is-ness, brings about the persistence of un-wanted existences, and so brings about unreality, which includes forgetful-ness, unconsciousness, and other undesirable states. Axiom 19. Bringing the Static to view As-is any condition devaluates that condition. Axiom 20. Bringing the Static to create a perfect duplicate causes the vanishment of any existence or part thereof. A perfect duplicate is an additional creation of the object, its energy, and space, in its own space, in its own time, using its own energy. This violates the condi-tion that two objects must not occupy the same space, and causes a vanishment of the object. Axiom 21. Understanding is composed of Affinity, Reality, and Communication. Axiom 22. The practice of Not-is-ness reduces Understanding. Axiom 23. The Static has the capability of total knowingness. Total knowingness would consist of total ARC. Axiom 24. Total arc would bring about the vanishment of all mechanical conditions of existence. Axiom 25. Affinity is a scale of attitudes which falls away from the co-existence of Static, through the interpositions of distance and energy, to create identity, down to close proximity but mystery. By the practice of Is-ness (beingness) and Not-is-ness (refusal to be) individua-tion progresses from the knowingness of complete identification down through the introduction of more and more distance and less and less duplication, through lookingness, emotingness, effortingness, thinkingness, symbolizingness, eatingness, sexingness, and so through to not-knowingness (mystery). Until the point of mystery is reached, some communication is possible, but even at mys-tery an attempt to communicate continues. here we have, in the case of an indi-vidual, a gradual falling away from the belief that one can assume a complete af-finity down to the conviction that all is a complete mystery. Any individual is somewhere on this know-to-mystery scale. The original chart of human evalua-tion was the emotion section of this scale. Axiom 26. Reality is the agreed-upon apparency of existence. Axiom 27. An actuality can exist for one individually, but when it is agreed with by others it can then be said to be a reality."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"AXIOMS OF SCIENTOLOGY 3 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 261 MCSC The anatomy of reality is contained in Is-ness, which is composed of As-is-ness and Alter-is-ness. Is-ness is an apparency, it is not an actuality. The actuality is As-is-ness altered so as to obtain a persistency. Unreality is the consequence and apparency of the practice of Not-is-ness. Axiom 28. Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from Source-point across a distance to receipt point, with the inten-tion of bringing into being at the receipt point a duplication and under-standing of that which emanated from the source point. The formula of communication is: Cause, distance, effect, with intention, atten-tion and duplication with understanding. The component parts of communication are consideration, intention, attention, cause, source-point, distance, effect, re-ceipt-point, duplication, understanding, the velocity of the impulse or particle, nothingness or somethingness. A non-communication consists of barriers. Barri-ers consist of space, interpositions (such as walls and screens of fast-moving particles), and time. A communication, by definition, does not need to be two-way. When a communication is returned, the formula is repeated, with the re-ceipt-point now becoming a source point and the former source-point now be-coming a receipt-point. Axiom 29. In order to cause an As-is-ness to persist, one must assign other authorship to the creation than his own. Otherwise his view of it would cause its van-ishment. Any space, energy, form, object, individual, or physical universe condition can exist only when an alteration has occurred of the original As-is-ness so as to prevent a casual view from vanishing it. In other words, anything which is per-sisting must contain a \"lie\" so that the original consideration is not completely duplicated. Axiom 30. The general rule of auditing is that anything which is unwanted and yet persists must be thoroughly viewed, at which time it will vanish. If only partially viewed, its intensity, at least, will decrease. Axiom 31. Goodness and badness, beautifulness and ugliness, are alike considerations and have no other basis than opinion. Axiom 32. Anything which is not directly observed tends to persist. Axiom 33. Any As-is-ness which is altered by Not-is-ness (by force) tends to persist. Axiom 34. Any Is-ness, when altered by force, tends to persist. Axiom 35. The ultimate truth is a Static. A Static has no mass, meaning, mobility, no wave-length, no time, no location in space, no space. This has the technical name of \"basic truth\"."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"AXIOMS OF SCIENTOLOGY 4 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 262 MCSC Axiom 36. A lie is a second postulate, statement or condition designed to mask a pri-mary postulate which is permitted to remain. Examples: Neither truth nor a lie is a motion or alteration of a particle from one position to another. A lie is a statement that a particle having moved did not move, or a statement that A particle, not having moved, did move. The basic lie is that a consideration which was made was not made or that it was different. Axiom 37. When a primary consideration is altered but still exists, persistence is achieved for the altering consideration. All persistence depends on the Basic Truth, but the persistence is of the altering consideration, for the Basic Truth has neither persistence nor impersistence. Axiom 38. 1: Stupidity is the unknownness of consideration. 2: Mechanical definition: stupidity is unknowness of time, place, form and event. 1: Truth is the exact consideration. 2: Truth is the exact time, place, form and event. Thus we see that failure to discover truth brings about stupidity. Thus we see that the discovery of truth would bring about an As-is-ness by ac-tual experiment. Thus we see that an ultimate truth would have no time, place, form or event. Thus, then, we perceive that we can achieve a persistence only when we mask a truth. Lying is an alteration of time, place, event, or form. Lying becomes Alter-is-ness, becomes stupidity. (The blackness of cases is an accumulation of the case's own or another's lies.) Anything which persists must avoid As-is-ness. Thus, any thing, to persist, must contain a lie. Axiom 39. Life poses problems for its own solution. Axiom 40. Any problem, to be a problem, must contain a lie, if it were truth, it would unmock. An \"unsolvable problem\" would have the greatest persistence. It would also con-tain the greatest number of altered facts. to make a problem, one must introduce Alter-is-ness."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"AXIOMS OF SCIENTOLOGY 5 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 263 MCSC Axiom 41. That into which Alter-is-ness is introduced becomes a problem. Axiom 42. MEST (matter, energy, space, time) persists because it is a problem. It is a problem because it contains Alter-is-ness. Axiom 43. Time is the primary source of untruth. Time states the untruth of consecutive considerations. Axiom 44. Theta (the Static) has no location in matter, energy, space or time. It is ca-pable of consideration. Axiom 45. Theta can consider itself to be placed, at which moment it becomes placed, and to that degree a problem. Axiom 46. Theta can become a problem by its considerations, but then becomes MEST. A problem is to some degree MEST. MEST is a problem. Axiom 47. Theta can resolve problems. Axiom 48. Life is a game wherein Theta as the Static solves the problems of Theta as MEST. Axiom 49. To solve any problem it is only necessary to become Theta, the solver, rather than Theta, the problem. Axiom 50. Theta as MEST must contain considerations which are lies. Axiom 51. Postulates and live communication not being mest and being senior to MEST can accomplish change in MEST without bringing about a persis-tence of MEST. Thus auditing can occur. Axiom 52. MEST persists and solidifies to the degree that it is not granted life. Axiom 53. A stable datum is necessary to the alignment of data. Axiom 54. A tolerance of confusion and an agreed-upon stable datum on which to align the data in a confusion are at once necessary for a sane reaction on the eight dynamics. This defines sanity. Axiom 55. The cycle of action is a consideration. Create, survive, destroy, the cycle of action accepted by the GE, is only a consideration which can be changed by the thetan making a new consideration or different action cycles. Axiom 56.

Ron Hubbard Well, we've got our equipment turned on here pretty good. You like that, huh? This is the mad scientist lecture. I meant to give you a lecture on the subject of being a mad scientist. I think those boiling pots there are pretty good. Got that now? Marvelous. This pole for in-stance, actual name is James, just wanted to introduce you. The whole substance of the human mind has been figure-figured since time immemo-rial. It's been fantastic, the amount of figure-figure that they have actually been able to inject into the figure-figure. It was just as if thee and me weren't here. They would just adopt some ideas of one character or another which somehow or another didn't apply to anything. But in Dianetics and Scientology, in the course of a third of a century, I have found that there are certain things in the human mind. And today I want to show you some of those things. Now, this whole congress is devoted to this exact subject and we'll have two lectures on this today and another one tomorrow along with the three lectures tomorrow, see, is that there are things in the mind. There are things that you can practically put your hands on. This is essentially a simple subject. It is a very simple subject with a fifty thousand year back-ground of fees to make it complicated. You understand that? Alright. Here and there throughout the world at one time or another in history someone, some very bright boy, has come up with just one thing, one little thing, and has said \"Ah-ha, here's where I collect heavily, ah-ha.\" And then didn't bother to find out anything even about that thing. I'll give you an idea. You had a chap down here by the name of Chaka, rather unpleasant fellow, he was called Beetle. Spread the Zulu empire all over the map. Alright. This fellow Chaka along about, I don't know, 1825. You'll excuse me if my Zulu pronunciation isn't so good, I don't speak Zulu too well and everybody laughs at me when I speak Afrikaans. Nevertheless I'll fool you. I'm going to write a textbook on Afrikaans. And everywhere we look throughout history we find somebody taking one of these little things just like the witch doctor of the time of Chaka took them. Chaka was against witch doctors. When he got them all folded up he lost a lot of his inhibitions. He could kill anybody then and it didn't matter. The witch doctor up till that time had a total monopoly on slaughter aside of course from war and wiping out tribes and so forth â€“ but he had on domestic slaughter he had â€“ he was a monopolist. And he could pick out anybody who hadn't contributed the ten cows they should have contributed and put the finger on him. Now, there was an interesting point. How do you get ten cows for nothing?"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 2 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 266 MCSC Well, he found out something. He found out that people who were afraid stink. I beg your pardon ladies, I hate to use a word like that, but that's true. People who are afraid smell bad and when they are very very afraid they smell very very bad. And so we have the witch doctors of Chaka's day going through a smelling out process. I always like to come down to countries and tell the inhabitants what's going on in their country, or what has gone on. You probably know all about this, but you probably don't know the basic mechanisms. They would get the whole tribe standing up going nyah nyah nyah or something of the sort, everybody going nyah nyah nyah, and then the witch doctor and his assistants would walk down the line. You see? Going (sniff sniff) and they'd get to that fellow that should have contributed the ten cows and they'd say he stank. The basic mechanism was good, you see? It was true that a person who was being traitorous or had tremendous withholds from the leader of the tribe and so on, this is basically factual, would smell a little bad. And he wouldn't be pushing his breath out. You know, they were supposed to go aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa and the witch doctor would come along and smell their breath, you know, and he'd say, \"Aha! Halitosis,\" you know? And then he'd go along and he'd sniff them under the armpits, \"B.O.\" He wasn't' selling Lifebuoy, he was selling nothing but contribute. That was the whole lot. Well, undoubtedly at one time or another this was probably good practice. But that little fact, that little fact all by itself, just this little tiny one, you see, was enough to keep witch doctors from working for a very long time. That's why I say here and there throughout the world you find a lot of basic mechanisms or things or actualities that you can practically put your hands on and nobody had ever combined all of them together. Well, most of the things which I am going to show you in this lecture are all firsts. There are just one or two of them. There is the old cycle of action, which is not a first. It is about ten thousand years old but it's not been modernly used, we're the first to use it mod-ernly. But most of these things are firsts and it gives Scientology something more than just figure-figure-figure-figure, you know? So let's get to work, huh? Shall I get to work on all this? It's cooled off now, I can get near it. OK? You'll pardon me here, I have to get busy. I have to always look the part. This, does that look professorial enough? Hm? You will see in a moment that I need this. This isn't just window dressing. Now, the first thing we're going to take up is the human brain, the human brain. This is the most interesting of these things, and it is a thing and it has to do with the mind, and it is a brain and here's some brain. I'm glad my brain isn't this cold. Now, there is a brain. And if you rap your skull, you'll find one just under it. That's a brain. Now, what does this thing do? What has this got to do with the mind? Well, in 1879 a professor Wundt operating in Leipzig, Germany stated didactically and conclusively that the brain was the source of all thought, energy and so forth. And it was a very simple thing, this brain. It looked at itself and when the brain wanted to know what the brain was doing, the brain looked at the brain. And when you had muscular control going on, you had a brain do-ing the muscular control. And when the brain thought, why then the person was alive and"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 3 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 267 MCSC when the brain didn't think, he wasn't alive, and so on. And I like this, I like this, it's a good simple theory for simple, very simple people. All this is is a shock absorber. This is to keep you from getting stung, this arrests pain. It actually doesn't forward any muscular control to amount to anything. The reason they thought it did has been disproven in Scientology. The reason they thought that muscular con-trol was coordinated by the brain is because very often soldiers, and they plotted various parts of the brain this way, soldiers with bullets in their heads and parts of the brain destroyed, would be incapable of moving certain parts of the body. Do you follow that? Therefore they concluded then that those parts of the brain controlled those parts of the body, and all brain maps are based on battle casualties. The psychologist would tell you this, if he looked into his notes he would find it, battle casualties. So that when a part of the brain was destroyed, a part of the body wouldn't work. So they said then the brain controlled the body. Now, in Scientology we have taken people with all and any parts of the brain de-stroyed and restored the body's functions although that part of the brain was gone. Therefore it doesn't control anything, all it is is a shock absorber. When you test this out, you will find out it has an enormously high electrical resistance. It keeps the internal inside of the inside of the inside from getting stung. You got the idea? But it does not in a white European arrest an outgoing impulse to any degree. But the more animal this tissue is, the more it arrests outgoing impulses and absorbs thought. And absorbing thought, it can eventually in a low level of animal like a cat, practically stop thought. The cat can't even remember, his brain is too good, it absorbs his memory. This is a shock absorber. It is resident in the skull. It's a part of the human mind only because it is insu-lation of the human mind. If we ourselves had not totally restored body usages when parts of the brain weren't re-stored, if we had not done this, I couldn't tell you what this was. But I can and that is the brain. Would any of you ladies like to have this souvenir? Wouldn't you like a souvenir of the congress? No takers, no takers. OK. Well now, messy. You got the point about the brain? Al-right. That's a thing, that is a thing that has to do with the mind. But we have other things which have to do with the mind and you will wonder very shortly how all these things fit into the situation. And I would like to introduce you now to the human nervous system. This is the human nervous system. This is my friend Ching Chong. Me telly sung yuma? Uh-huh. He said OK. Now, I'm not a puppet master, now I just can't do very much with puppets, but they do a little bit of this and that when you bounce them around. As a matter of fact this puppet isn't well hooked up, he has nervous occlusions. Don't you? Are you feeling well today? Me soing sung yuma? Yeah, he said he's feeling alright. This is the human nervous system. The human nervous system consists of just this and nothing more. You pull certain strings in the body and you get certain motion. It facilitates the action and motion of the body and that's all there is to it. In other words, we pull this over here, we get action. Now, you take your arm, you pull your arm up, what's pulling your arm up? A derrick up there someplace? A pneumatic system that is built with a hoonigawk by IBM? Is it a punched card control system or what is it?"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 4 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 268 MCSC Well, it isn't anything very, very fantastic. It's just the fact that the body works on strings. You run a body very much the way this puppet could be run by an expert, OK? That's the human nervous system. Now, when we take one of these strings and we cut it, making it totally inactive, the person has difficulty moving that particular limb. This you can demonstrate rather conclu-sively. And it takes little more than Scientology to tie up a broken nerve. But these nerves are just push-pull cords, but they have two other functions. They are a warning system. For in-stance, I put a cigarette here and he says no. Got the idea? I try to burn him on these fingers, he says nuh-uh. Got the idea? So there are subcontrol points such as here in the elbow, which react before you find out about it. But we'll go into that later. This is basically a cord pulley, gimmegahoojit sys-tem. Now, just because I am showing you these on a Chinese, this is no reason this isn't the way you work, too. One of the, one of the facts about this is the other day a Scientologist and I were in an auditing session. This Scientologist for some time had complained about certain body mal-functions of one character or another. She obviously couldn't handle her body the way she thought she could handle her body, and so just for fun, I kicked her in the knee. Well, you know how a knee is supposed to, you're supposed to get down here and you hit them in the knee. Of course it's very pleasant kicking a pretty girl in the kneecap, but anyhow, hit the knee and the knee is supposed to fly up, the leg is supposed to fly up. Well, that is a sub control point which controls automatically and this point gets hit, this flies up. Well let me tell you, you could kick her in the kneecap endlessly, you could just keep kicking her in the kneecap, you know, just wham, and nothing happened. Her leg did not fly up. Something was definitely wrong. So I said to her, \"Have you ever had an injury to your spine?\" She said, \"No, I have no engrams at all.\" If anybody tells you they have no en-grams, living on this planet, this sounds pretty wild... a peculiar frame of mind. So I said, \"Let's see your spine.\" Well, she pulled her sweater down from the top and showed me the top of her spine. One vertebrae is totally out of line. In other words, the verte-braes above and below it are both closed together and the vertebrae that should be between them is way off to the side. A principle course of these things go down the spine and the nervous system is punched up down the spine. And of course with this much vertebrae out of line, all of these lines were closed. And when she said twitch here, she has eventually learned that you probably twitch here, see, but if you twitched here then this leg moved. Got the idea? There was a mish-mash and a scramble on this spine. So in view of the fact that this spine was totally crushed in and inoperative, she of course had body malfunctions of one character or another. Do you follow me? Now, nobody'd ever looked at her spine. I don't know whether she was shy or what. Now, if she'd gone to a chiropractor, he of course might have been able to do something for her, an osteopath. If she'd gone to a surgeon he would've removed the, the little, what do you call the little caps, the discs in between the spine, he probably would've removed those, re-moved the top and bottom of the spine, removed the knee caps, removed the..."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 5 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 269 MCSC But Man has been very foolish. He's looked at the, at aberrated conditions of the body and he's said, \"Well, these things are just natural, that's all there is to it, they're just natural conditions, you know, I mean there's hardly anything you can do about it.\" Very peculiar. How did she keep that spine in that condition? Because in auditing it could be very easily demonstrated that the moment you got the condition out of the road, the spine snapped back straight. Now, I don't say that you can take all cripples and fix them up, so forth, easily because some of them really work at it. But in this particular case the function which kept this leg from jumping and so on, could be rehabilitated and established. OK, Ching Chong, is that enough? Ula ma. Now our, the inter-spatial system there or the sub-system, you could call a somatic mind, the automatic warning system. I just told you about it, I haven't called it as a part. We call it the somatic mind, what makes a body jump before you find out about it, the figure-figure-figure and the think that goes on before you think it, the automaticity of body motion. It's just called the somatic mind. The... Every time, anytime anybody gets a skull in his hands he at once thinks it's Shake-speare, you know? Only they don't know it, that's what gets me. It keeps graveling me, you know? They say, \"Alas, poor York,\" and all of that sort of thing, you know? And that isn't the way it goes. You ever read any Shakespeare? The, what are you talking about? Oh, alright. Said there's a psychiatrist in the audience and he's scared. Now this, it's an awful temptation, \"Alas, poor York,\" you know? I won't succumb to it. This is a skull, and as a skull it of course houses the brain. And is the point from which this somatic mind nervous system operates. Do you follow me? It's simply a skull, it is some ar-mor plate. It itself doesn't do anything. But just as you don't get a shock because you have brain tissue around, so you don't get much of an impact from a blow, a light blow, because you have a skull around this other absorption tissue. Now, if you look up here very carefully, you'll find out that you have a skull too right up here. And if you'll look in right in there, you'll see this thing is awfully hollow. You can look in there and you won't find anything in there at all. In actuality what really belongs in there is a brain and you. Now, we used to use these things, by the way, in exteriorization drill and if you ever saw a preclear go yecch, you just tell him... I know this is very esoteric and I shouldn't be talking about it because there are newcomers here and so forth, but there are things in Scien-tology that I'm afraid you must talk about. Just because people are allergic to the facts of life is no reason you should bury them all. We used to set up two actual skulls and we'd tell a preclear, \"Be in skull A, be in skull B, be in skull A.\" And when they first started doing this, boy were they nervous, you know, it'd make them awful nervous to get into skulls. And you wonder what's that? I'm talking about you, a thetan. But anyway the skull performs no vast function except to protect these mechanisms of the brain and the nervous system. Of course we notice that this vertebrae here is not very big around. It's a hole, the actual hole. You probably think of the skull as being"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 6 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 270 MCSC totally open at the bottom, but it isn't. How you ever crawl into one is a mystery that only you know. But the skull has been a badge of medicine and it's been a badge of medicine for a very long time because this is about as close as they could get to the mystery of you. They could get a nice dead body, you see, and they'd find out that it would rot down to being a skull. I know this sounds very grisly and so forth, but we're all adults, even us kids. And the basics of it were that this represented death. Well of course, this doesn't represent death at all. This is simply a part of the anatomy. But when you see one lying around loose and bare with no hat or hair on it, why, you assume the fellow is dead. Well, that's your mistake, that's your mistake. You've got a body there which is no longer serving people, but that's about all you could say about it. Well, so much for the skull. You have to include the skull because it's a traditional part of medicine. Without skulls they couldn't operate. And I want to invite on the part of medicine, tolerance for the skull, because if they weren't â€“ if everybody wasn't so afraid of dying, they would never get any business at all. That also applies to the insurance business. Insurance... have this one, they tell everybody, \"Well, you're going to die someday.\" And they really don't know that but it sure does get those policies sold. Of course, I own insurance myself, nothing about insur-ance... Now, the skulls of existence are not very important, but something else is important. Now, the first hour I was talking to you about the synthetic being, the person who isn't there. Du Jacques Rousseau and the chaos of the French Revolution are not disrelated. Everybody was trying to help this non-extant being, and of course they were provided needs and meas-ures on the subject of this non-extant being, this was a non-existent person. It was just a mmmwa, you know, just a shimmer in the air. And they were so convinced out here that this non-extant being had reality, that they tried desperately to mock him up. But the difficulty was is they had a lot of non-unreal people, had some real people in other words, and what fitted this didn't fit them. And the chaos of the French Revolution resulted from such things as Du Jacques Rousseau, expectancy that all they had to do was go out and play in the pastures and if they wanted to play in the pastures, then every man would be happy. Ma oui por qua, no? Only it didn't work. They started putting little heads, all they did was separate real heads because of this ideal being. You got the idea? You've got the same condition right here today in South Africa, you've got the same condition. You have people in the north who are trying to free a non-extant Bantu. The only riots I've seen besides those few I myself have quelled â€“ I have as a matter of fact, I've quelled about three since I got here, all of them amongst themselves, amongst the natives, and arguing madly about money. Going to kill people on the subject of money. Now, the Bostonian thinks that there is this ideal person, you see, and he's dreamed it all up about this, this person, this fake person, you see? And he wants a whole bunch of measures, you see, that will solve the problems of this non-extant person. But of course this non-extant person doesn't exist so really doesn't have any problems. And they are telling you"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 7 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 271 MCSC in South Africa that you must free this non-extant person which you are holding in capture, in captivity. See? And you've got to, you've got to let this fellow free. And you think they're crazy because you can't see him. And they think you're crazy because you can't see him. You say, \"Where is this person we're supposed to free around here?\" Now, if you're going to do something for the Bantu, you do pretty well much of what's being done, maybe you'd be a little more informative to the rest of the world. Maybe you'd get them in a little bit better on what's going on. But they're still trying to free this non-existent Bantu, see? Now, what is he? He's a synthetic valence. He doesn't exist, but everybody thinks he exists. Now, let's get an idea like this. Father's a seafaring man and a fairly good fellow al-though he goes to sea all the time and doesn't send all the money home that he easily could. But mama doesn't like him, so mama tells junior all the time about this horrible beast, his fa-ther. He's a bum, he's no good, he drinks, goes out with other women, he's a dog, he beats little children, so forth. And tells the kid continually see, continuously about this horrible beast, his father. And pretty soon there are two people in the world both named father. There's father and there's this synthetic father. And as father is gone all the time, of course this synthetic father becomes the real father. You got the idea? What I'm talking about is valences and there is the most created non-extant thing in the world, the synthetic valence. It's simply created, it's never been alive, it's never lived, it doesn't breathe, nothing, it's just a bunch of people's ideas on what's this. Now, don't any of you people get the idea that I'm mad at the Bantu. I've probably got more influence with him than you have. I have and he calls me the \"essymaglopy insanguam.\" He's superstitious about me. I can look into his skull. He hasn't seen the likes of me since the last witch doctor died. As a matter of fact I told a cook one day, I said, \"You're all fixed.\" \"Yes, doctor.\" I said, \"You just stop thinking bad thoughts about me all the time and you'll get well.\" He's been well ever since. You know, I have trouble developing a practice, I have trou-ble not developing a practice rather. They come see me all the time. But what we're talking about here is this fellow, he's invested here. Supposing I were a puppet master and here I had puppets and I was throwing puppets around and making them talk and walk and do other things, you see, and I was giving them the business all the time. And then I would get mad at them, you know, and I'd complain about it and so on. And even-tually, eventually I'd keep working with puppets, and puppets would seem awfully real to me. And the next thing you know, instead of doing anything sensible or anything like this, why, I would think puppets, puppets. Like Edgar Bergen, you know? He one time got very insulted with a hostess because she didn't invite Charlie McCarthy to the party, his puppet. And I'd just get lots of overts on this and the next thing you know, why, I'd be going around like this, you know? And I'd walk in to a Scientologist and say, \"I don't know what's wrong with me.\" Of course if the Scientologist didn't know anything about valences, he'd say you had vertigo combined with St. Vitus Dance or something like that. Now, if he asked a few smart questions, he'd learn at once that the fellow was a puppet master. Then he'd look at this and he'd say, \"What is that?\" you know? Huh, the guy doesn't"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 8 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 272 MCSC know, he's just a puppet. Say, \"Well, when was the first time you had an unkind thought about a puppet?\" \"Unkind thought about a puppet? Well as a matter of fact, I have unkind thoughts about them all the time, the dirty little things. They sleep, you know, they sleep,\" and start giving you the business, and the next thing you know, the fellow can walk straight. What's he done? He's gone into the valence of a puppet. Now, this valence is one of the things of Scientology, pure and simple. But just as you can go into the valence of a puppet, so could you go into the valence of your mother, father, cousins, sisters, aunts, school teachers, commanding officers and the worst private in the company. But these are all synthetic people. You go into the valence of what you think they're all about. You don't go into them or they don't go into you. You go into the valence of what you think they're all about. No valence is ever real. But it exists, it has mass and it has think-ingness. After an individual is closed with one of these valences heavily, he will then behave or respond to this valence. That's very interesting. This person has vertigo, asthma, lumbosis, is terribly nervous, has bad eyesight, can't remember any arithmetic and so forth. And this is his whole package of ills. The Scientologist very brightly might say to him, \"Well, who had ver-tigo, asthma, yap yap yap......?\" \"Well nobody, nobody but my mother.\" And the answer of course is that he really isn't mother, he's in some distorted idea of mother. Got it? He's in a non-extant personality that he himself has created which he thinks is mother. Do you see? But it solves simply on the basis of what has he done to mother. And you get him out of this valence, there goes his asthma and his lumbosis, they all go. He can suddenly do arithmetic and everything else. Do you realize this is so important that the graphs which you get in testing over here at the Johannesburg test center, the graph you get, is actually the pic-ture of a valence that isn't you? Did you really realize that? That that's the picture, and of course the test evaluator, following down the line he tells you this is what you're like. Well, this is what you are like. But an auditor going zzzt click clap wvumf, all of a sudden gets that separated and you find you aren't like that anymore, you're you. Well, that's basically done by the separation of valences. And whatever else is done, the separation of valences produces enormous results in processing. Now, you can... the difficulty â€“ the difficulties we encounter here in handling all of these various things, have to do with the somatic mind. You know, he isn't thinking a thing as he does that? He isn't, you know? Maybe he's on the police force. The difficulty of valences lead us into the idea of circuits, and circuits of course are basically valences. But do you know the circuit can get into the â€“ a circuit can be a car, a man can get into the valence of his own car. You know that? \"You know, there's always something wrong with me, rrrrmmm, rrrmm, rrmm, rrmm, rrmm, rrmm, rrmm.\" You can get into almost anything, anything can be a va-lence. Well, we call these things basically \"circuits.\" And also an individual can set up a cir-cuit. And all a circuit is is just a thinkingness which is set up, just a set up thinkingness, that is all, nothing else. Do you know that you can hypnotize somebody, tell him that the great god throgmagog stands by his left-hand side at all times, does all of his thinking for him, is abso-lutely right, has never made a mistake in his decisions of any kind whatsoever, and will here-"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 9 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 273 MCSC inafter regulate his life for him, bang. Wake the fellow up, you have a circuit. And the funny part of it is, it doesn't make mistakes and it does everything all perfectly and so forth. He set up the circuit without any responsibility for any mistake that he makes, so it goes along just fine. You say, \"Well, what's wrong with this?\" Well, a lot's wrong with it. When I first gave out with this datum, there was a whole crew of people got off on what they called E-therapy in the United States, and they were setting up these circuits all the time. The only trouble is, Scientology and Dianetics tries to rehabilitate the individual, not set up synthetic people. To-tal reverse goal, don't you see? Yes, you could set up some sort of a circuit that would do all of your thinking. Well, what do you think you're doing when you memorize the multiplication table, huh? You sort of set up a circuit, and after that you say, \"Eight thousand six hundred and seventy-one times nine thousand seven hundred and seventy-six is thbnrallumln.\" There are great mathematical geniuses who do this, by the way. But before we get any distance into this, how do you get into a valence? Well, there is this thing and this is a thing which is just itself and it is nothing else. The overt/motivator se-quence. That is a thing, that is another discovery of Scientology. Now, we used to have a thing called the stimulus response mechanism in psychology and that worked like this. When you kicked Joe, he jumped. You see that? You kick Joe, he jumps. You provide the stimuli, he does the responding. Got it? Well, if that was all there was to it, that would be OK, that'd be alright. But the trouble is, that isn't all there is to it. There's a great deal more than that to it. And the great deal more than that simply comes on this basis. Joe doesn't always just flinch. In fact, he never just flinches. Joe does something else. Joe re-sponds. How? By doing the same cotton-picking thing back. In some fashion, he kicks you back. Now, this is based primarily upon Newton's law of interaction. There were many ef-forts in the early part of the, I think it was the seventeenth century, to apply Newton's three laws of motion to human thinkingness. And as you can read today in the encyclopedia, they all failed, nobody ever made the grade. But today we've made the grade. There are some of these laws of motion which do apply to human thinkingness and this is one of them, Newton's law of interaction. For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction. Well Man, when he gets well down scale and begins to think of himself as MEST â€“ and by the way he does think of himself as MEST today. You ask anybody around in the medical field and so forth, they think of bodies as simply material objects. \"Livingness is the result of a mechanical accident.\" Now, this Newton's law of interaction goes like this. Here are two balls here. I'm going to pick up one and if this machine is constructed right, we will be able to see what happens. We pick up this first white ball and we drop it. Now, what happened here? Let's take another look at this. We drop the white ball. What's this all about? Isn't that fascinating? That's the overt/motivator sequence and it actually is true."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE PARTS OF THE MIND 10 ACSA-02 â€“ 21.01.61 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 274 MCSC Now, let's call this white ball Joe and this red one Bill. Now, stimulus-response mechanism of the nineteenth century said that when Joe kicked Bill, Bill responded. But let's see what really happens. Ha-ha, ha-ha, ho-ho, ha-ha-ha, kicked him right back, didn't he? Now, this is what they hoped would happen. This is very hopeful, that stimulus-response mechanism is very hopeful. It's probably the one thing in psychology besides there's a... Let's look, take a look at this. They hoped this would happen, that you could with impunity kick Bill. Huh-uh. Let's look at this again. Now, according to stimulus-response, all the red ball is sup-posed to do is respond. It hasn't got any business doing anything else. All it's supposed to do is respond. Respond now, don't do anything else, OK? Alright. You got it now? Alright, now kick him. Uh-oh. Kickback. Isn't that interesting? If it just responded like this, bang, this is supposed to stay out here responding. You got it? Now, this is the way people who do overt acts in life to other people hope it works, this is the way, this is the way they hope it works. You pick up the white ball, we get the red ball and that red ball just stays put from there on out. But in actuality, what happens? Comes back and kicks the white ball, right? You kick Bill, in some subterfuginist way he's going to kick you. That's the way the law goes, the law of interaction, overt/motivator sequence. You do an overt, get a motivator. Now, this gets to be so true that people who have done overts will come around claim-ing they have the motivator. Did you ever see anybody do this? They say, \"Well, the reason I hit him is because he was very insulting to my wife last night at the party.\" Only you inquire into it and neither he nor his wife were at the party last night, nor the other fellow either, and there wasn't any party. This you call justification and other such mechanisms as this. This is blame, justifying, so forth. But the truth of the matter is, before you have originated an impulse to kick somebody, you never get kicked. And you could only be kicked in life by those people or classes of be-ings that you've kicked. Now, that's an awfully hard pill to swallow. It of course is a limited mechanism. It occurs only when men begin to think of themselves as material objects and that's all. But I consider this quite fascinating. There's, this is in the bible by the way. You'll find it all through literature. He who li-veth by the sword dieth by the sword, you know? All kinds of remarks around, wise sayings and that sort of thing, but of course there are eight billion seven hundred and sixty-five mil-lion nine hundred and thirty, twenty-three wise saying for every true one. This overt/motivator sequence, used and understood, makes, well actually makes the dead walk again. This is a very valuable discovery and it works every time. And eventually they just kind of wobble around in the absolute belief that they've had it from here on out. Now, I've shown you just a few of the things of Scientology, Dianetics and Scientol-ogy. These are just things. I want to give you an idea that these things however do exist, they can be demonstrated, they aren't something you just think-think-think â€“ think about and fig-ure-figure-figure-figure about. We are in the midst, unfortunately for some philosophers, of a highly practical subject. And unfortunately also, it is a very simple subject and I, I know that's, I know that's a bad thing.

It's the whole Latin vo-cabulary practically. We have only four hundred and seventy-six special terms, most of which mean what they mean in English. That's right, that's the whole vocabulary, four hundred and seventy-four of these items. I wish elementary physics could say as much. And with only knowledge of twenty-four of these items and how to handle these items, you can make the blind see. You could also bring the dead back to life. Well, you think I'm kidding. That's no trick. It's whether or not they want to be alive that's the point. I remember one black man that was busy dying and so on, and I looked him over and I, all I had to say was the magic words, you know? He'd been drowned and he hadn't been drowned very long. It was very easy you know? And I said so-and-so and so-and-so and I found out he was connected with enough woe in life that it was no wonder that he had busily drowned. I just asked his friend who was standing there, \"This man lead a happy life?\" \"Oh boss,\" he says, \"Oh no, no he have an awful time, awful time.\" I said, \"OK. Cart him away.\" Now, the best in life are its simplicities, not its complexities. What I'm trying to show you here is that we are dealing basically with simplicities. OK? Alright.

It occurs when the postulate made during the basic incident on the chain is gotten off. A Lock is a mental image picture of an incident where one was knowingly or unknow-ingly reminded of a secondary or engram. It does not itself contain a blow or a burn or impact and is not any major cause of misemotion. It does not contain unconsciousness. It may con-tain a feeling of pain or illness, etc., but is not itself the source of it. Example: one sees a cake, feels sick. This is a lock on an engram of being made sick by eating cake. The picture of see-ing a cake and feeling sick is a lock on (is locked to) the incident (unseen at the moment) of getting sick eating cake. When one finds a lock it can be run like any other mental image pic-ture. A Secondary is a mental image picture of a moment of severe and shocking loss or threat of loss which contains misemotion such as anger, fear, grief, apathy or \"deathfulness.\" It is a mental image recording of a time of severe mental stress. It may contain unconscious-ness. When it is restimulated by a similar but lighter experience another mental image picture is recorded which becomes a lock on the secondary and serves to keep the secondary alive. A secondary is called a secondary because it itself depends upon an earlier engram with similar data but real pain, etc. An Engram is a mental image picture which is a recording of a time of physical pain and unconsciousness. It must by definition have impact or injury as part of its content. It is of the very greatest importance that a Dianetic auditor really grasp what these things are. Otherwise he won't know what he is doing or to what. Now because he isn't seeing his preclear's pictures an auditor can become very care-less about them and not handle them correctly. If an auditor doesn't really know what these things are (erasure, locks, secondaries, engrams) he cannot of course hope to handle them for the preclear."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 2 HCOB 23.4.69RA MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 278 MCSC The basic Dianetic errors are just not knowing what these are and that they are there to be handled and that these and these alone cause psychosomatic ills. Once one has a full grip on these definitions he can then and only then hope to do any-thing with them for the preclear. If the auditor is going to handle the aches, pains, unwanted sensations and psychoso-matic illnesses of the preclear, it requires that he fully grasp these basic definitions. Literally millions of complications can stem from the simple fact that a preclear re-cords experiences in mental image pictures and that these thereafter can affect his body ad-versely. Once one really understands that mental image pictures are all there is in the preclear's \"mind\" one has understood the total of aberration. There is not something else there. No \"id,\" no \"ego.\" There are only mental image pictures. These, if you use the exact procedures of Dianetics, can be found and erased. When the unwanted locks, secondaries and engrams are erased the preclear will be rid of the physical disabilities of which he complains and will be well physically. Somatic â€“ means essentially body sensation, illness or pain or discomfort. \"Soma\" means body. Hence Psycho Somatic or pains stemming from the mind. Misemotion â€“ anything that is unpleasant emotion such as antagonism, anger, fear, grief, apathy or a death feeling. This is the entire breadth of Dianetics today. In Scientology we deal with the thetan, the being who is the individual and who han-dles and lives in the body. This is beyond the scope of today's Dianetics. If a preclear is well physically made so by Dianetics and any required physical medi-cation or nutrition, he can then embark on Scientology, the increase of his abilities and spiri-tual freedom. If a preclear who is being audited or has been audited on Scientology grades becomes ill one does not try to make him well by giving him new higher grades. That has been an error of great magnitude. Instead one reverts to Dianetic Auditing until the pc is well and only then continues with Scientology. This is correct procedure because it works. People \"come into Scientology\" to cure their headaches. Somebody starts them off on grade auditing, several grades later they still have their headache. It is a continual present time problem to them and the auditor. It sometimes vanishes during grade processing. This gives an unfortunate win."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 3 HCOB 23.4.69RA MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 279 MCSC The right thing to have done was give the person Dianetic Auditing, until he or she no longer had headaches and then begin to audit the person on grades so as to put them well above ever again getting headaches. Continual headaches come from mental image pictures retained by the pc of having a head crushed or shot off or hit. That is an engram. It actually had to happen. It is not imagi-nary or delusion. The proof is that when the auditor finally erases the engram the recording of the injury is gone and the headaches will not again occur. The preclear often is unable to confront the actual engram at once. He offers one a Lock, a time when he had a headache. One \"runs\" this lock (one always runs whatever is of-fered, you don't force the pc) and finds after putting the preclear through it a couple of times that it is getting more solid or it simply isn't erasing. One finds an earlier recording. This possibly turns out to be a secondary. The pc had a moment of loss and cried and also had a headache. This secondary may or may not erase. If it does one leaves it of course as finished. But if it goes more solid (shown by TA rising at the end of a run through the incident â€“ or if the pc says it is going more solid) one then asks for an earlier incident. One probably would then get the actual engram, a recording of a time when the head was actually injured. The auditor runs this through and as soon as he has completed a run through the in-cident and discovered (from the rising TA or the pc) that the incident is going more solid, he asks for an earlier incident. This one erases. When it erases the whole chain of headaches also erases. And that is the end of the pc's headaches period. One then inquires after other somatics or sensations and handles them the same way. It is all done by using the technique called R3RA without variation. Since these recordings contain mainly other-determinedness (pictures of others doing things) the auditor always has more control over the preclear's mental image pictures than the preclear does. Thus the pictures do what the auditor says. This point too must be grasped by an auditor or he will be waiting on the preclear to act or move in time. The Time Track is the consecutive record of mental image pictures which accumu-lates through the preclear's life or lives. It is very exactly dated. Pleasure Moments are mental image pictures containing pleasure sensations. They respond to R3RA. One seldom addresses them unless the preclear is fixated on some type of \"pleasure\" to a point where it has become highly aberrated."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 4 HCOB 23.4.69RA MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 280 MCSC Black Field is just some part of a mental image picture where the preclear is looking at blackness. It is part of some lock, secondary or engram. In Scientology it can occur (rarely) when the pc is exterior, looking at something black. It responds to R3RA. Invisible Field is just a part of some lock, secondary or engram that is \"invisible.\" It like a black field responds to R3RA. Pressure Somatic is, in Dianetics, considered to be a symptom in a lock, secondary or engram, simply part of the content. Whatever, the symptom pain sensation, whatever, it is from either the body directly (such as a broken bone, a gallstone or immediate physical cause) or is part of the content of a mental image picture â€“ lock, secondary or engram. The Dianetic auditor does not audit ideas or think. He is handling mental recordings. Ideas are in them. Ideas come out of them. But think is no longer part of Dianetics. In Dianetics we handle locks, secondaries and engrams. Key-In is the action of recording a lock on a secondary or engram. Key-Out is an action of the engram or secondary dropping away without being erased. Dianetic F/Ns are handled differently than Scientology F/Ns. An F/N seen by the auditor in running R3RA is not called until the full Dianetic EP is reached. An auditor running R3RA is not looking for F/Ns. He is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running. The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in its place. Release the postulate and the chain blows. That's it. The auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/N and end off auditing that chain. An F/N seen as the incident is erasing is not called. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate the erasure has occurred. The auditor will see an F/N and VGIs. Now the F/N is called. F/Ns are not indicated until the EP of postulate off, F/N and VGIs is reached. It's the postulate â€“ not the F/N that we are going for in New Era Dianetics. Multiple Illness â€“ means the preclear is physically uncomfortable or ill from several engrams of different types all restimulated. One runs one somatic chain at a time, running each new symptom that is assessed or stated by the preclear. Chain means a series of recordings of similar experiences. A chain has engrams, sec-ondaries and locks. Example â€“ head injury chain in the sequence encountered by an auditor and run by R3RA â€“ sporting goods display window seeing it (lock), losing a bat (secondary),"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 5 HCOB 23.4.69RA MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 281 MCSC hit in the head with a bat (engram). The engram is the earliest date, the secondary a later date, the lock the most recent. By using somatics to trace back (meaning discomforts, complaints, sensations, aches, pains) and by staying on the chain of only one somatic (i.e. headaches) you get back down the single chain without dispersing all over the place into different chains. Thus one runs the chain of one particular somatic or discomfort or complaint down to key-out or erasure before doing the next somatic or discomfort or complaint. Automatic Bank â€“ when a pc gets picture after picture after picture all out of control. This occurs when one isn't following an assessed somatic or complaint or has chosen the wrong one or one which the pc is not ready to confront or by overwhelming the pc with rough TRs or going very non-standard. Some pcs turn up in their first session with automatic banks. The thing to do is carefully assess the physical complaint for longest or best read and gently handle that chain well. Basic â€“ this is the first experience recorded in mental image pictures of the type of pain, sensation, discomfort, etc. Every chain has its basic. It is a peculiarity and a fact that when one gets down to the basic on a chain (a) the postulate made at the time of the incident comes off and (b) the whole chain vanishes for good. Basic is simply earliest. Unburdening â€“ as a basic is not at once available on any chain one usually unburdens it by running later engrams, secondaries and locks. The act of unburdening would be digging off the top to get at the bottom as in moving sand. As you run off later incidents, the ability of the preclear to confront it also increases and basic is easy to run when finally contacted. Basic Basic â€“ this belongs in Scientology. It is wholly beyond the scope of Dianetics. It means the most basic basic of all basics and results in clearing. It is found on the Clearing Course. If contacted or run before the pc was brought up through the Scientology grades, he wouldn't be able to handle it anyway as experience has shown. So this is part of Scientology, not Dianetics. Valence is the form and identity of the preclear or another, the beingness. Ally â€“ a person from whom one had sympathy and was dependent upon. Assess in Dianetics means choose, from a list or statements, which item or thing has the longest read or the pc's interest. The longest read will also have the pc's interest oddly enough. If you know these definitions cold so you don't have to mutter them or memorize them but just know them, you will really get results with Dianetics. The biggest failure in training auditors was their faulty grasp of what they were ad-dressing and their additive think."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 6 HCOB 23.4.69RA MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 282 MCSC The discoveries of Dianetics were basic and vital and opened a wide new unexplored frontier. These words were assigned to things arbitrarily. They had to be. Man had not had any notion of these things before so they had no names and had to be assigned names. The names were chosen because they didn't also mean something else in another field of science. The terms are therefore important and what they mean and the things they name must be grasped before success can attend any auditing. Any failures of Dianetic auditors were not the failures of Dianetics. The persons at-tempting to audit others didn't know what these things were, essentially the lock, the secon-dary, the engram, erasure and key-out. So these are essential to any training or use of Dianetics. L.

The student must determine what he is going to do with the materials he is studying. He must determine what he is going to do with the information he is absorbing. If a student's intent is to study the materials so he can pass the exam he will be very incapable of doing anything with the subject once the exam is over. He might be a great theo-retician, but he will not be able to use the subject. Some students don't have any intention other than getting through the course. They are just there studying away. They balk at doing demos or clay or looking up words for their ex-act meaning. Even when forced to demonstrate something they maintain the attitude that it has nothing to do with them. \"It's all very interesting to read but...\" Non-involvement is the primary barrier in the ability to apply the materials of a course.

(Paragraph three under the ASSESSMENT section on page 4 of this HCOB has been revised to update and expand upon the use of Prepared Lists in handling cases.) Keeping Scientology Working Series 26 OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN The term \"Out Tech\" means that Scientology is not being applied or is not being cor-rectly applied. When Tech is in we mean that Scientology is being applied and is being cor-rectly applied. By Tech is meant technology, referring of course to the application of the pre-cise scientific drills and processes of Scientology. Technology means the methods of applica-tion of an art or science as opposed to mere knowledge of the science or art itself. One could know all about the theory of motor cars and the science of building them and the art of de-signing them and still not be able to build, plan or drive one. The practices of building, plan-ning or driving a motor car are quite distinct from the theory, science and art of motor cars. An auditor is not just a Scientologist. He or she is one who can apply it. Thus the tech-nology of Scientology is its actual application to oneself, a preclear or the situations one en-counters in life. Tech implies use. There is a wide gap between mere knowledge and the application of that knowledge. When we say tech is out, we might also say, \"While that unit or person may know all about Scientology, that person does not actually apply it.\" A skilled auditor knows not only Scientology but how to apply the technology to self, pcs and life. Many persons auditing have not yet crossed over from \"knowing about\" to \"applying\". Thus you see them fooling about with pcs. When a skilled auditor sees a critical pc he knows bang â€“ pc has a withhold and pulls it. That's because this auditor's tech is in. Meaning he knows what to do with his data."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 2 HCOB 13.9.65R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 288 MCSC Some other person who knows a lot of Scientology, has had courses and all that, yet sees a critical pc and then tries to add up everything he knows about pcs and stumbles about and then decides on a Zero pc it's a new thing that's wrong that's never been seen before. What's the difference here? It's the difference between a person who knows but cannot apply and a skilled technician who can apply the knowledge. Most golfers know that you have to keep your eye on the ball just before, during and after you hit it. That's the basic datum of powerful, long drives down the fairway. So if this is so well known then why do so few golfers do it? They have arrived at a point of knowing they must. They have not yet arrived at a point of being able to. Then their heads get so scrambled, seeing all their bad drives which didn't go down the fairway, that they buy rabbits feet or new clubs or study ballistics. In short, not being able to do it, they disperse and do something else. All auditors go through this. All of them, once trained, know the right processes. Then they have to graduate up to doing the right processes. Observation plays an enormous role in this. The auditor is so all thumbs with his meter and unfamiliar tools he has no time or attention to see what goes on with the pc. So for 15 years lots of auditors made releases without ever noticing it. They were so involved in know-ing and so unskilled in applying, they never saw the ball go down the fairway for a 200 yard drive! So they began to do something else and squirrel. There was the pc going release, but the auditor, unskilled as a technician for all his knowledge of the science, never saw the audit-ing work even though even the auditing done that badly did work. Do you get the point? You have to know your tools very very well to see past them! An auditor who squir-rels, who fools about with a pc, who fumbles around and seldom gets results just isn't suffi-ciently familiar with a session, its patter, his meter and the mind to see past them to the pc. Drill overcomes this. The keynote of the skilled technician is that he is a product of practice. He has to know what he is trying to do and what elements he is handling. Then he can produce a result. I'll give you an example: I told an auditor to look over a past session of known date on a pc and find what was missed in that session. Something must have been missed as the pc's tone arm action collapsed in that session and ever afterwards was nil. So this auditor looked for a \"missed withhold from the auditor in that session\". The ordered repair was a complete dud. Why? This auditor did not know that anything could be missed except a withhold of the hidden overt type. He didn't know there could be an inadvertent withhold wherein the pc thinks he is withholding because the auditor didn't hear or acknowledge. This auditor didn't know that an item on a list could be missed and tie up TA. But if he did know these things he didn't know them well enough to do them. A second more skilled auditor took over and bang! the missed item on the list was quickly found. The more skilled auditor simply asked, \"In that session what was missed?\" and promptly got it. The former auditor had taken a simple order, \"Find what was missed in that session,\" and turned it into something else: \"What withhold was missed in that session?\""},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 3 HCOB 13.9.65R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 289 MCSC His skill did not include applying a simple direct order as auditing looked very com-plex to him as he had so much trouble with doing it. You can train somebody in all the data and not have an auditor. A real auditor has to be able to apply the data to the pc. Importances play a huge part in this. I had a newly graduated darkroom photographic technician at work. It was pathetic to see the inability to apply important data. The virtues of ancient equipment and strange tricks to get seldom required effects were all at his fingertips. But he did not know that you wiped developer off your hands before loading fresh film. Con-sequently he ruined every picture taken with any film he loaded. He did not know you washed chemicals out of bottles before you put different chemicals in them. Yet he could quote by the yard formulas not in use for 50 years! He knew photography. He could not apply what he knew. Soon he was straying all over the place trying to find new developers and papers and new methods. Whereas all he had to do was learn how to wash his hands and dry them before handling new film. I also recall a 90-day wonder in World War II who came aboard in fresh new gold braid and with popped eyes stared at the wheel and compass. He said he'd studied all about them but had never seen any before and had often wondered if they really were used. How he imagined ships were steered and guided beyond the sight of land is a mystery. Maybe he thought it was all done by telepathy or an order from the Bureau of Navigation! Alter-is and poor results do not really come from not-know. They come from can't-apply. Drills, drills, drills and the continual repetition of the important data handle this condi-tion of can't-apply. If you drill auditors hard and repeat often enough basic auditing facts, they eventually disentangle themselves and begin to do a job of application. IMPORTANT DATA The truly important data in an auditing session are so few that one could easily memo-rize them in a few minutes. From case supervisor or auditor viewpoint: 1. If an auditor isn't getting results either he or the pc is doing something else. 2. There is no substitute for knowing how to run and read a meter perfectly. 3. An auditor must be able to read, comprehend and apply HCO Bs and instructions. 4. An auditor must be familiar enough with what he's doing and the mechanics of the mind to be able to observe what is happening with the pc. 5. There is no substitute for perfect TRs. 6. An auditor must be able to duplicate the auditing command and observe what is hap-pening and continue or end processes according to their results on the pc."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 4 HCOB 13.9.65R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 290 MCSC 7. An auditor must be able to see when he's released the pc and end off quickly and eas-ily with no shock or overrun. 8. An auditor must have observed results of his standard auditing and have confidence in it. CASE REACTION The auditor and the Case Supervisor must know the only six reasons a case does not advance. They are: 1. Pc is Suppressive. 2. Pc is always a Potential Trouble Source if he Roller Coasters and only finding the right suppressive will clean it up. No other action will. There are no other reasons for a Roller Coaster (loss of gain obtained in auditing). 3. One must never audit an ARC Broken pc for a minute even but must locate and indi-cate the by-passed charge at once. To do otherwise will injure the pc's case. 4. A present time problem of long duration prevents good gain and sends the pc into the back track. 5. The only reasons a pc is critical are a withhold or a misunderstood word and there is NO reason other than those. And in trying to locate a withhold it is not a motivator done to the pc but something the pc has done. 6. Continuing overts hidden from view are the cause of no case gain (see number 1, Sup-pressive). The only other possible reason a pc does not gain on standard processing is the pc or the auditor failed to appear for the session. Now honestly, aren't those easy? But a trainee fumbling about with meter and what he learned in a bog of unfamiliarity will always tell you it is something else than the above. Such pull motivators, audit ARC Broken pcs who won't even look at them, think Roller Coaster is caused by eating the wrong cereal and remedy it all with some new wonderful action that collapses the lot. ASSESSMENT You could meter assess the first group 1 to 8 on an auditor and the right one would fall and you could fix it up. You could meter assess the second group 1 to 6 on a pc and get the right answer every time that would remedy the case. You have a C/S Series 53 which lists any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan and you have a Green Form which covers the things bugging a case. Plus there are"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 5 HCOB 13.9.65R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 291 MCSC dozens of other Prepared Lists which are designed to handle various things that can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. HCOB 29 April 80 PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND PURPOSE, summarizes the various types of Prepared Lists and their use. When I tell you these are the answers, I mean it. I don't use anything else. And I catch my sinning auditor or bogged down pc every time. To give you an idea of the simplicity of it, a pc says she is \"tired\" and therefore has a somatic. Well, that can't be it because it's still there. So I ask for a problem and after a few given the pc hasn't changed so it's not a problem. I ask for an ARC Break and bang! I find one. Knowing the principles of the mind, and as I observe pcs, I see it's better but not gone and ask for a previous one like it. Bang! That's the one and it blows completely. I know that if the pc says it's A and it doesn't blow, it must be something else. I know that it's one of six things. I assess by starting down the list. I know when I've got it by looking at the pc's reac-tions (or the meter's). And I handle it accordingly. Also, quite vitally, I know it's a limited number of things. And even more vitally I know by long experience as a technician that I can handle it fully and proceed to do so. There is no \"magic\" touch in auditing like the psychiatrist believes. There is only skilled touch, using known data and applying it. Until you have an auditor familiar with his tools, cases and results you don't have an auditor. You have a collected confusion of hope and despair rampant amongst non-stable data. Study, drill and familiarity overcome these things. A skilled technician knows what gets results and gets them. So drill them. Drill into them the above data until they chant them in their sleep. And finally comes the dawn. They observe the pc before them, they apply standard tech. And wonderful to behold there are the results of Scientology, complete. Tech is in. L.

A student would starrate on a bulletin completely. Then he would sit down to audit and do the action 180 degrees in reverse. Com-pletely opposite to what was supposed to be done. You see this in students who study and think the materials have nothing to do with them. They signed up for the course but they are there for some other reason than to study. They are not there to use the material. When you see this kind of phenomenon you are looking at three things: 1. Status 2. Involvement 3. Representation. Under status you might get a student who is studying because there is prestige or rank involved. \"I want to study this course so I can get promoted to Lieutenant\" or \"I can't wait to be a Class VIII so people will look up to me finally.\" You see this in Spain where an engineer gets his degree in engineering and never has to use it. It is a status symbol. They just sit there and have a certificate. Under involvement you get fear of involvement and spectatorism. The student is afraid to really get into the materials he is studying. You see this in a resistance to do Clay Tables as per 11 Oct 67. You see this in a reluc-tance to do TR 0 as per the bulletin with no movement but just being there for two hours. The student is afraid to get involved. He becomes a spectator and not a student. Under representation you get people who represent themselves as something when they are not. \"I am a student\" when the guy doesn't even know what a student is and hasn't begun to apply the study data to himself.

Demo â€“ Abbreviation for \"demonstration\". Part of Scientology study technology is the use of \"demonstration\" when a student is studying concepts and ideas. The student is often asked to show such things as definitions of terms, basic principles, etc. Two ways of demonstration that are commonly used are: 1. Demo Kit Demonstration â€“ meaning the use of various small objects such as corks, caps, paper clips, batteries, etc. These objects are kept in a box or container called a \"demo kit\". Each student should have one. The pieces are used while studying, to represent the things in the material being read. Demonstrating helps make concepts and ideas more real. A demo kit adds mass (physical matter), reality and doingness to the significance and so helps the stu-dent to study. When a student is required to do a demonstration using his demo kit, he simply takes whatever demo kit items he wishes and has them represent the ideas he is studying. An example of this is: The student is reading about how a student and his twin should sit across from each other, each with a dictionary and a demo kit. To demonstrate this, he picks a blue battery and decides that that represents the stu-dent. He picks out a red battery and decides that represents his twin. He places the batteries across from each other. He then picks out two pennies which he decides will represent the demo kits and he places a penny (demo kit) beside each of the batteries (students). He then picks out two paper clips which he decides will represent dictionaries and places them next to each of the batteries (students). The student now has sitting in front of him some actual objects that represent what he has read and he feels much better because the information isn't just in his head. The demo kit pieces can be moved around by the student if he is studying about an ac-tivity or an action."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"DEMONSTRATIONS   2   HCOB   14.5.80   MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 298 MCSC If a demo is being done for a twin or the supervisor, the student explains what the ob-jects represent and what he is doing with them (but the idea is to actually have the objects showing any action, not the student's explanations). 2. Clay Demonstration â€“ meaning the use of clay in demonstrating or representing facts, ideas, procedures, add mass, reality and doingness to the significance and so help the student to study. Clay demos give a proper balance of mass and significance. They are used to teach a student to apply. The student is given a word or auditing action or situation to demonstrate. He then does this in clay, labeling each part. The clay shows the thing. It is not just a blob of clay with a label on it. Use small strips of paper for labels. The whole demonstration then has a label of what it is. On the checkout, the student removes the overall label. The student must be silent. The examiner must not ask any questions. The examiner just looks and figures out what it is. He then tells the student who then shows the examiner the label. If the examiner did not see what it was, it is a flunk. Clay table must not be reduced to significance by the student explaining or answering questions. Nor is it reduced to significance by long-winded labels of individual parts. The clay shows it, not the label. The clay demonstrates it. The student must learn the difference between mass and sig-nificance. For example, the student has to demonstrate a pencil. He makes a thin roll of clay which is surrounded by another layer of clay â€“ the thin roll sticking slightly out of one end. On the other end goes a small cylinder of clay. The roll is labeled \"lead\". The outer layer is labeled \"wood\". The small cylinder is labeled \"rubber\". Then a label is made for the whole thing: \"pencil\". On checkout, the student removes \"pencil\" before the examiner can see it. If the examiner can look at it and say, \"It's a pencil,\" the student passes. If clay table training is not brightening that student up, then the above is NOT being done. Someone is in such a rush that real learning is being put aside for the sake of speed. ____________________ \"Demo\" on a checksheet usually refers to using a demo kit. \"Clay Demo\" on a checksheet refers to using clay to demonstrate per the procedure given above. A well done demonstration, which actually does demonstrate, will produce a marvel-lous change in a student.

He detects coming blows and handles fast (usually a misunderstood word). Course super is a working post. Course super is a production post. Student admin handles admin. A course super who reads on post has gone into a student valence and is no longer a super. In universities and other \"schools\" teachers more or less leave students in a self-study state. Students in such places are not taught. Well, let's not be back in the 19th Century. Our tech is 21st Century. And it includes teaching via HCOBs, Policy Letters and tapes. And I mean teaching. If the students are getting it so they can use it, that's the super's work. He gets students completed and when completed they can do the job they trained for. Good supervisors are really jewels.

The items are selected to add up to the required knowledge of the subject. They are arranged in the sequence necessary to a gradient of increasing knowledge of the subject. After each item there is a place for the initial of the student or the person checking the student out. When the checksheet is fully ini-tialed it is complete, meaning the student may now take an exam and be granted the award for completion. Some checksheets are required to be gone through twice before completion is granted. Checklist: A list of actions or inspections to ready an activity or machinery or object for use or estimate the needful repairs or corrections. This is erroneously sometimes called a \"checksheet\", but that word is reserved for study steps. Checkout: The action of verifying a student's knowledge of an item given on a check-sheet. Twin Checkout: When two students are paired they check each other out. This is dif-ferent than a Supervisor checkout. Supervisor Checkout: A checkout done by the Supervisor of a course or his assis-tants. Theory: The data part of a course where the data as in books, tapes and manuals is given. Practical: The drills which permit the student to associate and coordinate theory with the actual items and objects to which the theory applies. Practical is application of what one knows to what one is being taught to understand, handle or control. Twin: The study partner with whom one is paired. Two students studying the same subject who are paired to check out or help each other are said to be \"twinned\". Two-Way Comm: The precise technology of a process used to clarify data with an-other for the other. It is not chatter. It is governed by the rules of auditing. It is used by Su-pervisors to clear up blocks to a person's progress in study, on post, in life or in auditing.

Tech Services: The activity which enrolls, routes, schedules, distributes the mail of and assists the housing of students. Starrate Checkout: A very exact checkout which verifies the full and minute knowl-edge of the student of a portion of study materials and tests his full understanding of the data and ability to apply it. Zero Rate: Material which is only checked out on the basis of general understanding. Blow: Unauthorized departure from an area, usually caused by misunderstood data or overts.

Roll Book: The master record of a course giving the student's name, local and perma-nent address and the date of enrollment and departure or completion. Qual: The Qualifications Division (Division V of an org) where the student is exam-ined and where he may receive cramming or special assistance and where he is awarded com-pletions and certificates and where his qualifications as attained on courses or in auditing are made a permanent record. Cramming: A section in the Qualifications Div where a student is given high pressure instruction at his own cost after being found slow in study or when failing his exams.

It is vari-ously constitutedâ€”such as loose leaf or a cardboard folder or bulletins in a cover stapled to-gether. A pack does not necessarily include a booklet or hardcover book that may be called for as part of a checksheet. Manual: A booklet of instruction for a certain object or procedure or practice. Points: The arbitrary assignment of a credit value to a part of study materials. \"One page equals one point.\" \"That drill is worth 25 points.\" Point System: The system of assigning and counting up points for studies and drills that give the progress of a student and measure his speed of study. They are kept track of by the student and Course Administrator and added up each week as the student's statistic. The statistic of the course is the combined study points of the class. Completion: A \"completion\" is the completing of a specific course or an auditing grade, meaning it has been started, worked through and has successfully ended with an award in Qual.

It lists ALL the materials of the course in order to be studied with a place for the student (or the person checking the student out in the case of a Starrate Checkout) to put his initial and the date as each item on the Checksheet is studied, performed or checked out. The Checksheet is the program that the student follows to complete that course. The data of the course is studied and its drills performed in the order they are given on the checksheet. The student does not \"jump around\" or study the material in some other order. The materials are set out in the Checksheet in the best order for study by the student so that he covers all the material in logical sequence. Further, following the exact order of the Checksheet has a disciplinary function which assists the student to study. The student's initial beside an item is an attestation that he knows in detail AND can apply the material contained in that Bulletin, Policy Letter or Tape, or that he has done and can do that drill. The initial of the supervisor or another student against a Starrated item is an attestation by him that he has given the student a Starrate checkout on the item and that the student has passed."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A CHECKSHEET 2 HCO PL 21.7.81 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 310 MCSC The Course Supervisor must inspect students' checksheets daily to ensure that all stu-dents are following the Checksheet in its correct set out order, and that the student is making good progress through it. \"Through a Checksheet\" means through the entire checksheet â€“ theory, practical, all drills â€“ and done in sequence. RETRAINING \"Retraining\" or \"back to Course for retraining\" means that the student is sent to Cramming to get straight exactly what is missed and then back to Course and does THE EN-TIRE COURSE AGAIN. No shorts cuts or skimping is allowed on retraining, as a student who fails to apply one aspect of the course had a misunderstood which would have prevented him from fully grasping and understanding the other material on previous times through the Checksheet. Also - number of times over the material equals certainty and results (a ma-jor study datum which has been proven beyond any question in Dianetics and Scientology). ADDING MATERIALS TO CHECKSHEETS Every student is given a complete Checksheet at the start of a course. It is not added to after he has started working on it. It is in its final form when it is handed to him. It may be added to for those who enroll later but is not added to during the course. The materials which may be added to a course are those which specifically state this in the distribution. (Example: \"NED Course\" or \"Class VIII Course.\") They must be specifically designated for the course. If the distribution of an issue simply states, for example, \"NED Auditors\" or \"Class IVs\" the issue is not to be added to those courses. The issue would be for distribution to the graduates of those courses. Only those issues whose distribution specifically states \"course\" may be added to course checksheets. No others may be added. Indiscriminately adding materials to course checksheets has been largely responsible for extending training time. This practice caused the Class VIII Course, a 3 week course in 1968, to take up to 8 months to do in 1970. Note: Hat Checksheets are the exception to the above. They are to be completely up-dated with all new materials that apply to the hat whether stated in the distribution of the is-sues or not. This means that all new materials that belong on the checksheet are added before the student starts his hat. (Ref. HCO PL 30 Sep 70 Checksheets Format) MASTER CHECKSHEETS The Course Admin is to keep up a Master Checksheet for each course he is responsi-ble for. These Master Checksheets must be kept up-to-date, noting all cancellations, revisions, additions and corrections to each checksheet."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A CHECKSHEET 3 HCO PL 21.7.81 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 311 MCSC Thus when a student starts a course he can be handed a checksheet that has been com-pletely updated per the Master Checksheet.

A whole course can be wrecked by lack of study materials. Speed of Training was a major 1969 breakthrough. It takes only 2 weeks to a month to make a competent Dianetic auditor using Standard Dianetics. This can be greatly retarded by study material scarcity. The best way to handle this is to have plenty of study packs, books and clay. Another way to handle it is to break the checksheet down into parts A, B, C and D and issue different sections of it to a broad new course. It does not greatly matter which one the student does first. Material scarcity tends to equalize itself when a course enrolls every day. You gradu-ally get a spread-out of materials. In past years study materials have been a continuing problem. All possible is being done to make this easier. But as Dianetics expands it will probably never cease to be a prob-lem. It is a point which requires thought and attention on the part of every group, org, Course Supervisors and Administrators. L.

The purpose of the board is to clearly indicate to supervisor and students the progress each student is making through the course, whether he or she is making expected progress and any students which may need to be sent to Qual for correction such as Remedy B. The board has a column for each major cycle of action of the course. For the HSDC this would be one for each time through theory and practical, one for the pre-auditing exam, one for Auditing and one for final exam. See sample Student Progress Board below. Each student's name is written on a small card, stuck in the Board with a thumb tack, and moved along to the next column as the student progresses through the course. If the student does not keep pace with expected completion's, such as he falls a week behind, a red slash mark is put on his card. If he falls two weeks behind schedule a second slash mark is placed on his card. The Course Administrator keeps the Student Progress Board and is responsible for its existence and condition. The Board must be posted conspicuously for all to see. The board must be kept up to date at all times. When a new student joins the course the Course Administrator immediately writes the student's name on small card and pins it up in the first column. The Administrator moves the students' cards along as they progress through the course and puts slashes on the card as war-ranted. The Administrator informs the Course Supervisor if the board is indicating a student is not making expected progress, but the Supervisor himself must also frequently check the board and take any appropriate actions. Students undergoing retraining are on the board with their names on a different col-oured card, such as green for second time through the course, blue for third time, red for fourth time, etc. ADMIN BASKETS As a double check on student progress, a stack of eight baskets is used. They are marked as follows:"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"STUDENT PROGRESS BOARD 2 BTB 30.7.69 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 316 MCSC 1. One week. 2. Didn't complete materials in one week. 3.

Again students' names on cards are used, different colours for retrain. When a student has been on course for one week, the Administrator places his card in the \"one week\" basket, or (if he didn't complete his materials) in the \"Didn't complete materials in one week\" basket. In the latter case, the student's card on the Progress Board is red slashed and the Su-pervisor notified so he can take appropriate action. The Course Administrator keeps these baskets always up to date. RECORD OF SESSIONS GIVEN The Course Folder Administrator is also to keep a posted list of sessions given by stu-dents.

In Scientology a course consists of a checksheet with all the actions and material listed on it and all the materials on the checksheet available in the same order. \"Checksheet Material\" means the policy letters, bulletins, tapes, mimeo issues, any reference book or any books mentioned. \"Materials\" also include clay, furniture, tape players, bulletin boards, routing forms, supplies of pink sheets, roll book, student files, file cabinets and any other items that will be needed. If you look this over carefully, it does not say \"materials on order\" or \"except for those we haven't got\" or \"in different order\". It means what it says exactly. If a student is to have auditing or word clearing rundowns or must do auditing those are under actions and appear on the checksheet. A course must have a Supervisor. He may or may not be a graduate and experienced practitioner of the course he is supervising but he must be a trained Course Supervisor. He is not expected to teach. He is expected to get the students there, rolls called, checkouts properly done, misunderstoods handled by finding what the student doesn't dig and getting the student to dig it. The Supervisor who tells students answers is a waste of time and a course destroyer as he enters out-data into the scene even if trained and actually especially if trained in the subject. The Supervisor is not an \"instructor\", that's why he's called a \"Supervi-sor\". A Supervisor's skill is in spotting dope-off, glee and other manifestations of misun-derstoods, and getting it cleaned up, not in knowing the data so he can tell the student. A Supervisor should have an idea of what questions he will be asked and know where to direct the student for the answer. Student blows follow misunderstoods. A Supervisor who is on the ball never has blows as he caught them before they happened by observing the student's misunderstanding before the student does and getting it tracked down by the student."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE? 2 HCO PL 16.3.71R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 320 MCSC It is the Supervisor's job to get the student through the checksheet fully and swiftly with minimum lost time. The successful Supervisor is tough. He is not a kindly old fumbler. He sets high checksheet targets for each student for the day and forces them to be met or else. The Supervisor is spending Supervisor Minutes. He has just so many to spend. He is spending Student Hours. He has just so many of these to spend so he gets them spent wisely and saves any waste of them. A Supervisor in a course of any size has a Course Administrator who has very exact duties in keeping up Course Admin and handing out and getting back materials and not losing any to damage or carelessness. If Paragraphs One to Three above are violated it is the Course Administrator who is at fault. He must have checksheets and the matching material in adequate quantity to serve the course. If he doesn't he has telexes flying and mimeo sweating. The Course Admin is in charge of routing lines and proper send-off and return of students to Cramming or Auditing or Ethics. The final and essential part of a course is students. If a course conforms with this P/L exactly with no quibbles, is tough, precisely time scheduled and run hard, it will be a full expanding course and very successful. If it varies from this P/L it will stack up bodies in the shop, get blows and incompetent graduates. The final valuable product of any course is graduates who can apply successfully the material they studied and be successful in the subject. This answers the question What is a Course? If any of these points are out it is not a Scientology Course and it will not be successful. Thus, the order \"Put a Course there!\" means this P/L in full force. So here's the order, when offering training put a course there. L.

There are two ways a course can be run. It can be in-ethics or out-ethics. An in-ethics course means that HCOBs are applied, verbal data doesn't exist whatso-ever, schedules are strictly adhered to, musters are held, the Supervisor applies all the study tech, etc. An out-ethics course would be anything less and sometimes becomes so obviously out-ethics that you see students goofing around on course, late arrivals for roll call, students taking cigarette breaks whenever they feel like it, verbal data running rampant, and a Course Supervisor that does nothing but stand around. There's such a thing as group agreement and if a new student walks into an out-ethics course room, he will tend to go into agreement with it and join in. There's no in-between point. A course (or any activity for that matter) cannot be run semi-standardly or with \"pretty much in-ethics.\" It must be run with totally standard tech and in-ethics. If this is not the case you'll get a gradually lowered ethics level, admin will go out and standard tech slips down to \"some of the tech being applied when we can.\" When a student or Supervisor goes into a course room and sees things that are out-ethics or nonstandard or \"not the way Ron says they should be\" and doesn't do something ef-fective to handle the scene then he himself will become part of it; he goes into agreement with it and will actually contribute to the out-ethics.

Does not muster his students in the morning, after lunch, and after dinner, precisely on time, note absences and take action. 2. Permit students to talk to each other or wander around or take unscheduled breaks or goof off during course hours. 3. Permit students to eat or smoke in the course room. 4. Permitting persons to come into the course room and bother students for any reason. 5. Supervisor standing around or sitting at his desk not actively handling students who need help. 6.

The student supervisor must in all cases have with him a clip board and a stack of pink sheets. This is a standard tool of a supervisor. In many of the drills there is more than one coach.

The coach picks these objects out starting with the smaller ones first. The student confronts the object picked by the coach and the coach passes him when the Student is comfortable confronting the object or space and shows no reaction. The coach should pick such objects and spaces as a demo kit, a table a student is sitting at, a clay table, a section of the progress board, a student graph, a progress board, the entire stat board, a row of tables and chairs, a row of tape recorders, the space be-tween two rows of tables, the space of the class room, etc. The coach should cover at least this many and not necessarily in this order.

Purpose: To train a student supervisor to spot indicators and to teach him that there are indi-cators to be spotted, and what they are. Training Stress: The student supervisor walks around the classroom with coach. He has a clip board and pen and paper. The student walks around the class and marks down bad and good indicators as he sees them. To name a few, this would include dope off, frowns, students be-ing noisy, tables out of line, no progress board, no demo kit, confusion caused by skipped gradient, a student's attention wandering, students not cogniting, students cogniting, students attentively at work, tables neat, progress board up and in PT, graphs up and in PT, lots of clay for the students, lots of packs, etc. These are just some of the bad and good indicators. The student merely marks these down on his paper on the clip board. Keep it simple. The stu-dent learns that there are indicators to be spotted and learns what they are.

The drill is passed when he spot checks correctly. Steps: 1. Supervisor walks around the classroom. 2. He picks up a pack of materials already covered by the student. 3. He gives him a situation to handle based on the material in the pack. 4. If the student answers correctly, the supervisor acknowledges him and has him con-tinue to study. 5. If the student flunks, the supervisor pink sheets him back to the material he missed. The supervisor also asks the twin the same question and if he misses, he also gets pink sheeted back to the earlier materials. 6. The supervisor keeps an eye on the students who flunked and spots if there is any study tech they are not applying and gets it corrected. 7. The next day the supervisor spot checks them again to see if they have improved. If not, he spot checks them on study tech and pink sheets them to whatever study tech they have out. 8.

The student supervisor is flunked for Q and A, failure to persist until he shows the student he can make the target, or for any additive other than getting the student targeted. The student passes when he gets the coach targeted and when the coach knows he can meet the target.

Purpose: To combine all the previous TRs for the final gradient of supervision drills. To train the student supervisor to be a complete supervisor and to be able to handle any situation that comes up. To train the supervisor to handle several students quickly and to produce an orderly environment where tech is in and used. Training Stress: The supervisor is walking around the room with clip board and pink sheets and pen. The coaches start manifesting any outnesses they wish. Dope off, talking, messy area, unstraight tables, loud voices etc. The supervisor must handle each until the entire area is quiet and orderly with in Tech. He must also decide which to handle first. For instance if one student is manifesting dope off and the other has a messy area, you would handle the dope off first. Then handle the messy area. Or if two students were being very noisy and another wasn't using a demo kit you might want to handle the noise level quickly and then handle the demo kit student as the high noise level might enturbulate the whole class. The point is that the supervisor must learn to handle these outnesses in proper sequence too. Once the supervisor handles the student (coach) the student must remain handled. He is not to start another manifestation. When the supervisor has handled all the students and produced an orderly in tech environment he is passed. He is flunked for any outness in the previous drills including pink sheeting, handling misunderstoods, not getting the physical environment straight, etc. This drill should be done several times on a gradient of larger and larger outnesses.

The course supervisor sees that his students are adequately hatted as students before they start study. The most important part of the student's hat is of course how to do checkouts on his twin. He must be very competent in this skill, for on it depends a lot of the future of Sciento-logy. An incompetent checkout can stall an auditor's progress and bring about flubs in his auditing. The course supervisor ensures his students are capable of very competent checkouts. He assigns twins for study. He checks the quality of their checkouts. If it is excellent, he lets them get on with it. If it requires correction, he checks them out on the checkout material that will correct the faults he finds. These checkout materials are the only ones he checks students out on personally. The course supervisor must observe for violations of checkout materials. His use of Two Way Comm with his students will bring such outnesses to view, whatever else it reveals and handles. The supervisor walks around his class all the time. He checks where students are on the checksheet. He gives spot checks on the materials studied to date. Anything a student flunks on is also checked out on his twin. Pink sheets are given on flunked materials. Failures on checkout tech are pink sheeted. The remedy for improper checkouts by students is further study of checkout materials, not in the supervisor taking over checkouts of all course materials himself.

And that R6 materials are suffering from the same fate when meter activ-ity lessens. It's this way: The student runs across a word he or she doesn't understand. He or she looks it up in a dictionary, finds a substitute word and uses that. Of course the first word is still misunderstood and remains a bother. Example: (Line in text) \"The size was Gargantuan.\" Student looks up Gargantuan, finds \"Like Gargantua, huge.\" Student uses \"huge\" as a synonym and reads the text line \"The size was 'huge'.\" A short while later is found still incapable of understanding the paragraph below \"Gargantuan\" in the text. Conclusion the student makes â€“ \"Well it doesn't work.\" The principle is that one goes dull after passing over a word one does not understand and brightens up the moment he spots the word that wasn't grasped. In actual fact, the bright-ening up occurs whether one defines the word or not. But to put another word in the place of the existing word, whether in Level 0 or Level VI is to mess it all up. Take the above example. \"Huge\" is not \"Gargantuan\". These are synonyms. The sen-tence is \"The size was Gargantuan.\" The sentence was not \"The size was huge.\" You can't really substitute one word for another at Level 0 or Level VI and get anything but an altera-tion. So something remains not understood at Level 0 and the meter stops at Level VI. It just isn't what was said or thought. The correct procedure is to look over, get defined well and understand the word that was used. In this case the word was \"Gargantuan\". Very well, what's that? It means \"Like Gar-gantua\" according to the dictionary."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"WORDS, MISUNDERSTOOD GOOFS 2 HCOB 10.3.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 338 MCSC Who or what was Gargantua?

On his order I piloted and wrote up the procedure on the original Saint Hill Special Briefing Course where most of today's training technology was developed. The original Pink Sheet Application was to the Saint Hill Co-Audit where all students audited in one big room. Later Pink Sheets were also issued to correct flubs in Coaching Ses-sions with great success as the supervision of coaching has always been one of the primary functions of a Course Supervisor. Later, as recently pointed out by Herbie Parkhouse, HCO Policy Letter of 20 Decem-ber 1970 was issued. This PL alter-ised Pink Sheet procedure to make it a 'quickie, outpoint-correct, outpoint-correct type of action. From Herbie's experience this does not get the basic why for student errors, tends to invalidate and cause student upsets. This later PL also substi-tuted Pink Sheets for Cramming Orders which are two distinct, separate functions. The 1970 Pink Sheet PL is therefore cancelled and the original reissued with a few minor revisions to bring it in line with current procedure and terminology. Its text follows: WHY PINK SHEET? All the study in the world isn't going to make an auditor or coach. Learning the data and the theory of auditing is vitally important. Perfecting your practical drills is essential. However, the final test lies with the question, \"Are you getting results with your pc?\" Whether you are getting results or not is totally dependent on whether or not you are actually"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 2 BPL 27.09.63 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 346 MCSC applying the data and theory you have learned, and are utilizing the practical skills you have developed. The bridge between the learning of data and development of practical skills and their actual application in the auditing or coaching session can be mightily bolstered by the Pink Sheet system of Training Supervision. A student's ability to apply Study Tech on himself and his twin can also be mightily bolstered by the Pink Sheet system of Training Supervision. HOW TO ISSUE PINK SHEETS 1. Put two sheets of pink foolscap size paper on a clipboard with a carbon between. 2. At the top of the sheet write the name of the student, student auditor or coach being observed, the date and the name of the observer. 3. Head a wide column on the right-hand side of the sheet with \"Observations\", a narrow column to the left of center with \"Theory and Practical Assignment\" and two more narrow columns on the left-hand side with \"Coach\" and \"Supervisor\". 4. Take the above with your ball-point into the vicinity of the student or the auditing or coaching session to be observed, close enough to hear and see what is going on with-out intruding. 5. Write in the wide column labelled \"Observations\" exactly what is happening in the session, coaching session, or while the student and his twin are studying. This is very difficult to do for most people (especially for someone at the case level of \"only able to confront own evaluations\"). Do not look for study, auditing and coaching errors. Just look and record what is happening. Do not write in evaluations. Do not write in invalidations. Do not attempt to correct or teach in the \"Observations\" col-umns. Simply observe the session and record what is happening. 6. After you have filled one or more pages of the \"Observations\" column, now is the time to evaluate. Study what you have observed taking place and see if anything actually diverges from the Standard use of Study Tech or the correct theory and practice of auditing or coaching. 7. Write in the column headed \"Theory and Practical Assignment\" the date and title of the exact bulletin or tape containing the correct data or the title of the exact practical drill which will correct the error recorded in the \"Observations\" column. If a session observed was a complete shambles, it means that some basic, basic fun-damental of auditing or coaching is absent in the student's repertory. Don't overload the student with tons of drills and theory assignments. Look over your \"Observations\" column carefully and it will suddenly dawn on you that this student hasn't a clue about the auditing cycle or doesn't note the difference between the needle and the TA on the meter. If you still can't find the main difficulty, you can always sit the student down and ask something like \"What happens when you sit down in front of a pc?\", or \"What's the meter for?\" You'll be surprised with some of the answers you'll get."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 3 BPL 27.09.63 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 347 MCSC On the other hand, you might find that you'll fill up a couple of pages of Pink Sheet without recording any errors. The student didn't happen to goof, or the coaching drill is going well, or Standard Study Tech is being used. That's fine â€“ send it to him without any assignment. It will still help him. 8. Send the top copy of the Pink Sheet to the student and file the carbon copy in the stu-dent's Pink Sheet folder. When the completed top copy is returned by the student, with all the necessary signatures, throw away the carbon copy and replace it with the com-pleted top copy. PINK SHEET EXAMPLES The following would be a poor Pink Sheet: THEORY AND PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS OBSERVATIONS HCO B 26 July 63 Doesn't know how to coach. \"Coaching Theory Materials\" HCO B 24 May 68 Got angry with twin and \"Coaching\" tried to explain text. HCO PL 7 Feb 65 \"Keeping Scientology Working\" In the above example the Supervisor has evaluated, invalidated and only made general comments. The above may all be true but the Coach is not helped by the observations noted and the assignments do not pinpoint the major difficulty because the why for the upset has not been found."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 4 BPL 27.09.63 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 348 MCSC The following would be a helpful Pink Sheet for the same situation: THEORY AND PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS OBSERVATIONS Student became groggy. Coach had his twin find an MU and student brightened up but still had trouble understanding material.

BTB 7 Feb 72 (II) \"Method 3 Word Clearing by the Student's Twin\" WC No. 4 by Super as needed. On 2WC with coach found he didn't know to continue clearing up Missed Us until twin has VGIs and can easily demo the ma-terial. In this 2nd example of the same situation the Supervisor does not try to evaluate but simply observes and notes down his observations. He steps in and two-way comms with the coach to get more data and the why for the trouble becomes very apparent. It can then be cor-rected with an exact assignment of the correct material. He makes sure that the coach above has his own Missed Us cleaned up and the Supervisor may need to step in with some Method No. 4 Word Clearing to handle in the end. The full procedure is as follows: 1. Straight observation with 2WC, if needed, to gain data. 2. Find the why behind the misapplication or non-application of Study Tech, the goof or upset (if a goof or upset is actually present). 3. Handle effectively the why found with assignment of the material needed to correct. 4. Method No. 4 Word Clearing may be required. 5. Trace down who originally coached or checked out the student receiving the Pink Sheet and straighten him or her out."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 5 BPL 27.09.63 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 349 MCSC 6. Continue the above and you will have an F/Ning and rapidly progressing course room full of students. COACHING PINK SHEETS Pink Sheets should be coached in both Practical and Theory. The coach first reviews the observations thoroughly with the student, finds and clears up the misunderstood words, and goes over and over the bulletin or drill with the student until the correct data is com-pletely learned and understood or until the student can perfectly execute the drill. Once this is done, the coach signs his name opposite the assignment notation on the Pink Sheet in the coach's column. The student is then ready to have a checkout on the as-signed material. CHECKING OUT PINK SHEETS In checking out the assigned material on a student's Pink Sheet, the Supervisor should carefully go over the \"Observations\" with the student and have the student spot the specific errors he has made, then have the student give the correct data from the assigned bulletin or tape or show by doing the practical drill that he has now mastered the skill that was poorly applied while studying or in the auditing or coaching session. The whole bulletin or drill should be reviewed by the Supervisor but specific attention should be paid to points that the student was observed to be weak in applying to his study, auditing or coaching. Be doubly strict on these points to be sure the student doesn't continue to make the same errors again and again. If each Pink Sheet thoroughly corrects only one gross error, really knocks it out, the student's study, auditing or coaching ability will improve markedly in a very short time. CONCLUSION Pink Sheets are never used as punishment or to make the student wrong. They are used to improve the student's study, auditing or coaching ability by having him thoroughly learn data and practical skills he is weak in. A student's weakness in data and skills often will not show up under the normal condi-tions of theory and practical testing but it will stick out like a sore thumb when he has to ap-ply them in an actual auditing or coaching session or while actually studying. Therefore, a Pink Sheet Assignment does not mean that the student hasn't learned the material if he has already passed it in Theory or Practical. It does mean that he hasn't learned it well enough to utilize it while studying or under the duress of an actual Auditing or Coaching Session. If a student has gone a few days without receiving a Pink Sheet, he should start screaming. If his auditing or coaching is not being observed and his weak points picked up, how does he expect to improve.

(As examples of misunderstood status, one could misunderstand an object's location or its time factor, or the state or condi-tion of someone or something.) Most people go around thinking that a misunderstood is just something they obviously don't know â€“ a \"not-understood.\" A \"not-understood\" is a misunderstood but there are additional ways a person can misunderstand a word. A misunderstood word or symbol is defined as a word or symbol for which the student has: 1. A FALSE (TOTALLY WRONG) DEFINITION: A definition that has no relationship to the actual meaning of the word or symbol whatsoever. Example: The person reads or hears the word \"cat\" and thinks that \"cat\" means \"box.\" You can't get more wrong."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"THE MISUNDERSTOOD WORD DEFINED 2 HCOB 17.7.79R I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 352 MCSC Example: A person sees an equals sign (=) and thinks it means to subtract something twice. 2. AN INVENTED DEFINITION: An invented definition is a version of a false defini-tion. The person has made it up himself or has been given an invented definition. Not know-ing the actual definition he invents one for it. This is sometimes difficult to detect because he is certain he knows it, after all he invented it himself. There is enough protest preceding his invention of it to make it read on a meter. In such a case he will be certain he knows the defi-nition of the word or symbol. Example: The person when very young was always called \"a girl\" by his pals when he refused to do anything daring. He invents the definition of \"girl\" to be \"a cowardly person.\" Example: A person never knew the meaning of the symbol for an exclamation point (!) but seeing it in comic strips as representing swear words invents the definition for it \"a foul curse\" and regards it accordingly in everything he reads. 3. AN INCORRECT DEFINITION: A definition that is not right but may have some re-lationship to the word or symbol or be in a similar category. Example: The person reads or hears the word \"computer\" and thinks it is \"type-writer.\" This is an incorrect meaning for \"computer\" even though a typewriter and a computer are both types of machines. Example: A person thinks a period (.) after an abbreviation means that you halt in reading at that point. 4. AN INCOMPLETE DEFINITION: A definition that is inadequate. Example: The person reads the word \"office\" and thinks it means \"room.\" The defini-tion of the word \"office\" is: \"a room or building in which a person transacts his business or carries on his stated occupation.\" (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language) The person's definition is incomplete for the word \"office.\" Example: The person sees an apostrophe (') and knows that it means that something is owned ('s) but does not know that it also is used to show that a letter has been left out of a word. He sees the word \"can't\" and immediately tries to figure out who can is. 5. AN UNSUITABLE DEFINITION: A definition that does not fit the word as it is used in the context of the sentence one has heard or read. Example: The person hears the sentence: \"I am dressing a turkey.\" The person's under-standing of \"dressing\" is \"putting clothes on.\" That is one definition of \"dressing\" but it is an unsuitable definition for the word as it is used in the sentence he has heard. Because he has an unsuitable definition he thinks someone is putting clothes on a turkey. As a result the sentence he has heard doesn't really make sense to him. The definition of \"dressing\" that correctly ap-"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"THE MISUNDERSTOOD WORD DEFINED 3 HCOB 17.7.79R I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 353 MCSC plies in the sentence he has heard is: \"to prepared for use as food, by making ready to cook, or by cooking.\" (Ref: The Oxford English Dictionary) The person will only truly understand what he is hearing when he has fully cleared the word \"dressing\" in all its meanings, as he will then also have the definition that correctly ap-plies in the context. Example: The person sees a dash (-) in the sentence: \"I finished numbers 3 - 7 today.\" He thinks a dash is a minus sign, realizes you cannot subtract 7 from 3 and so cannot under-stand it. 6. A HOMONYMIC (one word which has two or more distinctly separate meanings) DEFINITION: A homonym is a word that is used to designate several different things which have totally different meanings; or a homonym can be one of two or more words that have the same sound, sometimes the same spelling, but differ in meaning. Example: The person reads the sentence: \"I like to box.\" The person understands this sentence to mean that someone likes to put things in \"containers.\" The person has the right meaning for the word \"box,\" but he has the wrong word! There is another word \"box\" which is being used in the sentence he has just read and means: \"to fight another in a boxing match.\" (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language) The person has a misunderstood because he has a homonymic definition for the word \"box\" and will have to clear the second word \"box\" before he understands the sentence. Example: The person sees a plus sign (+) and as it resembles a cross he thinks it is something religious. Example: The person hears the word \"period\" in the sentence: \"It was a disorderly pe-riod in history\" and knowing that \"period\" comes at the end of a sentence and means stop, supposes that the world ended at that point. Example: Homonymic misunderstoods can also occur when a person does not know the informal or slang usage of a word. The person hears someone on the radio singing: \"When my Honey walks down the street.\" The person thinks a \"thick, sweet, yellow or golden liquid, good to eat, that bees make out of the nectar they collect from flowers\" is walking down the street! He doesn't know the informal definition of \"honey\" which is: \"sweet one: a pet name\" which is how it is being used in the song. (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language) 7. A SUBSTITUTE (SYNONYM â€“ a word which has a similar but not the same mean-ing) DEFINITION: A substitute definition occurs when a person uses a synonym for the definition of a word. A synonym is not a definition. A synonym is a word having a meaning similar to that of another word. Example: The person reads the word \"portly\" and thinks the definition of the word is \"fat.\" \"Fat\" is a synonym for the word \"portly.\" The person has a misunderstood because the"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"THE MISUNDERSTOOD WORD DEFINED 4 HCOB 17.7.79R I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 354 MCSC word \"portly\" means: \"of a stately appearance and carriage; impressive, especially on account of size.\" (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language) The person does not have the full meaning of \"portly\" if he thinks it just means \"fat.\" Knowing synonyms for words increases your vocabulary but it does not mean you un-derstand the meaning of a word. Learn the full definition for a word as well as its synonyms. 8. AN OMITTED (MISSING) DEFINITION: An omitted definition is a definition of a word that the person is missing or is omitted from the dictionary he is using. Example: The person hears the line \"The food here is too rich.\" This person knows two definitions for the word \"rich.\" He knows that \"rich\" means \"having much money, land, goods, etc.\" and \"wealthy people.\" Neither of these definitions make much sense to him in the sentence he has just heard. He cannot understand what food could have to do with having a lot of money. Omitted definitions can come about from using dinky dictionaries. If the person had looked up \"rich\" in a small paperback dictionary, he would probably still be stuck with his misunderstood. A dinky dictionary probably will not give him the definition he needs. In or-der to understand the word he would have to get a good sized dictionary to ensure it gives him the omitted definition which is: \"having in a high degree qualities pleasing to the senses; lus-cious to the taste: often implying an unwholesome excess of butter, fats, flavoring, etc.\" (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language) Example: The person reads \"He estimated the light at f 5.6.\" He can't figure what this \"f\" is, so he looks up \"f\" in the American Heritage Dictionary and wonders if it is temperature or money or sports for \"foul\" or maybe the money \"franc.\" The text doesn't refer to France so he can't figure it out. Omitted in the American Heritage is the photography definition of \"f\" which simply means \"the number which shows the width of the hole the light goes through in the lens.\" The moral of this is to have enough dictionaries around. NOTE: It can occur that an accurate definition for a word is not given in any diction-ary which is an error in the language itself. 9. A NO-DEFINITION: A no-definition is a \"not-understood\" word or symbol. Example: The person reads the sentence \"The business produced no lucre.\" No under-standing occurs, as he has no definition for \"lucre.\" The word means: \"money, especially as the object of greed; gain.\" (Ref: Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Lan-guage) It isn't that he has the word in-correctly, unsuitable or any other way defined, he has no definition for it at all. He has never looked it up and gotten it defined. Thus he does not understand it. The definition does not exist for him until he looks it up and gets it clearly un-derstood . Example: The person sees a dot at the end of a word on a printed page and having no definition for \"a period (.)\" tends to run all of his sentences together. "},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"THE MISUNDERSTOOD WORD DEFINED 5 HCOB 17.7.79R I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 355 MCSC 10. A REJECTED DEFINITION: A rejected definition is a definition of a word which the person will not accept. The reasons why he will not accept it are usually based on emo-tional reactions connected with it. The person finds the definition degrading to himself or his friends or group in some imagined way or restimulative to him in some fashion. Although he may have a total misunderstood on the word he may refuse to have it explained or look it up. Example: The person refuses to look up the word \"mathematics.\" He doesn't know what it means, he doesn't want to know what it means, and he won't have anything to do with it. A discussion of why he refuses to look it up discloses that he was expelled from school because he flunked with violence his first month of his first course in mathematics. If he were to realize that he flunked because he didn't know what he was supposed to study he would then be willing to look the word up. Example: The person refuses to look up the definition of asterisk (*). On discussion it turns out that every time he sees an asterisk on the page he knows the material will be \"very hard to read\" and is \"literary,\" \"difficult\" and \"highbrow.\" Discussion of why he won't look it up usually reveals and releases the emotional charge connected with it which he may never have looked at before. Properly handled he will now want to look it up, having gained an insight into why he wouldn't. ____________________ Any word you come across which fits one or more of the above definitions of a mis-understood word or symbol must be cleared up, using a good size dictionary or more than one dictionary or text book or encyclopedia. It is catastrophic to go on past or ignore a misunderstood word or symbol as one sim-ply will not understand what he is studying. A student must discipline himself not to go past misunderstood words. He should learn to recognize from his reaction to what he is reading, especially the mental blankness which usually ensues right after one, that he has gone by a misunderstood. He should look them up and get them fully defined before going on with his reading. Students must be persuaded to do this. It is a self-discipline that has to be learned. The definitions of \"misunderstood\" and \"not-understood\" and their different types, must be clearly understood by a person seeking to clear them in himself and others. The commonest error in Word Clearing is for the person being word cleared to believe that a mis-understood is something he simply does not know. With this limited definition he cannot ade-quately be word cleared nor can he adequately word clear others. So these definitions of \"misunderstood\" and \"not-understood\" should be very well known as it will often be neces-sary to clarify them to the person being word cleared. Good reading. L.

Word Clearing Series 59RA CLEARING WORDS (Ref: HCOB 7 Sep 74 Word Clearing Series 54 Superliteracy and the Cleared Word HCOB 17 Jul 79 I Word Clearing Series 64 The Misunderstood Word, Defined) In research concerning Word Clearing, study and training done with various groups over the recent past months, it has become all too obvious that a misunderstood word remains misunderstood and will later hang a person up unless he clears the meaning of the word in the context of the materials being read or studied and also clears it in all of its various uses in general communication. When a word has several different definitions, one cannot limit his understanding of the word to one definition only and call the word \"understood.\" One must be able to under-stand the word when, at a later date, it is used in a different way. HOW TO CLEAR A WORD To clear a word one looks it up in a good dictionary. Dictionaries recommended are The Oxford English Dictionary or the Shorter Oxford Dictionary and Funk and Wagnalls Standard English Dictionary. The first step is to look rapidly over the definitions to find the one which applies to the context in which the word was misunderstood. One reads the definition and uses it in sen-tences until one has a clear concept of that meaning of the word. This could require ten or more sentences. Then one clears each of the other definitions of that word, using each in sentences un-til one has a conceptual understanding of each definition. The next thing to do is to clear the derivation â€“ which is the explanation of where the word came from originally. This will help gain a basic understanding of the word. Don't clear the technical or specialized definitions (math, biology, etc.) or obsolete (no longer used) or archaic (ancient and no longer in general use) definitions unless the word is being used that way in the context where it was misunderstood."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"CLEARING WORDS 2 HCOB 23.3.78RA I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 358 MCSC Most dictionaries give the idioms of a word. An idiom is a phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of the words. For example, \"give in\" is an English idiom meaning \"yield.\" Quite a few words in English have idiomatic uses and these are usually given in a dictionary after the definitions of the word itself. These idi-oms have to be cleared. One must also clear any other information given about the word, such as notes on its usage, synonyms, etc. so as to have a full understanding of the word. If one encounters a misunderstood word or symbol in the definition of a word being cleared, one must clear it right away using this same procedure and then return to the defini-tion one was clearing. (Dictionary symbols and abbreviations are usually given in the front of the dictionary.) EXAMPLE You are reading the sentence \"He used to clean chimneys for a living\" and you're not sure what \"chimneys\" means. You find it in the dictionary and look through the definitions for the one that applies. It says \"A flue for the smoke or gases from a fire.\" You're not sure what \"flue\" means so you look that up: it says \"A channel or passage for smoke, air or gasses of combustion.\" That fits and makes sense so you use it in some sen-tences until you have a clear concept of it. \"Flue\" in this dictionary has other definitions, each of which you would clear and use in sentences. Look up the derivation of the word \"flue.\" Now go back to \"chimney.\" The definition \"A flue for the smoke or gases from a fire,\" now makes sense so you use it in sentences until you have a concept of it. You then clear the other definitions. One dictionary has an obsolete definition and a geological definition. You would skip both of these as they aren't in common usage. Now clear up the derivation of the word. One finds in the derivation that it originally came from the Greek word \"kaminos,\" which means \"furnace.\" If the word had any synonym studies, usage notes or idioms, they would all be cleared too. That would be the end of clearing \"chimney.\" CONTEXT UNKNOWN If you don't know the context of the word, as in Word Clearing Methods 1, 5 (when done from a list), 6 or 8, you should start with the first definition and clear all definitions, derivation, idioms, etc. as covered above."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"CLEARING WORDS 3 HCOB 23.3.78RA I MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 359 MCSC \"WORD CHAINS\" If you find yourself spending a lot of time clearing words within definitions of words, you should get a simpler dictionary. A good dictionary will enable you to clear a word with-out having to look up a lot of other ones in the process. CLEARED WORDS A cleared word is one which has been cleared to the point of full conceptual un-derstanding by clearing each of the common meanings of that word plus any technical or specialized meanings of that word that pertain to the subject being handled. That's what a cleared word is. It is a word that is understood. In metered Word Clear-ing this would be accompanied by a floating needle and very good indicators. There can be more than one F/N per word. Clearing a word must end in an F/N and VGIs. Off the meter this would be accompanied by very good indicators.

The Course Administrator's purpose is to help the course supervisor keep all bodies correctly arranged placed or routed and to keep all course materials folders records checksheets invoices and despatches handled, filled out and properly filed. Âš The essence, whether we have an Administrator or not is to: Âš Have adequate materials, packs, books and checksheets. Âš Issue what is needed promptly. Âš Demand what must be filled in promptly.

Âš Safeguard don't lose and keep neatly available all materials records and admin items. ____________________ The Invoice system of a course is an item that has to be kept in. If in an org you don't find it in, you force it in. The Course Supervisor receives a copy of the invoice enrolling the student. This is the student's \"pass\" to enter the course. It means he has paid and financial arrangements are final-ized. Without this you don't let the applicant on the course. This saves several things and prevents heavy upsets. You can actually teach a whole course and then find suddenly it wasn't economical for the org as the Registrative end of it which is not in the Course Supervisor's view, fell down and no money or little money was taken in."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"COURSE ADMINISTRATION 2 HCO PL 15.05.69 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 368 MCSC A student who isn't properly enrolled is a freeloader and has a withhold that prevents gain. Also, you will find that those who don't contribute don't value the course and you get enturbulation. The Course Supervisor works hard, he suddenly finds he can't have materials or facili-ties or promotion because it isn't \"economical\". If he has his invoices he knows how much is being made and can demand some portion of it to keep his course going or to get help for it. The Course Supervisor can and should reject an N/C (No charge) Invoice or a \"cour-tesy\" invoice. If he gets an award invoice he must insist that the awarding org pay for it even to him-self. The \"withhold from salary\" invoices are often not deducted in fact and by keeping track of these, the Course Supervisor can demand evidence these sums have been paid in. Training makes the most profitable income of the org as it requires the least expendi-ture. An org can almost go broke doing only auditing. It's training that makes income for use. Auditing absorbs the income in overhead. Yet training gets the least facilities and supplies and help while being the most important income producer. Money made in training students must also cover supplies, study packs, books, suffi-cient help, quarters, uniforms for Course personnel, etc. Course income should result in heavy expenditure on course promotion. This is the way Dianetics and Scientology will spread-through training. A tightly scheduled, smartly run course is always full. It goes empty the moment it goes slack. This is a startling fact. People detest (by years of experience in orgs) a sloppy, permissive, badly disciplined Course run with inadequate materials and supplies. You can say with certainty loud and clear that an empty course has been badly sched-uled, the Supervisor not on deck on time, materials lacking. The moment these points get IN, the course fills up. Excellent, neat admin is all part of a well run course. Things filed, marked up, issued smoothly and promptly. Students routed quickly, gotten in action. NOTHING BACKLOGGED That is the motto of a good course. Handle everything that comes up NOW and com-pletely. Any backlog is death to smooth administration. Be precise and definite, don't fumble around. Absent students, late students, enturbulative students, you turn the matter over to Eth-ics at once.

An empty class with no enrollees is traced always to violation of these points. People like it this way. It makes auditors. The moment you violate this you have a clinic not a class and you wind up with no auditors trained. A course should be taught very tough. The supervisor's first premises is that a student doesn't have a case. There is an old training rule in Dianetics and Scientology â€“ if a mist forms on a mirror held up to the student's mouth, he can carry on. Never sympathize with a student, just train him. THREE VITAL DATA There are three vital data which make the difference between a successful course and one which fails utterly. They are: 1. Exact Scheduling. 2. Supervisor Presence. 3. Supervisor refusal to answer Tech Questions but only refers the student to the materials. Exact scheduling means just that. The course has a daily schedule, it is known to each student, and it is adhered to exactly. The course commences each day and after each break exactly on time, with a brisk, snappy rollcall. It is ended exactly on time by the supervisor. The supervisor must be present with the class at all times and ON TIME. Continuous inspection of what is going on, correction by referral to the right bulletin, and just being there as a supervisor will bring about trained students.

URGENT â€“ IMPORTANT SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINEUP It has recently been found that there are blocks to Academy and major course training which are slowing the training of Auditors and C/Ses. It has been additionally found that the erroneous requirement of BSM before Academy contained in the above HCO PL had intro-duced a training cutative by taking the Student Hat and Study Tapes out of the training line-up. It is well known that these materials have been the backbone of Scientology training since their introduction in 1964. They are therefore fully reinstated by this BPL. The basics of successful training are simply the basics of Standard Study Tech. This means fast courses that encourage more enrollment and that produce Auditors and C/Ses and Supervisors who really know and apply Standard Tech. Further, staff training is itself vital in an org. It is a matter of survival to an org to be able to train its staff quickly. STAFF TRAINING AND HATTING The only prerequisite for Staff Hatting is BSM done per the checksheet. PRD is not a prerequisite, nor is a Student Hat nor is Word Clearing Method 1. Where a staff member has had neither the PRD nor M1, he may not fast flow his hatting, but may only starrate checkout, and take exams to graduate. Where a staff member has had PRD or Student Hat and Method 1, he may fast flow his hatting with no twin checkouts, no examination, but only by attest. Staff training on Major Tech or Admin courses is as given later in this BPL.

It is important to note the difference between staff Hatting and staff Training. For an exact outline of the basic sequence of hatting, see HCO PL 24 JULY 72, ESTO SERIES 23, THE VITAL NECESSITY OF HATTING. FAST FLOW TRAINING RULES Following are the rules of Fast Flow Training: 1. The only prerequisite for a student, staff or public, to be able to Fast Flow his courses is Student Hat and Method 1 Word Clearing. Where a student has already done the full Primary Rundown, he is also qualified to Fast Flow his courses. 2. Requirements of twin training or checkouts for Academy are suspended. 3. The prerequisites for Major Courses and Academy training are Student Hat and Method 1 Word Clearing. BSM as an Academy prerequisite is abolished. 4. Where a student has not yet completed his Method 1 Word Clearing, he is not to be held up or denied his Academy Courses or put onto smaller courses, but may get on with his Academy doing Starrate Checkouts and examinations to graduate while com-pleting M1. 5. The Student Hat Course including Study Tapes is one time only free and mandatory for any Major Course. (Note: A full Academy Package 0-IV must be purchased in or-der for this offer to be applicable â€“ not just individual levels.) 6. Method 1 Word Clearing must be fully done with each word taken to F/N as well as F/Ning the final assessment. 7. Method 1 may be done either on a Student Co-Audit or in the HGC. If purchased in the HGC, professional rates apply for those students who have purchased the full Academy 0-IV. If done on a student Co-Audit, the Method 1 Co-Audit Course must be completed and is free for those students who have purchased the full Academy 0-IV. 8. The above rules apply to OEC training. 9. The above rules apply to AOs and SHs. 10. Method 1 Word Clearing is not a prerequisite for HSDC or HPDC, but is advised. FAST FLOW AND QUAL Students who graduate Academy training Fast Flow are not made to take examina-tions. Courses are passed by attestation at C&A that the student has: (a) enrolled properly on the course, (b) paid in full for the course (or has signed a no charge invoice in the case of 2Â½ or 5 year contracted staff), (c) studied and understands all the materials on the checksheet, and (e) can produce the result required in the materials of the course."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINEUP 3 BPL 18.10.76 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 377 MCSC Interneships and High Crime Checkouts requirements remain as issued. High Crime Checkouts and cramming actions requiring starrates are done starrated and not fast flow. Interneship graduation requirements are that a full Interneship as formal auditing ex-perience is completed. When actual honest evidence is presented to C&A that a student has demonstrated that he can and has produced flubless results, the Interne's Certificate is vali-dated and made permanent. Until an Interneship is completed as above, Academy certificates are provisional. With other courses the person must demonstrate that he can apply the materials stud-ied by producing an actual statistic in the materials studied, such as an Apprenticeship done in full. This evidence is presented to C&A and the student receives a validation gold seal, mak-ing his certificate permanent. Qual has the responsibility of safeguarding the technology. Qual must be very strong to fulfill its responsibility, especially under Fast Flow training. Ethics must be accurate and not neglected. Ethics exists to get Tech in. False Attests on Fast Flow get immediate cancellation of certificate and a Condition of Doubt. A Provisional Certificate expires one year from date of graduation if not validated. Persons whose provisional certs have expired are required to take an Interneship for their past Class levels, at which time if Interneship is successfully passed, a Permanent Cert is awarded. CLASS VII Class VII is a vital level for training Sea Org Auditors. Orgs should have at least 2 Class VIIs on 5 year contract to deliver Power to contracted staff. Class VII is not prerequisite for Class VIII. The Class VII Course is not now available for public, but may be delivered to Org Auditors on a valid and proven 5 year contract, and to Sea Org Auditors only. IMPORTANCE The importance of top notch, 100% Standard Training on Academy and higher level Tech and Admin training courses cannot be stressed enough. The foundation of this is strong, Standard Study Tech. Auditors and C/Ses and Supervisors and Executives who have not got-ten in firm Study Tech basics have been seen to fail time and again and to themselves be sources of out-tech, declining delivery and declining income. Full Study Tech is hereby going back in with a crash. Staff only are allowed to do BSM as a hatting prerequisite and that is only a study boost, not a full grounding in Study Tech. BSM may, of course, be sold separately, but does not fulfill any study requirements except for staff hatting or public mini courses."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINEUP 4 BPL 18.10.76 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 378 MCSC The full technology of Dianetics and Scientology is there to be duplicated and applied.

Careful investigation has found that when supervisors fail they fail because of igno-rance of Scn Study Tech and failure to use it. In course supervision it is Out Tech to fail to know and use study tech. If an auditor were to say, \"I have to know all about minds but I don't have to know anything about TRs, meters or processes,\" you would think he was as crazy as a psychiatrist! He would become so involved with the figure-figure of the patient he would not know how to handle him. A super who does not know or use study tech as a tech and does not heavily apply it to get the student through is an out tech super. The real Why of any failed or blowing students or students who cannot or do not ap-ply the data is Why: The Course Supervisor does not know or use Study Tech but thinks he has to know the Subject taught so he can teach it. Example: A course super standing staring at his class. One half his students not using demo kits, one student listening to a tape and reading an HCOB at the same time but doping"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE HIGH CRIME 2 HCO PL 16.5.72 V MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 380 MCSC off, one third of the students boiling off.

If a housewife said, \"I can't run my house because I have never taken a course on how to run my husband's business,\" you'd think she was crazy. A course super who does not respect, know and use study tech on his students is guilty of practicing Out Tech. If an auditor did not know how to start and stop a session, how to read a meter, his TRs, his processes or handle a session he would have nothing but failed preclears. In the same frame of reference, a course super who does not know how to start and stop a student, clear words, enforce demos and does not get study tech applied con-tinually will have failed students. A course super's primary tech is study tech and its application to a student. If he can keep that student on the rails and F/Ning and rapidly covering his materials he is doing the whole job of supervising. It is therefore a High Crime for a person to supervise a course who does not know, apply and continually use his study tech on every individual student. It is also a High Crime for a director of training or a tech Sec or an Est O to have anyone supervising without full use of Study Tech. Just as it's a High Crime to continue to use HGC auditors who smash up pcs through non-use of auditing tech, it is a High Crime to continue to use course supervisors who do not know that study tech exists, that it is a tech and that it is the \"tools of his trade\" and who does not use it and thus smashes up students. The society knows nothing about study tech. It thinks a teacher \"teaches the subject and must know the subject!\" Thus it alter-ises the subject, almost never makes a competent person and routine school teaching is looked upon by industry as a huge failure. All manner of unusual solutions are in progress in every country to remedy this inability of students to learn. We must not continue to inherit the idiocy that a teacher only has to know the subject and know nothing about study tech. It is study tech that gets the student of any subject through. The thing that breaks the super down is ignorance of just one point: A student with a misunderstood word will pour out a torrent of queries about the subject! The super is a complete ignorant fool if he answers one of these questions. The su-per's knowledge of the subject is not what is needed! If the super knew and practiced misun-derstood word tech he'd know that student has misunderstood words and he would find and"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE HIGH CRIME 3 HCO PL 16.5.72 V MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 381 MCSC handle. He would not answer or even try to answer those queries. It would do no good if he did. This query-happy student has passed by a Mis-U word! Such a student can get misemotional. He is upset. He thinks data is being denied him. He wants to blow. What kind of a super is it that doesn't grab a meter and find the word? An SP? Or What? Just like an \"auditor\" is not an auditor who lets pcs blow without handling so is a su-per no super at all who cannot handle a student with study tech. So let's knock off the wog world inheritance and get on the ball and realize study tech is the tech a super knows and uses. Just because a super was himself mistaught by old Mrs. Zilch in the third gradeâ€”who knew arithmetic but not how to teach a subject â€“ is no reason he has to go on laying an egg in a Scientology classroom. A course super is a technician, a specialist in study tech. And just to help it out, it is a high crime to fail to use study tech in a classroom. Any time a student blows or later fails to be able to apply his data, the super who taught him will be Comm Eved for Out Tech. We must have no blows and no failures. The product of a super is a graduate from his course who knows and can successfully apply the subject that was taught. This is his true stat. Points measure only quantity. The record of the individual student measures quality. The exchange value of the student after a course (not his fee) measures viability. It may be a crazy planet. Course supers don't have to teach crazy courses where study tech is not used. What Is A Course is answered by one where the elements of the original HCO PL 16 Mar 71 are in use and: Where study tech is in full and continual application to every student in that course! L.

The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When the product vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet. L.

This started me looking. For there is no such line. I wondered if it was a \"missed withhold of nothing\". There can be one of these, you know. There is nothing there, yet the auditor tries to get it and the pc ARC breaks. This is \"cleaning a clean\" with an E-Meter. One pc I cleaned up very nicely had been harassed for years about \"an incident that happened when she was five\". A lot of people had tried to \"get it\". The pc was in a pitiful condition. I found there was nothing there. No incident at all! The meter read came from the charge on previous auditing. I think probably she must have sneezed or her finger slipped on the cans when first asked about \"an incident when you were five\". An auditor who \"sees a read\" when there is no charge makes a \"missed withhold of nothing\". This is the other side of the ARC break â€“ the gone something, the non-existence of something. No food. No money. These things ARC break people. So it is with a \"missed withhold of nothing\". Take Johannesburg. Some years ago the field there was upset by three rabble rousers who alleged all manner of wild things about the Scientology org there. They held wild field meetings and all that. Truth was these three people had done a vicious thing and screamed to high heaven when I sought to query them. They made a \"missed withhold of nothing\" in the field in that area! There was exactly nothing wrong with Scientology there or us. There was something wrong with those three people. They had been stealing from the org. The field kept looking for what was wrong with the org or us. Nothing was. So it couldn't be cleaned up because there was nothing to clean. There were three thieves who had run off with org property and defied orders to give it back. How this made something wrong with us is quite a puzzle. They are still \"cleaning up this ARC Break\" in Johannesburg! For it is not cleanable, not being there to be cleaned! Unless you realize there was nothing there at all! It's a missed withhold of nothing.

They are easily defeated because their statements are so crazy even their own legal systems can't help but see it. So it's easily won. The only person who goes mad on a missed withhold of nothing is the person who thinks there is something there that isn't. So it is with the \"hidden data line\" students sometimes feel must exist on courses. There is no line. But in this case there is an apparency of a line. When instructors or seniors give out alter-ised technology or unusual solutions, the student feels they must have some inside track, some data line the student doesn't have. The student looks for it and starts alter-ising in his turn pretending to have it when they become instructors. It's a missed withhold of nothing. The whole of technology is released in HCO Bulletins and HCO Policy Letters and tapes I do and release. I don't tell people anything in some private way, not even instructors. For instance, all the instructors I taught to handle R6 we taught by my lecturing or writing bulletins for them. Every one of these tapes is used to teach GPM data and handling to students on the Saint Hill Course. Any new data I have given on it has been given to all these people. The instructor then knows only to the degree he has studied and used the very same HCOBs and HCO Pol Ltrs and tapes the student is now using. There is no \"hidden data line\". To believe there is makes an ARC Break. The apparency is somebody's pretence to know from me more than is on the tapes and in books and mimeos, or, brutally, somebody's alter-is of materials. This looks like a \"hidden data line\". It surely isn't. All the lower level materials are in the HCOBs, Pol Ltrs or on tapes. All the GPM materials released are here waiting for the student when he reaches that level. One could say there was one if one was way off the main data line. But it sure isn't hidden. It's on courses and in orgs. I laughed one time at the top flight US Government White House entrusted psycholo-gist. He looked over some startling IQ changes, said such a thing would revolutionize psy-chology overnight if known and added \"no wonder you keep your technology secret!\" That is very funny when you look at how hard you and I work to make it known to all!

But even my closest staff and communicators when it hears of a new process or plan from me verbally, sees it in an HCOB or HCO Pol Ltr a few days later. Don't for heaven's sake mistake alter-is by somebody as evidence of a hidden line. In Scientology we say \"If it isn't written it isn't true\". That applies to orders. Some-body says \"Ron said to . . .\" and on a veteran staff you hear the rejoinder \"Let's see it\". I've had raw meat walk into an org and say \"Ron said I was to have 25 hours of auditing\". And in the raw meat days of orgs, they sometimes were given it. So we have learned the hard way â€“ \"If it isn't written it wasn't said\". And that applies to anybody's orders, not just mine. And on tech and policy, it's equally true. If it isn't in an HCOB or an HCO Pol Ltr or recorded on a tape in my voice, it isn't tech or policy. Next time you hear a pretended order or a squirrel process attributed to me, say \"If it isn't written or recorded it isn't true\". And watch how tech results soar then in that area. LRH:ml.rd L.

Remimeo All Hats BPI SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY For some years we have had a word \"squirreling\". It means altering Scientology, off-beat practices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why. Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or a perfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system. In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workable system. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another. Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of Scientology. Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact mark-ings in the tunnels. It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out. It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also a clear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth. Therefore it is a workable system, a route that can be traveled. What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy guide. What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure the su-pervisor knew worked. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor. What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You'd think he was a pretty heartless guide. You'd expect him to say at least, \"Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn't go that way.\" All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his pre-clear eventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition? People have following the route mixed up with \"the right to have their own ideas.\" Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions â€“ so long as these do not bar the route out for self and others."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY 2 HCO PL 14.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 394 MCSC Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth. If there were no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in the sticky dark, alone. Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess. So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. He isn't following the route. Scientology is a new thing â€“ it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all the sales-manship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routes are being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery. Scientology is the only workable system Man has. It has already taken people toward higher IQ, better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor. Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now the route only needs to be walked. So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don't let them off of it no matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them. And move them on up and out. Squirreling is today destructive of a workable system. Don't let your party down. By whatever means, keep them on the route. And they'll be free.

It has been found that any time a supervisor broke one of the rules, to any degree, the course and training activities failed to function properly. Teaching Scientology is a very precise job, and a supervisor must maintain the preci-sion at all times to render the services he should to the students entrusted to his care. A supervisor cannot hope to gain the respect or willingness of the student to be taught by him sitting there, spouting words and being an \"authority\" on the subject. He must know his subject and follow the supervisor's code to the letter. It isn't a hard code to follow, and it is a very practical one. If you feel you cannot honestly follow all of it, you should receive more training, and, maybe, more processing until you can make the code your own before attempt-ing to train students in Scientology. We have had the rules of the game of Scientology a long time, and now we have the rules of the game called training. Have fun! 1. The supervisor must never neglect an opportunity to direct a student to the actual source of Scientology data. 2. The supervisor should invalidate a student's mistake ruthlessly and use good ARC while doing it. 3. The supervisor should remain in good ARC with his students at all times while they are performing training activities. 4. The supervisor at all times must have a high tolerance of stupidity in his students, and must be willing to repeat any datum not understood as many times as necessary for the student to understand and acquire reality on the datum. 5.

We lost a key basic process! Two Way Comm is missing in today's line-up in Academies, on courses and in HGCs. It goes this way â€“ to get volume auditing going, you need auditors. To make auditors you need fast training. The reason fast training isn't occurring is because two way comm seems to be out between course supervisors and students. Course supervisors in most instances are not asking students if anything is wrong or how to help them and then letting the students talk. While the supervisor listens. I am putting together new practical for course supervisors. But meanwhile it's very elementary. 1. Detect a student's concern. 2. Get the student to talk about his problems and troubles in study. 3. Listen. 4. Do what one can to help without evaluating. 5. Let the student get back to it. Students who drift off of courses or who are very slow lack somebody to talk to! Where a student's progress is slow or he or she appears to be troubled or struggling, a good supervisor notices it early. He gets the student to talk about it. He listens and acknowl-edges. He does what he can to help without evaluating and lets the student get back to study-ing. This action went out when supervisors were found to be lecturing and evaluating all data which data, entered on the course, upset the high workability of tech as it is found in HCOBs and on tapes.

This was in the early days of the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Two way comm with students tended to vanish also. Giving a student off-line data and letting the student discuss his troubles are two dif-ferent things. QUAL In Qual there should also be a consultant service which uses a meter and two way comm to find out about cases before patch-up or review. The Qual Consultant should also handle students who are slow or dropped out. This letting the pc tell his side of it is very valuable. One can handle them much better. Analyzing what they say and how they say it helps the case supervisor also. I.e., Natter = ARC Breaks and overts. The pc's comm has been chopped. An old old session evaluated for him. etc. etc. etc. GET IT IN Two way comm should be gotten in on all courses fast. It will speed training and add up eventually to volume auditing by making trained auditors available. This is the way to unlock that flow. In the HGC pcs can be two way commed by the Tech Sec. In Qual someone can two way comm those sent to Review to help the person and get more accurate data for C/Sing. THE PROCESS Two way comm is not a rote process. That's why it is hard to teach. The trick is to get the person to talk, to keep him looking and talking until he has a cog and very good indica-tors â€“ and sometimes an F/N at the end (not vital). If you can listen you have it progressing. If you can get a person to talk about his troubles and listen and ack, you really can run it. This is your primary block on volume auditing. No two way comm in training! I hope it helps. L.

Two way comm is actually a process. It is not just talking to someone. There is a two way comm checksheet. It can be done with or without a meter. When there is nothing wrong and the student is going along well, the course supervi-sor does not act to correct. The comparable action in auditing would be: when the pc is doing all right you let him carry on with regular auditing; when he isn't doing all right you take a corrective action such as a review. It is a serious error in auditing to correct a pc who needs no correction. In course supervision it is a serious error to correct a student who is doing all right. For example, one sees a student busily checking out another and they are both doing fine. To interrupt or correct these two students would be a supervision error. Reversely, to see a student frowning or a coaching session bugged and NOT get in and straighten it out would be a supervisor error.

Bill Foster 14 June 71) Two way comm where it has been described has been described for the use of an audi-tor, not a supervisor of a course. Supervisors not knowing this then run around itsa-ing students. They let the students itsa and they think they are going to get some place. It's the most incredible scene that you ever heard of and the boom could go bust only on this one point. I've got it narrowed down to this. Apparently no matter how many times the study tapes have been played, nobody has ever heard of them. I watched a recent course run to find out how deep they would let the students strug-gle â€“ how long it would stay bogged â€“ and it would have stayed bogged from here on out! And do you know what's out? It's the study data tapes just that â€“ and that's all that's out on a course. So when they say \"two way comm the students\" you'll find the supervisors instantly start to itsa them and are using auditor two way comm on these courses. It doesn't belong on these courses. I'll give you now the total dialogue of a supervisor: The supervisor shows interest. There can be a little bit of chatter, like â€“ \"I see you've just completed. Great!\" â€“ something like that, or he shows interest â€“ \"How are you doing?\" Student replies â€“ \"Ah well, I'm doing all right.\""},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR 2WC AND THE 2 HCOB 26.06.71R MISUNDERSTOOD WORD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 404 MCSC Supervisor â€“ \"Now are there any words there in that, that you have misunderstood?\" Student â€“ \"No ... no ....\" Supervisor â€“ \"Well what is the word that you didn't quite understand?\" Student â€“ \"Ah well . . . ah . . . this one.\" Supervisor â€“ \"Good. Now look that word up.... Now what's the word in the paragraph above that, where's that? . . . Alright let's look that up. Now use it in a sentence a couple of times and I'll be back in a minute.\" He comes back, the student gives him the sentences for it and straightens it out and he sees the student's got it. That's the two way comm of a supervisor. If a Supervisor does any other thing you've got a wrecked course. I've got the proof of it. The way you teach a TR course is you give the student the bulletin and you have him read it. You don't check the guy out on the bulletin, he just reads it. When you come back you say, \"Alright, have you read it?\" \"Yeah. I've read it.\" \"What word don't you understand on it?\" You will find things like HCOB and TR, and you get those cleared up, etc. I am having some roaring success stories from FEBC students who are through this. One had gone through the bulletin 10 times and had found words he didn't know all 10 times, and he was all of a sudden finding new things on the bulletin that he'd never heard of before. Another student had gone through it 20 times with the same result and they were doing fine and getting down to TRs and passing them. On a TR course you give them the bulletin and let them read it and you find what word they didn't understand. That's the routine. Now that sounds so impossible â€“ and it's been on the study tapes for so long â€“ that you wouldn't believe that this thing is the key. Do you know there were students there for 15 or 20 days until we started doing this, then all of a sudden there was a breakthrough and their enthusiasm started coming up. They had been just going lose, lose, lose, out the bottom because supervisors were let-ting them itsa. Maybe supervisors thought they were auditors. They aren't. Neither are they supposed to give advice or tell students how â€“ or ask them if they blinked or anything else."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR 2WC AND THE 3 HCOB 26.06.71R MISUNDERSTOOD WORD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 405 MCSC The other thing they were doing was only emphasizing all the \"can'ts\". The students just went into despair. This was because the supervisors were inviting all kinds of itsa and criticizing and so forth. You may say, \"Gee! Everybody knows it's a misunderstood word.\" Yeh â€“ but they don't use it. Now I'll give you another one. I set up a test so that each student was brought up to the D of T who had a meter on his desk and he'd ask them if they had anything they misunderstood â€“ and see if they got a read on the meter. If it didn't clear up at once he'd send them back to get the definitions and look the thing up and of course use the word in a couple of sentences and then if it didn't clear up he'd send them to the word clearer and really let them get worked over because it goes way back. They even found a student who had a misunderstood word clear back into his last life. There wasn't any other two way comm and no other interest and they just about blew the roof off with student stat points. This is the action of a supervisor and that's ALL the action a supervisor does â€“ and he can do that. The course has plenty of dictionaries and so on. But, the main point is, it is the misunderstood word. This has been proven again. On a TR practical course it's the misunderstood word and the misunderstood action. On other courses it's just misunderstood words and misunderstood words and misun-derstood words, one right after the other. As fast as they clear this up â€“ up the student's production goes. It's painfully slow on some of them at first and I suppose the supervisors have so many misunderstood words of their own that they just won't key into doing this action and that's what's wrecking courses. It's elementary, and it's the wildest discovery of all time but they don't use it. If it is used, your courses start running fast, your students start learning quickly and all starts going well. Other course outnesses like supervisors not giving anybody a pack or no one to give checkouts are all administrative outnesses. As far as actual supervision is concerned it's this other line of handling misunderstood words. The second that line is in there are wins all over the place.

We are shooting for a target, using just this misunderstood word tech, of a reduction of time by about a third on all major courses. Just using this misunderstood word tech. That's all. If some student is a totally slow student, you can get him back to the first bulletin or book he ever read and make him get every word in it he didn't understand, and it will go up in a chain.

The coach has a copy of the book \"Alice in Wonderland\" and from it he reads a phrase and gradually increases to a sentence or two. The student listens carefully and when the coach has finished reading he acknowledges. (The ac-knowledgment used may be Good, Fine, All right, Thank you or OK.) This cycle is repeated and periodically the coach should ask \"What did I say?\". The student should be able to repeat back what the coach has read. If he cannot he is flunked and the coach gives it to him again. When the coach is satisfied that the student is capable of listening well, he should then start talking to the student for 2 to 3 minutes on imagined study or post difficulties. The student is flunked for doing anything other than listening or acknowledging when the coach has finished talking. The student should know that when the coach is very cheerful and no longer has an imagined problem he should say \"That is all!\" and that would be the end of that subject being handled. The coach should then present a new imagined difficulty and that cycle completed. The student is also flunked for nervousness, embarrassment, shifting in the chair, for doing anything distracting to the coach that would take his attention off what he was saying, plus not knowing and saying \"That is all\"â€”when the coach has become cheerful or saying \"That is all\" before the coach having brightened up has finished what he wants to say. The coach when he flunks the student should say, e.g. \"Flunk!\", \"You coughed!\", \"Start!\". This pattern is used as needed. The student is passed on this drill when he can sit quietly and listen. To end the period the coach says \"That's it!\". History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1960's to help students to be able to lis-ten.

Purpose: To train the student Hubbard consultant to do two way communication. To ask, listen and acknowledge. Position: The coach and student Hubbard consultant sit facing each other a comfortable dis-tance apart. Commands: Tell me about the difficulty you are having with apples. Training Stress: The training stress is ask, listen and acknowledge. The coach answers the student's question with an imagined answer. The student listens and acknowledges when the coach has finished speaking. If the coach is not completely cheerful the student asks another question which must be about the imagined difficulty. E.g. \"When did it start?\" or \"When were you doing well?\" The student is flunked for asking a question about the answer and so going off onto another track and for talking too much. The idea is to get the student to ask, listen and acknowledge, and to get a reality that really listening will handle the difficulty or help discover the source of the disagreement. The student is also flunked for talking about himself, giving data, expressing an opinion, stopping the coach from talking, for uncertainty, for not listening or for poor acknowledg-ments. The coach manifests various phenomena of upset or those concerned with study, i.e. frown-ing, getting sleepy, staring into space, wanting to leave the class, etc. If the difficulty being handled is one as per listening drill the cycle is handled as per that drill. If the difficulty is found to be a misunderstood word or term, the HC student refers the coach to the exact materials which will handle the misunderstanding and ensures this is clarified and that the coach is very cheerful and happy about it all before this cycle is complete. These cycles should be repeated over and over and the drill is passed when the student can use two way comm in training. History: Developed by L.

I.e. the room is as comfortable as possible and is free from interruptions and distractions, the meter is well charged, set up and that the consultant report forms and worksheets are ready and that he has a sufficient supply of pens and a good dictionary. The personnel receiving the consultant is seated in the chair furthest from the door and is asked to pick up the cans (from now on until the consultation ends the personnel remains on the cans). The HC ensures the personnel is not wearing any rings, that he has eaten well, had sufficient sleep and rest, has had no alcohol for 24 hours prior to the session and has had no drugs and has taken no aspirin or painkillers for at least a week. When this is all checked and ascertained to be OK, the HC says, \"This is the consultation\", and then gently informs the personnel what he is going to do and ensures that the personnel understands this. If the needle is quite clean and loose or if floating (may not be the latter if the person has had little or no auditing) and the personnel is quite cheerful, the HC goes directly into doing the actions intended for the consultationâ€”i.e. any of the HC stress analyses or the out-point-plus-point assessment and two-way comm, which ever is scheduled for the consultation. If the needle is fairly clean but the person is somewhat upset, the HC should find out and clean up what is troubling the personnel by two-way comm as per stress analysis No. 1 until the personnel is feeling bright and cheerful and the needle is floating. He should indicate thisâ€”i.e. that the needle floated and then proceed with the action intended for the consulta-tion. If at the beginning of the consultation the needle is found to be very dirty or there is an ARC break float and the personnel is quite upset, the consultant should gently say that he is going to conclude the consultation at this point and say \"That is all\". The personnel should then be routed to the Qualifications Division of a Scientology organization to visit the exam-iner and to arrange for some auditing to be C/Sed for him. If at any time during a consultation, the needle becomes dirty or there is an ARC break float and the personnel is upset the same action should be doneâ€”i.e. conclude the consulta-tion at this point and send the personnel to the examiner, this is if the consultant has not been able to clean the upset by two way comm."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"MODEL CONSULTATION FOR HC 2 BTB 6.9.70 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 412 MCSC When the major action intended for the consultation is complete and the person is very cheerful, has finished what he wants to say, realizes what has been bothering him and has a floating needle, the HC says \"That is all\" and ends the period. Points to be noted: 1. The Hubbard consultant should never run any subject which does not read well on the meter as it will not readily discharge, but should locate something else which reads well and run that instead. 2. If at any time the personnel comments that he is exterior or that he can see his body or the room from a different viewpoint other than from where he is sitting, the HC should gently end the session by saying \"That is all\" and route the personnel to the examiner to ensure that an exteriorization/interiorization intensive is run as no further consulta-tions should be done until this is complete otherwise the tone arm will go very high and no further progress will be made. 3. If at any time the HC is unable to make progress with the personnel and the TA goes high, he should also gently end the session with \"That is all\" and route the personnel to the examiner in the Qualifications Division of a Scientology Organization for the trouble to be resolved with processing.

A student who is having trouble is placed across a table from the Hubbard consultant. The student is given the leads to hold one in each hand and the meter balanced. The Hubbard consultant makes a consultant report. This is a form or plain sheet with the student's name at the top, the date and the course name, or a description of the material being handled. The time and the meter reading is placed routinely at appropriate intervals on the left edge of the sheet. The questions asked by the Hubbard consultant are written down with the student's an-swers in brief. The Hubbard consultant is trained to ask what he is supposed to and to listen to and acknowledge what the student says.

The Hubbard consultant has control of the tape player start-stop. As the tape plays the Hubbard consultant watches his meter needle. As soon as it reads (falls) the Hubbard consultant stops the machine and asks what word or term that was. If the student can't tell him the tape section is replayed from an even earlier point. A needle read is watched for and the machine stopped. The Hubbard consultant asks for the word or term the student has just heard. The stu-dent gives it. The Hubbard consultant has the student look up the word: (a) If a non-technical word in the student's language it is looked up in a good diction-ary of that language which must be available. (b) If it is a technical word or term in the subject, it is looked up in the glossary. (c) If in the glossary the student reads the term aloud and the Hubbard consultant watches the needle.

If not, they are taken off study and given manual or clerical work to do for the remainder of that day. If the student has had enough sleep, he is given the appropriate Hubbard consultant stress analysis action as above. ____________________ Students given Hubbard consultant stress analysis should be cheerful and relieved at the end. ____________________ If E-Meters are not available for stress analysis a Hubbard consultant can be trained to do the four actions above by watching the facial characteristic change of the student. This is more difficult than in using an E-Meter. ____________________ The meter readings when the matter is cleared up should be between 2(F) and 3(M) on the 1 to 6 dial and the needle should be \"floating\". On the l to 6 dial the position 2 measures 5,000 ohms across the leads with the needle at set. The position 3 measures 12,500 ohms. A floating needle is the idle uninfluenced movement of the needle on the dial without any patterns or reactions in it. It moves to the right at the same speed as it moves to the left. It is loose and free. When the student has resolved the matter, is more cheerful about it and the floating needle is observed, the matter is not taken any further. This indication to stop must be ob-served so that the consultant action is not overdone. Overdoing this action could cause further difficulty. If the needle is agitated with small jerky movements the student is upset and is not be-ing frank with the Hubbard consultant or has been provoked by the Hubbard consultant.

It is useful to management in locating points of stress after physical tests on equipment (as in test pilots or machine operators) so that faults of design where the machine is not well adjusted to man can be accurately remedied. It also works on physical stresses resulting from the tension of concentrating particularly when the student or trainee is unable to grasp materials or handle a subject or equipment. By the use of the E-Meter a Hubbard consultant can isolate the exact point of a man's difficulty with a subject or equipment and clear this up. Or the exact point can be found where equipment is not well adapted to man. Its use in study can pin-point the exact thing that has halted the flow of comprehen-sion. Thus it can be cleared up. L.

A person who has to be retreaded on Academy and SHSBC to receive a class VIII course is of course a false attest. Further the full expense of the course would be at the cost of the Academy or the SH that gave it. Normally speaking a retread requirement would be too unwieldy if the student were sent back to an Academy or an SHSBC. A more practical solution would be to form a retread course from the HGC auditor checksheet and give it and send the offending org that gave the course a bill for it. Teach it to the student. Then put the student on the class VIII course. The class VIII course has been slowed by: (a) Attempting to use it as a free retread IV and VI course instead of just teaching class VIII. (b) Adding what will be class IX to the 1968 HCOBs thus tangling up the course design and extending its checksheet to triple length. (c) Incompetent or unalert supervision. The class VIII course is 3 weeks long. Period. Counter policy has been for the supervisor to set the course length, to add to the course, to give away free retread and to give away the 1969â€”mid-70 materials training.

The group will be sane to the degree that these points are in. Internal stresses of magnitude begin to affect every member of the group in greater or lesser degree when one or more of these items are neglected or badly handled. The society at large currently has the majority of these points out. These elements be-come aberrated in the following ways:"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 2 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 420 MCSC 1. Hiring The society is running a massive can't have on the subject of people. Automation and employment penalties demonstrate an effort to block out letting people in and giving them jobs. Confirming this is growing unemployment and fantastic sums for welfare â€“ meaning relief. Fifty percent of America within the decade will be jobless due to the population explo-sion without a commensurate expansion in production. Yet production by US presidential decree is being cut back. War, birth control are two of many methods used to reduce popula-tion. This third dynamic psychosis is a refusal to employ people. Exclusion of others is the basic cause of war and insanity. 2. Training Education has fallen under the control of one-worlders, is less and less real. Data taught is being taught less well. Less data is being taught. School and college unrest reflect this. Confirmation is the deteriorated basic education found in teenagers such as writing. Older technologies are being lost in modern rewrites. This third dynamic psychosis is a cov-ert refusal to train. 3. Apprenticeships The most successful industries, activities and professions of earlier centuries were at-tained by training the person as an apprentice permitting him to understudy the exact job he would hold for a long period before taking the post. Some European schools are seeking to revive this but on a general basis, not as an apprentice system. A third dynamic psychosis is a denial of adequate experience to succeed. 4. Utilization In industries, governments and armed services as well as life itself, personnel are not utilized. A man trained for one thing is required to do something else. Or his training is not used. Or he is not used at all. A third dynamic psychosis is failure to utilize people. 5. Production Modern think is to reward downstats. A person is paid for not working. Governments who produce nothing employ the most people. Income tax and other current practices penalize production. Countries which produce little are given huge handouts. War which destroys at-tains the largest appropriations. A third dynamic psychosis is to prevent production."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 3 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 421 MCSC 6. Promotion Promotion activities are subverted to unworthy activities. True value is seldom pro-moted. What one is actually achieving gets small mention while other things are heavily pro-moted. Reality and PR are strangers. A third dynamic psychosis is unreal or non factual promotion. 7. Sales Sales actions are unreal or out of balance. Clumsy or non-functioning sales activities penalize producers and consumers. In areas of high demand sales actions are negligible even when heavy advertising exists. This is proven by the inability to sell what is produced even in large countries so that production cut backs are continual threats to economies and workers. A population goes half fed in times of surplus goods. With curtailed car factories a nation drives old cars. With a cutback construction industry people live in bad houses. Sales taxes are al-most universal. A third dynamic psychosis is the impeding of product distribution to poten-tial consumers. 8. Delivery Failure to deliver what is offered is standard procedure for groups in the humanities. Commercially it is well in hand. 9. Finance One's own experience in finance is adequate to demonstrate the difficulties made with money. A third dynamic psychosis is the perversion of finance. 10. Justice Under the name of justice, aberrated man accomplishes fantastic injustices. The upstat is hit, the downstat let go. Rumours are accepted as evidence. Police forces and power are used to ENFORCE the injustices contained 1 to 9 above. Suppressive justice is used as an ineffectual but savage means of meeting situations actually caused by the earlier listed psy-choses. When abuses on 1 to 9 make things go wrong, the social aberration then introduces suppressive injustices as an effort to cure. Revolt and war are magnified versions of injus-tices. Excess people â€“ kill them off in a war. A third dynamic psychosis is the substitute of violence for reason."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 4 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 422 MCSC 11. Morale A continuous assault on public morale occurs in the press and other media. Happiness or any satisfaction with life is under continuous attack. Beliefs, idealism, purpose, dreams are assaulted. Insanity is a refusal to allow others to be, do or have. Any action which would lead to a higher morale has to be defended against the insane few. A third dynamic psychosis is a detestation of high morale. ____________________ The common denominator of all these insanities is the desire to succumb. Insanities have as their end product self or group destruction. These eleven types of aberration gone mad are the main points through which any group succumbs. Therefore, these eleven points kept sane guarantee a group's survival. EXAMPLES Seeing all this in one example permits one to see that these third dynamic insanities combine to destroy. A. Believing it impossible to obtain money or make it, a firm cannot hire enough people to produce. So has little sell, which is badly promoted and is not sold so it has no money to hire people. B. Needing people for another job the firm robs them from a plant which then collapses and fails to make money so no new people can be hired. This reduces production so people have to be dismissed as they can't be paid. C. Persons are in the firm but are kept doing the wrong things so there is little production and no promotion or sales so there is no money to pay them so they are dismissed. D. A new product is put in. People to make it are taken from the area already making a valuable product which then collapses that area and there is not enough money to promote and selling fails so people are dismissed. The examples are many. They are these same eleven group insanities in play upon a group, a firm, a society. SANITY If this is a description of group aberration, then it gives the keys to sanity in a group."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 5 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 423 MCSC 1. HIRING Letting people into the group at large is the key to every great movement and bettered culture on this planet. This was the new idea that made Buddhism the strongest civilizing in-fluence the world has seen in terms of numbers and terrain. They did not exclude. Race, color, creed were not made bars to membership in this great movement. Politically the strongest country in the world was the United States, and it was weak-ened only by its efforts to exclude certain races or make them second class citizens. Its great-est internal war (1862-65) was fought to settle this point, and the weakness was not resolved even then. The Catholic Church only began to fail when it began to exclude. Thus inclusion is a major point in all great organizations. The things which set a group or organization on a course of exclusion are (a) the de-structive impulses of about 10 or 15% of the society (lunacy) and (b) opposition by interests which consider themselves threatened by the group or organization's potential resulting in infiltration (c) efforts to mimic the group's technology destructively and set up rival groups. All these three things build up barriers that a group might thoughtlessly buy and act to remedy with no long range plans to handle. These stresses make a group edgy and combative. The organization then seeks to solve these three points by exclusion, whereas its growth depends wholly upon inclusion. No one has ever solved these points successfully in the past because of lack of tech-nology to solve them. It all hinges on three points: (1) the sanity of the individual, (2) the worthwhileness of the group in terms of general area, planetary or universal survival, and (3) the superiority of the group's organization tech and its use. Just at this writing, the first point is solved conclusively in Scientology. Even hostile and destructive personalities wandering into the group can be solved and, due to the basic nature of Man, made better for the benefit of themselves and others. The worthwhileness of the organization is determined by the assistance given to gen-eral survival by the group's products and the actual factual delivery of those valid products. The superiority of a group's admin tech and its application is at this current writing well covered in current developments. Thus inclusion is almost fully attainable. The only ridges that build up are the short term defense actions. For instance, Scientology currently must fight back at the death camp organizations of psychiatry whose solution is a dead world, as proven by their actions in Germany before and during World War II. But we must keep in mind that we fully intend to reform and salvage even these opponents. We are seeking to include them in the general survival by forcing them to cease their non-survival practices and overcome their gruesome group past."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 6 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 424 MCSC There are two major stages then of including people â€“ one is as paid organization per-sonnel and one as unpaid personnel. Both are in essence being \"hired\". The pay differs. The wider majority receive the pay of personal peace and effectiveness and a better world. The org which excludes its own field members will fail. The payment to the org of money or the money payment to the staff member is an in-ternal economy. Pay, the real pay, is a better personal survival and a world that can live. Plans of INclusion are successful. They sometimes contain defense until we can in-clude. Even resistance to an org can be interpreted as a future inclusion by the org. Resis-tance or opposition is a common waypoint in the cycle of inclusion. In an organization where everyone wins eventually anyway the senselessness of resistance becomes apparent even to the most obtuse. Only those who oppose their own survival resist a survival producing or-ganization. Even in commercial companies the best organization with the best product usually finds competitors merging with it. 2. TRAINING Basic training, hats, checksheets and packs must exist for every member of a group. Criminal or antisocial conduct occurs where there is no hat. Any type of membership or role or post in the whole organization or its field requires individual and team training. Only where you have a group member who will not or cannot bring himself to have and wear a hat will you have any trouble. This is so true that it is the scope of personal enhancement. Ask yourself \"Who isn't trained on his post and hatted?\" and you can answer \"Who is causing the trouble?\" Basic training, slight or great, is vital for every member of a group, paid or unpaid. A field auditor must have a hat. A student needs a student hat, etc. etc. This requires training. Training begins in childhood. Often it has to be re-oriented. Training as a group member must be done. Training in exact technology or in the precise tech of admin is not the first stage of training. Basic training of group members, no matter how slight, must exist and be done. Otherwise group members lack the basic points of agreement which make up the whole broad organization and its publics. Training must be on real materials and must be rapid. The technology of how to train is expressed in speed of training."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 7 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 425 MCSC The idea that it takes twelve years to make a mud pie maker is false. Time in training does not determine quality of training. Amount of data learned that can be applied and skills successfully drilled determine training. That the society currently stresses time is an aberrated factor. The ability to learn and apply the data is the end product of training. Not old age. The rate of training establishes to a marked degree the expansion factor of a group and influences the smoothness of the group during expansion. If training is defined as making a person or team into a part of the group then process-ing is an influencing factor. The facilities for processing and quantity available are then a de-termining factor in group expansion. 3. APPRENTICESHIP Training on post is a second stage of any training â€“ and processing â€“ action. This is es-sentially a familiarization action. To have a person leave a post and another take it over with no \"apprenticeship\" or groove-in can be quite fatal. The deputy system is easily the best system. Every post is deputied for a greater or lesser period before the post is turned over and the appointment is made. When the deputy is totally familiar he becomes the person on the post. Rapid expansion and economy on personnel tend to injure this step. Lack of it can be very destructive. Optimumly there should be one or two deputies for every key post at all times. This is a continual apprenticeship system. Economically it has limitations. One has to weigh the losses in not doing it against the cost in doing it. It will be found that the losses are far greater than the cost, even though it increases personnel by at least a third for a given organization. When an organization has neglected it as a system (and has turned over too many posts without deputy or apprenticeship action) its economics may decay to where it can never be done. This is almost a death rattle for an organization. In a two century old highly successful industry, only the apprentice system was and is used (Oporto wine industry). The quality of the product is all that keeps the product going on the world market. If the quality decayed the industry would collapse. Apprenticeship as a total system maintains it. Certainly every executive in an organization and every technical expert should have a deputy In training. Only then could quality of organization be maintained and quality of prod-uct guaranteed."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 8 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 426 MCSC The total working organization should be on this system actually. And whenever a person is moved up off a post, the deputy taking over, a new deputy should be appointed. The last step (appointment of a new deputy) is the one that gets forgotten. Failure to recruit new people over a period will very surely find the whole organiza-tion declining soon solely because there is no apprentice system of deputies. The organization expands, singles up the posts, promotes some un-apprenticed people and begins to lose its economic advantage. Low pay ensues, people blow off, and then no one can be hired. It's a silly cycle, really, as it is prevented easily enough by hiring enough soon enough when the org is still doing well. The rule is deputy every post and newly deputy them when promotions occur. The most covert way to get around this is just to call each person's junior a deputy even though he has other duties. This makes it all look good on an org board. \"Do you have each post deputied?\" \"Oh yes!\" But the deputies are just juniors with posts of their own. A deputy is used to run the same post as it is deputied for. This means a double post-ing pure and only. You'd be amazed at how much production an executive post can achieve when it is also deputied and when the principal holder of the post will use the deputy and gen him in, not get him to cover an empty lower post. 4. UTILIZATION People must be utilized. Equipment must be utilized. Space must be utilized. Learning to use is a very hard lesson for some. Untrained people, bad organization, poor machinery, inadequate space all tend to send one off utilization. The rule is, if you've got it use it; if you can't use it get rid of it. This most specifically applies to people. If you've got a man, use him; if you can't use him get him over to someone who can use him. If he isn't useful, process and train. Anyone who can't figure out how to use people, equipment and spaces to obtain valu-able final products is not worthy of the name of executive. Reversely we get what an executive or foreman is â€“ an executive or foreman is one who can obtain, train and use people, equipment and spaces to economically achieve valuable final products. Some are very skilled in preparing people, systems, equipment, property and spaces to be used. But if these then go to someone who does not USE them you get a bad breakdown. The welfare state and its inflation is a sad commentary on \"executive ability\"."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 9 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 427 MCSC An executive whose people are idle and whose materiel is decaying is a traitor to his people and the org, just that, for he will destroy them all. Utilization requires a knowledge of what the valuable final products are and how to make them. Action which doesn't result in a final product that adds up to valuable final products is destructive, no matter how innocent it seems. Man has a planet as a valuable final product. Improper use of the countries and seas, air and masses which compose it will wind up with the destruction of Man, all life on it and the usefulness of the planet. So proper utilization of anything is a very real factor. The 19th century industrialist like the mad kings who built great structures used up men; they didn't properly use men. And not using them at all, the current fad, is the most deadly of all. Utilization is a big subject. It applies to resources, capabilities and many other factors. The question being asked in all cases is \"How can we use this to economically obtain a valuable final product?\" Failing to answer that question gives one the \"mysteries of life\". 5. PRODUCTION One may be prone to believe there is no sense in any production at all. Such a one would also be likely to say \"There is no sense at all.\" Or \"If they keep on producing it will become impossible to destroy it all.\" Production of some final valuable product is the chain of all production sequences. Even the artist is producing a reaction. The reaction's service in a wider sphere to en-force it is what gives art its sense. A feeling of well being or grandeur or light heartedness are legitimate valuable final products, for instance. The production areas and activities of an org that produce the valuable final products are the most important areas and activities of the org. 6. PROMOTION The acceptance of valuable final products and of their value depends in a large degree upon (a) a real value and (b) a desire for them. Promotion creates desire for the valuable final product. The old saw that the man who builds a better mousetrap will have the whole world coming to his door is a total falsity."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 10 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 428 MCSC Unless the value is made known, and the desire created, the mousetraps are going to go unsold. Promotion is so important that it can stand alone. It can have limited success even when there is no product! But in that case it will be of short duration. Promotion must contain reality and the final product must exist and be deliverable and delivered for promotion to be fully successful. Public Relations and advertising and all their skills cover this area of promotion. 7. SALES It is hard to sell what isn't promoted and can't be delivered. Economics greatly affect selling. Anything must be sold for a price comparable to its value in the eyes of the purchaser. Costing is a precise art by which the total expenses of the organization administration and production must be adequately covered in the Pricing allowing for all losses and errors in delivery and adequate to produce a reserve. Pricing (the amount being asked) cannot be done without some idea of the total cost of the final valuable product. The sale price of one final valuable product may have to cover the cost of producing other products which are delivered without price. Pricing however does not necessarily limit itself to only covering immediate cost of a product. A painting with a dollar's worth of paint and canvas may have a price of half a mil-lion dollars. Also a painting used in promotion may cost two hundred dollars and be displayed at no cost at all to the beholder. These relative factors also include the Skill of the salesman himself and there is much technology involved in the act of selling something to someone and the world abounds in books on the subject. Therefore sales (once promotion is done) are bound up really in Costing, Pricing and Selling. The value in the eye of the purchaser is monitored by the desire created in him for it. If this is also a real value and if delivery can occur then Selling is made very easy â€“ but it is still a skilled action. The production of a valuable final product is often totally determined by whether or not it can be sold. And if it can be sold at a price greater than the cost of delivering it. That it gets sold depends on the salesman. The skill of the salesman is devoted to enhancing the desire and value in the eyes of the buyer and obtaining adequate payment."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 11 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 429 MCSC 8. DELIVERY The subject and action of Delivery is the most susceptible to breakdown in any or-ganization. Any flaw on the sequence of actions resulting in a valuable final product may de-teriorate it or bar off final delivery. There are many preparatory or hidden from public view steps on a production line. When any of these break down, delivery is imperiled. Given the raw materials and wherewithal to make some valuable final product, the valuable final product should occur. When a valuable final product does not get produced and cannot be delivered re-pair the earlier steps of its production. Example: An auditing result is not delivered. Don't just repair the pc. Repair training of auditors and C/Ses. Repair the assembly line before the valuable final product. The sub-products are less visible. Yet they add up to the valuable final product. The law of the irreducible minimum occurs in all delivery problems. Someone is trying to produce only the visible end product of a post or production line and neglects the earlier contributory actions and products as these are not plainly visible. When an organization or its posts operate only on an irreducible minimum, production goes bad and Delivery crashes. Take a cook who has his post at an irreducible minimum. Food is appearing on the ta-ble. If he reduced just one bit more the food would no longer be edible at all. He neglects pur-chasing, menus and preparation. That these occur is invisible to the diners. That food appears on the table is visible to the diners. If the cook operates at any less level than he is, no edible food would be visible â€“ hence, irreducible minimum. The food served will be bad. But it will be visible. Invisible-to-the-diners actions aren't being done. To improve the food, get the less visible actions done. Get the sequence of actions all done. The result will be improved food. Take training. The final valuable product is a trained auditor. The course supervisor who runs his post on an irreducible minimum is simply there, appearing to supervise. His final product may be horribly unskilled. The teaching may take \"forever\". To improve this one goes earlier on the assembly line â€“ materials, packs, tapes, student tech services, recorder repair, scheduling â€“ dozens of actions including getting the course su-pervisor trained. The visibility is still a course supervisor and students being taught. But with the whole earlier line in, the final valuable product is excellent! A being hopes lazily for instantaneous production. It doesn't happen this way in the MEST universe. Things are produced in a sequence of sub-products which result in a final valuable product. Hope all you want to. When you omit the sub-products you get no valuable final product."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 12 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 430 MCSC When the people in an organization do not know the valuable final products of the org and when a person on a post does not know the final products of his post, a condition arises where no org Delivery will occur, or if it does occur it will be poor or costly. It is vital that a person knows what his post final products are and what his unit, section, department and divi-sion sub-products are and how his own and each of these contribute to the valuable final products of the organization for actual delivery to occur. Delivering other than valuable final products or useless final products or final products that need constant correction also add up to non-delivery. A whole civilization can break down around the point of Delivery. So can an organi-zation. Since money can be looked upon as too valuable a final product it can actually prevent Delivery. Failure to deliver is the one point beings do not forgive. The whole cycle hangs upon Delivery. Deliver what is promised when it is expected in sufficient volume and adequate qual-ity is the first maxim even of a group in politics or the humanities. 9. FINANCE Finance too often disregards the other factors in this scale or the other factors in this scale too often disregard finance for organizations to long remain viable. Financing must be in agreement with all the other factors of this scale and all the other factors must be in agreement with finance for viability to occur. Because money is interchangeable for commodities then people can confuse it with too many things. If you regard money like so many beans, as a commodity in itself, you open the door to understanding it. Money is so many beans in to get so many beans out. When you can master this you can handle Finance. The Finance persons of an org, a civilization, a planet should put so many beans in and expect more beans out than they put in. This is quite correct as a viewpoint for finance. The difference of beans in and beans out for a planet is made up by adding beans enough to those already in existence to cover new commodity. When finance people fail to do this beans cease to be in pace with production and in-flation and deflation occur. In an org or any of its parts, industriousness of the staff makes the difference between the beans in and beans out."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 13 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 431 MCSC An org has to have income greater than outgo. That is the first rule of finance. Violat-ing it brings bankruptcy. Now if the Finance people of an org apply the same rule remorselessly to all its trans-actions (financial planning) with each person and part of an org, finance becomes real and manageable. So many beans in to support the first division means so many beans out of the org back to finance because of the cooperative work of the first division. A hectic effort to work only with production products will wind finance up in a knot One has to estimate (cost) the contribution of each part of an org to the valuable final product to know what to allow what part of an org. Finance has to have a full reality on the valuable final products and the sub-products and post products of the whole org to intelligently allocate funds. This person, that division, each contributes some part of the action that results in the money received for the valuable final products. So finance can extend so much money for each and expect that and an additional amount back. If this occurs, so will expansion. Finance comes unstuck when it fails to \"cost\" an organization and fails to support valuable final product production. Finance must not only practice \"Income greater than Outgo\" for the org, it must prac-tice it for each part of the org as well. Then solvency becomes real. The greatest aberration of finance is that it seeks to save things into solvency. The real losses in an org are the sums never made. These are the most important losses for finance to concentrate upon. An org that makes Â£500 a week that should make Â£5000 a week in potential is losing the finance people Â£4500 a week! Finance can force production along certain lines by putting in funds and getting more back. Finance becomes too easily the management of an org but it only does that when it ceases to deal in its own commodity â€“ money. An org which has executives unfamiliar with finance will fall at once into the control of the finance people in the org. And these finance people, if they don't really know money will fall at once under the control of outside finance people. One has to know finance in any organization anywhere, even in a socialism. Sooner or later the books get balanced in any society."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 14 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 432 MCSC 10. JUSTICE Without justice there can be no real organization. Even a government owes its people an operating climate in which human transactions and business can occur. Where insane and criminal individuals operate unchecked in the community justice is uncertain and harsh. The society in which the insane rise to positions of power becomes a nightmare. Justice is a difficult subject. Man handles it badly. Justice cannot occur until insanity can be detected and cured. The whole task of justice is to defend the honest man. Therefore the target of justice is the establishment of a sane society. The inability to detect or cure the insane destroys civilizations. Justice is an effort to bring equity and peace. When one cannot detect and cure insan-ity then sooner or later justice actions will become unjust and be used by the insane. To us, justice is the action necessary to restrain the insane until they are cured. After that it would be only an action of seeing fair play is done. 11. MORALE When all factors balance up in an org and give the group a common direction and mu-tual viability, morale can be expected to be good. When the admin scale and the ten elements described are out of balance (without proper importance given to each) and when one or many of these (admin scale and the ele-ments herein described) are not in agreement one with another, then morale will be poor. Morale is not made of comfort and sloth. It is made of common purpose and obstacles overcome by the group. When the admin scale and these elements are not held together by similar aims, then morale has to be held up artificially. The most ghastly morale I have ever seen was amongst \"the idle rich\". And the highest morale I've ever seen was amongst a furiously dedicated common pur-posed group working under fantastic stresses with very little against almost hopeless odds. I used to observe that morale in a combat unit would never materialize before they had been through hell together. All drama aside, morale is made up of high purpose and mutual confidence. This comes from the admin scale items and these elements of organization being well aligned, one with the next, and honest sane endeavor to achieve a final goal for all."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"HCO PL 14.12.70 15 GROUP SANITY MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 433 MCSC L RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:ms.rd"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":" MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 435 MCSC HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 7 FEBRUARY 1965 Reissued 15 June 1970 Remimeo Sthil Students Assn/Org Sec Hat Case Sup Hat Ds of P Hat Ds of T Hat Staff Member Hat Franchise (issued May 1965) Note.

We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied.

The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 436 MCSC So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 437 MCSC In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable â€“ only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact â€“ the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve â€“ psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 438 MCSC So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell â€“ and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 439 MCSC still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 440 MCSC Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse â€“ never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us â€“ win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive â€“ and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 441 MCSC But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don't muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

As a supervisor, you would want to handle anything that slowed or interfered with such a student's F/N. Using dope-off as the only detection of misunderstoods is supervising at a below F/N level. The F/N went off long before the student reached the point of dope-off, so waiting for dope-off to occur before handling is waiting too long. Let us look at this from the point of view of the tone scale. If you consider that each student who is not at tone 5.0 during study has a misunder-stood word â€“ and if you do something about the misunderstood word â€“ then you can drive up study velocity so that all students are flying along as F/Ning students. (It's not a misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but a misunderstood word.) This always occurs before the subject itself is not understood. In comparison with waiting for dope-off to occur before handling the misunderstoods, this method is like high level auditing where slowed F/Ns are taken as reads â€“ rather than TA rise being the read. An estimation of the tone level of students on one course showed them at about plus or minus 2.5. This would mean many students had a very tight meter needle if we compare them to the F/Ning student who is flying along successfully. This could be remedied."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"STEPS TO SPEED UP PRODUCT FLOW 2 BTB 29.6.71R MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 450 MCSC If you had this problem of a group of students at tone 2.5 it could be approached this way: 1. Set up one or more word clearers in the classroom. 2. Start with the faster study students, but not those at tone 5.0 or above. 3. If TA above 3.5 or below 2.0 send to Qual for a C/S 53RI. 4. Word clearer inspects student stats graphs and locates with simple two way comm what was being studied at the specific period just before the graph leveled or started to go down. If the graph has not done either but just maintained at a low level, the word clearer selects out the earliest materials on the course. 5. Do method 4 on the materials selected on each student, taking each word to F/N. 6. Any student with BIs which do not clear up, or who runs into trouble on method 4 is sent to Qual for WCCL. 7. Push back the action so it's done within the first few days of course for all new stu-dents, once all existing students are handled. 8. Keep in the M4 for all new students within the first few days as a standard action. 9. Do method 4 or use other methods of word clearing on all course students at the first sign of a non-F/Ning student. By eliminating all these slows (misunderstood words), the students' average points will rise and you will get all students flying along as F/Ning students. The above actions can be done on all students who are not at tone 5 or above on courses, whether super literate or on fast flow courses.

The stu-dent simply looks for the word, the word is found, and then cleared using a good dictionary. Method 3 is routinely used by the supervisor. It is done by twins on each other as needed.

This will be very clear to you if you understand that if it is not resolving, the thing the student is apparently having trouble with is not the thing the student is having trou-ble with otherwise it would resolve, wouldn't it? The trouble is earlier. If he knew what he didn't understand he could resolve it himself. So to talk with him about what he thinks he doesn't understand just gets nowhere. Good word clearing is a system of backtracking. You have to look earlier than the point the student become dull or confused and you'll find that there's a word that he doesn't understand somewhere before the trouble started. The student will brighten up the moment he spots the word, even before the word is cleared. And if he doesn't brighten up there will be a misunderstood word even before that one. PROCEDURE The student is not as bright, or feels dull or disinterested, or is doping off, has bogged down or is going slower; or he just can't understand something or disagrees with it and has done all the usual actions such as clearing the words in it, but it still won't resolve. The student is asked to look earlier in the text for the misunderstood word. There is one always. There are no exceptions. It may be that the misunderstood word is two pages or more back but it is always earlier in the text from where the student is now. The words found. The student brightens up. The misunderstood word is looked up in a good dictionary and cleared per HCOB 23 Mar 78RA Word Clearing Series 59RA Clearing Words. The student reads the text that contains the word that was misunderstood. If the stu-dent is not now bright then there is a misunderstood word even earlier in the text that must be found. When the student is bright and cheerful he is told to come forward, restudying the text, to the area of the subject he did not understand. The difficulty he was having should now resolve. If the difficulty does not resolve then there are still one or more misunderstood words earlier which must be found. If the word can't be found with method 3, then it would be permissible to use one or more of the other methods of word clearing to get the word found. ZEROING IN ON THE WORD The formula is to find out where the student wasn't having any trouble and find out where the student is now having trouble and the misunderstood word will be in between. It will be at the tag end of where he wasn't having trouble.

The student can also be spot-checked on the words in the area to help him find the word, if necessary. The student is asked for the definitions of various words in the area and any that the student is uncertain of or doesn't know are looked up. The end result of doing method 3 is the student is now bright and any difficulty he has had is cleared up. Method 3 is tremendously effective when done as described herein. If it were done every time a student hit a bog or slow or every time a student became dull or his study stats dropped your students would gradually get faster and faster and brighter and brighter. Study stats would soar and the Academy would turn out more and more auditors as well as other trained individuals the org could really be proud of.

If no read the question may be varied, e.g. \"Is there any part of the materials you're studying you disagree with?\" or \"Is there any part of what you're studying you feel you could not apply?\" or \"In (material being checked) is there anything you didn't understand?\" Let the student tell you briefly. Do not tell him the data. Verify that his study pack is complete as the data might have been omitted. Also he might never have read the pack at all. If the data was missing do not go on to step 3. See that he gets the complete pack and reads it. Then repeat method 4. If the person just has not read the materials do not go on to 3 but get him to read the materials. Then repeat method 4. 3. Get what it is then ask: \"What word was misunderstood just before that?\" Meter reads, word clearer finds the word, never accepting a confusion but finds the word giving the read (SF, F, LF, BD), gets it looked up in a dictionary and used in sentences until it can be seen from the sentences that the student now understands the word and the word F/Ns. All the tools of study tech and word clearing are at the word clearer's dis-posal to take the word to F/N. The word clearer does not stop at one misunderstood but makes sure all are cleared. 4. Repeat 2 & 3 until the materials are fully cleared up and any and all misunderstoods or confusions handled. 5.

The correct action is a W/C Correction List done on the student and handled. Of course if the above question F/Ns on asking, there would be no misunderstoods on the material being checked, but the person is in cramming, not an F/Ning student or whatever, so there obviously are misunderstood words to be found and handled. Look at HCO PL 16 Feb 72, The Purpose of the Dept of Personnel Enhancement. It says this Dept \"reaches and looks for business all over the org and brings it in\". So someone with stats down â€“ student or post stats, confusion about what to do, overloaded, can't seem to handle it, how do you do this, etc. etc. are all indicators of misunderstood words as the person is saying confusion, confusion.

Example: \"Is there anything in college you didn't understand?\" That of course is just plain ridiculous as a question. \"Have you ever heard anything you didn't understand?\" would be similarly silly. BREAK DOWN THE MATERIALS When doing method 4 you have to break down the materials (put them into small separate units) in order to ask questions. Example: We have papers 1 & 2, both on the same subject. The wrong question for method 4 would be \"Is there anything in papers 1 & 2 you didn't understand?\" and not even give him the papers to see! The right way to do it would be to take paper 1 and break it down into its obvious sections, give the person paper 1 and let him look at it.

HCOB 23 March 78RA revised 14 Nov 79, Word Clearing Series 59RA, Clearing Words.) Word Clearing Series 46RB was the first HCOB which gave the full and correct use and handling of M9. It was revised 19 Dec 1979 to include developments on how one goes about clearing a word. This revision is on page 7, section 7 \"Clear the Word\". There were five other changes, all minor. This 13 Sept 80 revision (of the procedure and the examples of cor-rect M9 that follow) serves as a clarification and elaboration of the fact the method 9 word wording must be done with comprehension of the material being word cleared. Earlier write-ups on this subject, not by myself, stated that the person's Mis-U was that word on which he stumbled. This is not the case. It is only occasionally the word on which he stumbles that is misunderstood. Usually, as was covered long since in study tech, it is the earlier word or symbol which has caused the stumble or twitch or blink or omit or mispronunciation or what have you. HISTORICAL Method 9 word clearing was first developed in a pilot project which sought to teach people to read who were not reading in their native tongue. The first versions of M9 were not correctly written up but the technology nevertheless began to spread in use. It was found that not only non-English students didn't know what they were reading but as the educational standards of the culture deteriorated, it was found that people reading in their native tongue could benefit with the use of M9. It was then found that college students could not get through M9. And the latest survey has demonstrated that 31 school teachers taken at random throughout the school systems flunked M9 on their common reading materials."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 2 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 470 MCSC What has apparently happened here is that we have drifted down in literacy to a point where the culture can't read or hear. In a technical culture such as this, one should not ask further why it is failing. Because there are not enough supervisors to personally M9 all the people on the planet, much less a medium size class, it has to be done on a turnabout basis by the students themselves. This caused a difficulty with M9 because one was asking students who couldn't read to understand how to do the method 9 which would find the things which prevented them from reading. Here again we have the chicken and egg problem. Therefore, the procedure has been demonstrated in a picture book which will be issued in due time as a part of a special course. This picture book shows the student how to M9 another student and he can, after be-ing drilled by the supervisor on the picture book. So this has also been solved. M9 is probably the top key method of word clearing today. You would be utterly amazed to find somebody who habitually reads western stories cannot pass an M9 on them. He sees, \"He mounted his roan (a type of horse)\" and he understands from this, \"He roamed around the mountains.\" He has become so accustomed to not-ising his inability to understand what he is reading that he thinks it is ordinary. Isn't that the way everybody reads? M9 brings it home forcefully to him that he really doesn't understand what he is read-ing. This is not why one uses it. One uses it to produce somebody who can read. But, like one of the English teachers who was M9ed on his own text, although he may begin with hostile protest that of course he knows what he is reading, he soon gets into the real reality of it and sees where he is at. His willingness to continue then has already been secured. It will be found that the simple things are the main things on which he stumbles. Thus M9ing is usually preceded by M8 as covered in the new basic comprehensive reading course. This shows him by picture book how to use a dictionary and gets him to define the simple words of the language. Commas, semicolons, even capital letters will be found to be com-monly misunderstood. The usefulness of M9 has gone then from a way of spotting the points where a foreign language student is falling down to detecting and handling the professors and the rest of the culture. It is an extremely important method of word clearing and should be learned very well. HOW TO LEARN METHOD 9 Method 9 word clearing is a way of finding the words a person doesn't understand in a book or other written material by having him read it aloud to the word clearer. It is very simple and precise and it can be done by students on one another with great success as well as by a professional word clearer. Method 9 does not require expertise and it does not require a meter as many other methods of word clearing do. Method 2 word clearing is very similar to method 9 but it requires the use of a meter to pick up the misunderstoods. The virtue of method 9 is that, while it is very thorough and effective, it is not restricted in use to those who can operate a meter and who have other expertise needed for method 2. It can therefore be learned very easily and used very broadly.

One can also learn how to do it all by himself by going through this picture book and this HCOB. MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS A student, when reading by himself, often does not know he has gone past misunder-stood words. But whenever he does go by misunderstood words, he will have trouble with what he is reading. A misunderstood word keeps a person from duplicating what the written materials ac-tually say. It causes the communication formula to go out. A word can be misunderstood in many different ways and it is important that these dif-ferent types of misunderstoods are known to the person doing method 9. A word can be mis-understood because of a false (totally wrong) definition, an incorrect definition, an incom-plete definition, an unsuitable definition, a homonymic (one word which has two or more dis-tinctly separate meanings) definition, a substitute (synonym â€“ a word which has a similar but not the same meaning) definition, a no (omitted) definition, a rejected (by the person himself, usually due to a false datum) definition or an invented (by the person himself, usually due to a false datum) definition. This is covered more fully on HCOB 17 Jul 79 Issue I, The Misunder-stood Word Defined. If a person has habitually gone past many, many misunderstood words in his reading or his education (which most everybody in this present culture has), not only will his ability to read be lowered but also his intelligence. What he himself writes and says won't be under-stood, what he reads and hears he won't understand, and he will be out of communication. The probability is that he will have sunk back to the first dynamic, the world will look like a very peculiar place to him, he will feel that he is \"not understood\" (how true!) and life will look a bit miserable to him. He can even appear to others to be criminal. At best he will become a sort of robot or zombie. So you see, it is very important to clear misunderstood words. Lack of the ability to communicate probably underlies the causes for the current drug culture. You will be amazed that somebody who appears to be a criminal idiot all of a sudden begins to look comparatively like a genius after he has been M9ed. WHY METHOD 9 WORKS A student who understands all the words on the page he is reading will be able to read the page aloud perfectly. He will feel bright and alert and will fully understand what he reads. But when a student passes a word or symbol he doesn't understand, the misunderstood causes an interruption of his voice or physical beingness. His voice may change, or he may stumble on a word or make a face or squint his eyes or react in some other way. This is easy to understand if you remember that a person can go blank after he passes a word or symbol he doesn't understand. He may make a mistake in his reading right there at the point of the misunderstood, or he may continue reading past the misunderstood and make"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 4 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 472 MCSC a mistake on a later word or symbol. He will feel duller and he will try to make up for the dull feeling by reading with more effort. This will always be expressed by a non-optimum action of some kind which must be noted and handled at once by the word clearer. A non-optimum reaction is anything the student does besides read the page easily, naturally, and perfectly. Examples of some of the non-optimum reactions that may show up are: 1. Student adding a word or leaving out a word or changing a word in the sentence he is reading. 2. Student stumbling on a word or saying it incorrectly. 3. Student pausing or reading more slowly. 4. Student frowning or looking uncertain. 5. Student going stiff or tensing a body part, such as squinting his eyes or tightening the grip of his hands, or biting his lip or some other physical reaction. 6. Student reading with effort. 7. Student reading with a glib, robotic attitude (which is how he gets after he has been forced to read \"correctly\" by someone who doesn't know anything about Mis-Us). Other manifestations can occur. Note that the above is not a complete list of reactions but is intended to give an idea of what to look for. In all fairness, one can stumble when reading if he is trying to read in a dim light or he is having eye trouble or the print or handwriting or pencilled corrections in the text are very hard to make out. Thus it is necessary to do M9 word clearing only in bright light and if the fellow is supposed to be wearing glasses, he should be wearing glasses, and the material being M9ed must not contain smudges and deletions itself. All possible reasons why he cannot see the text and unclear text must be removed. Otherwise, the student will simply say he couldn't see it or the light was bad or some other wrong why. Anytime the person makes an error in his reading or reacts in some non-optimum way, a misunderstood will ALWAYS be found just before that point or sometimes at that point itself. Example: The student is reading the page aloud. He reads, \"Raymond walked home slowly and thoughtfully,\" then he frowns. The other student, who is M9ing him says: \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" (If the stu-dent wonders why he was stopped, the word clearer tells him what reaction he no-ticed.) The student looks over what he has read. He feels uncertain about the word 'slowly'. He tells this to the word clearer and the word 'slowly' is looked up in the dictionary and used in sentences until the student fully understands it. "},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 5 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 473 MCSC When the word that was misunderstood is located and cleared, the student will brighten up and will begin reading clearly and correctly once again. THE GLIB STUDENT Glibness is often trained into students by the current educational methods used in schools. The student is drilled to suppress or go by misunderstood words and to robotically answer back with what the book says. If he can do this, he is said to be a \"good student\" and a \"good reader\". With this method, a student's understanding of what he has read is actually considered to be separate from the act of reading. If the educators bother with comprehension at all, it is only to measure memorization, not understanding. In today's schools, students are actually instructed to go right on past words they don't understand; to figure out how to say them and to continue reading whether they understand the text or not. One textbook even advises, \"If you find a hard word, read it as best you can and continue to read.\" Students are expressly drilled to suppress reactions such as mispro-nouncing words, substituting one word for another, inserting extra words, repeating words, and omitting words. These reactions indicate misunderstoods have been bypassed, but under heavy drilling a student can learn to become robotic enough to suppress even these reactions, and read on, leaving misunderstoods piled up behind him. In all fairness, his teachers were not just trying to victimize him. The discovery of the effects of a misunderstood word and the reasons for such stumbles had not been discovered. Teachers did not know about them. Thus they invented various drills to force the student not to make these \"comprehension errors\". They did not have the tech or even know what caused these manifestations. You have the rea-sons for them in method 9 and in study tech. You can spot a glib student on method 9 because he sounds and looks robotic when he reads. One step to take on such a glib student is to ask him if he has ever been taught to sup-press reactions on words which, when he read them, he did not understand. One is asking him to take the \"suppress\" off. He will tell you immediately that he has been when this is true, and some emotional reaction can occur. One simply lets him talk about it until the charge seems to be off of it and then gets him to start his M9ing again. Some of it may be left, of course, but he will gradually get into it and become more honest and more there. He thinks, of course, when you're M9ing him that you simply want him to utter certain sounds. This is what he has been trained to expect. If he is supposed to read aloud, he is supposed to utter certain sounds. These sounds, of course, are meaningless to him but that doesn't matter. Previously, his whole purpose and training pattern in reading aloud was narrowed into getting passed. So it may be necessary for the supervisor to take up why he is being M9ed. But even though he is reading like a robot and suppressing everything, you will be able to see the suppression deepen when he hits the really big Mis-Us. He reads them even more robotically than he does the other parts of the text, so these too can be detected. As soon as he has found a few of these things out and found out what you are trying to do, he will begin to respond much more readily with M9. Method 9 on common reading materials will show up a student's lack of reading compre-"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 6 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 474 MCSC hension and show up his misunderstoods so that he can really see it for himself. It may be an entirely new idea to him that written pages and sound waves communicate something. Another method, an extreme one, of handling the extensively mis-trained glib student is to get him to read a paragraph and then, employing a method known as \"clay table\", get him to demonstrate it. He won't be able to do so. Furthermore, he will realize he isn't able to do so. It was just sounds. METHOD 9 ON COMMON READING MATERIALS To do method 9 on common reading materials, the student chooses a paperback book or something that he reads for his own pleasure and he reads it aloud to the word clearer. If he cannot read it perfectly, it is because he has gone by misunderstood words. At first it may not be real to the student that he has misunderstood words. But after he has found and cleared a number of them using method 9, the student will realize that he does have mis-understood words and that his misunderstoods are getting in the way of his ability to read. When the student reaches the point of realizing that he does actually have misunder-stood words on the materials he commonly reads for his own pleasure, he becomes very will-ing to find his own misunderstood words and he can usually do so easily. Method 9 of com-mon reading materials can be ended at this point. The student is now much more aware of and able to find and handle his own misunderstoods and he is on his way toward reading natu-rally, correctly and with understanding. HOW TO DO METHOD 9 1. STUDENT AND WORD CLEARER SIT ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER. The student and the word clearer sit across from each other at a table or desk. Each person has his own copy of the text to be word cleared. The word clearer must be able to see the student and the page in front of him at the same time. 2. DICTIONARIES ARE AVAILABLE. A good, simple English language dictionary, and any other dictionaries the student may need are available. (Above all things, do not use what is called a \"dinky dictionary\". This is different than a simple well-expressed dictionary. A dinky dictionary is what you com-monly get off the paperback racks in drug stores. It quite often defines word A as word B and then defines word B as word A. It also omits all the alternative definitions and all the techni-cal definitions. Always have to hand, at least in the classroom, the most extensive and volu-minous set of dictionaries anybody ever heard of on all the subjects ever heard of under the sun, plus any encyclopedias that you can round up.) 3. STUDENT RECOGNITION OF MISUNDERSTOODS."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 7 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 475 MCSC Before the student starts reading, he should be told that if he sees a word he doesn't know the meaning of, he should stop and look the word up and clear it instead of going on past it. And the student should be encouraged to find and clear misunderstood words himself. M9 brings about the ability to do this, so that the student will find and clear his own misun-derstoods in future. The word clearer on M9 would never prevent the student from clearing a word that the student recognizes as misunderstood. Correctly done M9 will bring about the ability of the student to find and clear his own misunderstoods. . . . (If you don't want to spend ten years M9ing one page, it is best to get him through method 8 on simple English words. This will be part of a special course which will greatly improve someone's level of literacy.) 4. STUDENT READS THE TEXT ALOUD TO THE WORD CLEARER. The student reads the text aloud to the word clearer. He is not on the meter. While the student reads, the word clearer follows his own copy of the same text, watches the student and listens to him. The word clearer must be very alert and see or hear any non-optimum reactions of the student while he is reading. 5. NON-OPTIMUM REACTION EQUALS MISUNDERSTOOD WORD. A non-optimum reaction by the student to what he is reading is the clue to the word clearer that the student has encountered a misunderstood word. The word clearer and student must now locate the exact misunderstood word or symbol. It will be found just before or sometimes at the point the non-optimum reaction occurred. 6. FIND THE MISUNDERSTOOD. If it is not obvious to the student that he has reacted and he just continues reading, the word clearer says, \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" It is the duty of the word clearer to steer the student to the misunderstood. It is either at the point of the non-optimum reaction or before it. The point is that the student must be steered onto it. And it then is looked up. The student may be able to spot his misunderstood word right away and tell the word clearer what it is. Or he may have difficulty finding it and the word clearer will have to help him find it. The word clearer helps the student by getting him to look earlier and earlier in the text from the point where he reacted until the misunderstood word is found. The word clearer can also spot-check the student. Spot-checking means choosing words from the text the student has already read and checking with him to see if he knows the definitions of those words. If the student is uncertain about any word or gives a wrong definition, then that word is taken up and cleared in the dictionary. 7. CLEAR THE WORD."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 8 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 476 MCSC Once the misunderstood is found it must be fully cleared in the dictionary. The person will be hung up on the definition of the word as it is used in the context of what is being word cleared, which will not necessarily be the first definition given in the dictionary. To try and clear any other definition before clearing the one he is stuck in would cause him to try and clear a word over misunderstoods. Therefore he would rapidly go over the definitions to find the one that fits the context and clear that first. Then the remaining definitions would be cleared. This is how a word is cleared: The first step is to look rapidly over the definitions to find the one which applies to the context in which the word was misunderstood. One reads the definition and uses it in sen-tences until one has a clear concept of that meaning of the word. This could require ten or more sentences. Then one clears each of the other definitions of that word, using each in sentences un-til one has a conceptual understanding of each definition. The next thing to do is to clear the derivation â€“ which is the explanation of where the word came from originally. This will help gain a basic understanding of the word. Don't clear the technical or specialized definitions (Math., Biology, etc.) or obsolete (no longer used) or archaic (ancient and no longer in general use) definitions unless the word is being used that way in the context where it was misunderstood. Most dictionaries give the idioms of a word. An idiom is a phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of the words. For example 'give in' is an English idiom meaning 'yield'. Quite a few words in English have idiomatic uses and these are usually given in a dictionary after the definitions of the word itself. These idioms have to be cleared. One must also clear any other information given about the word, such as notes on its usage, synonyms, etc. so as to have a full understanding of the word. If one encounters a misunderstood word or symbol in the definition of a word being cleared, one must clear it right away using this same procedure and then return to the defini-tion one was clearing. (Dictionary symbols and abbreviations are usually given in the front of the dictionary.) 8. READ THE SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH AGAIN. The word clearer then asks the student to read once again the sentence in the text in which the misunderstood word or symbol was found. The student does so. The word clearer must now ensure that the student understands the sentence and/or paragraph that contained the misunderstood. If the student does not originate this the word clearer must ask him to tell him what the sentence or paragraph means. He does not just let the student continue read-ing with no comprehension of the text that contained the misunderstood. If the student still doesn't understand the sentence or paragraph there will be another misunderstood word or symbol probably earlier in the text, that needs to be found and cleared. Only when he fully understands the section or the text that contained the misunder-"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 9 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 477 MCSC stood does the student continue on with the M9. He would continue reading from the sen-tence that had the misunderstood in it, not just the point where he had the non optimum re-action. Any further non-optimum reactions are handled by finding the next misunderstood word or symbol and clearing it, as above. 9. METHOD 9 IS CONTINUED UNTIL THE TEXT HAS BEEN COMPLETED. Method 9 is continued until the text to be word cleared is completed. 10. STUDENT GOES TO EXAMINER AT THE END OF METHOD 9 WORD CLEAR-ING. The student is always sent to the PC examiner at the end of a method 9 session. And that's all there is to doing method 9! METHOD 9 CAUTION When the word clearer has misunderstoods of his own on the material being word cleared, he tends to go 'wooden' and just sits and does nothing to handle the student. The word clearer must always clear his own misunderstood words or else when the student stumbles on a word, the word clearer won't even see it or hear it because of his own misunderstoods. He can miss the student stumble and never get the student's misunderstood word. The word clearer can also miss a student's reactions when he has so much attention on the page that he becomes unaware of the student or doesn't even look at the student. When students are M9ing each other on the same study materials, they do not first just read the materials as this will only give them misunderstoods. They take the materials being word cleared one paragraph or section at a time and M9 each other on it. This is done by a student first M9ing his twin on one section, and then getting M9ed on what he just word cleared his twin on, plus the next section. It then turns around again. The twin gets M9ed on what he just word cleared the other student on, and on the next section. In this way one person is not constantly leading. Unless the M9ing reversals are done in this fashion, misunderstoods could be missed. The whole text would be covered in this way. EXAMPLES OF STUDENT REACTIONS AND THEIR CORRECT HANDLING There are many, many different kinds of reactions that can occur when a student passes a word he doesn't understand. There are also many different ways a student will re-spond to method 9. All that is needed for success with method 9 is for the word clearer to un-derstand method 9 and to apply it exactly according to this bulletin. Given here are some examples of student reactions and correct handlings by the word clearer: "},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 10 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 478 MCSC A. THE STUDENT CHANGES A WORD IN THE SENTENCE. Example: The page says: \"The boy then reached down and patted his dog.\" The student says:\"The boy than reached down and patted his dog.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" The student looks at the words 'then', 'boy' and 'the'. He knows those words. So he looks in the sentence before that one. In that sentence he sees the word 'collie'. He's not sure what that is. He tells the word clearer and they clear the word 'collie'. The word clearer now has the student re-read the sentence that had the misunder-stood in it and the following sentence. The student does this and the word clearer ensures he now understands the sentences. They continue on with the M9 starting with the sentence that has the word 'collie' in it. B. THE STUDENT ADDS AN EXTRA WORD. Example: The page says: \"The child went to school.\" The student says: The child went to the school.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" The student looks over the sentence. He says he understands all the words, but thinks the sentence should say, \"A child went to school\" rather than, \"The child went to school.\" The word clearer says, \"Okay, let's spot-check some words. What does 'the' mean in this sentence?\" The student looks blank for a moment and doesn't say anything. The word clearer says, \"All right. We're going to look up the definition of 'the'.\" 'The' is then looked up and cleared. After clearing the word 'the' the word clearer has the student take a look at the sen-tence again and tell him what it means. The student now understands the sentence perfectly so the M9 is continued from that sentence. C. THE STUDENT LEAVES OUT A WORD. Example: The page says: \"Robert then visited the city.\""},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 11 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 479 MCSC The student says: \"Robert visited the city.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" The student reads over the sentence. He can't find anything he doesn't understand. The word clearer asks him to look over the next earlier sentence for a misunderstood word. The student can't find any there, either. The word clearer has the student keep looking earlier and earlier in the text and finally the student spots the misunderstood word in the first sentence of the page. The word found is then cleared. The word clearer now has him re-read the sentence that the misunderstood was in. The student reads the sentence and frowns. The word clearer says: \"All right, is there another word or symbol there that you don't understand?\" They look even earlier in the text and find another word that the student went by that he didn't understand. The word is cleared fully and the word clearer has him read the earlier passage where the misunderstood was found again. The word clearer then has the student tell him what that passage means. The student does so and now understands the passage, so the M9 is continued from that point in the text. D. THE STUDENT LEAVES OFF A PART OF A WORD. SUCH AS AN 'S' OR AN 'ED' AT THE END. Example: The page says: \"There was a huge pile of assorted tools in the woodshed.\" The student says: \"There was a huge pile of assorted tool in the woodshed.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. You left the 's' off 'tools'. Have a look over that sen-tence or page and tell me what word or symbol was misunderstood.\" The student says, \"I don't have any misunderstood words on this page.\" The word clearer acknowledges him and asks him once again to have a look for the misunderstood word or symbol. The student looks over the entire page but still says he has no misunderstoods. So the word clearer starts spot checking the student on the definitions of the words on the page. The word clearer asks, \"What's the definition of 'tools'?\" The student says, \"It means 'implements of work'.\" The word clearer says, \"That's fine. What's the definition of 'as-sorted'?\" The student gives it to him correctly, so the word clearer simply backs up the sen-tence words one by one, getting the definition of each one until he hits the word 'was'. Student says, \"It's something you saw with.\" The word clearer says, \"Let's have a look at 'was' in the dictionary.\" Each definition of 'was' is then cleared and it is suddenly discov-"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 12 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 480 MCSC ered that the person has never understood that it had anything to do with the conjugation of the verb 'to be'. After this is fully cleared up the word clearer has the student re-read the sentence and tell him what it means. The student says: \"There was a huge pile of assorted tools in the woodshed. Oh yes, I understand that, it means that there was a large pile of different sorts of tools in the wood-shed. That makes sense.\" The word clearer now has him continue on with the M9. E. THE STUDENT STUMBLES ON A WORD OR SAYS IT INCORRECTLY. Example: The page says: \"I think I'll go shopping.\" The student says: \"I th-think...\" The student stops after he stumbles. The word clearer says, \"Is there some word or symbol there that you don't understand?\" The student says, \"Well, it just doesn't make sense.\" The word clearer asks, \"What doesn't make sense?\" The student says, \"I don't see why it says 'think' here.\" The word clearer says, \"All right. Let's have a look at 'think' in the dictionary.\" 'Think' is then looked up in the dictionary, but the student can't seem to get it, even though he understands all the words in the definition. The word clearer asks, \"Tell me, what part of speech is 'think' in that sentence?\" The student says, \"Uh, I don't know.\" The word clearer says, \"Okay. Well, right here in the dictionary, it says 'Verb'. What does that mean to you?\" Student: \"Mm...\" (long pause). The word clearer says, \"All right.\" He gets a grammar book and says, \"Have a look at this definition of 'verb'.\" 'Verb' is then cleared but while clearing it, the student says, \"Hey, I always thought you could only have one verb in one sentence and that sentence has two verbs in it. Some-body threw me a curve.\" And as he has cognited and has now got it straight, M9ing continues. He uses it in sentences until he's really got it, then they go on to the next definition of 'think' in the dictionary. After all the definitions of 'think' are cleared the word clearer has the student re-read the sentence. The student does so, with no error. The word clearer asks him what the sen-tence means and the student tells him accurately with understanding. The M9 is continued from that point in the text. "},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 13 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 481 MCSC F. THE STUDENT HESITATES OR PAUSES WHILE HE IS READING OR BEGINS READING MORE SLOWLY. Example: The page says: \"The sun was shining on the flowers.\" The student says: \"The sun----was shining on the flowers.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. What word or symbol was misunderstood just before that point?\" The student very carefully looks back over the page, but he can't find any words he doesn't understand. The word clearer says, \"Okay. I'll spot-check you.\" He gives the student a thorough spot-check, but no misunderstood words are found. The word clearer then asks, \"Show me where you were last doing really well on this text.\" The student shows him. It's three paragraphs back. The word clearer says, \"Good. We're going to check from this point back for any mis-understood words.\" He extensively spot-checks the student in that area, and the student's misunderstood word is finally found and cleared. After ensuring that the student understands the part of the text where the misunder-stood was found, the M9 is continued from the sentence in which the misunderstood oc-curred. G. THE STUDENT FROWNS, LOOKS UNCERTAIN, GOES STIFF, OR IN SOME WAY SHOWS LACK OF COMPREHENSION. Example: The page says: \"The family ate dinner together every night.\" The student says: \"The family ate dinner together every night.\" While the student is reading, there is a slight look of uncertainty on his face. The word clearer says, \"That's it. Look over this section you've just read and tell me what word or symbol has been misunderstood.\" The student says, \"But why did you stop me?\" The word clearer says, \"You were looking uncertain as you read that last sentence.\" The student says, \"Well, actually, I did have some attention back on the sentence be-fore last.\" The word clearer says, \"Okay. Was there any misunderstood word or symbol there?\""},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 14 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 482 MCSC The student says, \"I have some attention on the word 'for', but I've looked that up be-fore.\" The word clearer says, \"Well, let's have another look at it.\" 'For' is then cleared and the student realizes that he hadn't fully cleared all of the defi-nitions when he had previously looked it up. Each definition of 'for' is cleared fully and then the word clearer asks the student to re-read these sentences and tell him what they mean. The student has a good grasp of the ma-terial and so the M9 is continued from the sentence that had the word 'for' in it, with the stu-dent reading smoothly and effortlessly. H. THE STUDENT TENSES HIS BODY IN SOME WAY. THIS COULD BE TIGHT-ENING HIS GRIP, SQUINTING, TENSING HIS JAW, JERKING HIS BODY STIFFENING AN BODY PART, ETC. 1. The page says: \"The girls were delighted to see one another.\" The student says: \"The girls (tightens the muscles in his jaw) were delighted to see one another.\" The word clearer says, \"That's it. Look back over this section you have just read. Was there a misunderstood word or symbol there?\" The student looks at the page a long time. The word clearer can see he is looking ear-lier and earlier on the page. Finally the student says, \"I can't see any words I don't understand, but this line seems a bit strange to me: 'It was Christmas Eve. Alice was listening to 'Silent Night' when Carol came into the room.'\" The word clearer says, \"All right. Let's do a spot-check in that area. What does 'Carol' mean?\" The student says, \"That's a girl's name.\" The word clearer says, \"Good. What do the quotation marks show in that sentence?\" The student says, \"Hm. Well, someone said 'Silent Night' to Alice.\" The word clearer says, \"All right. I want you to read this section in the grammar book on quotation marks.\" The student reads the section aloud and says, \"Oh, I see. 'Silent Night' is a song and you use quotation marks around the names of songs. I've got it now!\" The word clearer says, \"Great,\" and has the student give some examples of the use of quotation marks. They then return to the text. 2. The page says: \"The men walked quietly through the dockyard.\" The student says: \"The men walked quietly through the dockyard.\" (Student leans forward and looks at the page more intently.)"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 15 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 483 MCSC The word clearer says, \"That's it. Is there some word or symbol there that you didn't understand?\" The student looks over the sentence. \"Well, I've never seen 'dockyard' used like that before. It doesn't make sense.\" The word clearer acknowledges him and has him look it up. The student reads the definition and starts brightening up. He turns to the word clearer and says, \"And all this time I thought a dockyard was a place where you built docks, I never could understand why...\" 3. The page says: \"The car drove off, leaving a trail of dust in the air.\" The student says: \"The car drove off, leaving a trail (student squints his eyes at the page) of dust in the air.\" The word clearer says, \"Is there some misunderstood word or symbol in that area?\" Student looks bewildered. \"No, the sentence just doesn't make sense.\" Word clearer says, \"All right. What is the definition of 'trail'?\" \"Oh, that's the impression of a horse hoof where a horse has been.\" The word clearer says, \"Okay, look up the word 'trail'.\" The word is cleared and the student sees that he had a totally wrong definition. The word clearer now has him read that sentence again and tell him what it means. The student is still confused about the sentence and thinks it means that the car drove off a cliff or something. They clear the word 'off' fully and find that the sentence now makes perfect sense to the student. The M9 is continued from that sentence. I. THE STUDENT YAWNS. SUPPRESSES A YAWN, GETS WATERY EYES. ETC. The page says: \"A bright red apple was on the table.\" The student says: \"A bright red apple was (yawn)...\" The word clearer says, \"Okay. Let's find the word or symbol that was misunderstood in this section.\" The student says, \"I'm not sure I have the right definition for 'bright'. Could we look it up?\" The word clearer says, \"Sure\", and they look up the word 'bright'. The student then re-reads the sentence and tells the word clearer what it means. The M9 is continued from that sentence. J. THE STUDENT BEGINS READING WITH MORE EFFORT. THIS INCLUDES READING VERY CAREFULLY OR UNNATURALLY OR ROBOTICALLY OR READING IN SUCH A WAY AS TO SHOW THAT THE WORDS HAVE NO"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 16 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 484 MCSC MEANING TO HIM, OR THAT HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS READING. The page says: \"The families were having a picnic on the beach.\" The student says: \"The families were having a picnic on the beach.\" The student reads the page correctly, but he is being very careful not to make any mis-takes. The word clearer says, \"That's it. Let's find the misunderstood word or symbol that you didn't understand before this sentence.\" The student says, \"Yes, I started feeling uncomfortable while was reading the sentence before last.\" The word clearer says, \"Good. Let's look just before that for the misunderstood word.\" The student finds his misunderstood and it is cleared. After ensuring that the student understands this section of the text, the M9 is contin-ued from the sentence where the student found the misunderstood. ____________________ The important point for the word clearer to remember is that where there is a student reaction, a misunderstood word will be found, usually just before the point he reacted. The misunderstood word can always, always be located with good communication, persistence and a totally standard application of method 9 tech, as given in this HCOB. If the student can't easily achieve this, he must go to the supervisor for help. TRS AND M9 To be a very successful M9 word clearer, one's TRs must be in. One has to be able to TR-3 the question and get the actual misunderstood, yet at the same time, one should never go robotic or rote on the method 9 procedure. For example it may happen that half-way through a sentence, the student stops, smiles, and then continues on. Upon questioning, you find that a bulletin he has read many, many times before is now finally making sense. You wouldn't then ask him for his misunderstood. Just acknowledge his win and carry on with your word clear-ing with your TRs in and your application of this bulletin 100% standard. The wins and gains of those you word clear will by no means be slight. QUARRELS OR UPSETS It occasionally happens that the students doing the word clearing get into a quarrel or upset. If this happens, you know that one of two things has happened, either:"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"METHOD 9 WORD CLEARING THE RIGHT WAY 17 HCOB 30.1.73RD MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 485 MCSC 1. \"Misunderstoods\" that were really understood were forced off on the student, or 2. Actual misunderstoods were not detected and were passed by. 1. If this happens, you can clean up any falsely looked-up words by asking him if he was made to look up words he understood. If this is the case, the student will brighten up and tell you the word or words he was wrongly made to clear. This done, the M9ing can be re-sumed. 2. If the above doesn't handle it, then one knows that misunderstoods have been missed. Have the twin who is doing the word clearing take him back to when he was last do-ing well and then come forward in the text, M9ing as he goes, picking up the missed misun-derstoods. It will usually be found that several misunderstoods have been missed, not just one. WORKSHEETS Worksheets are a written record of the word clearing session. They contain the stu-dent's name, the word clearer's name, the date and the name or title of what is being word cleared. The word clearer keeps worksheets during the word clearing session and writes down which words have been looked up and cleared and any other important information concern-ing the word clearing. Worksheets are stapled to the student's exam form when word clearing is complete. They are filed in his pc folder. TEACHING THE STUDENT TO DO METHOD 9 This is done using this HCOB or the M9 Picture Book (which will be issued in due time as part of a special course). This is a simple picture book which is handed to the student. He goes through the book and then does some M9 drilling as contained in the back of it. The supervisor checks him out and corrects him if needed, using only the data in the M9 Picture Book and this HCOB. No verbal tech or opinions are thrown in. ____________________ The end result of a well done method 9 is a student who is certain he has no misunder-stoods on that material so that he can easily study the material and apply it. Method 9 is a great civilization saver. It is easy to do. It's fun and it gives tremendous gains. It is vital that method 9 is done correctly, exactly by the book. Otherwise, people will be denied the enormous wins that can be attained with it. L.

You then find out why he didn't find the misunderstood himself when he realized he was doping off. He knows the tech too. Ethics is only used to get the tech back in.

Auditing and training are awards. A student who is disruptive of discipline and acts contrary to the ethics codes may not be ordered to review by the D of P, D of T or ethics personnel or other persons in an org. ORDERING STUDENTS & PCS Tech and Qualifications personnel, particularly the Tech Sec and Qual Sec and D of Estimations, the D of P and D of T, D of Exams and D of Review and D of Certs may order students or pcs to review or to course or to HGC or anywhere in and around these two Divi-sions without any ethics action being implied. It is just normal, done to get students and pcs on the road to higher levels. Ethics actions may only suspend training or deny auditing. Therefore, a student ordered to ethics for discipline who does not then give adequate promise and example of good behaviour and compliance must be thoroughly investigated even to his or her own area and in the meanwhile may not be trained or processed. The student, however, may not be dismissed or expelled unless full ethics actions and procedures have been undertaken. All sentences carrying a denial of training or processing must carry a means of the right to be trained or processed being restored in a specified time or under specified condi-tions."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"ETHICS REVIEW 2 HCO PL 29.4.65 III MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 490 MCSC STUDENTS AND PCS & ETHICS The routine action of ethics is to request a reappraisal of behaviour and a signed prom-ise of good behaviour for a specified time. If the student or pc refuses to so promise, then the next action of ethics is an investigation of the student's course or pc's processing behaviour. When then confronted with the data, if the student still refuses to promise, ethics undertakes a full investigation in the student's or pc's own area. If the student or pc still refuses to co-operate, the student goes before a court of ethics which may pass sentence. RECOURSE Only after sentence has been passed by a legal body such as a court of ethics or com-mittee of evidence or after an illegal disciplinary action may a student or pc ask for a re-course. Normally before asking for recourse a student or pc petitions the office of L. Ron Hubbard if unwilling to accept the discipline but this must be done at once. If the petition is unfavorably acted upon, the student or pc may ask for recourse. Recourse must be requested of the convening authority that had local jurisdiction over the student or pc and may not be requested of higher authority. A request to higher authority than the ethics activity that passed sentence is a petition, not recourse. COMM EV A committee of evidence is considered the most severe form of ethics action. One must not be idly threatened or requested. Only a Comm Ev can recommend suspension or remove certificates or awards or memberships or recommend dismissal. The office of LRH passes on all Comm Ev findings before they can go into effect. A staff member may not be suspended or demoted or transferred illegally out of his division or dismissed without a committee of evidence. Only after that action, (or wrongful demotion, transfer or dismissal) as above, may re-course be requested. Students or pcs, however, may be transferred, demoted in level or grade by a court of ethics. And the action of sending the student or pc to a court of ethics is of course a type of suspension which may be prolonged in the face of non-cooperation. A student or a pc is not a staff member in the ethics sense of the word by simple en-rollment on a course or in an HGC or review."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"ETHICS REVIEW 3 HCO PL 29.4.65 III MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 491 MCSC A staff member who is temporarily a student or pc in the Academy or Review or the HGC is not covered as a student or pc by his staff member status. He may be transferred about or demoted as a student or pc by Tech and Qual personnel or suspended as a student or pc by ethics. This however may not affect his staff member status as a staff member. Because he or she is transferred or demoted or suspended by Tech personnel or ethics when a student or pc does not mean he or she may be transferred, demoted or dismissed from his or her regu-lar staff post unless the person's staff status permits it. POTENTIAL TROUBLE SOURCES Staff members found to be potential trouble sources are handled like any other poten-tial trouble source â€“ but unless provisional or temporary, may not be affected by this in their staff post. They are of course denied auditing or training until they handle or disconnect but this may not also suspend, transfer or dismiss them (unless of provisional or temporary status). This ethics action (the potential trouble source) is in lieu of any discipline and disci-plinary actions that go beyond temporary suspension of training or processing until the matter is settled, must be undertaken by a court of ethics or a Comm Ev. ARC BROKEN STUDENTS OR PCS An ARC break is not an extenuating circumstance in ethics or disciplinary matters and is only taken into account on the person of the auditor who made the ARC break and didn't repair it. The plea of \"ARC broken\" is inadmissable in any ethics matter as a defence or justifi-cation of misdemeanours, crimes or high crimes. LIGHT TOUCH Scientology ethics are so powerful in effect, as determined by observation of it in use, that a little goes a very long ways. Try to use the lightest form first. Students are quite caved in by it when it is applied, by actual observation. Our lines are too powerful and direct and what we mean to a person's future, even while he or she is nattering, is so well understood down deep that ethics action is a far worse threat than mere wog law. The being who is guilty knows with certainty that he is offending against the future of all, no matter what his surface manifestations or conduct. Further, while wog law at the worst can only cause him or her some pain and a body by execution or one lifetime's loss of liberty, we threaten his eternity. Even while he screams at us he knows this down deep."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"ETHICS REVIEW 4 HCO PL 29.4.65 III MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 492 MCSC My first instance of this was a very dangerous psychotic who was largely responsible for a great deal of the public commotion in 1950. This person desisted and caved in the mo-ment the thought was suggested to her by a non-Dianetic friend that she was threatening all Mankind. She suddenly saw it as truth and instantly gave up all attacks and utterances. Even the fellow who could push the button on atomic war knows, really, it's only one lifetime per person he is blowing up, only one phase in earth's existence he or she is destroy-ing. That we exist here could actually restrain him. The mere destruction of a planet might not as it's temporary. Our discipline is quite capable of driving a person around the bend because of what he or she is attacking, Therefore we can all too easily make a person feel guilty by just a whisper. I've now seen a student, simply asked a question by ethics, promptly give up and ask for his Comm Ev and expulsion. He hadn't done more than a poor auditing job. Nobody was talking about a Comm Ev or expulsion and he had not a bit of defiance in it. He just caved right in. You are threatening somebody with oblivion for eternity by expulsion from Scientol-ogy. Therefore realize that an ethics action need not be very heavy to produce the most star-tling results. Down deep they know this even when they are screaming at us. One suppressive person who had committed a high crime of some magnitude, went quite insane after departing Scientology and then realizing what he had done. Therefore, use ethics lightly. It is chain lightning. LEVELS OF ETHICS ACTIONS Ethics actions in degree of severity are as follows: 1. Noticing something non-optimum without mentioning it but only inspecting it silently. 2. Noticing something non-optimum and commenting on it to the person. 3. Requesting information by ethics personnel. 4. Requesting information and inferring there is a disciplinary potential in the situation. 5. Talking to somebody about another derogatorily. 6. Talking to the person derogatorily. 7.

Students must be trained to audit regardless of their own restimulation or case. When auditing, auditors do not have cases. Students must not be permitted to sag or slack or fall away in attendance and this can be done because all such attitudes result from a student's failure to obtain a reality early in training.

These persons can be grouped under \"sources of trouble\". They include: (a) Persons intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial ties) of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even when they approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong. They, by experience, produce a great deal of trouble in the long run as their own con-dition does not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism. Their present time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous, and so long as it remains so, they should not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor. (b) Criminals with proven criminal records often continue to commit so many undetected harmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should not be accepted for processing by organizations or auditors. (c) Persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publicly attacked Scientology or been a party to an attack and all their immediate families should never be accepted for processing by a Central Organization or auditor. They have a history of only serving other ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or audi-tor. They have already barred themselves out by their own overts against Scientology and are thereafter too difficult to help, since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure.

By responsible-for-condition cases is meant the person who insists a book or some auditor is \"wholly responsible for the terrible condition I am in\". Such cases demand unusual favours, free auditing, tremendous effort on the part of auditors. Re-view of these cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing, that they are losing a planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing, that they are not as bad off as they claim, and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them, even their own families. Establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly. (e) Persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are a liability as they are forced into being processed by some other person and have no personal desire to become bet-ter. Quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrong and so do not get better. Until a personally determined goal to be processed occurs, the person will not benefit. (f) Persons who \"want to be processed to see if Scientology works\" as their only reason for being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate. News re-porters fall into this category. They should not be audited. (g) Persons who claim that \"if you help such and such a case\" (at great and your expense) because somebody is rich and influential or the neighbors would be electrified should be ig-nored. Processing is designed for bettering individuals, not progressing by stunts or giving cases undue importance. Process only at convenience and usual arrangements. Make no ex-traordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons. Not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal of notoriety, not betterment. (h) Persons who \"have an open mind\" but no personal hopes or desires for auditing of knowingness should be ignored, as they really don't have all open mind at all, but a lack of ability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyone's efforts \"to convince them\". (i) Persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better. They have a purpose far being audited entirely contrary to the auditor's and so in this conflict, do not benefit. When such persons are trained they use their training to degrade others. Thus they should not be accepted for training or auditing.

I know of no instance where the types of persons listed above were handled by auditing or instruction. I know of many instances where they were handled by just ignoring them until they change their minds or just turning one's back. In applying a policy of cut-communication one must also use judgement as there are exceptions in all things and to fail to handle a person's momentary upset in life or with us can be quite fatal. So these policies refer to non-Scientology persons in the main or persons who appear on the outer fringes and push toward us. When such a person bears any of the above designations we and the many are better off to ignore them. Scientology works. You don't have to prove it to everyone. People don't deserve to have Scientology as a divine right, you know. They have to earn it. This has been true in every philosophy that sought to better man. All the above \"sources of trouble\" are also forbidden training and when a person being trained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings (a) to (j) he or she should be advised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanation should be given them at that time.

This fact routinely stuns Tech and Qual personnel when it is called to their attention â€“ that only two or three are making their lives miserable. Ethics, seeing tech statistics drop, must investigate all this and when Ethics finds the Qual and Tech personnel have not been handing in ethics chits, the ethics officer must report them to the HCO Exec Sec for disciplinary action. NON ENTURBULATION ORDER What to do with the 2 or 3 students or pcs causing trouble? Ethics issues a Non Enturbulation Order. This states that those named in it (the SPs and PTSs who are students or preclears) are forbidden to enturbulate others and if one more report is received of their enturbulating anyone, an SP order will be issued forthwith. This will hold them in line until tech can be gotten in on them and takes them off the back of Tech and Qual personnel. NOT THEORETICAL This is not a theoretical situation or policy. It is issued directly after seeing tech results go down, Tech and Qual cases Roller Coaster and results drop. Ethics found that the entire situation came about through no chits from Tech and Qual personnel about troublesome people which resulted in no restraint and a collapse of Divisions 4 and 5 comm lines and results.

Such people are known to have anti-social tendencies. When the legal or political structure of a country becomes such as to favor such per-sonalities in positions of trust, then all the civilizing organizations of the country become suppressed and a barbarism of criminality and economic duress ensues. Crime and criminal acts are perpetuated by anti-social personalities. Inmates of institu-tions commonly trace their state back to contact with such personalities. Thus, in the fields of government, police activities and mental health, to name a few, we see that it is important to be able to detect and isolate this personality type so as to protect society and individuals from the destructive consequences attendant upon letting such have free rein to injure others. As they only comprise 20% of the population and as only 2Â½% of this 20% are truly dangerous, we see that with a very small amount of effort we could considerably better the state of society. Well-known, even stellar, examples of such a personality are, of course, Napoleon and Hitler, Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Christie* and other famous criminals were well-known examples of the anti-social personality. But with such a cast of characters in history we ne-glect the less stellar examples and do not perceive that such personalities exist in current life, very common, often undetected. When we trace the cause of a failing business, we will inevitably discover somewhere in its ranks the anti-social personality hard at work. In families which are breaking up we commonly find one or the other of the persons involved to have such a personality. Where life has become rough and is failing, a careful review of the area by a trained observer will detect one or more such personalities at work.   * Editor's note: John Dillinger, famous American bank robber, 1902-1934; Pretty Boy Floyd, famous American gangster 1904-1934; Christie: English serial killer from the middle of the 20th century."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 2 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 512 MCSC As there are 80% of us trying to get along and only 20% trying to prevent us, our lives would be much easier to live were we well-informed as to the exact manifestations of such a personality. Thus we could detect it and save ourselves much failure and heartbreak. It is important then to examine and list the attributes of the anti-social personality. In-fluencing as it does the daily lives of so many, it well behooves decent people to become bet-ter informed on this subject. ATTRIBUTES The anti-social personality has the following attributes: 1. He or she speaks only in very broad generalities. \"They say...\" \"Everybody thinks...\" \"Everyone knows...\" and such expressions are in continual use, particularly when im-parting rumor. When asked, \"Who is everybody...\" it normally turns out to be one source and from this source the anti-social person has manufactured what he or she pretends is the whole opinion of the whole society. This is natural to them since to them all society is a large hostile generality, against the anti-social in particular. 2. Such a person deals mainly in bad news, critical or hostile remarks, invalidation and general suppression. \"Gossip\" or \"harbinger of evil tidings\" or \"rumormonger\" once described such per-sons. It is notable that there is no good news or complimentary remark passed on by such a person. 3. The anti-social personality alters, to worsen, communication when he or she relays a message or news. Good news is stopped and only bad news, often embellished, is passed along. Such a person also pretends to pass on \"bad news\" which is in actual fact invented. 4. A characteristic, and one of the sad things about an anti-social personality, is that it does not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy. 5. Surrounding such a personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who, when not driven actually insane, are yet behaving in a crippled manner in life, failing, not succeeding. Such people make trouble for others. When treated or educated, the near associate of the anti-social personality has no sta-bility of gain but promptly relapses or loses his advantages of knowledge, being under the suppressive influence of the other. Physically treated, such associates commonly do not recover in the expected time but worsen and have poor convalescences."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 3 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 513 MCSC It is quite useless to treat or help or train such persons so long as they remain under the influence of the anti-social connection. The largest number of insane are insane because of such anti-social connections and do not recover easily for the same reason. Unjustly we seldom see the anti-social personality actually in an institution. Only his \"friends\" and family are there. 6. The anti-social personality habitually selects the wrong target. If a tyre is flat from driving over nails, he or she curses a companion or a non-causative source of the trouble. If the radio next door is too loud, he or she kicks the cat. If A is the obvious cause, the anti-social personality inevitably blames B, or C or D. 7. The anti-social cannot finish a cycle of action. Such become surrounded with incomplete projects. 8. Many anti-social persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimes when forced to do so, but will have no faintest sense of responsibility for them. Their actions have little or nothing to do with their own volition. Things \"just hap-pened\". They have no sense of correct causation and particularly cannot feel any sense of re-morse or shame therefore. 9. The anti-social personality supports only destructive groups and rages against and at-tacks any constructive or betterment group. 10. This type of personality approves only of destructive actions and fights against con-structive or helpful actions or activities. The artist in particular is often found as a magnet for persons with anti-social person-alities who see in his art something which must be destroyed and covertly, \"as a friend\", proceed to try. 11. Helping others is an activity which drives the anti-social personality nearly berserk. Activities, however, which destroy in the name of help are closely supported. 12. The anti-social personality has a bad sense of property and conceives that the idea that anyone owns anything is a pretense made up to fool people. Nothing is ever really owned. THE BASIC REASON The basic reason the anti-social personality behaves as he or she does lies in a hidden terror of others. To such a person every other being is an enemy, an enemy to be covertly or overtly destroyed."},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 4 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 514 MCSC The fixation is that survival itself depends on \"keeping others down\" or \"keeping peo-ple ignorant\". If anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter, the anti-social personal-ity suffers the utmost agony of personal danger. They reason that if they are in this much trouble with people around them weak or stupid, they would perish should anyone become strong or bright. Such a person has no trust to a point of terror. This is usually masked and unrevealed. When such a personality goes insane the world is full of Martians or the FBI and each person met is really a Martian or FBI agent. But the bulk of such people exhibit no outward signs of insanity. They appear quite ra-tional. They can be very convincing. However, the list given above consists of things which such a personality cannot de-tect in himself or herself. This is so true that if you thought you found yourself in one of the above, you most certainly are not anti-social. Self-criticism is a luxury the anti-social cannot afford. They must be RIGHT because they are in continual danger in their own estimation. If you proved one WRONG, you might even send him or her into a severe illness. Only the sane, well-balanced person tries to correct his conduct. RELIEF If you were to weed out of your past by proper search and discovery those anti-social persons you have known and if you then disconnected, you might experience great relief. Similarly, if society were to recognize this personality type as a sick being as they now isolate people with smallpox, both social and economic recoveries could occur. Things are not likely to get much better so long as 20% of the population is permitted to dominate and injure the lives and enterprise of the remaining 80%. As majority rule is the political manner of the day, so should majority sanity express itself in our daily lives without the interference and destruction of the socially unwell. The pity of it is, they will not permit themselves to be helped and would not respond to treatment if help were attempted. An understanding and ability to recognize such personalities could bring a major change in society and our lives. THE SOCIAL PERSONALITY Man in his anxieties is prone to witch hunts. All one has to do is designate \"people wearing black caps\" as the villains and one can start a slaughter of people in black caps."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 5 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 515 MCSC This characteristic makes it very easy for the anti-social personality to bring about a chaotic or dangerous environment. Man is not naturally brave or calm in his human state. And he is not necessarily vil-lainous. Even the anti-social personality, in his warped way, is quite certain that he is acting for the best and commonly sees himself as the only good person around, doing all for the good of everyone â€“ the only flaw in his reasoning being that if one kills everyone else, none are left to be protected from the imagined evils. His conduct in his environment and toward his fellows is the only method of detecting either the antisocial or the social personalities. Their motives for self are similar â€“ self-preservation and survival. They simply go about achieving these in different ways. Thus, as Man is naturally neither calm nor brave, anyone to some degree tends to be alert to dangerous persons and hence, witch hunts can begin. It is therefore even more important to identify the social personality than the anti-social personality. One then avoids shooting the innocent out of mere prejudice or dislike or because of some momentary misconduct. The social personality can be defined most easily by comparison with his opposite, the anti-social personality. This differentiation is easily done and no test should ever be constructed which iso-lates only the anti-social. On the same test must appear the upper as well as lower ranges of Man's actions. A test that declares only anti-social personalities without also being able to identify the social personality would be itself a suppressive test. It would be like answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the question \"Do you still beat your wife?\" Anyone who took it could be found guilty. While this mechanism might have suited the times of the Inquisition, it would not suit modern needs. As the society runs, prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personali-ties, one must know them as they, not the anti-social, are the worthwhile people. These are the people who must have rights and freedom. Attention is given to the antisocial solely to protect and assist the social personalities in the society. All majority rules, civilizing intentions and even the human race will fail unless one can identify and thwart the anti-social personalities and help and forward the social personali-ties in the society. For the very word \"society\" implies social conduct and without it there is no society at all, only a barbarism with all men, good or bad, at risk. The frailty of showing how the harmful people can be known is that these then apply the characteristics to decent people to get them hunted down and eradicated. The swan song of every great civilization is the tune played by arrows, axes or bullets used by the anti-social to slay the last decent men."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 6 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 516 MCSC Government is only dangerous when it can be employed by and for anti-social person-alities. The end result is the eradication of all social personalities and the resultant collapse of Egypt, Babylon, Rome, Russia or the West. You will note in the characteristics of the anti-social personality that intelligence is not a clue to the anti-social. They are bright or stupid or average. Thus those who are extremely intelligent can rise to considerable, even head-of-state heights. Importance and ability or wish to rise above others are likewise not indexes to the anti-social. When they do become important or rise they are, however, rather visible by the broad consequences of their acts. But they are as likely to be unimportant people or hold very lowly stations and wish for nothing better. Thus it is the twelve given characteristics alone which identify the anti-social person-ality. And these same twelve reversed are the sole criteria of the social personality if one wishes to be truthful about them. The identification or labeling of an anti-social personality cannot be done honestly and accurately unless one also, in the same examination of the person, reviews the positive side of his life. All persons under stress can react with momentary flashes of anti-social conduct. This does not make them anti-social personalities. The true anti-social person has a majority of anti-social characteristics. The social personality has a majority of social characteristics. Thus one must examine the good with the bad before one can truly label the anti-social or the social. In reviewing such matters, very broad testimony and evidence are best. One or two isolated instances determine nothing. One should search all twelve social and all twelve anti-social characteristics and decide on the basis of actual evidence, not opinion. The twelve primary characteristics of the social personality are as follows: 1. The social personality is specific in relating circumstances. \"Joe Jones said...\" \"The Star Newspaper reported...\" and gives sources of data where important or possible. He may use the generality of \"they\" or \"people\" but seldom in connection with attrib-uting statements or opinions of an alarming nature. 2. The social personality is eager to relay good news and reluctant to relay bad. He may not even bother to pass along criticism when it doesn't matter. He is more interested in making another feel liked or wanted than disliked by others and tends to err toward reassurance rather than toward criticism. 3. A social personality passes communication without much alteration and if deleting anything tends to delete injurious matters."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 7 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 517 MCSC He does not like to hurt people's feelings. He sometimes errs in holding back bad news or orders which seem critical or harsh. 4. Treatment, reform and psychotherapy particularly of a mild nature work very well on the social personality. Whereas anti-social people sometimes promise to reform, they do not. Only the social personality can change or improve easily. It is often enough to point out unwanted conduct to a social personality to completely alter it for the better. Criminal codes and violent punishment are not needed to regulate social personalities. 5. The friends and associates of a social personality tend to be well, happy and of good morale. A truly social personality quite often produces betterment in health or fortune by his mere presence on the scene. At the very least he does not reduce the existing levels of health or morale in his asso-ciates. When ill, the social personality heals or recovers in an expected manner, and is found open to successful treatment. 6. The social personality tends to select correct targets for correction. He fixes the tyre that is flat rather than attack the windscreen. In the mechanical arts he can therefore repair things and make them work. 7. Cycles of action begun are ordinarily completed by the social personality, if possible. 8. The social personality is ashamed of his misdeeds and reluctant to confess them. He takes responsibility for his errors. 9. The social personality supports constructive groups and tends to protest or resist de-structive groups. 10. Destructive actions are protested by the social personality. He assists constructive or helpful actions. 11. The social personality helps others and actively resists acts which harm others. 12. Property is property of someone to the social personality and its theft or misuse is pre-vented or frowned upon. THE BASIC MOTIVATION The social personality naturally operates on the basis of the greatest good. He is not haunted by imagined enemies but he does recognize real enemies when they exist."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 8 HCOB 27.9.66 MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 518 MCSC The social personality wants to survive and wants others to survive, whereas the anti-social personality really and covertly wants others to succumb. Basically the social personality wants others to be happy and do well, whereas the anti-social personality is very clever in making others do very badly indeed. A basic clue to the social personality is not really his successes but his motivations. The social personality when successful is often a target for the anti-social and by this reason he may fail. But his intentions included others in his success, whereas the anti-social only appreciate the doom of others. Unless we can detect the social personality and hold him safe from undue restraint and detect also the anti-social and restrain him, our society will go on suffering from insanity, criminality and war, and Man and civilization will not endure. Of all our technical skills, such differentiation ranks the highest since, failing, no other skill can continue, as the base on which it operates â€“ civilization â€“ will not be here to continue it. Do not smash the social personality â€“ and do not fail to render powerless the anti-social in their efforts to harm the rest of us. Just because a man rises above his fellows or takes an important part does not make him an anti-social personality. Just because a man can control or dominate others does not make him an anti-social personality. It is his motives in doing so and the consequences of his acts which distinguish the anti-social from the social. Unless we realize and apply the true characteristics of the two types of personality, we will continue to live in a quandary of who our enemies are and, in doing so, victimize our friends. All men have committed acts of violence or omission for which they could be cen-sured. In all Mankind there is not one single perfect human being. But there are those who try to do right and those who specialize in wrong and upon these facts and characteristics you can know them. L.

Even indifferent auditing on even a haphazard course causes good case gains. The minority group of no-case-change in routine course auditing and \"withholdy\" is very minor. These categories contain all the students who disturb your course, are insolent to instructors, rant against rules, etc. You are under no orders from me that you must please them but you are under orders to report such cases to HCO. You only use difficult case or student in the Academy as an indicator of some-thing worse. You aren't a staff auditor but an instructor. You want proper auditor and case gain of course, and you'll get it (providing when some student says it didn't work to find out exactly what the student did that didn't work and you'll find it was never what was ordered). However, on cases that are very difficult, watch it! These difficult cases are more than cases. They mean trouble for you from that student and for your class in ways you wouldn't look for. By concentrating on \"tough cases\" you miss the fact that you have a whole class to handle. If you want it handled, look rather at what these tough cases do to your class and han-dle the \"tough case\" in a way to protect your course, not to make their cases move. In an Academy, don't try to handle your course environment with student audit-ing! Handle your course environment with good data, good 8C and discipline and HCO justice machinery."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"THE NO-GAIN-CASE STUDENT 2 HCO PL 5.4.65 II MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 520 MCSC Your students now have their old course regulations suspended. Instead, the justice codes are in. The students are Scientologists. Becoming students gives them no new rights. And it doesn't remove their justice rights either. I've been through all you go through and I have found, by comparing conduct on a course to conduct in the field afterwards, that the turbulent student is a pc, not a student. He or she makes trouble. On the course and afterwards. The total symptom that alerts you to such a person is \"tough case\". This is very easy to notice. Just look over the student case folders and note that one or another student doesn't seem to get going. Note the folder you have to work on. That's it. That's your trouble spot on the course. Don't judge students by \"conduct\" or speed of study. Judge on \"tough case\" only. Routine auditing is good unless it's been alter-ised. Routine processes work on good people. The no-case-gain case makes you hunt for magical processes and fatally leads to alter-is. Now hear this: The processes you have, even when only fair, are better than the processes that will be dreamed up by students or anyone around your course. The processes you use, if altered to \"fit\" some tough case will cease to work on stan-dard cases when so altered. The \"tough case\" (who is also the difficult student) is the sole reason one has an urge to alter a process. You must be sure to push routine processes done routinely. When you see a process being altered look for a \"tough case\" in the pc or the student and call HCO promptly if you find the poor TA type case, the \"no change\" response to routine processes. Your approach is to run the standard processes in the right grade in the right sequence. That's all you teach students to do and it's all you do in case supervision. When these \"don't work\" even when you force them to be correctly applied, you have a tough case there. Don't louse up Scientology technology to handle a \"tough case\". You don't have to invent the processes for it. They already exist in the HGC. When you see alter-is, look for the tough case and let HCO take it from there. We are, after all a team, and as a team we can handle our environment.Your job is just teach and get run the processes of the grade in the right sequence. Your job is to teach students to do just that. Your job is to force the stu-dent to run the process that should be run and run it right and to correct any alter-is savagely. Never let some student tell you \"it didn't work\" without at once plowing in there to look. You will find only one of two things wrong: 1. Your student erred in the wording, sequence or application of the process through lack of study."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"THE NO-GAIN-CASE STUDENT 3 HCO PL 5.4.65 II MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 521 MCSC or 2. Either the student auditor or the student pc is a \"tough case\". Don't let anybody try to vary a process to fit a case. If you do your indicator is ob-scured in letting anybody fool about in \"trying to make a process work\" or trying to get inven-tive just to crack a \"tough case\". The majority of your course trouble and the tendency to alter-is material comes from trying to force a \"tough case\" to get gains. Should you alter or advise alteration of a process you are letting our side down. It leads you into teaching students to alter-is and there goes the balloon. It means they won't be able to run standard stuff successfully. And that means (let's be brutal) they will miss, by non-standard auditing, on 90% of their cases, the good people. They will slant all Scientology toward one nut and we'll be a failed mess like psychiatry with our clinics full of psychiatric cases not people. The HGC (and perhaps one course level) is taught to handle \"tough cases\". The proc-esses for them are standard, too. You must hold the line and answer a student's \"didn't work\" with \"Exactly what didn't work?\" and \"Exactly what did you do?\" and you'll find they didn't do it, or it's a tough case. Either way follow policy. You must report a tough case to HCO at once. For there sits a justice matter, not an Academy problem. It's not your hat. You see the no-gain-case, the \"withholdy case that ARC breaks easily\", \"the blowy student\", \"unstable gain student\" and your tendency may be to do something original or give the student some different process. If you do you are madly off-policy. In the ordinary Acad-emy Course you are not teaching a \"tough case\" course. You are teaching a nice fast, worka-ble course for decent average cases. Your majority is composed of good students. They de-serve your time. So this makes the \"tough case\" student the odd man (or woman) out. They make a lot of commotion so one may think they are \"everybody\" on a course. They're not. They are sel-dom higher than 10%. So you risk the 90% of your course and all Scientology just to handle 10%. Could I point out that the Protestant idea of recovering at any expense and considering very valuable any sheep who strayed, was batty. How about the whole flock? Leave them to the wolves while one ran off after one? No, please don't go the route by doing that. It's pretty awful. No, this \"tough case\" is for the HGC and HCO. And I'd darn well rather you didn't give the person the technology before he straightens out as he'll hurt people with it. Such \"tough cases\" are possible to salvage. They're just cases. But it takes an HGC to run them and it takes HCO to hold them still so they'll be audited. Remember, we're a team. HCO and HGC are part of the team. Don't steal their hats. The \"tough case\" is judged only on the basis of case gain or lack of it."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"THE NO-GAIN-CASE STUDENT 4 HCO PL 5.4.65 II MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 522 MCSC The Academy does not send students to the HGC for \"slow study\" or dullness or any other reason except \"tough case\". That's firm policy. The \"tough case\" is the only one you send. There are 3 categories of these \"tough cases\". 1. The Roller Coaster Case. The Potential Trouble Source. A suppressive person is on the other side of this one. The case will get a gain and slump, get a gain and slump over and over. It isn't a \"manic-depressive\" as the old 19th Century psycho-analyst thought. It's a guy whose marital partner or family is going into fits over this person's connection with Scientology. This is purely a justice matter and belongs to HCO. He either disconnects or acts to settle his or her situation. No halfway measures. But you can't do much about that in an Academy. If you did you'd leave your class to the wolves. Get on-line and route this mysterious fellow who can't get a gain without losing it the next day or week over to HCO with a \"Please investigate. Possible Potential Trouble Source.\" Don't even bother to question the student. HCO will find out. It's also illegal to audit them so HCO won't even route to the HGC but will act as per policy on such. Always err on the side of sending HCO too many students rather than risk keeping one who is a liability to us all. But never send merely a course \"cut-up\" or a lazy student whose case runs well. This policy is only faintly discipline. It is actually excellent technology to a recurring course problem. 2. The Withholdy Case. The withholdy case is routinely ARC breaking and having to be patched up, com-monly blows, has to have lots of hand-holding. As your course possibly isn't at that level it is too much to handle anyway and you're not equipped to handle. But even if your course is equipped to handle the right action is again HCO. Report this student to HCO with the label \"withholdy case that ARC breaks easily\" or \"Blow type case\". And get HCO over to the Academy. HCO may route to HGC at the student's own expense or get two tough staff mem-bers to stand by while the withholds are explored on a meter in case this is a real justice case or just a student lunch thief. The reason for all that weird behaviour is always a withhold con-dition. You can't be bothered. HCO, however, is interested in the No Report aspect of such a case. This person hasn't told all that's sure. HCO can send to HGC or refund or even Comm Ev. 3. The Suppressive Person. The suppressive person does turn up to get trained. And when you train them (a) their case doesn't change, (b) they cheer when their course pc loses and gloom when their course pc wins and (c) they chatter about the horrors of discipline and seek to lead student squirreling or revolt."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"THE NO-GAIN-CASE STUDENT 5 HCO PL 5.4.65 II MINI COURSE SUPERVISOR COURSE 523 MCSC Their dream is a society wherein the criminal may do anything he pleases without any faintest restraint. We sometimes get loaded up with these characters but they run about 1 or 2 in 80 students usually. This person has no faintest chance of making it unless handled for what he or she is in an HGC. And if you train such you lend our name to all the chicanery and injury they do with our tech and protect them with our name. You've seen this case in another guise of squirreling â€“ chatter-chatter about phoney past lives when they were Cleopatra and so on invalidating others' actual memories, talking only whole track to raw meat. You've seen this one. It's suppression pure and simple and they know it! And they don't ever get a case change and their ARC breaks don't heal, etc. etc. etc! The secret here is Continuous Overts which are then withheld. The technical fact is they are quite gone and are solving a personal but long gone problem by Continuous Overts. One can actually handle them if one knows this seemingly tiny fact. One finds of course the PTP, not the overts. For one has about as much chance pulling this fellow's overts as moving the Earth by pulling weeds. The suppressive acts this person does are solutions to solve some long long ago prob-lem in which the pc is stuck. To an HGC this is finding conditions of environment the pc has had and discovering how he or she handled them. But this is HCO-HGC business. The longer you wait to notify HCO, the more harm will be done and HCO will get inquisitive as to why there was no report from you on this. For here is the auditor heart breaker, the natterer, the rumour factory, the 1.1 and the course and group wrecker. Here's \"Whee, kill everybody!\" in person. Here also is the possible government agent, the AMA BMA1 stooge. Here is the guy who plans to \"squirrel\" and \"grab Scientology\". Here is the boy. Or here is the girl. But here is also a thetan buried in the mud. And if you let this person go without attention he or she will soon become ill or die â€“ or worse will mess up or kill others. The person is the only real psycho. And if you let him drift he'll soon wind up in the brain surgeon's suppressive hands. So it's nothing to overlook. People who have to solve their problems by shooting the rest of us down are what made life such a hell in this universe. You have your hands on the implanted, the warmonger, the wrecker. But still, this is what's left of a human being and he or she can be salvaged. But only in an HGC, not a course. Please! Here also is the criminal or the sex crazy guy or the pervert who just had to break old rule 25 (the old no-sex Academy rule). People who are sex crazy are over their heads in a collapsed bank that they've collapsed themselves with overts. Let's be real. This person throws people back in twice as fast as we can pull them out! So why arm him with tech. Put on your label when you send for HCO \"No-Case-Change de-spite good tries with the routine processes taught on this course that was closely supervised in correct application\". Let HCO take it from there. It's not Academy business. Your routine procedure on any of the 3 types of case is: 1. Call HCO Department of Inspection and Reports; 2.

Hold the student in an empty classroom or auditing room; 4. Stand by to help if things get rough; 5. Help HCO complete its report; 6. Let HCO (and probably HGC) take over from there and get back to your students. If you're going to grow and get your own case changes and have a good time instruct-ing you'll read this very, very carefully and put it very briskly into practice. At first you may not agree that you should be so sharp. It may be a blow to feeling you can crack all cases. You probably can. But man, that's an HGC hat. What are you doing wear-ing it as an instructor? By all means crack the routine cases. But the tough ones? That's HCO and HGC. The bigger we get, the easier all this will be. But now let's mark a start in teaching courses that are fun for all by giving the deep six2 to those who want a mess. Okay? Well, do it, do it, do it. L.
