OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 20 MAY 1969 Remimeo Dian Checksheet KEEPING DIANETICS WORKING IN AN AREA In that any Dianetics Course, starting out, has only its Course Supervisor trained, the problems of what is used for Case Supervision and Cramming Supervisor in Qual will arise. Here more than any other points, alteration can enter. Altering, doing something else, is a sufficiently serious problem to destroy a course and all the benefits of Dianetics in a whole area. Early on, during the development of the Standard Dianetics Course, we were suddenly getting case failures. These were traced by Case Supervision to wild variations from Standard Dianetic procedure. These variations were traced to an examiner who during student check-outs was giving \"advice\". As soon as this was handled, case gains immediately resumed. Over the many years of Dianetic use, I think we must have seen all possible variations of auditing. \"New\" phenomena were often discovered and used and eventually the whole sub-ject wandered off into never-never land and ceased to produce uniform results. What has happened here in Standard Dianetics is that the exact actions that produce results on all cases have been isolated and used as the procedure. The procedure is a thin narrow walkway through a huge field of potential alterations. There are no different cases. Built in to the Standard Dianetic procedure are the remedies. For instance early Dianetics was plagued by several problems: 1. Lack of visio – an inability to see pictures. This was solved by getting date and dura-tion. 2. Perception shut-off. Not required in total now to produce results. Sonic, ability to hear the sound in pictures, is not needed at all. Impression is sufficient. 3. Somatic shut-off. Not now required to be solved but its source (drugs and alcohol) has been discovered. 4. Rough sessions. Solved by TRs. 5. Lack of auditor judgement in diagnosis. Solved by the E-Meter."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"KEEPING DIANETICS WORKING IN AN AREA 2 HCOB 20.5.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 2 17.11.12 In these years of research I have been able to wrap up these and other things. There have been more cases run on Dianetics than could easily be counted. So the re-search data is very broad. This is no new subject. It has been close to 39 years under research. Thus what you are told on the Standard Dianetics Course is the essence of all this work and experience. There are no unsolved problems, there is only varied application where there should not be. The whole object of the course is to train people to get good results, and train people to give a course that results in good auditors. That's the whole thing. We could also teach over 50,000,000 words about things that don't get results or train auditors. The essence of a brilliant subject is a simple subject. Therefore anything that varies the data of a Standard Dianetics Course can send it out into unworkability. I've seen auditors also use \"peyote\" (a drug), CO2 and drugs \"to help auditing\". I've seen many different meter types used. I've looked over a thousand different ways to run a ses-sion. And I've seen all these things fail. The four points of greatest potential failure are 1. A Course Supervisor who interprets data and alters it in order to satisfy some student's offbeat quest. 2. An Examiner who throws curves into data by means of invalidating the right data. 3. A Case Supervisor who does not simply and only put the auditor back onto the main line and who seeks to \"solve\" cases by altering data. 4. An Auditor who, not knowing his data in the first place, alters the data and, because in an altered form he fails, starts off on a wilder alteration of data and fails harder. Under Supervisor come the Course and Cramming Supervisor both. So you see, that to get real Standard Dianetic results going in an area you have to be very alert to hold the exact data line as contained in the HCO Bs. Where you begin to find case failures, look to 1 to 4 above and to student failure to just simply study and drill. ____________________ For the first time you have an exact subject in the field of the \"humanities\". These \"humanities\" for all man's history have been a mass of superstition, bad logic, propaganda,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"KEEPING DIANETICS WORKING IN AN AREA 3 HCOB 20.5.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 3 17.11.12 authority and brutality. An exact humanity is so new that it has a bit of a hard time. All the errors and prejudices start to \"blow off\" when truth enters in. Just be sure you don't lose the subject with the confusion. Cope, make do, hold the line and you'll have a successful Dianetic area. It's worth working toward, worth achieving. You have only one big stable datum. If it isn't working it is being varied. To get it working again, find who and what is varying it and get back on the main line. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:an.rd"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" DIANETIC CS COURSE 5 17.11.12 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 6 APRIL 1969 Remimeo Dianetics Course FUNDAMENTAL AUDITING For some years it has not been appreciated fully that the ability to do Dianetic audit-ing is the true fundamental background of a Scientology auditor. For many years, 1950 onward, a Dianetic auditor was proudly capable of resolving mental and physical problems by his ability to find and run engrams and secondaries. The Dianetic auditor had no other skill or tools than his understanding of mental im-age pictures, as locks, secondaries and engrams and the time track. With these tools he produced many miracles. Broken bones healed in two weeks in-stead of six, withered limbs restored, burns vanished, swellings reduced visibly to nothing, lives wrecked by grief and loss recovered, women lost their aging wrinkles and sought-after abilities returned. The percentage of win was above 50%, which is double that of former approaches. The use of the E-Meter and my development of R-3-R increased this percentage. Dianetic training was usually one month in length and attained a high percentage of successful graduates who could attain excellent results. Dianetics operates at the level of the human being and is addressed mainly to the body and mind. It does not attempt and should not be confused with the end product of Scientology which is spiritual freedom. The end product of Dianetics is a well, happy, high IQ human be-ing. Dianetics is itself and has its place. When one can handle Dianetics so as to make peo-ple well and happy, one can then begin to think of and work on the higher aspects of Scien-tology. To attempt to obtain the results of Scientology by applying only Dianetics is in fact a confusion of objectives. The Dianetic auditor, whether the \"very best people\" behind governments like it or not, is the natural inheritor of all mental healing. Working in conjunction with bona fide physical healers such as the actual practicing medical doctor, the Dianetic auditor, with only the skills taught on the Dianetic Course, could all but eradicate psychosomatic illness and mental illness on this planet. Tens of thousands of cases in Dianetics show this is no idle boast. The recent breakthrough showing most insanity is common physical illness untreated, adds up to making such an objective a fact."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FUNDAMENTAL AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.4.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 6 17.11.12 The Scientology auditor is all too often balked by the fact that his preclear comes to him already ill. His preclear is below being a well human being. That is part of the gradient. If the Scientology auditor is not also a good Dianetic auditor he tends to ignore the fact that his preclear is not yet up to being a well human being. Applying Grade Processing the Scientology auditor has already skipped a grade – a well human being. He therefore fails to understand that his preclear is simply seeking to es-cape as a thetan the gradient of being a well being. The role of Dianetics, let us face it, is that of a healing science. It is the most advanced mental science man has. It should not be skimped or scanted. A good Dianetic auditor can handle the bulk of psychosomatic illness and speed the healing of ordinary illness or make it possible for the person to recover. Mental aberration as such can be handled in Dianetics if it works in conjunction with other valid branches of physical healing. There is then a demarcation between Dianetics and Scientology. The Dianetic auditor's skills reach up to and include a well, happy human being. This is in excess of man's hope for any mental science. The Scientology auditor is working for increased ability and spiritual freedom. And that is far in excess of any dream of accomplishment man has had including Buddhism. When we get a sick human being being handled to make him spiritually free we get a confusion and are likely to fail. The Scientology auditor who is also a good basic Dianetics auditor can make that be-ing well enough, using Dianetics and available healing skills, to succeed with Scientology objectives. But it has become plain, particularly in the last few months when I have been sorting out materials to communicate them better, that there is a vast difference between Dianetics and Scientology. A Dianetic preclear is one who is being processed toward the objective of a well and happy human being. A Scientology preclear is a well, happy human being who is being proc-essed toward total ability and spiritual freedom. Those two definitions should be well learned. It will prevent much confusion and some failures. When I hear of a preclear \"getting his Grade IV to get rid of his headaches\" I really groan. A preclear \"getting his Grade IV\" obviously never got his Dianetic auditing and the auditors who audited him were mixed up. I would never never never audit a pc on grades if I found before me a sick person. I would simply change gears, get busy with good old Dianetics and use physical healers if nec-essary to get a well, happy pc before me. Then I would go on with grades."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FUNDAMENTAL AUDITING 3 HCOB 6.4.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 7 17.11.12 Scientology objectives are so far above anything man has any hope for that he at once thinks of them as healing activities. They are not. Dianetics is the healing activity. Therefore all Dianetic course materials are refined with that objective fully in view. And when a Scientology auditor finds himself with a Dianetic preclear on his hands and if that auditor learned his Dianetics well, then he will apply Dianetics and when the preclear is ready for it, only then will he apply Scientology. Any Scientology failures are totally owing to the auditor not learning his Dianetics in the first place. So have at it and get a hatful of healing wins as a Dianetic Auditor. L.

Please replace your copy with this corrected is-sue. The original copies should be returned to the HCO Area Sec.) DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE The first requisite of any auditor trainee is to find and run secondaries and engrams on a preclear, preferably a fellow student, and to have secondaries and engrams run on self. Due to the fantastic speed of results today it is not possible for a student to get enough auditing experience using the standard tech of 0 to VI. To remedy this we use dolls for model session practice and learning the processes. But even further training is needed, using live preclears. The tech used is that of Book I, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, but omitting the countdown and canceller, this not being necessary today and using instead a sim-ple \"Start of Session\" and \"End of Session\" and then running the engram. Do not try to use past track incidents. The preclear may eventually fall into these but try instead for current lifetime. Try first for secondaries (moments of misemotion) particularly loss. Try to find these on a gradient, first trying for minor losses and eventually locating the death of a loved one. Certain pcs (Black Vs they used to be called) are not able to run track incidents but try to coax them through incidents of loss on a gradient (small losses first) and then get on with it. They usually will get visio on incidents turned on if this is done. There is a complete method of running engrams on anyone, developed by me about three years ago whereby the date is found then the duration of the incident. This always per-mits an incident to be run with visio. Don't try for sonic. Get the pc to regress to the moment of the incident. Don't try to run them conceptually with the pc in present time. Emphasize getting the pc to start at the beginning and go through to the end several times. Don't be too keen on repeater technique to get phrases. They show up if you get the pc to run through the incident a few times. When the pc can run secondaries successfully try for actual engrams."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 2 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 12 17.11.12 Once again try for light incidents like a pinprick and graduate up to real engrams – moments of real pain and unconsciousness. Most students shy off actual secondaries and engrams and try to run conceptual blah that could never have affected anyone's life with the pc in PT. This alone is the cause for fail-ure of case gain running secondaries and engrams. Don't try to pull withholds, etc, or handle present time problems but send the pc who ARC Breaks with the auditor (not with life) to Qual at once for an ARC Break assessment. Don't continue to audit an ARC broken pc who has ARC Broken with an auditor. All Ethics data applies – don't audit a Potential Trouble Source. If you encounter an SP (no case gain no matter what you do) send to Ethics. Lack of Ethics facilities and Ethics know-how was the primary reason Dianetics occasionally didn't work. So the new student has to be genned in on: 1. If pc starts chopping auditor send to Qual at once. 2. Suppressives. 3. Potential Trouble Sources. 4. The org pattern showing Tech Div and Qual. E-Meters must be used and regardless of whether the student knows anything about them or not the pc \"must be on the cans\". We don't care if the student learns much or little about meters at this stage but a bright student will catch on fast. There is no E-Meter training at this stage. The texts supplied the student are those which cover 1 to 4 above, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health which he must buy or own and an E-Meter he must buy or borrow but may not be lent by the school. There is real magic in running secondaries and engrams. I have seen the most fantastic recoveries from running merely a secondary (most spectacular recoveries with secondaries were obtained from running the death of an ally). I have seen severe physical ailments – heart disease, arthritis, malfunction, allergies, impotency, frigidity, lameness, etc, through the cata-logue of human ills – vanish or reduce on properly running engrams to erasure. We are not in healing but we have a fantastic success with Dianetics in this activity. No auditor will ever be worth very much unless he has come in the right way – through Dianetics. The concept of physical and mental difficulty stemming from a mental image picture was a great discovery and the technology of erasing such pictures as developed must not be lost in our trained Scientologists. This very instant I know of 3 cases with whom I am in daily contact whose whole lives would be changed by finding and running the incident necessary to solve the case. I have seen a woman who looked 60 appear 20 after 9 hours of auditing out a single secondary (the recent death of her husband). When we originally tried to teach this technology (running of secondaries and en-grams, 1950-1952) we had no Ethics, we were at that time already drowned with SPs. Audi-tors weren't duplicating tech. They often couldn't even state the basic definitions of \"secon-dary\" or \"engram\". They steered the pc all over the track or let him wander like a lost soul."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 3 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 13 17.11.12 They tried to force the pc to run the auditor's aberrations. And it was a jolly old mess! But those few I taught personally and simply had, as any old-timer will tell you, the most fantastic successes with incredibly low effort by the auditor. It's just a picture, secondary or engram. The whole of the technique is just finding the incident the pc is \"in\", running the pc through the incident, beginning to end, several times and not letting him digress and letting him come up the tone scale past boredom to enthusiasm by doing so. When I think of the millions of words I have had to speak or write just to get that terrible simplicity across, I see it can be bent as technology in a thousand thousand ways. ____________________ The student has today guides he never had in 1950-52. He has the Auditor's Code, the actual responses of the E-Meter, Ethics and the final solution of how to turn on visio even in SPs as per three years ago. The startling gains of the exact tech of 0-VII of course overawe the old plodder of 1950. But there is a sting here as far as training goes. No understanding of the mind is com-plete without a thorough grasp of secondaries and engrams and running them. I have seen a person trained up to a high level who suddenly flopped at V because he had no faintest notion of what he was auditing. The budding psycho-analyst gets the shock of his life when he sees there is something there. Before us, people thought the brain had short circuits in it (psychologists and psychia-trists) or that a beast called a Censor lived in a dungeon in it (Freud), or that evil spirits haunted one (Christianity). The whole answer to the mind is mental pictures and masses created by the thetan. There is no other source or cause of aberration. Unless a student knows this he will never make a good auditor and Scientologist. The only early way to get a reality on it is to audit secondaries and engrams and be audited through them. One does encounter all this phenom-ena by the time one is a Grade VII even though not audited on Dianetics. But students begin-ning their training are not Grade VII. And unless they have actually audited or been audited on secondaries and engrams they will never, even though Grade VII, really have a reality on why people act as they do or the complex nature of the bank. Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health was written before whole track was known. It made releases like mad but they were then overrun like mad. It failed only on SPs and PTSs. It was and is the answer to psycho-somatic ills and human aberration. My results with Dianetics were not often duplicated because: 1. I stopped when the ability of the pc on any one subject was regained. 2. I audited smoothly. 3. I didn't use the subject to invalidate the pc (see Original Thesis on why auditing works)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 4 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 14 17.11.12 Many auditors did duplicate my results and made \"clears\" which we now call releases due to total Clear being so much higher. That we are today making a total Clear as well as Operating Thetans is completely out of comparison with what Dianetics was trying to do. Scientology is the route from human being to total freedom and total beingness. Dianetics was the route from aberrated or aberrated and ill human to capable human. This step had never before been achieved in Man's history. Oddly, the step from human being to a spirit had been achieved, if rarely, but was not generally credited (Buddhism, other spiritual practices, even Christianity). Scientology really achieves it and for the first time with total stability, no relapse and invariably one for one. Nevertheless Man had an inkling of the goals of Scientology even though he considered them almost beyond God. But Man had no inkling whatever of Dianetics. None. This was the bolt from the blue. Man was hacking and sawing and shocking and injecting and teaching and moralizing and counselling and hanging and jailing men with enthusiasm without any idea at all of what caused Man to behave as he did or what made him sick or well. The answer was and still is Dianetics. As we can now go directly toward total freedom on a precise and narrow roadway without any ifs and as it can be done by a human being in about a year minimum time due to my discarding of all non-essentials, by developing the exact steps and techniques of admini-stration, and as the result is so hugely startling grade to grade compared to anything anybody had ever even dreamed of and as the final result was never before known in this universe, we tend to turn up our noses at poor little old Dianetics. But it was the grandpa, the ancestor, the basic discovery which led to and the reason for Scientology. And we have the gigantic problem amongst us that Scientology works too fast in an auditor's hands and forbids him to overrun a result. Therefore how can he ever learn to au-dit? He can't, running Scientology, as he'll never get enough practice on live pcs. Dianetics, however, has a virtue we never would have called one in 1950. It is slow. You can grind away on a secondary for hours. You can one by one whittle down a chain of related engrams for days, even weeks. You can audit a pc for a long, long time. And you can get auditing practice. Now just one change – have the pc sit in a chair in Dianetic sessions. No reason to use a couch. Thus the auditor has the same set-up as in grade auditing. The same approach and patter he will use in his standard Scientology grade auditing must be used in this Dianetic auditing or the practice will not train one to do Scientology auditing. (Yes, I know the pcs will roll up in a ball or leap into the air, but this is a hazard of the trade! Put such a pc seated on the floor after one roll off from a chair.) And one Supervisor caution: Tell such students to watch that tone arm for reading at clear read and watch the needle for a float and if they see the release phenomena occur to gen-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 5 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 15 17.11.12 tly ease off the session without even one more command \"to go on\" or any other command. Unless you watch this you will overrun some pc on a release grade. (Also tell him what to do in case of a pc refusing to co-operate or chopping the auditor – send to Qual quick.) Dianetics is easy to do. 1. You say, \"Start of Session.\" 2. You locate an incident (an actual past happening). 3. You tell the pc to go to the beginning of it. 4. When the pc says he's there the auditor tells the pc to go through it to the end and say what is happening as he goes along. 5. When the pc reaches the end of it, the auditor tells the pc to go to the beginning of the same incident. 6. When the pc has, the auditor tells him to go through it (not \"again\") and say what is happening. 7. Repeat 5 and 6. Repeat 5 and 6. Repeat 5 and 6. 8. When the pc is up to tone 4.0 (cheerful) on it, repeat 2. 9. On the new incident repeat 3 to 7. 10. When the new incident has come up to tone 4.0, repeat 2. 11. Repeat 3 to 7. 12. When the new incident has come up to tone 4.0, repeat 2. 13. At end of the body of the session tell the pc to spot the environment a few times. 14. End the session by saying, \"End of Session.\" That's Dianetic auditing. Refined, one can handle \"bouncers\" or \"denyers\", etc. But frankly, I found the pc would only reach to these when he was in over his head and the gradient of incident selected had not been followed. If you choose incidents in the pc's conscious recall not by flash an-swer or meter the refinements aren't necessary. You just do 1 to 12. The original version of Dianetic auditing was all done on a gradient. One searched nothing out by meters or trick questions or tests or flash answers. One got what the pc could comfortably face and audited it. If the auditing was smoothly done, the next incident was tougher but the pc was comfortable in facing it. In that way the incidents (secondaries or en-grams) become progressively more horrifying but the pc is quite comfortable facing each one in turn. This is what is meant by \"gradient\" – it is a steepening or an increasing from the slight to the heavy. But you see the pc smoothly audited is gaining ability and confidence all the time and so can face more and more violence in his past. It's all there in pictures. Blackness is either his unwillingness to face things or his basic bank. It cures (vanishes) if you do it by gradients. And the pc soon can see pictures very well."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 6 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 16 17.11.12 Therefore if your student is becoming a good auditor all you need to do is look at his pc. If the pc is more confident and cheerful, then the auditor is learning and doing well. If the pc isn't, the auditor has a rough spot and should go to cramming. If this doesn't work, training being good, then the auditor is probably an SP who has no idea of helping the pc at all but is using \"auditing\" to bust somebody up. Dianetics is too easy, really, for the student to conceive that his minimum mild actions will produce such fabulous results. So the auditor feels called upon to add. Additives are what checked Dianetic results in the vast majority of cases that were checked. The pc who wants to \"psycho-analyze\" (talk) by the hour isn't getting audited and isn't going to get any better. This pc simply isn't under auditor control so the auditor's control and TRs are at fault. (Pcs explain this sometimes by saying they're \"cogniting\" whereas a cogni-tion is rather quick, not an hour's maundering.) The pc has to be told what is expected of him. \"We're going to find an incident in your life of which you have an exact record. Then by sending you through it at the moment it hap-pened several times we're going to erase it. Just do what I tell you and all will be well. Do you have any questions about that?\" That exact quote must be made to the pc who has not been Dianetically audited (which includes many Scientology pcs too) and the pc must understand it and be satisfied he does before locating and running incidents. Very bad off pcs jump about on the \"time track\" and really need only grade auditing. Such pcs should be rejected for the purposes of this Dianetic auditing and sent to any Hub-bard Guidance Centre. Some pcs just won't get the idea and just won't run incidents. Simply reject for these purposes and send to the HGC. Some pcs are so snarly and choppy even before meeting the auditor, they have to be sent to Qual and afterwards only to the HGC as they're no good for this. They'll make it, but are not easy enough to afford any training to a student. Some pcs are simply Ethics cases (SPs and PTS) and these too should be rejected for this purpose. The PTS is known by \"roller coastering\" (Coney Island fast up and down quar-ter-mile of aerial railway). They slump. So they're Ethics cases. If a pc ARC Breaks suddenly or seems very sad after auditing it's an ARC Break with the auditor and needs Qual attention – and the student auditor should be looked over very carefully as a possible Ethics case. ____________________ Engrams are hard to run in a room full of auditing teams.

In the absence of such Sec Eds an Academy may make up its own. It is possible to make it a whole new course with an equivalent of the old Hubbard Dianetic Auditor certificate. And one recalls that a course not even vaguely as good as this one can be was the course on which all others have been based since 1954. The course out-lined herein is a smoothed version of the course I personally taught in 1950 to thousands. ____________________ \"Secondary\" in its original use meant \"a moment of loss\" and incidents should be cho-sen on that basis. A secondary derives all its power from an underlying engram (containing real pain and unconsciousness). Therefore many, many secondaries (which bury engrams) must be taken off the case first and the job thoroughly done before engrams should be approached in auditing. Seconda-ries may again be approached when engrams seem to have been \"all cleaned up\". This alternation of: 1. Take off a lot of secondaries 2. Take off a lot of engrams – should be followed one after the other. ____________________ Past life incidents are handled just like any other secondaries and engrams. A \"past life\" and memory of it is buried under the terrific loss of possessions and body and natural recall can be restored by just general Dianetic auditing as given in this HCOB. No special attention is required. Do not run prenatal or birth engrams unless they come up naturally. The pc must run only consciously recalled incidents. He need not recall the details consciously. Only that the incident happened. ___________________ The state of release attained by Dianetic auditing is probably below Grade 0 and should be regarded as such and is declared by Qual as \"Dianetic Release\" – no grade number being given. ____________________ "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING COURSE 8 HCOB 3.4.66 DIANETIC CS COURSE 18 17.11.12 The material in this HCO B takes precedence over any Dianetic material, books or tapes including Dianetics: The Modern Science Of Mental Health where a conflict may or may seem to exist.

EXTRACTS FROM HCO BULLETIN OF MAY 15 AD. 13. An auditor must know the basic laws and mechanics of the Time Track in order to run engrams. There is no rote procedure and never will be that will be successful in absence of a knowledge of what a Time Track is. There is no substitute for knowing what engrams are and what they do. Knowing that, you can run engrams, not knowing that, there is nothing that will take the place of such knowledge. You have to know the behavior of and data scout engrams. There is no royal road that avoids such knowledge. If you know all about engrams you can run them. If you don't, you'll make a mess regardless of the commands given for use. Therefore the essence of engram running is a: knowledge of the character and behav-ior of engrams. This is not a vast subject. However, these three things stand in the way, of learning about engrams: 1) Engrams contain pain and unconsciousness; fear of pain or inflicting pain causes the auditor not to confront the pc's engrams and unconsciousness is after all a not knowing condition; and 2) The auditor is so accustomed to projectionists reeling off movies and TV programs for him or her that the auditor tends to just sit while the action rolls forward, acting like a spectator, not the projectionist. 3) Failure to handle time in incidents. On (1) you can remedy this just by knowing about it and realising it and surmounting it and on (2) you can remedy the attitude by realizing that the auditor, not the pc (or some in-stalled movie projectionist) is operating the pc's bank. (3) is covered later. Take a pocket movie projector and any bit of a reel of film and wind it back and forth for a while and you'll see you are moving it. Then give a command and move the film and you'll have what you're doing as an auditor. Many drills can be developed using such equip-ment and (2) will be overcome. (1) requires just understanding and the will to rise superior to it."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 2 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 20 17.11.12 THE TIME TRACK The endless record, called the Time Track, complete with 52 perceptions, of the pc's entire past, is available to the auditor and his or her auditing commands. The rules are: The Time Track obeys the auditor; the time track does not obey a preclear (early in auditing). The Time Track is a very accurate record of the pc's past, very accurately timed, very obedient to the auditor. If motion picture film were 3D, had 52 perceptions and could fully react upon the observer, the Time Track could be called a motion picture film. It is at least 350,000,000,000,000 years long, probably much longer, with a scene about every 1/25 of a second. DEFINITIONS That part of the Time Track that is free of pain and misadventure is called simply the Free Track, in that the pc doesn't freeze up on it. Any mental picture that is unknowingly created and part of the Time Track is called a Facsimile, whether an engram, secondary, lock or pleasure moment. Any knowingly created mental picture that is not part of a Time Track is called a Mock-up. Any unknowingly created mental picture that appears to have been a record of the physical universe but is in fact only an altered copy of the Time Track is called a Dub-in. Those parts of the Time Track that contain moments of pain and unconsciousness are called Engrams. Those parts of the Time Track which contain misemotion based on earlier engramic experience are called Secondaries. Those parts of the Time Track which contain the first moment an earlier engram is res-timulated are called Key-ins. Those parts of the Time Track which contain moments the pc associates with Key-ins are called Locks. A series of similar engrams, or of similar locks are called Chains. A Basic is the first incident (engram, lock, overt act) on any chain. Basic Basic is the first engram on the whole Time Track. Incidents are not in piles or files. They are simply a part of the consecutive time track. By Incident is meant the recording of an experience, simple or complex, related by the same subject, location or people, understood to take place in a short and finite time period such as minutes or hours or days. A Chain of Incidents makes up a whole adventure or activity related by the same sub-ject, general location or people, understood to take place in a long time period, weeks, months years or even billions or trillions of years."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 3 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 21 17.11.12 An incident can be an engram, secondary, key-in or lock. A chain of incidents can therefore be a chain of experiences which are engrams, secondaries, key-ins and locks. A chain of incidents has only one Basic. Its Basic is the earliest engram received from or overt act committed against the subject, location or beings which make it a chain. THE INFLUENCE OF THE TIME TRACK Shakespeare said all life was a play. He was right insofar as the Time Track is a 3D, 52 perception movie which is a whole series of plays concerning the preclear. But the influ-ence of it upon the preclear removes it from the class of pretense and play. It is not only very real, it is what contains whatever it is that depresses the pc to what he is today. Its savageness relieved, the preclear can recover, and only then. There is no other valid workable road. The preclear, as a thetan, is the effect of all this recorded experience. Almost all of it is unknown to him. There are no other influencing agencies for the preclear than the Time Track and Pre-sent Time. And Present Time, a moment later, is part of the Time Track. THE CREATION OF THE TIME TRACK The preclear makes the Time Track as time rolls forward. He does this as an obsessive create on a sub-awareness level. It is done by an involuntary intention. Unless the Time Track is made available it cannot be as-ised by the pc and so remains aberrative. The Time Track is actual in that it is made of matter, energy, space and time as well as thought. Those who cannot confront MEST think it is composed only of thought. This forms the Time Track. Some parts of it, then, are \"permanently\" in a state of crea-tion and the majority of it becoming created when the thetan's attention is directed to them. The \"permanently created\" portions are those times of overwhelm and indecision which almost entirely submerged the thetan's own will and awareness. Such parts are found in implants and great stresses. These parts are in permanent res-timulation. The mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which pause a balance which does not respond to current time and remains \"time-less.\" L. RON HUBBARD EXTRACTS FROM HCO BULLETIN OF JUNE 8, AD13 HANDLING THE TIME TRACK Although finding and curtailing the development of the Time Track at genus is not improbable, the inability of the preclear to attain it early on is questionable without reducing the charge on the existing track. Therefore, any system which reduces the charged condition"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 4 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 22 17.11.12 of the Time Track without reducing but increasing the awareness and decisionability of the preclear is, valid processing. Any system which seeks to handle the charge but reduces the preclear's awareness and decisionability is not valid processing but is degrading. According to early axioms, the single source of aberration is Time. Therefore any sys-tem which further confuses or overwhelms the preclear's sense of time will not be beneficial. Thus the first task of the student of engram running is to master the handling of Time on the preclear's Time Track. It must be handled without question, uncertainty or confusion. Failing to handle the Time in the pc's Time Track with confidence, certainty and with-out error will result in grouping or denying the Time Track to the pc. There are only a few reasons why some cannot run engrams on pcs. These are: 1) Q and A with the pain and unconsciousness of incidents; 2) Failing to handle the Time Track of the pc for the pc; 3) Failure to understand and handle Time. (2) and (3) are much the same. However, there are three ways to move a Time Track about: (a) By Significance (the moment something was considered); (b) By Location (the moment the pc was located somewhere); (c) By Time alone (the date or years before an event or years ago); You will see all three have time in common. \"The moment when you thought\" \"The moment you were on the cliff.\" \"Two years before you put your foot on the bottom step of the scaffold,\" are all dependent on time. Each designates an instant on the Time Track of which there can be no mistake by either auditor or pc. The whole handling of the Time Track can be done by any one of these three meth-ods – significance, location, time. Therefore all projectionist work is done by the time of significance, the time of loca-tion or time alone. The track responds. Those auditors who have trouble cannot grasp the totality and ac-curacy and speed of that response. The idiotic and wonderful precision of the Time Track defeats the sloppy and careless. They wonder if it went. They question the pc's being there. They fumble about until they destroy their command over the Time Track. \"Go to 47,983,678,283,736 years, 2 months, 4 days, 1 hour and six minutes ago.\" Well, a clear statement of it, unfumbled, will cause just that to happen. The tiniest quiver of doubt, a fumble over the millions and nothing happens. Charge is stored energy or stored or recreateable potentials of energy. The E-Meter registers charge. A very high or low tone arm, a sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge. The \"chronic meter of a case\" is an index of chronic charge."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 5 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 23 17.11.12 The fluctuations of a meter during a session are registering relative charge in different por-tions of the pc's Time Track. More valuably the meter registers released charge. You can see it blowing on the me-ter. The blowing down of the TA, the heavy falls, the loosening needle all show charge being released. The meter registers charge found and then charge released. It registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight, by a climbing TA or a TA going far below the clear read. Then as this cleans up, the charge is seen to \"blow\". Charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to \"charge up\", in that charge already on the Time Track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc. The whole cy-cle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing. When prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown, we get upsets and dramatization of the charge1. Charge is held in place by the basic on a chain. When only later than basic incidents are run charge can be restimulated and then bottled up again with a very small amount blown. This is known as \"grinding but\" an Incident. An engram is getting run, but as it is not basic on a chain, no adequate amount of charge is being released. The mission of engram running is to free the charge which has accumulated in being and so restore that being to appreciated life. And all these things add up to charge, an impulse to withdraw from that which can't be withdrawn from or to approach that which can't be approached, and this, like a two pole bat-tery, generates current. This constantly generated current is chronic charge. The principal ac-tions are: (a) When the attention of the thetan is directed broadly in the direction of such a track re-cord, the current increases. (b) When the attention is more closely (but not forcefully) and accurately directed, the current is discharged. (c) When the basic on the chain is found and erased, that which composes the poles them-selves is erased and later incidents eased, for no further generation is possible by that chain and it becomes incapable of producing further charge to be restimulated. The above are the actions which occur during auditing. If these actions do not occur de-spite auditing, then there is no case betterment, so it is the auditor's responsibility to make sure they do occur. Engram running is a step necessary to get at the more fundamental causes of a Time Track and handle them. So it is a skill which must be done and done well. L. RON HUBBARD   1 There is a difference to the HCOB in the red Volume: instead of \"upsets and dramatization of change\" in the red Vol is written \"ARC breaks\"."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 6 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 24 17.11.12 EXTRACTS FROM HCO BULLETIN 3 APRIL 1966 There is real magic in running secondaries and engrams. I have seen the most fantastic recoveries from running merely a secondary (most spectacular recoveries with secondaries were obtained from running the death of an ally). I have seen severe physical ailments – heart disease, arthritis, malfunction, allergies, impotency, frigidity, lameness, etc. Through the cata-logue of human ills – vanish or reduce on properly running engrams to erasure. We are not in healing but we have a fantastic success with Dianetics in this activity. No auditor will ever be worth very much unless he has come in the right way – through Dianetics. The concept of physical and mental difficulty stemming from a mental image picture a great discovery and the technology of erasing such pictures as developed must not be lost in our trained Scientologists. This very instant I know of 3 cases with whom I am in daily contact whose whole lives would be changed by finding and running the incident necessary to solve the case. I have seen a woman who looked 60 appear 20 after 9 hours of auditing out a single secondary (the recent death of her husband.) When we originally tried to teach this technology (running of secondaries and en-grams, 1950-1952) we had no Ethics, we were at that time already drowned with SPs. Audi-tors weren't duplicating tech. They often couldn't even state the basic definitions of \"secon-dary\" or \"engram\". They steered the pc all over the track or let him wander like a lost soul. They tried to force the pc to run the auditor's aberrations. And it was a jolly old mess! But those few I taught personally and simply had, as any old timer will tell you, the most fantastic successes with incredibly low effort by the auditor. It's just a picture, secondary or engram. The whole of the technique is just finding the incident the pc is \"in\", running the pc through the incident, beginning to end, several times and not letting him digress and letting him come up the tone scale past boredom to enthusiasm by doing so. When I think of the millions of words I have had to speak or write just to get that terrible simplicity across. I see it can be bent as technology in a thousand, thousand ways. DIANETICS THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH was written before whole track was known. It made releases like mad but they were then overrun like mad. It failed only on SPs and PTSes. It was and is the answer to psychosomatic ills and human aberration. My results with Dianetics were not often duplicated because: 1. I stopped when the ability of the pc on any one subject was regained. 2. I audited smoothly. 3. I didn't use the subject to invalidate the pc (see ORIGINAL THESIS on why auditing works.) Many auditors did duplicate my results and made \"clears\" which we now call releases due to total Clear being so much higher. That we are today making a total Clear as well as Operating Thetans is completely out of comparison with what Dianetics was trying to do. Scientology is the route from human being to total freedom and total beingness."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"DIANETICS EXTRACTS FROM 7 BTB 7.5.63 EARLY BULLETINS DIANETIC CS COURSE 25 17.11.12 Dianetics was the route from aberrated or aberrated and ill human to capable human. This step had never before been achieved in Man's history. Oddly, the step from human being to a spirit had been achieved, if rarely, but was not generally credited (Buddhism, other spiritual practices, even Christianity.) Scientology really achieves it and for the first time with total stability, no relapse and invariably one for one. Nevertheless Man had an inkling of the goals of Scientology even though he considered them almost beyond God. But Man had no inkling whatever of Dianetics. None. This was the bolt from the blue. Man was hacking and sawing and shocking and injecting and teaching and moralizing and counselling and hanging and jailing men with enthusiasm without any idea at all of what caused Man to behave as he did or what made him sick or well. The answer was and still is Dianetics. The original version of Dianetic auditing was all done on a gradient. One searched nothing out by meters or trick questions or tests or flash answers. One got what the pc could comfortably face and audited it. If the auditing was smoothly done, the next incident was tougher but the pc was comfortable in facing it. In that way the incidents (secondaries or en-grams) become progressively more horrifying but the pc is quite comfortable facing each one in turn. This is what is meant by \"gradient\" – it is a steeping or an increasing from the slight to the heavy. But you see the pc smoothly audited is gaining ability and confidence all the time and so can face more and more violence in his past. It's all there in pictures. Dianetics is too easy, really, for the student to conceive that his minimum mild actions will produce such fabulous results. So the auditor feels called upon to add. Additives are what checked old Dianetic results in the vast majority of cases that were checked. Past life inci-dents are handled just like any other secondaries and engrams, a \"past life\" and memory of it is buried under the terrific loss of possessions and body and natural recall can be restored by just general Dianetic auditing as given. No special attention is required. Do not demand and run prenatal or birth engrams unless they come up naturally on R3-R. What comes up is what comes up. L.

Audience: The 10th, the 9th. The 10th? This is the 10th of July AD 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. I have a lecture to-day on R3R and 3N. But before we get onto these – these technical matters, it's a remarkable world we're living in. Very remarkable world. How can anything be as idiotic at some lines and places as they can be is quite marvelous. I have a banker today who is arguing with me and the only thing I could make out of it – he's just arguing with me vociferously not to reduce any loans I have with the bank or reduce overdrafts and he's trying to make me realize that he's – I don't need any overdraft account, since he's perfectly willing to extend me all the overdrafts that I possibly want anyplace, and not – please not reduce my loan account, you see. [laughter] It was quite remarkable. This is – Scientology credit-wise apparently has arrived. [laughs] Mar-velous. Never had it happen to me before! [laughter] \"Please owe us money, Dr. Hubbard.\" [laughs, laughter] It's very funny, you know, at the times when you need this money, they're never in that frame of mind. You know, never in that frame of mind. But when you get to a point where you don't need any money, you see, you've got everything taped in all directions and so forth, they couldn't be so liberal. Marvelous, isn't it? It's the law of supply and no demand – demand and no supply. Anyway, you are confronting some horrible facts today, talking about R3R, you're confronting some horrible facts. I have some very bad news for you. Very difficult for me to impart this to you and so on, but we have the exact number of skills necessary to make an OT. That's – I'm sorry to have to tell you that – this, because they are not simple skills. And that is the bad news. That is the bad news. They are not simple skills and they are numerous. Now, I brought the bulletin out yesterday which is being run off today in order to talk to you from my notes. But following in my tradition of having no notes and so forth – I brought the bulletins I don't need today, and the ones that I had yesterday which I should have today, you see – that's being run off, so I don't have it today. The number of skills – the number of skills which you have to master in order to make an OT are numerous. And I'm not going to go into a list of these because you'll shortly have it in HCOB, I think, 8 July or 9 July. But these skills are going to make you gasp a little bit when you first look at them, unless I give you a good piece of news. And that is that they"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 2 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 28 17.11.12 break down to about five skills which you have been taught for a long time and which unfor-tunately you have to have perfect. And those skills are: the ability to follow an auditing cy-cle – can you give an auditing cycle? That auditing cycle is quite important. And the next one is: can you give it repetitively? Can you repeat yourself? That's quite important, too. That's a special skill. You see, you could sit down and give one auditing cycle, but can you give the next auditing cycle and the next auditing cycle and the next auditing cy-cle? Now, you say that isn't very hard. Years ago we had to master that one, so we've got that one taped. Got that one taped. And the next one is: to read a meter. And I do mean read a meter. You have to be able to read a meter – and do very well with a meter. Next one is: you have to be able to read, understand and follow the procedure of a bul-letin. That is a training skill all by itself. The last one is somewhat debatable and I don't know what I said in the bulletin on the last one, but it's something on the order of: Keep a pc in-session. Handle a Model Session. And those, actually, are the basic skills – those are the basic skills that we go down to. And any time – now hear me, hear me now – any time that you find an auditor unable to han-dle one of these upper procedures, you look back at those five I just gave you and there is something wrong with those five. This character just can't seem to run something like R3R or 3N – just can't seem to handle it. Can't seem to handle 2H, can't seem to cut it, you know? Just can't seem to do anything with the pc in CCHs, just can't seem to – and you look back at that small list I have just given you and you will find that the fault lies there. The fault does not lie in the complexity of the skill. Now I give you this with great – a great margin of warning on this because this is whether you can train people or not train people. This is whether you personally as an audit-ing supervisor can get auditing done or not get it done – completely aside from getting result on the case that you are doing. When you see an auditor who is getting no results and you've told him to run tech-nique Z and he just can't seem to cut it, you're just going to break your heart if you then get ahold of technique Z and wrap it around his head and expostulate and scream and pound the desk and shove technique Z at him and technique Z at him and technique Z at him and then send him back into an auditing room to audit technique Z and you're going to get hash. And then you're going to conclude that technique Z doesn't work. But you have followed the wrong procedure. I don't say don't teach him technique Z – but if you have to get very extreme in teach-ing him technique Z or if there's anything hard about teaching him technique Z, it isn't tech-nique Z that you are up against. You are up against the five I just gave you. One or more of those is as wrong as Khrushchev. That's awry! It is awry, man. Now, do you understand what I mean when I tell you that no amount of persuasion is going to take an auditor who can't do these basic skills and make him do a complicated skill?"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 3 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 29 17.11.12 Now, no amount of persuasion on an upper level or complex technology – no amount of persuasion, is going to overcome these basic technologies. The difficulties which you're up against are the difficulties of basic skills. Now, you like to think sometime that you're up against case level. To some degree that is true. But all case level does is make it harder for you to teach the basic skills. It does not make it impossible for you to teach the basic skills. And if you ever proceed on the basis that case level makes it impossible for you to teach the basic skills, then you are going to lose. You're not going to lose on just one person, you're going to start losing on pc after pc after pc after pc. I've had the most remarkable people audit. My belief in their ability to audit amounted to more than their case level. I've had a girl who was mostly throbbing away at the lower lip as she gazed out the windowpane fixedly most of her life, headed at a pc, and, \"Now, you can do this,\" see, and so on. \"Oh, can I? ... Maybe I can.\" And they go ahead, and I've had her go ahead and turn in a job. Oh, yeah, you had to keep your eye on it. That gives you a slightly different look at training. You see, you get so involved with a Q and A on training that you can't train. And the Q and A is this: The guy is saying, \"I can't,\" and so you Q-and-A and say, \"Okay, you can't.\" That's Q and A on the part of an Instructor. Look, if he can't, he's awful wrong. If you make him do it, you make him right. And this is one of the few instances where that is the case. He becomes right if he can do this. And it's only his aberration that you're Qing-and-Aing with, if you say he can't. I know this is a very extreme view. But I have recently begun to look on it, not as an extreme view of \"just because we couldn't do otherwise,\" which is what I've said before – I've become to look at it as fact. It's a fact. I don't care what the case level is. Discount it as far as the auditor is concerned. The lower the case level, the more horrible time he'll have. All right. But he can get auditing done. The more brutal it'll be to face up to a session, the more horrible it is to face up to the ARC breaks, the more worry there is between sessions – \"Oh, my God, what am I doing? I've already ruined him. Look at there, he's got a cold, and – and he's all caved – oh, oh ho! And – oh oh!\" All right, that's... aspect of auditing multiplies – but it doesn't forbid it. Now, the mo-ment you let the door open on \"aberration forbids it,\" you've let the door open on \"no auditing must occur.\" Oh, yes, because look at the reductio ad absurdum of all this. \"Only OTs can audit.\" Where does that leave you? It leaves you with no OTs to audit. Every once in a while you get it going in an Academy. Do you know that you daren't – you daren't let a D of P or a D of T, either one – D of P of course can say, \"We can't audit this person because the person has an insane history, or is illegal\" or something like that. But we can't let them get too ex-treme on who they accept for processing or training. But particularly the D of T. The D of T, honest, must never be permitted to refuse a student. Aw, that lets some awful things occur in Academies. It makes the job an awful head-ache. But immediately that you say, \"This student can't be admitted to the Academy,\" then we"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 4 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 30 17.11.12 upgrade our classification of who can study Scientology and then we upgrade our classifica-tion – casewise, see – and only this case level, and then only this case level can study, and wuuhh! And there's all of a sudden nobody in the Academy and nobody learning how to do anything. And look, I've seen it happen. I've sat right there and watched it happen. And I've taken the very people that they said couldn't audit – sometimes with malice aforethought – and made them turn in an auditing session. Oh, brother, it takes some doing! As your Instructors can sometimes tell you here; they probably could expound on this at some rate. But the truth of the matter is it's a Q and A. This guy's aberrations are saying, \"You can't.\" So the moment that the Instructor says, \"All right, you can't,\" the Instructor is then Qing-and-Aing with the reactive bank of the student. And the student's ability deteriorates at a square the like of which I'd hate to see. It's quite remarkable how fast this will occur. Now, one time I remember, one memo-rable ACC – in the last week and a half I decided that no results had taken place in this ACC to amount to anything, so I just went around and all the auditors sitting there and auditing pcs and so forth – each unit as they flip-flopped and so on – and I said do so-and-so and so-and-so and I said, \"You can do it all right,\" and gave them a very complex technology to go ahead and do, but I told them they could do it. I didn't tell them they couldn't do it. And they brought off some remarkable results and all the auditing results that occurred in that ACC occurred in the last week and a half. It was on the basis of \"You can do it.\" And the guy said, \"Oh, I can't do it, it worries me so much,\" and so forth. \"But you're standing here, you're not auditing. Now go on back and audit.\" It's quite remarkable. You see, I myself know all about your qualms and horrors and jitters on the subject of taking apart somebody's head. I know all about these things. I've held my breath more often than you ever will. And I can sympathize with you. But it's something you can get over. And I have seen auditors who couldn't audit at all, couldn't follow an auditing cycle, just had to Q and A and so forth – took a while, but they eventually got to a point, said, you know, \"Hey! I mustn't Q and A this way. Nearly all of my trouble is in this auditing cycle. Nearly all of my trouble is right here in this auditing cycle. Every time the pc opens his face, why, I do what he says in some particular fashion or I question his answer or something like this. And I'm just going from bad to worse. I never stick to procedure.\" You know, crash! A great big exclama-tion point occurs in the sky like they do over comic strip characters, you know? You know, \"Hey!\" you know. \"No, I shouldn't do that.\" And he wakes up to it and he starts right on the situation. Therefore, it takes some a little longer to get these basics down than others. Now, all the training that has been given in recent years is pointed toward those basics. So no training is lost. And it takes you a while to learn to shift gears with shifting technology and that sort of thing, but you will find good news in this. Nearly all of the things which you have learned how to do now have their place in Scientology. And if you've learned how to do these things – if under some different procedure name and so forth – well, you're that much further ahead. When we get down to a complex technology such as Routine 3R, it's a complex tech-nology. Now you join 3R up to 3N and run them all on the same team all with the same"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 5 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 31 17.11.12 reins... And my God, a one-armed paperhanger with the hives – isn't going to [laughs] – couldn't be in any worse shape than this. No, you'll only get into bad shape if while you're trying to do this complex technology you haven't learned which side of you the E-Meter goes on. Don't you see? While you're do-ing this complex technology, all of your weaknesses in the other five show up. If you're still busy Qing-and-Aing, 3R3 can get you into – I mean, R3R can get you into more difficulty in less time... A Q and A isn't just an innocent accident that can be passed over and cleaned up in 3R; it can be a catastrophe! It won't kill the pc, you can recover the session, but boy, it's that whole session is gone. Now, why? Because he's particularly vulnerable? No, it's what you Q-and-A on. You say, \"All right...\" Let me give you an actual instance – actual instance. You say, \"All right. Now we're going to date this implant.\" Pc says, \"Well, I've got the picture right here, why don't you take the date of the pic-ture.\" \"All right, what is the date of the picture? Is it less than, greater than_______?\" An hour later the whole bank goes into a grouper, reality goes by the boards, the pc explodes and his skull flies in pieces through the ceiling. Well, that was an innocent Q and A, wasn't it? The pc just offered up the engram in a muddy sort of a way and thought it was the implant. But the auditor said that he'd been looking for an implant there and he never dated the implant. And some four-thousand trillion trillion years intervened between the picture the pc had and the implant the auditor wanted to date. So he was running the implant with a date error of four-thousand trillion trillion years. Quite an interesting date error, isn't it? Don't you suppose that wouldn't tend to group up some bank? Well, I think that's very interesting. And yet that isn't much of a Q and A, don't you see? See, I'm not even berating that particular accident. You have to be very slippy about this sort of thing, you see. Well, the auditor just doesn't make his own intention stick in the session, which is the basic reas... how things happen in Q and A. He's trying to locate the date of an implant and the pc gives him an engram which is on an entirely different chain, but which he thinks, muddily, is the implant and then the auditor says, \"Well, to make the pc happy, why, we'll just say, 'Well, that's the engram.'\" Pc says he has it, so we just Q-and-A about the whole thing. In other words, the auditor doesn't carry out his intention originally of dating the im-plant he was looking for in the first place. All he had to do was simply carry out the intention he started with in the first place and he would have been all right. Don't you see? But his ten-dency to become the effect of the pc slips his gears, see, and he just gets into a cross-eyed situation where he has no business being. Now, carry out an auditing cycle – carry out a repetitive auditing cycle let's look at how this influences it. The auditor says, \"I'm going to date this implant.\" You see? This is carrying out an auditing cycle. You might not look at this as being an auditing cycle, but it is. \"I'm going to date this implant now.\" And the pc says, \"I have an engram here which I have been looking at which is the implant.\" And the auditor never gets his question answered,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 6 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 32 17.11.12 which understood, the question is, \"When is this implant?\" No, no, he gets, \"When is this en-gram?\" Do you see how that is? In other words, he intends something and he never gets it answered. He wants to know when is the implant, see. No matter if he has to go over the meter and do a lot of things in order to determine this thing, this is still his auditing question. And the pc says, \"It's a pic-ture,\" so he dates the picture and he never finishes off his auditing cycle. And then a couple of hours later you're still picking up the pieces scattered around the room and you wonder, \"What the hell happened?\" Well, frankly, nothing happened to R3R at all. The error was not R3R error. The error is that the auditor wanted, and knew he had to get, the date of a certain implant. And he didn't get it. Ha! Elementary, my dear Watson, isn't it? You want to know what happened to the auditing session. Well, whatever else might have occurred as an error in the auditing session – you could be very technical about all this – the auditor's question, \"When is this implant?\" is an-swered by \"Here is an engram, get its date.\" And these things can slide by so innocently that you can't even recognize them as a Q and A. Too delicate. You say, \"Well, I've got to take the pc's data,\" you can say, muttonheadedly. Well, you've got to take the pc's data. All right, the pc says, \"This was the engram in which the implant occurred.\" Well, he didn't actually, in this case, say that. But even if the pc said that, the auditor has to choose between invalidating the pc and getting his data straight and all this sort of thing, you get into judgment, you get into an involvement of one kind or another. You say, \"Well, all that's very complicated.\" No, it is not very complicated because never at any time did the auditor ask if it was the date of the implant. In other words, you just derail the whole procedure. He started running Routine 3R. Now, here's what's amusing about this anecdote: is the auditor wasn't running R3R, but 3N. And mysteriously found himself running – or found it in progress – R3R. And did the ARC break assessment on 3N. But was in actual fact doing R3R. Now, look at that as a fur-ther complication. Now, you wonder where we are here. I notice you all looking very puzzled. Well, an implant is an engram. And the auditor in this case went to the lengths of getting the date and duration of an engram, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the implant. You don't get durations of implants. Ninety percent of the time you don't even have to bother getting their dates. And if the auditor had just omitted dating this implant, everything would have run off like a well-oiled dream. Because they knew what chain of implants they were looking for and the session – to be very factual with you – was actually a 3N session. And they found them-selves doing R3R. Now, how involved do you think that can get? Well, how do you possibly differentiate between these two things? It's horrible. Well, I might have added to the five, \"To run the process they're running.\" But I consider that inher-ent in the auditing cycle. You get the level of error? This is the only thing I'm trying to get across to you – the level of error is all very, very stupidly elementary. Always! You're really not getting into er-rors which have anything whatsoever to do with R3R or 3N. This auditor apparently has diffi-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 7 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 33 17.11.12 culty running the process which is started on and has a tendency to weasel off into other proc-esses. That tendency existing, then doesn't hold the line on a very precise process. This is not meant in a spirit of criticism; I'm just showing you something, see. Start in running CCHs, see, and then just kind of weasel off into Reach and Withdraw. Be the same thing, wouldn't it? All right, well, that's a gross tendency that any of you could notice. But how about the ten-dency of – carried out... no matter how faint this tendency is – it still expresses itself in not adhering to a procedure. Not starting and finishing an auditing cycle. Because an auditing cycle also includes completing the process you are running. Part of the auditing cycle; that's the major auditing cycle. You flatten the process you're running. I want to make these points with you, not in a spirit of criticism or any derogation. And I want to make these points with you for just this reason: You're colliding with some-thing which on the surface looks very complicated. 3N and R3R look very complicated. Got all kinds of steps and has all about time track and... Have to list, assess, find right levels, watch the TA like a hawk. And you're not going to have any trouble with those at all if you can do the basics of auditing. Actually, it really isn't complicated. If anything is wrong with R3R, it's too idiotically simple. We have here a process which after all these years runs engrams by rote. Well, that's fantastic! But you can't run an engram by rote if you can't read and execute a bulletin. You say, \"Well, oh, yeah, yeah, well, that's Book One and so forth, and I think there was some-thing about implants in Book One. Aw, yeah, well, I understand implants all right, I – di – implants... And so forth. We had a technique one time, we had a pc sit down and he flowed the energy from the top of his head down around his shoulders and that must have been 3... Oh, yeah, I guess that's 3N. Yeah. Very easy. All right. All right, sit there and have the energy flow from both of your temples down over your shoulders. Yes, well, all right. What's the matter? You say there's kind of – something going on? Well, it's all right, just\" – and so on. Pc says, \"Well, it's – this is absolutably terrible.\" [laughter] \"Dear Ron, I was running 3N the other day, and it doesn't work.\" Aw, your level of error – your level of error is fantastic. It's never slight. I never find these gross audit... that's why you call them \"gross auditing errors,\" because they're never slight – never slight. All right, so somebody comes along and he does 3R3 and he dates these engrams and he gets these engrams all dated and so forth and the pc keeps getting groups of engrams and thinks he's running dub-in, and you say, \"Well, study your 3R3 and do those steps better and learn how to move the pc on the time track better and don't get things confused the way you're confusing and moving the pc on the time track.\" And the pc gets his engrams further grouped and he's ARC breaking more often and you say, \"Now, confound it, study that bulletin! Study that bulletin! Learn to say 'move to the beginning of the incident,' and 'move through the incident to a point so forth years later.' Learn how to do that!\" Pc is getting worse and worse. Eyes getting black, you see, getting to look haggard, crunched over, you know, starts withdrawing from life. And you say, \"Well, this 3R3 is a pretty dangerous process. Look what it can do to somebody.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 8 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 34 17.11.12 Ah, but if... now here's what I'm telling – telling you to do. This you might not do – is look into these basics with regard to this auditor. Look into the basics. You may find some-thing like can't read a meter; never has been able to read a meter. Well, let me tell you, the greatest crimes that you can pull and the only thing that'll give you any real trouble in R3R, the only real trouble you will have, will come from wrong date and wrong duration. And that trouble is so far in advance and so high above any other trouble that you can have in doing R3R, that it looks like the sun looking down upon some space fragments. I mean, the order of magnitude is absolutely fantastic. Meter reading. The guy wasn't having any trouble with R3R, he was having trouble with his meter. He had some misconception with regard to a meter; his practice with regard to meters was bad. Or, better than that, he just didn't understand dating. He couldn't ever use a meter, really, on dating, and he couldn't get his durations and so forth. Now look, it's very difficult for an expert meter reader to get the dates and durations of engrams or incidents or anything else. You understand? That's tough; that's hard to do. Let's now add to that difficulty an inability to read a meter! Now you see what I mean. Pc will never chop at you for moving him all over the time track unless you've already laid in the by-passed charge of a wrong date or a wrong duration, because time is the single source of aber-ration. Wrong date, wrong duration. Now, when I say a wrong date, you've got this incident at 9.5 trillion years ago. And it's actually 9.49 trillion years ago. That's not a wrong date. Look for your gross errors – gross errors! Well, this incident is 900 years ago. And it's really 9.45 trillion. Ah, boy! You start running errors in dates like that into R3R and boy, that time track looks like an accordion af-ter a hot night in the – in the polka parlor. Zzzzzzzzzzz. You say, \"What's this?\" Used to be a time track. The bypassed charge is fantastic! You've missed the whole incident, put it in the wrong place; and then you'll say, \"Well, this pc is actually a dub-in pc because they – here he's got this picture of going down to the growler – or rushing down to the – to the local cor-ner saloon and getting a growler for his old man, see – this is – this is the – the whole inci-dent. Next thing you know, halfway down to the saloon he meets this dragon and finds him-self mounted on a horse and the pc will say, \"Well, the old man must have had DTs, and I must have gotten some of his engrams and so forth.\" And you run a little bit further and you say, \"Well – well, let's see, what's the scenery look like around there?\" \"Well, I don't know, like the 1890s or something like that.\" And you say, \"Well, 1890s. Let's redate this thing. Oh, 1890, all right.\" Pc just said it so it ticks, see. You ever notice that you can pick a date off the coach that the coach is thinking of? Well, a dating always will. It'll always – all the guy has got to do is said the date and you'll get some tick on it. He'll say a date and it – for an instant it flicks. Or you can't get a date. You don't have to do anything about it, but he says, \"1890\" and so on. Now, this actually is true that a pc does have the date, and the right date does read. But then he told you the date of the incident, don't you see? I'm saying, well, he just said the fig-ure's 1890. 1890 will get a faint, vesperish tick. It'll only do one tick. It won't do two ticks, three ticks."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 9 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 35 17.11.12 Say, \"All right, it's in 1890.\" Well, he gets – he doesn't get the dragon anymore, but he gets going up in this airplane, you see, to deliver the beer in an airplane and so forth, but he says there's something wrong about this because there were no airplanes in 1890. Orville and Wilbur didn't commit their crime until a few years later, so therefore there's something wrong with this – and the auditor's in perfect agreement; he says, \"Well, this pc's running dub.\" No, he's not running dub. The auditor is running \"can't read a meter.\" That's what's the matter. Now, you eventually get this all tangled – untangled and you do an assessment and you find out you have a wrong date or something and you find that this is 9.45 trillion years, and he did go down to the saloon to get his old man some beer, but halfway there the atom bomb hit. And you get a complete incident and it all unrolls and it's all fine, pc's happy with it and it reduces and so forth. You might say that a dub-in case is only somebody that's got his dates mixed up. You could probably cure a case of dub-in just by accurately dating. Start into this lifetime and keep going back and just date, date, date and you probably could close up a case that was doing dub, because the only time you get time track closure and other things happening and so forth is when you have wrong dates. Now, that's very important, then, isn't it? Let's take a look at this wrong duration. Nothing drives a pc battier than to have a wrong duration. You say, \"All right, this incident is two days long.\" It's actually a trillion years long. He tries in vain to find the beginning of the incident. He can't. Because he's looking at something that happens two days before. So it stays all black and gruesome and he can't make sense out of it and he's all anaten and that sort of thing. Well, after a while – because whenever you get this phenomenon you re-duration – that is the rule – if you have any trouble and you can't find the beginning of an incident – this is what made R3R. I haven't released this, by the way, before this moment. But what made R3R workable is this datum: That a pc has perception on any incident that is properly dated and durationed. That's the most important factor we've learned in many a year. There's where perceptics lie. Now, there's only three reasons why he doesn't have perception on the incident that you're trying to run. There are only three reasons. You have the wrong date or the wrong du-ration or it's got a GPM in it. And those are the only three things that can close an engram out so the pc can't run it. Now, you can add another thing to it – and actually that doesn't close out his percep-tions and it becomes very junior. But you can add this other thing to it, just for fun, and you could say it's a wrong assessment, but all that does is give you TA action. Or the chain you're running has vanished; you've flattened the chain you are running. Once more, you won't be able to assess – pardon me, you've got a wrong assessment. And you're now running him on the wrong chain. The chain he was running is flat. But that all represents itself in tone arm action and actually doesn't really always ex-press itself in nonperception. The whole secret of perception – the secret of perception in an engram is: right chain, right date, right duration equals perception. Period. Every time, man!"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 10 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 36 17.11.12 And the only thing that can get in the road of that thing is a GPM, and you pass the pc through it once – and because he resisted all the way through it – he had a lot of black energy in there, you see. The black energy goes up, bzzzz! – and of course obscures the incident. I found the other day an engram that had a GPM in it. I didn't know it had a GPM in it before I ran the pc through it a couple of times. It registered and then didn't register that it had a GPM in it – so I said, \"Well, we'll just run the pc through it.\" And I didn't really know that the thing had a GPM into it until the lights in a tunnel went out. A moment before there had been lights in this tunnel. But now this time through there's no lights in the tunnel. So the old maestro knew at once that we had rekindled those items and made the black energy off of the items go bzzzzzt and of course it put out the lights. So I got the incidents – I got the... took the pc to the first pair of items, and it was a wildcat GPM and you've got to learn how to run those. That's another skill you have to learn – ha-ha – sorry! [laughter] But the basic ones and the real tough ones, we've got them clear back to the beginning of time. We know their pat-terns all the way back. I haven't released them completely, but actually the April 17th bulletin covers some vast period of time. That's the Gorilla Implants and the Bear Implants, and they cover a vast, vast period of time – trillions of trillions of years. And that only changed just once. They dropped a couple of items out of it in the middle of all of this. Otherwise we've got all that. We got the – an earlier implant, the Glade Implants, we've got those; we've got the earlier Fairgrounds or Circus Implants before that; we – we've got the lot, see. And that's all very helpful. And you'll say, \"Thank God, Ron got these things.\" But every now and then you'll be running an engram in R3R and one of the things which you have to watch out for is, does it have an implant in it? Before you scoot the pc through it, be a good thing to find this out about it. So, did it have an implant in it, see, while you're durationing it. And heh-heh! It has an implant in it. Augghh. Well, the proper procedure is not to throw the pc through the incident, but to take him through the first pair of items in the im-plant, if there are any. And finally fool with it until you finally find out what it's all about, discharge the items out of it. Sometimes there are only a half a dozen items. And get those, you'll see them fire, rocket read, you clean it up and then just handle it as an engram and you'll get the rest of it. You get motion and that sort of thing out of it, get some of the emotion out of it and so on. Pick up two more items that you missed and clean it up. It's a wildcat im-plant, see, and they're never very long – they are never very, very difficult. The pc, if it's on his chain, can reach them for sure. But there's a point in running where 3N and R3R cross. And frankly, as far as pro-gramming is concerned, I would always start a case on R3R and pick up those implants which turned up in the normal progress of running R3R. I found myself going heigh-ho down the Helatrobus Implants, get the lot! Don't just pick his chain up, you know, just get everything you can lay your paws on in that series of implants. Heigh-ho. Clean them up, man. Got your paws on them. Then go on and handle it as an engram. You've got it clean now. Now – then you'd always find the engrams that are on the pc's chain that are obscuring the implants. Of course, we're asking you to drive the 20-mule team Borax mules, you know, out there, with reins wrapped around both hands and, you know, and around your shoulders"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 11 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 37 17.11.12 and driving with your toes – because at any minute, you check up this thing, got an implant in it. Well yeah, it's an implant, and what... You'll have a table of dates eventually to tell you when all these implants occur. And you say, \"What's...\" And you – suddenly dawns on you, \"43 trillion, 980 billion, 706 – that's Helatrobus. Zzz!\" \"You know, I've been betrayed.\" We have the level \"Failed to die,\" and you've got the goal \"Failed\" in the Helatrobus Implants. You're sitting right on it, see. Which is preceded slightly by \"To die.\" Ha-ha. Now, you have to know how to shift that transmission, that – with a smooth shifting of gears right over to 3N. And you just go ahead and handle the whole thing, right there. And forbear tracing back up the track and not handling any more engrams and scattering every-thing around. Just finish what you're doing. It landed you there, you found the engram, you found the computation in the engram, you just got whatever you could get your hands on, cleaned up as much of it as you could and then you jolly well went back to running what you were running, of course, because you've never stopped running it. You have just used 3N as an adjunct to R3R, which is all it is anyway. That's all 3N is; it's just an adjunct to R3R. It gives you how to run implants – implant engrams the easy way, by pattern. And when you get onto a wildcat one, you've got a few more headaches but it's just because you haven't got a pattern; you've got to take the pattern. Now, when we go into this and study this over, we find out that there are a lot of tech-nical details you have to know. Such as, how do you assess for an ARC break. \"We did a half-a-page list on the pc and the tone arm went from 3 to 5.5 to 4 – and the moment it got back to 4 we had a sort of a blowdown so we ended the list. And I – I null the list and pc just seems to be awfully ARC broke and we just don't seem to get anyplace on R3R after this.\" Well, you have to know such things as pcs ARC break if you do not run the tone arm action out of the list the pc is doing. You're going to do a list, you got to do a list. A list is a list! I don't care what it's for – and if you leave a list half-finished you not only won't find any item on it that is any good to the pc, but your pc's going to ARC break. The most frequent source of ARC breaks in the old days was incomplete lists. The guy never finished the list. Or overcompleted lists. You know, the list was complete at fifteen pages and they're just now passing page 75 and the – and the pc hasn't been able to think of any new items since page 20. But they've still been grinding on, the auditor keeps getting in the mid ruds and asking him, \"In this lifetime, what have you failed about?\" On and on and on and on until you get – list's been complete forever. Most frequent source of ARC breaks is – around any listing action – is simply an in-complete list, that's all. You could take any arbitrary list and assess the pc on it. Because the pc didn't do it, it is therefore not incomplete because he never started it. You know, it's like your Prehav levels and the preliminary step list of items – I mean levels to be to run. Well, you can do all of those that you want to and you're not going to ARC break the pc unless you get a completely incorrect level. And that can be very embarrassing to the pc. And I've given the source of this list so that if you ever run into it and you just can't find anything on this list – or if you're – the audi-tor doing it can't find any level on this list at all, I've given you where these lists came from so you can get ahold of some of the old lines and put a \"failed\" to it; put it and a \"failed\" to it and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 12 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 38 17.11.12 a \"not\" to it and you can go on and extend this list considerably. I've given you the sources for this list and you have all those. They're about every thought or combination of anything that man and life has. But this is adequate for most pcs and it doesn't matter whether the level list is complete or not, because it's an arbitrary list. Pc didn't do it, so therefore it doesn't stand as an incomplete list. Ah, but the other list – now you – you're up against all the rules of Listing. And that's quite a skill; Listing and Nulling is quite a skill. And what does it do? It goes back to meter reading. Get your auditing cycle completed. When you confront these complex processes, make sure that your nerviness does not stem from an inability to place the pc's chair. You get the idea? See? You're saying, \"I'm hav-ing all kinds of trouble with R3R.\" Well, before you conclude anything about R3R – oh yeah, go on and study it and learn it and so forth – but you just can't seem to make it work. Before you conclude anything catastrophic with regard to this whatsoever, let's take a look at what you are doing that makes up R3R that makes you nervous. And you'll probably find out that listing makes you very nervous, or something, and you find out, \"Well, why does listing make me very nervous? Oh, well, I...\" It'll be something like this: \"I've just never mastered the art of writing things while I was looking at a meter to see if they read. Yeah, something like that.\" And you say, \"Oh – Oh well, no wonder we're having such a hell of a time in this as-sessment.\" In other words, go back to basic things like your meter, your session, auditing the pc. Auditing cycle. Q and A. Pc keeps getting ARC broke – you can't figure out why he's getting ARC broke and every time you try to find it out – well, you didn't accept something the pc said. You had better conclude sooner or later that you must be doing a Q and A of some kind or another. There must be something wrong with your auditing cycle. Otherwise your pc wouldn't continue to get ARC broke. Look it over and patch it up. Now, therefore, learn to play this game called auditing on its fundamentals. And when you feel very competent with its fundamentals, why, then I don't think that you will have much awe of a procedure which is simply a complex application of these fundamentals. There really isn't very much to R3R. Guy has got a time track and you're going to run him through these things and you're going to come a cropper sometimes – going to come a cropper some-times with it. Why? Well, it isn't because you didn't tell him to move to the beginning of the incident – it isn't anything elementary like that – or you didn't follow your procedure – it isn't anything involved. You'll find out, well, you had something like a wrong duration. You just continued to get wrong durations. And eventually, running this pc, you finally get it through your knucklehead that this pc just won't date on this chain that you are running. And you finally say... trace this thing back. \"Well, let's see. Let's trace this thing back here. Now, what did I do? So-and-so and so on and so on and so on and so on. Oh, we must – he – he doesn't have any tone arm action either. Oh, we must not have the right assessment. Something is wrong with the assessment. Well, how could there be anything wrong with the assessment?\" And it suddenly dawns on you that you have absolutely no confidence whatso-ever in being able to clean up a pc's needle so you can assess. Nothing wrong with R3R, see. You're having trouble – you're having trouble handling a session and handling a meter."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 13 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 39 17.11.12 So on this pc, without going back and putting yourself through a course or something like that – on this pc right then, you decide, \"Well, all right, to hell with it, this thing has got no tone arm action so I must have a wrong assessment. That's it. So there's something wrong with the item or there's something wrong with the level. That's all. All right, now what could be wrong with those? Well, I just must not have done what I was supposed to do to find the item – or to find the level from which I got the item. Now something is wrong in that depart-ment. \"Well, how come I could – would get a wrong assessment on this pc? Well, I've – let's see. Let's see, his needle was awful dirty. As a matter of fact, his needle is still dirty. As a matter of fact I've never seen a clean needle on this pc! Ahh! Hey, hey – I think I've got it. I think I got it. I think this pc – I've never had this pc in-session. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Excuse me!\" [laughter] \"Ah,\" so you say, \"Well, now let's – let's put this pc in-session. This pc has been roughed up a few times and so forth; let's just run 'in auditing,' eighteen-button Prepcheck.\" Something elementary. Only in this particular case, why, we're just going to run them until we've got a bit of a clean needle and we're not going to bother the pc and so forth because that seems to be a weak spot, here. So let's just kind of – let's run a sort of an eighteen-button Prepcheck on auditing and let the pc answer it any way he wants to, and we'll say it's clean when it's clean and we'll just kind of ease this thing out and so forth. Boy, we find out all kinds of things. This pc has been withholding, and he's been suppressing and he's been upset with this and he's been in disagreement with that and so forth, and you know? You thought you couldn't run R3R. Well, no, you just didn't have the pc in-session. See, elementary, my dear Watson. How can you do an assessment on somebody who isn't in-session? So you trace this – always trace this back to these stupid fundamentals. And your main danger as an auditor is – the main danger that you run into – is that you're too complicated. You're not – you're insufficiently idiotable. See, if you would just – if you would just recog-nize that the simplicities of the game make it hang together and work – if you'll just recognize that, why, you'll have some fantastic wins here and there. Look it over. And eventually you'll get very cocky about these things and it'll all fall into line with you and so forth. But the reason you're not achieving a result here or there on a complex technology goes back to these early ones. You either aren't doing it, you aren't doing it in an auditing ses-sion because you haven't got a session, or you suddenly discover that there's something wrong between you and the pc and this meter. This pc does not register well on this meter. Why? Well, I'll let you in on something. The greatest errors that you can make in R3R – the greatest errors that you can make – are wrong date and wrong duration. Those outshine any other er-ror. You can even make progress with a wrong assessment, you understand? Those are just enormous. They ride up there at the umpteen skillion light-year level, see? And way down below these things is wrong assessment. Well, there's two ways we can get a wrong assessment. We can have had a wrong as-sessment in the first place, and we could actually have run it out so that we are now running on a wrong assessment, because you see, we flattened the first assessment. In which case – both cases, the TA will remain without motion. You won't have adequate motion in the TA."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 14 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 40 17.11.12 Now, the only other thing that can kill TA motion, as far as R3R is concerned, is this astronomic fact of wrong date, wrong duration – they'll kill TA motion. Wrong date, wrong duration, bang! No TA motion; that's it. I've been studying TA motion here, lately – what makes it and that sort of thing, and I finally found these facts out. And so there's this enormously important fact – just cannot be overstressed. Wrong date, wrong duration. Those are crash. Anytime you're really having any trouble with it you've got wrong dates and wrong durations. I mean, that's all. You under-stand? I mean, that's waaay up there. The other point here, wrong assessment, well, the only thing that leads to is just no TA action and not much pc interest and you're not getting much done on the case and so forth and so on. It's not going to ruin the case, don't you see? And flatten the chain – you flatten the chain, and you said, \"Well, a chain couldn't flat-ten in one engram.\" Yet you did. You flattened it in one engram. What you found was basic on that chain. You know, it flattens in a hundred or it flattens in one or... it's no point – has nothing to do with where the engram is on the time track. The engram can be yesterday; just yesterday. And it's basic. Well, you ran – run this engram that you date as yesterday. And you clean it all up and the pc's fine, and the somatics reduce and everything's gorgeous about the thing and you look for an earlier one, you can't get any date, you can't get any... \"Let's see. Is the earlier incident we want gr-gr-greater-greater than 10 days ago? Less than – I don't get any read. Just a minute, get some better light on this...\" [laughter] \"Now is – is the engram – is the engram, the earlier engram which reduces to absurdium that chain – is the earlier engram earlier than 20 days ago? Is it later than – I mean no, no. No. I mean is it more – more than 20 days ago? Le-le-less than 20 days ago? I don't get any read here at all.\" [fumbles with meter, clears his throat] \"Now, maybe it's the wrong order of magnitude. Ah! Is the earlier engram we are looking for on the re – to re-fail to reduce to absurdity, is this more than a hundred trillion years ago? Is it less than a – that doesn't read. More than a hundred? They're both reading. Did you think of something?\" [laughter] \"All right, let's have another crack at this. Is it more than a hundred trillion years ago? Less – I got a dirty needle here. You thinking of something?\" [laughter] Four sessions later: \"Say, I wonder something.\" Lights dawn, you know? \"To fail to reduce to absurdity... fail to reduce to absurdity – it doesn't read.\" [laughter] \"We flattened the chain. Oh, excuse me!\" [laughs] Pc says self-righteously, \"Well, I told you I thought that was all there was to it.\" Pc didn't say a word about it! [laughs] Well, that's some of the troubles you run into, when you get a wrong assessment. Man, the devil himself with telepathy! The Russians have heard that the Americans are now using telepathy to communicate to the atomic subs – so they now have a Professor of Telepathy who is studying telepathy and he wants to telepath to a group at Oxford University. Only he won't do it because he doesn't think telepathy works. I mean... Our scientific world marches on."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 15 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 41 17.11.12 But the point I'm making here is wrong assessment is contributive to wrong date and wrong duration. Because even if you have the right chain, getting a date to read and getting a duration to read is hell. It's horrible! It's very hard to do. With the pc in-session, needle clean, right level, right item, next engram coming up dead-easy, it's difficult. It's not easy to get the right date and the right duration. Why? Because you've got the date, which is usually the last moment of the engram toward present time. So your duration extends that earlier, see? And if you don't get – and the pc has no reality on how early this thing went because he's only got the last tail of it, which is the part toward present time, so duration doesn't read worth a nickel – dating is easier to do than duration. And brother, I have dated something twice and re-durationed it ten times trying to find the beginning of it. When I finally did find the beginning of it, zing! Of course, I had to redate it by that time. Because it had now become unreal. See, its end was so much further away that it made about a – well, it made about a hundred years of error in the date when we finally found the beginning of it. And it was dark and it was terrible and the pc couldn't run it and nothing could be done about it and nobody could find anything in it and it was all a mess and all a mess and all a mess and all a mess, and re-duration, re-duration, re-duration – and then finally got a more proper date, and then dura-tion, and then durationed it, and then all of a sudden had the right duration, and bang, pc got to the beginning of the thing, went through it zip-zip-zip, all of the somatics reduced, every-thing was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. That pc was running all right, on the right chain. How many re-durationings? Ten. God help you someday, when you get somebody who has an engram fifteen trillion trillion years long. Try to find the beginning of that! Before you've gone halfway through, of course, your date is so wrong that it's jamming the track anyway. And just time after time, you find the earlier part of it and you find the earlier part of it and you find an earlier part of it – and finally, you finally get it all worked out and you find out that this thing which first regis-tered as one and one-half hours long was actually 15 trillion trillion years in length. Some-body stuck in a mountain that long; couldn't get out. That's rough. That's hard to do. It's hard to do when everything else is correct. So you've got to have everything else correct and then it can be done. But it is not easy to do when all signs and portents are favorable. Got that? Now you get a wrong assessment and add it to this. Oh-ho, you've had it. Or you over-run a chain. You've run five engrams on this chain and they don't – no TA action on the last two. The thing was sitting at 5 on the TA and you're getting no TA action, so you just say, \"Well, maybe the TA action will pick up. Maybe I've got wrong dates and durations on this thing, maybe the TA I...\" Actually pick it up and you say, \"Now, is it more than...\" You know, \"Is the next incident...\" You know, \"What's the date of the next earlier incident?\" See? Get your head back on. TA's up there, hasn't moved for two incidents; 3R3 says that you're supposed to find the basic on the chain. Maybe you did. Maybe you've run two more incidents than you needed to run to flatten it. Maybe the thing's been flat. But you can't go into esoterics as to whether something is flattened or not flattened or anything else, if you can't even put a pc in-session. How can you run an ARC break when all"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"AUDITING SKILLS FOR R3R 16 SHSBC-310 – 10.7.63 DIANETIC CS COURSE 42 17.11.12 your sessioning on the pc is an ARC break? When you won't answer anything the pc tells you, how can you do an ARC break assessment – because you're laying in ARC breaks faster than, of course, you're picking them up by assessment. That's something like the frog that crawls up two inches and falls back three, and he never gets to the top of the well that way. What's in error then? Just your auditing cycle – nothing more elementary than that. So I'm saying it's not terribly good news that taking somebody all the way to OT re-quires a number of complicated procedures; this is not very good news. But it is good news that all the errors of these procedures, when they really get erroneous, fall immediately back down to just a very few basics. You can learn how to do those basics, get confidence in that line, recognize that your disabilities in handling other things fall back to those simple basics. Therefore you can always improve those basics so you'll be able to do it, and you've got a clear road ahead of you. I'm not at all dismayed as far as you're concerned in being able to do these procedures, but I'm looking at what difficulty you are having here or there, and I recognize they're all elementary difficulties; they're not complex difficulties at all. You can do these things – you can do them easily and you can bring off the show. Because, I'm telling you, you're right – you're right here within handshaking distance of making OTs. OT is on the sunny side of a thousand hours right this minute for any pc. The length of time it'll take him to go OT has intimately to do, much more intimately to do with the auditor's command of basics than it does the state of his case. Because I have made a new discovery which will hearten you a great deal. And that is that case levels VII, VI, V – all of them – have a channel which, if properly assessed, give them clear-running, TA-moving engrams, with no dub. There's always a little channel lies through the bank which is straight, that the pc has a reality on. And that doesn't matter if you're running \"brushing teeth.\" See? He's still got that one. Win on that one, flatten that chain, reassess, get another chain, and he goes up, up, further, further, ability, better, better, better, better. The next thing you know, you've got it made. You're not up against difficult cases. You're up against rather difficult procedures. And all that your difficult procedures are up against are your ability to handle the basics I've been talking about. Okay?

REVIEWING FOLDERS In reviewing a folder, the first thing to do is to look at the C/S to see if it was done. Use the Summary Sheet to get the Auditor's attitude. Use the Auditor's Report Form to get the time of processes. Read and take all your data from Worksheets and compare it to and see that C/S was complied with and ensure Standard Tech was applied. If you can't read the reports, send it back to have the Auditor over-print illegible words. Never try to case supervise (C/S) an illegible worksheet as you'll only run into head-aches. The After Session Examiner's Report gives you the first clue of how suspicious you should be in examining the folder and whether or not auditing reports contain falsities. STANDARD TECH You're never led by anything into departing from Standard Tech. The only reason it doesn't work is that it hasn't been applied.

Therefore they do not have various skills you will find in a Scientology Auditor. Even when they become a Scientology Auditor, Dianetics is still done as Dianetics. Therefore the Case Supervisor supervising folders done by Dianetic Auditors must not expect or require any of the following: 1. RUDIMENTS, they came in long after Dianetics. 2. MODEL SESSION, this was invented 11 years after Dianetics. 3. TRIPLE FLOWS. 4. WITHHOLDS PULLED. 5. PTPs handled (Present Time Problems). 6. ARC BREAKS patched up. In short knowledge and skill above and beyond the training received on a new Dianet-ics Course is not to be expected. There are also things in Book One we no longer use such as Repeater Technique, looking for phrases to explain conditions. We use Dianetics as it was re-worked in the early 60s and as currently being pre-sented. If it isn't on the checksheet of the Dianetics Course, then we don't demand it. We do demand some skill with a meter and what a floating needle is. If a Dianetic pc gets in trouble we send him to Qual for a review. In this review, all Scientology skills (but no grades) can be done. In review he can get in his rudiments, etc. It is very worthy of note that in Reviewing Dianetics or in doing Dianetic auditing one can run out bad sessions as an auditor or pc by using R-3-R on auditing sessions or therapy.

It is a very easy job providing the Case Supervisor knows his Standard Dianetics ex-actly and completely. Any time there is the most minute or flagrant departure from exact assessment or exact R-3-R, there will be a breakdown of the results. It is quite a tribute to the tech that this is true. And it is true. Doing C/S recently on a very great many Dianetic cases audited by relatively untrained auditors the following emerged in letters ten feet high. 1. Where the auditor followed the exact procedure without deviation the results were uni-formly excellent. 2. Where the auditor deviated from the exact procedure the results were poor or bad. There are many, many ways an auditor can deviate from exact procedure. There is only one exact procedure. As a result of doing this C/S work, I would, if I were doing Dianetic C/Sing, refuse to let an auditor audit until he had been through his checksheet 3 times. This would save nearly all the work required of a Case Supervisor. When the auditor is in a fumbly state regarding the procedure and has not drilled it un-til he could do it with the house caving in, the preclear does not get good results. That is really all there is to it. If the auditor simply observes the Auditor's Code, handles TRs and the meter fairly well and does the assessments and R-3-R exactly as laid out, the results will be found to be astonishingly good, even miraculous. To correct a bad session the normal action of the C/S is to order the offbeat actions done correctly. EXAMPLE A. Auditor assessed by interest only, not by read and the session bogged down.

Pc was put through each incident on the chain only once and finally bogged. C/S ac-tion, order the whole chain rerun so that pc has been through each one twice and the earliest one found erased. D. A basic was found and auditor told it was erasing but sent pc earlier but pc could find nothing so left it. C/S orders the basic erased. E. Auditor tells pc he won't run it because it \"isn't an engram\". C/S action, order auditor to retrain on Auditor's Code and do Invalidation and Evaluation in clay. Orders pc to an Scn Review, Green Form. F. Pc very nattery to auditor. C/S orders pc to Scn Review \"and be sure to pull all with-holds\". G. C/S finds his orders to complete a chain left undone with a high TA were not done – folder mislaid or pc not routed. Pc has become ill. Order the pc to medical treatment and the chain completed. You see how it is. Each time the auditor violated normal simple procedure, the C/S or-ders that the normal simple procedure be completed either by first giving pc an Scn Green Form in Qual and then completing the Standard Dianetics action or, omitting Qual (when pc not out-rud), just getting the real standard action done. This is really all there is to Case Supervising Dianetic Case Folders. The more you try to do something else than the above the further the case will go wrong. The Dianetic Auditor does not have to know how to do Green Forms or rudiments and these are not done in Standard Dianetics sessions. When they have to be done you get a Sci-entology Auditor to do them. It is a serious error to mix up Dianetics and Scientology in the same session – that is to say, to do ruds, rehab overruns, etc, etc. The potential errors of out-ruds and all the rest are present of course in any Dianetics session, but do not happen when exact Dianetic procedure is used. When they do happen you send the pc to an Scn Review Auditor. This is Case Supervision, Dianetics. It has been fully worked out by my Case Super-vising a great many Dianetic sessions to launch this new view of Dianetics. And the above is what I found. It drives home also the necessity of training Dianetic auditors as precision technolo-gists and the risk of letting people audit before they are fully grooved in on exactly what's done in a Dianetic session.

If you are a Scientology as well as a Dianetic auditor, you may be tempted to at once shift into Scientology. That can also be fatal. If no Qual Div is nearby and you are a Scientology auditor also and if no other Scien-tology auditor is around to give the review only then could you attempt a \"Green Form\" which is used in Qual Divisions in orgs. The way to do that is end the Dianetic session, take a break and begin the Scientology Review Session. But this is not good. It is best to send the pc to Qual and insist Qual actually handles.

If a student has no gains himself he is unlikely to be able to audit well. In HGCs, given Standard Dianetic Auditing, anything up to 25% of the pcs will not re-solve on Standard Dianetics alone. The reason for this is that in Standard Dianetics one audits without \"Rudiments\". Thus you get the pc coming in with life ARC Breaks, Present Time Problems and Missed With-holds. The answer is to send the preclear to a Scientology Review for a \"Green Form\" (GF). If the person comes back to Standard Dianetic Auditing and still has a hard time of it or gives the auditor a hard time or gets sick, send the person back to a Scientology Review with this instruction: \"Give Green Form to F/N and then assess No. 40 GF and handle.\" The Class VIII will take it from there. This should reduce course failures and HGC case failures down to the very small per-centage of those who are there for other reasons than learning or receiving auditing. Thus, unless the cases are handled these percentages of 20% and 25% may occur. Students don't have cases. But failed students do. OT CASES Handling the OT Case can be very tricky. Any one of these can give the auditor trou-ble. But it is usually nothing much to handle unless the OT is what we call a \"False III\". This is somebody who gaily went up the grades without doing them. You don't have to know more about it than that. Thus if a person who is OT is giving trouble being audited on Dianetics it's better to turn him or her over to a Class VIII for routine handling on Scientology.

One does the following: On any new pc a Dianetics C/S 12 is ordered. If this was successful (almost always is) a Dianetics C/S 2 is ordered. If this is successful one does Dianetics C/S 3 which consists of \"Reassess for longest read. If an item is found which also has pc's interest, R3R. If no item, add to list, take longest read.

There is very little to Dianetic C/S work. The Case Supervisor must be a Hubbard Dianetic Counsellor. There is no substitute for that. One who isn't would hopelessly snarl up real HDCs or HDGs or students aspiring to those certs. The Dianetic C/S should really be an HDG and a Class VIII. Even so he has to keep these techs completely separate. One never asks a Dianetic auditor in a Dianetic session to do anything except Stan-dard Dianetics. There are no other actions. The C/S, in correcting an auditor, should do it positively and refer to the Dianetic HCOB. Negative criticism, I have found, undermines auditors. One can as easily say the same thing in a positive way. Instead of, \"You broke the Auditor's Code,\" one can as easily say, \"Pcs must be rested before session.

One isn't, in Dianetics C/S, torturously laboring to solve some difficult case. Therefore there are only four possible actions for a Dianetics C/S to take: A. The case that makes gains is given more Dianetics. B. The case that has had all possible Dianetic gain (and that is considerable, ranging from 10 to 50 hours or more) is sent on to Scientology. C. The case that makes no gain due to case \"oddity\" is sent to a Scientology review. D. The session that is non-standard in auditing requires the pc be sent to Scientology review. It is the fantastic fact that the pc will only get Dianetic wins when receiving Standard Dianetics. Non-Standardness only once in a hundred will give a case gain and that is a fluke. The Case Supervisor must have good subjective and objective reality on this fact. He must therefore be the ultimate in dictatorial martinet precision in requiring standard auditing and assigning standard C/Ses. There are two types of cases only that come up. 1 .

Such a case is \"solved\" by now being sent to Review, now being sent to Dianetics, back and forth. In D above, the pc who gets a non-standard session and is bogged at the Examiner's is simply given a Scientology Green Form to F/N. He/she is then returned to Dianetic auditing. This is a very usual, easy action. In C above, the \"oddity\" case is easily recognizable in the folder. The oddity consists mainly of getting Dianetic auditing, getting sick. Or in getting auditing but not being able to follow good standard commands. Such a case also has a history of being ill. This case also can't make any real headway in study and messes up pcs as an auditor and can't seem to do standard auditing.

No. 40 GF is the \"7 Resistive Cases\". When the Scientology auditor has done the item found, the C/S then picks the next in line on the No. 40 GF list, then the next and, if any, the next and orders these handled too. This assessment list usually finds \"one in\". But in addition to //// there were others that read ///X, //X and /X. these are also handled. All by Standard Tech of course. And in dwindling order of reads. Then the C/S sends the pc back to Dianetic Auditing for routine assessments and R3R.

Lucky is the C/S who has a fine Class VIII. When he doesn't have he orders only one action done be-tween C/Ses and watches like a hawk.

These \"insane\" pcs are most often simple cases of medically ill people – gallstones, malnutrition, deficiencies in certain vitamins, broken backs – the usual. To undertake to audit an \"insane\" pc to sanity without complete attention to the above paragraphs is adventurous in our experience. But with these things given attention, the \"in-sane\" pc often responds amazingly. But do not be surprised to find that the \"insane\" pc turns into a C type as he comes up the scale. The main trouble with the \"insane\" is that too many people around them are com-pletely devoted to making them even more insane and they almost never respond to any treatment, medical or Dianetic, while kept in their same environment associating with the same people. Also we could say that \"Hell hath no fury to match that of a cured psychotic's associ-ates\". Usually the real crazy one is an associate, not the \"insane\" one.

The Examiner's Report to see if the pc thought it was okay and if the Examiner's TA, needle and Indicator observation is all right. 2. The pre-session C/S to see what was previously ordered done. 3. The session to see if the C/S was done. 4. The 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 sequence and ABCD to see if it is Standard. I seldom read text if the session was okay at Examiner's unless the session did not go well. 5. The F/N, Cog and GIs or VGIs at chain and session ends. If all that is okay I give it a \"well done\". If it isn't all okay I look for the 1, 2, 3, etc. that was not followed by an ABCD but by a new 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. instead. I try to find where the session went off Standard and point out the Standard actions that should have been done. If the pc came out of it okay, I order more Dianetic auditing. If the pc didn't, I send the pc to Review. If it had lots of ABCDs and ground to a high TA session end I check to see if the audi-tor asked for an earlier beginning.

The value of a C/S whether Dianetic or Scientology depends on his unfailing adher-ence to Standard actions. A C/S that dreams things up to try to \"solve a case\" by squirrel processes is worse than no Case Supervisor at all. The gain of cases depends on the Standard, unswerving adherence to Standard Dianet-ics, to C/Sing in complete standardness and a Scientology Review auditor who really is a flawless Standard Tech man. The result is the result of a team. To that team one also adds the Admin team of the rest of the group doing their jobs. Given all that, one can straighten up whole population areas and activities and get the job done on the goal lines of Well and Happy Human Beings and a Well and Happy Society both with greatly increased survival potential. C/Sing is a happy job itself. And blessed is a C/S who has good standard HDCs and good Review auditors on his lines and a good HDG making new good HDCs and a good AO somewhere making good new VIIIs, all backed with orgs whose staffs know their Org Exec Course and policy. The C/S's job only becomes unhappy and impossible when the auditors are non-standard or the Admin people never heard of lines or policy and he himself departs from the straight and narrow of Standard Dianetics and Standard Tech. The purpose of Dianetics can be accomplished smoothly and easily only if the above are taken into account.

And then the pc is sent back for more New Era Dianetics. This is what is meant by interplaying New Era Dianetics with Scientology reviews for a C type case. You will just be amazed at the eventual result in the pc. Really a cracked case, man! ____________________ Very sick pcs are sent directly to a medico of course. And New Era Dianetics auditing is given along with medical treatment to get the pc off stuck points. This is all covered in HCOBs on medical uses of Dianetics and includes Touch Assists. ____________________ The \"insane\" pc is given absolute rest, a secure environment and any needful medical treatment (but never shock or surgery of the brain or nerves, of course, since that's only de-personalization treatment). When in better physical health the \"insane\" pc is given just routine New Era Dianetics. But the sessions must be flubless and thoroughly within the Auditor's Code as the \"insane\" can't stand up to any goofs or overwhelm. These \"insane\" pcs are most often simple cases of medically ill people – gallstones, malnutrition, deficiencies in certain vitamins, broken backs – the usual. To undertake to audit an \"insane\" pc to sanity without complete attention to the above paragraphs is adventurous in our experience. But with these things given attention, the \"in-sane\" pc often responds amazingly. But do not be surprised to find that the \"insane\" pc turns into a C type as he comes up the scale. The main trouble with the \"insane\" is that too many people around them are com-pletely devoted to making them even more insane and they almost never respond to any treatment, medical or Dianetic, while kept in their same environment associating with the same people. Also we could say that \"Hell hath no fury to match that of a cured psychotic's associ-ates.\" Usually the real crazy one is an associate, not the \"insane\" one.

The Examiner's Report to see if the pc thought it was okay and if the Examiner's TA, needle and indicator observation is all right. 2. The presession C/S to see what was previously ordered done. 3. The session to see if the C/S was done. 4. The 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 sequence and A-EYE to see if it is standard. I seldom read text if the session was okay at Examiner's unless the session did not go well. 5. The F/N, ... postulate and GIs or VGIs (erasure of the chain) and GIs at session end. If all that is okay I give it a \"well done.\" If it isn't all okay I look for the 1, 2, 3 etc. that was not followed by an ABC but by a new 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. instead. I try to find where the session went off standard and point out the standard actions that should have been done. If the pc came out of it okay, I order more New Era Dianetics auditing. If the pc didn't, I send the pc to a Scientology auditor. If it had lots of DEFs and ground to a high TA session end I check to see if the auditor asked for an earlier beginning. If the Dianetics folder is getting fat and the session was unsuccessful I look for a pos-sible C type pc and handle accordingly. If the pc is reported ill, I order medical, an assist and treat the pc thereafter as a C type. The value of a C/S, whether New Era Dianetics or Scientology, depends on his unfail-ing adherence to standard actions. A C/S that dreams things up to try to \"solve a case\" by squirrel processes is worse than no Case Supervisor at all. The gain of cases depends on the standard, unswerving adherence to New Era Dianet-ics, to C/Sing in complete standardness and a Scientology auditor who really is a flawless standard tech man. The result is the result of a team. To that team one also adds the admin team of the rest of the group doing their jobs. Given all that, one can straighten up whole population areas and activities and get the job done on the goal lines of well and happy human beings and a well and happy society both with greatly increased survival potential. C/Sing is a happy job itself. And blessed is a C/S who has good standard New Era Dianetics auditors and good Scientology auditors on his lines and a good New Era Dianetics Course Supervisor making new good New Era Dianetics auditors and a good AO somewhere making good new VIIIs, all backed with orgs whose staffs know their Org Exec Course and policy."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"HOW TO CASE SUPERVISE DIANETICS FOLDERS5 HCOB 28.6.69RA DIANETIC CS COURSE 63 17.11.12 The C/S's job only becomes unhappy and impossible when the auditors are nonstan-dard or the admin people never heard of lines or policy and he himself departs from the straight and narrow of New Era Dianetics and standard tech.

New Era Dianetics Series 2R NEW ERA DIANETICS FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE As a person goes through life and lifetimes he collides with secondaries, losses, deaths of those he is closely connected with, injuries, accidents, illnesses, operations and emotional stresses. These of course are not all, but cover the main complaints and symptoms of pcs. Dianetics lends itself to handle the current, past and occasional complaints and symp-toms as above. It achieves its results by addressing and handling the spirit and is in no way to be con-fused with medical or other practices. The end phenomena of Dianetic auditing is a well and happy pc. These steps as laid out below if all done and with precision will give just that. NEW ERA DIANETICS FULL PROGRAM OUTLINE: The actions of the New Era Dianetics full program are to be run in the order they are given. The product is a well and happy pc and this is the direction you go, step by step to achieve that product. ACTION ONE: ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET This sheet is thoroughly filled out with the pc on the meter. It gives you the pc's his-tory, what drugs and alcohol he has taken in this lifetime, illnesses, operations, present physical conditions, mental treatment, medicines and perception difficulties. (Ref: HCOB 24 June 1978R New Era Dianetics Series 5R, ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET). At this point the data is taken only. Do not attempt to handle any of the items on this step. (Ref: HCOB 24 June 1978R NED Series 5R). ACTION TWO: HANDLE ANY PTSNESS"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 2 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE DIANETIC CS COURSE 70 17.11.12 It must be noted that you have to handle any PTSness before you can begin any audit-ing. Pcs who are PTS will not hold their gain. Therefore any PTSness must be handled before auditing is begun. (Ref: HCOB 10 Aug 73 PTS HANDLING, HCOB 20 Apr 72 SUP-PRESSED PCs AND PTS TECH, HCOB 9 Dec 71RC PTS RD). ACTION THREE: OBJECTIVE ARC I have added a new process to be done before the full battery of Objective Processes. It is called Objective ARC. This is the first process to be done on a pc and will bring a person up to present time. (Ref: Objective ARC is covered in HCOB 19 Jun 1978, New Era Dianetics Series 3, OBJECTIVE ARC). ACTION FOUR: SWEAT PROGRAM A Sweat Program will be necessary if the person has taken LSD or Angel Dust. It may also be indicated when a person has been subjected to exposure to toxic substances which have lodged in the tissue and fat of the body. In future times psychiatrists or others of ill repute may develop other compounds such as LSD which lodge in the sys-tems; a Sweat Program may be indicated in these. (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION FIVE: OBJECTIVES A battery of Objectives is done on this step. This consists of the following Objective Processes properly and fully done to their complete EP for each process: CCH 1-10, SCS on an Object and SCS (Note: SOP 8C and Op Pro By Dup are run on a later step.) (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION SIX: HARD TR COURSE On this course, the preclear will thoroughly do TRs 0-9. (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING, HCOB 16 Aug 71R, TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED, HCOB 7 May 68, UPPER INDOC TRs, BPL 18 Sep 78 New Era Dianetics Hard TRs Course). ACTION SEVEN: CS-1 Before we can even begin a pc on Dianetics we have to indoctrinate him into what Dianetics is and what is expected of him as a pc. This is standardly and effectively accomplished by using the Standard Dianetics CS-1, HCOB 9 Jul 78R, DIANETIC CS-1. ACTION EIGHT: DRUG RUNDOWN QUAD It has been proven time and time again that until you audit out, each by name, the drugs, alcohol and medicine a person has taken, he does not make good case gain."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 3 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE DIANETIC CS COURSE 71 17.11.12 A person who has been on drugs, alcohol or medicine seldom runs any other type of engram, seldom goes backtrack well, and is subject to somatic, emotional and percep-tic shut-offs, making any other type of Dianetic or Scientology auditing a difficult ac-tivity. Therefore if drugs, medicine or alcohol, or individual names of them read on the meter on the Original Assessment Sheet, they are handled first and foremost . (Note: You do not ask the pc for whole track drugs. You want only drugs, medicine or alcohol he has taken in this lifetime.) In New Era Dianetics the Drug Rundown has five parts: 1) The Original Assessment in which the names of drugs, medicines or alcohol the pc has taken in this lifetime are obtained, 2) The running of each reading drug, medicine or alcohol Narrative R3RA Quad, 3) The preassessment of each of these and the running by R3RA Quad of the items, 4) The prior assessment to drugs or alcohol for each, 5) The final step of bring-ing the pc fully into PT and stabilizing him by the running of further Objectives, SOP 8C and Op Pro By Dup. 1. The Original Assessment This has already been done as Action One. It may be necessary to get the preclear to add to the list and it is highly possible that he has taken more types of drugs in this lifetime than he remembered at the time the Original Assessment was done. You have to have all drugs, medicines and alcohol by their actual names as known to the pc. It is not enough to use an item like \"drugs,\" \"alcohol\" or \"medicine\" as you will get no-where. They have to be \"heroin,\" or \"penicillin\" or \"bourbon.\" 2. Narrative Handling of Drugs Before any other handling, the pc runs out each of the reading drugs, medicines or al-cohol's Narrative R3RA Quad. This is done first. 3. The Preassessment New Era Dianetics handling for drugs includes the use of the Preassessment List. This is a new procedure on the handling and running of Dianetics. Previous to this you would ask the pc for attitudes, emotions, sensations and pains connected with an item. Instead the preassessment is done. It ensures that every somatic is gotten off in con-nection with whatever you are handling. (Ref: HCOB 18 Jun 78R New Era Dianetics Series 4R, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM). Each item found by preassessment is run by R3RA Quad as soon as the running item is found in every case. Then one continues with further preassessment until all possible drugs, medicines and alcohols are fully handled R3RA Quad."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 4 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE DIANETIC CS COURSE 72 17.11.12 4. The Prior Assessment After all reading drugs, medicines and alcohols have been preassessed and run out R3RA Quad, the prior assessment to drugs or alcohol is done. This step locates and runs out all the feelings, attitudes, misemotions, pains, etc. the pc had prior to first tak-ing each drug, medicine or alcohol. (Ref: HCOB 15 Jul 71RA III, Rev 27 Jun 78 New Era Dianetics Series 9R, C/S Series 48RB, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION EIGHT-A: 5. The Final Step – More Objectives As a final step, the pc is brought fully into present time with further Objectives: SOP 8C and then Op Pro By Dup, each run to its complete EP. This completes the Dianetic Drug Rundown. ACTION NINE: RELIEF RUNDOWN Where the Original Assessment Sheet has shown losses by death or other severe changes in a person's life such as losses of position or pets or objects it will be found that the person's life changed for the worse at that point. The auditor spots these points of change either on the Original Assessment Sheet or by asking the preclear. These points are then handled with New Era Dianetics procedure. It will be found that when all such great changes in a person's life have been handled the person will experience a considerable relief about life. (Ref: HCOB 3 July 1978R, NED Series 10R). ACTION TEN: DIANETIC REMEDIES – OPTIONAL The Picture and Masses Remedy and the Past Life Remedy are optional and are only done when you run into trouble. They are run after the Drug Rundown because unhan-dled drugs are the cause of most of that trouble. The Picture and Masses Remedy (Ref: HCOB 22 Jul 69 HIGH TA ASSESSMENT HCOB 24 Jul 78 DIANETIC REMEDIES) Past Life Remedy (Ref: HCOB 16 Jan 75 PAST LIFE REMEDY HCOB 24 Jul 78 DIANETIC REMEDIES) ACTION ELEVEN: COMPLETE HANDLING ON THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET You have handled all drugs, alcohol and medicine and all losses the pc has had fully and completely. The pc is now set up to go ahead with handling the rest of his com-plaints and symptoms."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 5 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE DIANETIC CS COURSE 73 17.11.12 The full procedure of handling the remainder of this Original Assessment Sheet is laid out in full in HCOB 28 July 71RA Rev 25 June 78 New Era Dianetics Series 8R DIANETICS, BE-GINNING A PC ON and HCOB 18 June 78R New Era Dianetics Series 4R ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM. Follow these issues exactly. ACTION TWELVE: REASSESSMENT OF THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET When all Original Assessment Sheet items are handled as above, the Original Assess-ment Sheet is reassessed. The pc's memory will have improved if you've done a good job of auditing so far and his targets in processing will have changed. So we reassess the Original Assessment Sheet and handle any now reading area. (Ref: HCOB 4 Jul 78R New Era Dianetics Series 12R, SECOND ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT) . ACTION THIRTEEN: DIANETIC STUDENT RESCUE INTENSIVE This is an optional step to be taken if your pc is having any trouble with study. It takes up and handles any and all somatics connected with the subject of study. A Student Rescue Intensive is not run until the pc has been completed up to ACTION ELEVEN as it would interrupt his program because drugs, if he has taken any, are a probable contributory cause to being unable to study. Also the Dianetic Student Res-cue Intensive is not a substitute for proper Word Clearing of Dianetic, Scientology and earlier courses and training. It does however make the latter much more effective. (Ref: HCOB 2 Jul 78 New Era Dianetics Series 11, DIANETIC STUDENT RESCUE INTENSIVE). ACTION FOURTEEN: PREPARED ASSESSMENT FORM This is an early step I developed in Dianetics which fell into disuse and abandonment. However it can produce some amazing results and so is being put back as a standard step in the running of Dianetics. It is done by assessing a prepared list of types of somatics and fully handling each one using New Era Dianetics. When you have an F/Ning list and the pc is VGIs it is the end of this step. The procedure and list is covered on HCOB 1 Jul 78 New Era Dianetics Series 13, DIANETICS PREPARED ASSESSMENT RUNDOWN. ACTION FIFTEEN: DISABILITY RUNDOWN This rundown handles anything the pc considers a disability; mental, physical or oth-erwise. It handles everything from being too short to not being able to speak Arabic or not wanting to go to parties. It takes each disability and handles it with R3RA. (Ref: HCOB 29 June 78 New Era Dianetics Series 14, DISABILITY RUNDOWN). ACTION SIXTEEN: IDENTITY RUNDOWN"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 6 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE DIANETIC CS COURSE 74 17.11.12 We have never before had a Dianetic process specifically directed to getting a pc into valence. The Identity Rundown now handles that. It specifically takes up and handles valences the pc may be in by using the New Era Dianetics tech. (Ref: HCOB 20 Jun 78 New Era Dianetics Series 15, IDENTITY RUNDOWN). ACTION SEVENTEEN: AUDITING OUT SESSIONS – OPTIONAL Now and then it is necessary to audit out an auditing session or all auditing. One does this by R3RA, running the incident narrative to erasure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly or, if all auditing, handling it session by session as a chain. (Ref: HCOB 23 May 69 AUDITING OUT SESSIONS HCOB 26 Jun 78RA II NED Series 6RA; ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS HCOB 18 Jun 78R NED Series 4R; ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM). IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE If you run into any trouble on these Dianetic steps, use the L3RF and handle all read-ing items to EP. Or go to Cramming on Dianetics. (Ref: HCOB 11 April 71RC L3RF). SUMMARY Completing all the above steps thoroughly and completely ensuring that all chains are run to full end phenomena is the only way you will have a well and happy pc. L.

In C/Sing hundreds of Dianetics sessions I found that the auditor's reports on failed sessions did not include any reason for the failure. In researching this I found that only certain auditors were failing. Thus, it was not a technical failure but an auditor failure. These folders must therefore contain false reports or no reports on what had happened. For all that I could see, as the Case Supervisor, New Dianetics tech was failing on some cases. Further investigation disclosed that things had gone on in those sessions which were non-standard but not reported. In developing this I discovered the golden rule: When you have a failed session you ask the pc what the auditor did. In this way you discover an amazing array of flagrant outnesses. With these you can retrain the auditor and he or she will then win every time. We have compiled a large array of samples of outnesses found, any one of which would have made a session fail or cause a Dianetics student not to obtain results. The variety can be infinite in number but the chief one is Failing to give the next command. The new auditor does not realize how serious it is to flub a command. The pc is \"down the track\" and not in present time. He looks like he is there. When he fails to get the next command or gets a wrong command he becomes alarmed, comes into Pre-sent Time as best he can and the auditor loses control. Anytime a pc is made to wait, whether by a wrong command or no command or an auditor writing too much on his work sheet, a Dianetic session crashes. The TA may go up or down, the chain messes up and the session fails."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"URGENT – IMPORTANT 2 HCOB 16.7.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 76 17.11.12 Other additives or outnesses mess things up. An auditor instead of auditing talking about other pcs or his own case, an auditor halting to look up a word for himself, a thousand such actions can, any one, wreck a session. Auditing is very fast and very exact. It is a business-like activity. It is a technical preciseness. When that is violated one gets failed sessions. ____________________ An auditor-student may think he knows his commands. When he is auditing a doll he can do it. When confronted by a live pc, he needs to know the commands so well that pc ran-domity does not throw him off the right command. I therefore developed four new Dianetic TRs. They are TR 101, 102, 103 and 104. ____________________ When a student fails to get a good result we (1) ask the pc what he did, (2) send the student back to training, (3) send the pc to Review for a Green Form to F/N and No. 40 GF and handle all reading No. 40 GF items, (4) send the student to Review for a GF to F/N and a No. 40 GF and handle all reads and three-way Failed Help, three-way Help brackets, (5) get the student corrected on what we learned he did wrong from the pc and (6) get the student drilled on TRs 101, 102, 103 and 104. We tolerate no flubbed sessions. If a pc suffers because of a flub, we boost him way up with Review as a case. If a student flubs we handle him as a case and retrain. ____________________ All this has been subjected to a lot of research and proof. And what do you know!

Case Supervision is done against the thoroughness and exactness of technical applica-tion. To give an auditor a well done when he has made a technical flub (despite a good re-sult on the pc) is to hang the auditor with a win. The next time he does the same thing he is liable to get a resounding lose. In looking over folders one C/Ses against Standardness of application. The tech takes care of the rest. For a long time, auditing was \"what you could get away with\". It no longer is. It is the act of holding a standard. Only in that way does one get 100% wins. In assigning what is to be done with a pc or pre-OT, one seeks to keep the case pro-gressing or winning. The Case Supervisor's action is to get the case audited as long as possible! Any im-pulse to get the case off one's lines will be a losing one. Cases progress in exact ratio to the amount of charge gotten off. They do not progress by magic buttons designed just for that case. The \"sudden\" big wins are the result of the accumulated effect of getting charge off. It is of course charge of a certain type and that type is contained in the Case Supervi-sor's book, in the mechanics of Dianetics and Scientology. Early on (using Standard Tech) the worse off (more shallow) the case is, the faster it F/Ns. The pc is reaching no depth. An example is someone who cannot get into or run past lives. They F/N almost at once on any process. This does not mean they are at once \"clear\" or released. It means they are like a coiled spring. When you touch them something flies off. The Case Supervisor on such a case works hard to keep them running Dianetics. The task is finding something to audit, not to complete pcs."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE \"ART” OF CASE SUPERVISION 2 HCOB 29.7.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 78 17.11.12 When the Dianetics Grade was missed, people F/Ned their way straight on up to OT VI, still wondering where their headache came from. This doesn't mean that in Scientology you by-pass F/Ns. It means that the Case Super-visor prepares the case. The finance statistic of orgs is assisted by attempts to stretch out auditing and is harmed by fast brush-off \"completions\". The reputation of the org is also harmed because the field fills up with shallowly run partially solved cases. Tech is so fast today that only now can a Case Supervisor work at attempting to pro-long a pc in auditing. The statistic of an HGC should be the number of successful auditing hours delivered, not the number of pcs completed. Therefore the Case Supervisor is alert to the inability or ability of a pc or pre-OT to go backtrack, to the number of engrams the pc runs per chain before erasure, to the number of commands given before F/N on a Scientology process. And by this he can gauge how ardu-ously the case must be worked on. For example, on a child, a bruised finger yesterday run as an engram F/Ns. In Scien-tology any grade command will also F/N on clearing it. End result, no real case improvement. But if you keep at it and at it and at it, gradually gradually the case runs deeper and deeper into the past and confronts heavier and heavier incidents. Then, as it goes along, the case runs faster and faster, requiring far more \"commands per unit of time in session\". Finally the case begins to blow by inspection and, ideally, has what is known as a \"Clear Cognition\". Scientology, dealing with the thetan and considerations, is now able to function with total bite. Power and R6EW really get the pc somewhere. The Clear and OT sections make him fly. And you have a real OT. That is the general Case Supervisor plan. As the number of hours in actual auditing are now under 50 for audited cases and un-der another 50 for solo, there is no use at all trying to solve a case fast."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE \"ART” OF CASE SUPERVISION 3 HCOB 29.7.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 79 17.11.12 Solve it standardly.

Therefore it is rou-tine for the Case Supervisor to have the pc asked what the Auditor did. It is usually surpris-ing. It will be one of the first four listed above. It requires a retrain. The next four are also auditor flubs but are detectable if the Case Supervisor reads the worksheets of the session. Therefore the Case Supervisor must know 5, 6, 7 and 8 above very well indeed and be able to look for them. In all of these the TA goes high or very low and the session ends up as a bust. You can easily see 5. The pc is still on the same chain but begins to grind ABCD ABCD ABCD ABCD ABCD, the TA goes way up or down below 2 and the auditor com-mand \"Is there an earlier beginning?\" is spectacularly absent. So the C/S tells the next auditor to get the earlier beginning of the same incident and it will F/N, Erase and get VGIs. 6 is very easy for the C/S to spot. The pc has been given ABCD ABCD ABCD ABCD ABCD etc and has been asked for an earlier beginning to the same incident but hasn't been asked for an earlier incident. So the C/S tells the next auditor to get an earlier incident. 7 is also easy for a C/S to detect from the worksheet of the session. Before the pc got into another chain by being forced to go earlier below basic, the TA went to a normal range, there may even be a cognition noted. The auditor missed the potential F/N by just not putting the pc through the basic again ABCD. Also the pc protested or had trouble when the auditor tried to go \"earlier than basic\" and also may mention another somatic. In 8, Misassessment, you can tell just by looking at the item that it is multiple such as \"A burning pain in my hair and a feeling of tension on my hand\"; that it is narrative \"getting my feet wet\" (where's the feeling in that????); or after the fact of the engram \"dizziness after a car wreck\". A real classic would be \"a stomach ache when I was thrown from a horse\". The C/S hardly has to look at the end of the session to know it will be no erasure, high or low TA and Bad Indicators at the Examiner. As auditors who do these last four things have their basic definitions madly out (such as \"I never did understand what a somatic was\") and as in the first four the approach to the pc, TRs and additives need ironing out, the C/S sends the auditor for retrain. From the C/S point of view (and fact) the technology applied gets uniform good re-sults. Thus the C/S never gets reasonable. The auditor will on retrain settle down. 100% sessions will occur regularly when he really can audit.

The pc has a good looking session yet complains to the Examiner. That is to say VGIs F/N Cog at session end, but sour grapes ten minutes later at the Examiner's. A pc who gets sad at session end and is or has been sad a long time and is sad and moping or despondent is, of course, suffering from an ARC Brk and is being audited over one and probably has had it for long duration. The proper C/S action is \"To Review, GF to F/N. Check ARC Brk Long Duration (LD).\" This last is done with Itsa earlier Itsa and ARCU CDEI by the auditor. The pc who is being audited over a PTP won't be making any gains. They quickly evaporate. The C/S orders \"To Review. GF to F/N.

Then check and pull all withholds and check if the pc has been audited over withholds.\" PHYSICALLY ILL PCS When a pc is ill or has a history of illness you get him/her medical attention and apply HCO B 24 July 69 which requires listing all somatics, etc in the area and running them all by R3R. When a pc gets ill after auditing but the sessions look alright, you can be pretty sure that the pc is being audited over out ruds so a C/S orders \"To Review. GF to F/N. Assess GF 40 and handle any out ruds found in that assessment first.\" SPECIAL CASES There may be some special versions of out ruds but they are all one variety or another of out rud.

This also operated as a withhold in session. It was not detectable in the worksheets except that the pc became ill. It came out while flying ruds in a Review session. But generally pcs don't act up in sessions if the auditing is straightforward and many get better even when audited over all kinds of out ruds. When a C/S begins to be mystified concerning some pc, why betterment isn't occur-ring – why the pc's manifestations and remarks never change – or the pc becomes ill, then only four things need to be done. And all four should be ordered by the C/S. 1. Medical exam and any treatment. 2. Review to straighten up all out ruds. 3. Dianetic auditing listing all somatics, etc in area and R3R on all those that read. And when the pc has markedly recovered: 4. Fly a rud, GF 40 and handle every item that reads fully. And whether it reads or not treat the case as Out of Valence and run LX 3, LX 2, LX 1, each item that reads twice 3-way recall, 3-way secondary or engram. You finish up the two or more slash items of LX 3. Then finish LX 2, then LX 1. Somewhere along the line the pc will change markedly before the auditor's eyes, go into his own valence and that's as far as you go with LX lists. The use of GF 40 is not restricted only to sick pcs. One gives any pc whose folder gets the least bit fat the GF 40 routine and assumes he's out of valence whether it reads or not and then sends the pc back to Dianetics. HEALTH FORMS There is one other flub a bit maddening to a C/S. When the C/S says \"Assess Existing lists or add\" and the auditor says no items, it is quite often an auditor flub, a special kind of 8 above – misassessment. One green auditor took 3 pcs in a row and could find no item, concluding that each of the 3 pcs was done with Dianetics! It turned out that the auditor's TR 1 was so bad the pcs couldn't hear her!

The pc can also be sent to the Examiner to be asked if there is anything not handled. The pc may give an area of interest.

These are the only reasons chains do not erase and the session does not complete with very good indicators. The first eight come under the head of auditing skill or knowledge. They are listed in order of frequency: 1. Auditor comm lag (lack of speed in giving commands). 2. Flubbed commands in which the commands are used incorrectly. 3. TRs out, either being inaudible or overwhelming or TR 4 not handled. 4. Auditor additives. 5. Failure to call for an earlier beginning of the incident when the pc can find no earlier incident – results in grinding and high TA. 6. Failure to call for an earlier incident when there is one. 7. Demanding pc goes earlier when the last incident was basic, making pc jump into an-other chain. 8. Misassessment. (Selecting a narrative item and running it by regular R3RA instead of by Narrative R3RA. Or choosing a multiple item or an after the fact item to run. Or taking an item that doesn't read or in which the pc has no interest.) 9. Pc has out rudiments. ____________________ Note that the first four are beyond the view of the Case Supervisor.

Dianetics is a very simple, precise procedure. The major errors are (a) misassessment (inability to use a meter usually but out TRs can do it) (b) taking narrative somatics and running them (c) forcing a pc toward \"earlier incident\" when it required \"earlier beginning\" making the pc jump chains (d) fumbling commands (e) out TRs. An auditor's poor TRs and corny errors such as above will prevent Dianetic results. But the Standard Dianetic auditing is so simple that it demonstrates cleanly whether the person can audit or not. This is not true of Scientology auditing particularly VI, VII and VIII. Here the proce-dure is more complex. The errors of the auditor are obscured in the possibility of a wrong C/S or a complex pc. Thus whether the auditor can audit or not, just as an auditor, is obscured. Thus, with the auditor as a variable factor, the tech can look variable. Therefore you can lay down this rule as truth and it will be truth until the end of time: If a IV, V, VI, VII or VIII cannot produce invariably excellent results his basic audit-ing is deficient but obscured by the complexity of material. Therefore it is vital that an auditor be a proven result-getting Standard Dianetic auditor before any result can be expected of him in his/her Scientology auditing."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CASE SUPERVISION AUDITING AND RESULTS 2 HCOB 15.11.69 I DIANETIC CS COURSE 94 17.11.12 We have now had several dark mysteries cleared up on this subject with many exam-ples. For instance one auditor who had been thought a competent VI and had been \"auditing\" for years was found to be getting too many failed pcs; he was trained up as a Standard Dianetic auditor and on his first sessions it was found that he could not produce Standard Dianetic results; he was vigorously groomed on his TRs which were wildly out and always had been and made to do the very exact business-like procedure of Standard Dianetics. He then got excellent Standard Dianetic results session after session on his pc and could be des-ignated as a very good Dianetic auditor. He was briefly retreaded on his Scientology materials and at once could get terrific results with upper level Scientology. From this we can state without any fear of contradiction by your future experience that: An VIII who is not a proven Standard Dianetic auditor as well is not dependable as an auditor no matter who trained him. The practice of loosely certifying HDCs without total proof that they get excellent uni-form session results on Dianetic pcs can foul up the whole field and jeopardize the entire au-diting future of the student. To certify an HDC who doesn't get provenly excellent Standard Dianetic results is an act of treason against all that person's future pcs and all the rest of us. If tech is \"out\" in an area it will be because some of the auditors, whatever their class, are not capable of delivering simple Standard Dianetic sessions, regardless of the level at which they are auditing. And out tech will be compounded if the Case Supervisor is not also an excellent HDC for he won't know the errors for which to look. When you can really dig this and know it and get it in practice the bulk of out tech and \"failed pcs\" in an area will vanish. I know it is sometimes hard to achieve a simplicity as simple as Standard Dianetics but when it is done, tech worries from there on up are over. L.

Only change – [page 79] word \"arrived\" corrected to \"aimed\". Correction in this type style.) C/S Series 6 WHAT THE C/S IS DOING In Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health considerable stress is placed on the words and phrases in engrams. This is still functional. However as I did further research I found that (a) many pcs were unable to get the words in the engram and (b) the apparent force of the words was derived wholly from the pain, emotion, effort contained in the engram. In Standard Dianetics the words in an engram play no major role in the auditing. The use of the words to de-aberrate and concentration on phrases in engrams is valid but junior in force to the pain, misemotion, etc in the engram. Thus if you run out the force the words drop into insignificance. This is often how the pc gets cognitions: the words and meaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating. The pc can then think clearly again on a subject previously pinned down by the force. Get the force out and the words take care of themselves and need no special handling. The meaning of things plays a secondary role in processing to forces. Thetans find counter-forces objectionable. Almost all chronic (continual) somatics have their root in force of one kind or another. In that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesser degree, in-capability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetan's objection to force. This objection descends down to a wish to stop things. It goes below that into over-whelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves. LOW TAs The low TA is a symptom of an overwhelmed being. When a pc's TA goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy a process, too steep a gradient in applying processes or by rough TRs or invalidative auditing or auditing errors. A low TA means that the thetan has gone past a desire to stop things and is likely to behave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 2 C/S-SERIES 6 – HCOB 16.6.70 DIANETIC CS COURSE 96 17.11.12 HIGH TA Chronically high TAs mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so. However, all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to have a high TA. High TA is reflecting the force contained in the chain. An \"over-run\" means doing something too long that has engrams connected with it which means an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by life or au-diting. Hence Over-run. If this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed and one, in theory, would have a low TA. MENTAL MASSES Mental masses, forces, energy are the items being handled by the C/S on any pc. If the C/S loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets of sig-nificance. Engrams, secondaries, locks all add up to mental masses, forces, energies, time, which express themselves in countless different ways such as pain, misemotion, feelings, old percep-tions and a billion billion thought combinations buried in the masses as significances. A thetan can postulate or say or reason anything. Thus there is an infinity of signifi-cances. A thetan is natively capable of logical thought. This becomes muddied by out-points held in by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences. As the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up, the logic po-tential becomes reduced and illogical results occur. PC SEARCH The pc is continually searching for the significance of a mass or force – what is it, why is it. The C/S is easily led astray by this. All forces in the bank contain significances. All forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures of auditing. The search of the pc is for significance. The action of the C/S is reduction of forces. THE E-METER The E-Meter records what force is being discharged in every slash, fall and blowdown. The amount of TA per session is the C/S's index of gain."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 3 C/S-SERIES 6 – HCOB 16.6.70 DIANETIC CS COURSE 97 17.11.12 Note that a discharged process no longer gives TA and gives case gain. The amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up as cogni-tions. As the TA works off the case, then one has two indicators: 1. There is needle and TA action. 2. The pc cognites. One shows that force is coming off. Two shows that thought is releasing from force. BACKWARDS C/Sing If a C/S processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress. The needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is. Diving toward significance the C/S winds up shortening grades, looking for \"magic one-shot buttons\" and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the grades while levels remain loaded with force. RELIABLE INDICATORS When a pc gets no more TA action on Level I he will have made Level I and will know it. He will therefore attest to \"No problems\". The reliable indicators are TA action and cognitions while a level is still charged. Diminished TA action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has been reached. A feeling of freedom and expansion on a subject is expressed in a normal TA and a loose needle. The pc will now attest to an ability regained. F/N ABUSE To process only to F/N and even chop off the cognitions on a process abuses the indi-cator of the F/N. You can find many pcs who bitterly resent F/N indications. They have been: A. Not run on all the processes of a level; B. Still have force on the subject; C. Were chopped off before they could cognite. The ARC Break in this is unfinished cycle of action. The proper End Phenomena for a process is F/N Cognition VGIs. Now look at that carefully. That is the proper end phenomena of a process. It is not the end phenomena of a level or even of a type of process."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 4 C/S-SERIES 6 – HCOB 16.6.70 DIANETIC CS COURSE 98 17.11.12 Let us say there are 15 possible Scientology processes for orienting a pc in his present location. To run one of these 15 and say, \"F/N that's it. You're complete,\" is a Quickie impatient action that rebounds on the pc eventually. If there are 15, run 15! Possibly the pc on no. 12 will cognite he's really right where he is. Only then could you cease to work at it. An F/N Cog VGIs tells you a process is finished, not a whole class of actions! Thus 2½ minutes from 0 to IV is not only impossible, it is murderous. It will result in an overwhelm, a low TA or a high TA eventually. Level I says, amongst other things, \"Problems Processes\". There are certainly half a dozen. Each would be run to F/N Cog VGIs. When these and the other processes of the Level are run, the pc will come to have no further reaction to problems and will be able to handle them. A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or forty cog-nitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one is free of the whole subject of the level. It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few. PC ABILITIES It is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force. Sooner or later he will have to begin to confront force. This comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed at fur-ther confront. \"What problem could you have?\" sooner or later is needed in one form or an-other. What force can the pc now handle? All auditing in a body – and any living in a body – makes a being vulnerable. Bodies break, suffer, intensify pain. Sooner or later a pc will go Exterior. The Interiorization Rundown must be ordered as the next action or you will have a pc with a high TA. 2-way comm Ext-Int must be given in a following session (not the same one) so the full cognitions will occur. After this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force will im-prove. Do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accident with the body. Exterior he forgets its frailty. However, such things are minor. He is \"learning how to walk\" a new way and will run into chairs! He gets this figured out after a while.

POINTS ON CASE SUPERVISION 1. Check your orders to find out if auditor did them. 2. Check to see if commands correct and if pc's reaction was expected reaction for those commands. 3. Check any list and find out if there was mislisting. 4. Advise against a background of Standard Tech. 5. Order any errors corrected or get the case on further up the grades. 6. Beware of over-correction. 7. Beware of false, pessimistic or over-enthusiastic auditor reports. They are detected by whether the case responded to usual actions as they all do. 8. Beware of talking to the auditor or the pc. 9. Have implicit confidence in Standard Tech. If it is reported not working the auditor's report is false or the application terrible but not reported. 10. Above all else hold a standard and never listen to or use unusual solutions. DOUBLE FOLDER DANGER When a preOT has a Solo and an Auditing folder, both, there is a great danger if the Case Supervisor does not look at both before C/Sing. There has been an instance of a preOT running strange C/Ses on himself. Another ran C/Ses out of other folders on himself. In both cases the consequences were hard to repair when finally found. In another case in the Solo folder the preOT had gone exterior with full perception. But the Non-Solo Auditing folder was being C/Sed. The TA shot up for 2 months without any C/S except myself calling for all folders. PreOTs unfortunately run on a Solo folder and an audited folder. Unless both are to hand when C/Sing wild errors can be made by the C/S. There is also the case of a person having two audited folders, being C/Sed at the same time. This is an Admin error. The firm rule is C/S only with all folders to hand. The embarrassing situation where one can't get a folder from another org or field audi-tor or where the old folder is lost has to be made up for somehow. It mustn't halt auditing to-tally."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 3 HCOB 25.6.70 DIANETIC CS COURSE 103 17.11.12 CASE SUPERVISOR – FOLDER HANDLING Analyzing Folders Go back in the folder to the session where the preclear was running well and come forward from it doing a folder error summary. Reviewing Folders In reviewing a folder, the first thing to do is to look at the C/S to see if it was done. Use the Summary Sheet to get the Auditor's attitude and pc mannerism changes. Use the Auditor's Report Form to get the time of processes. Read and take all your data from Worksheets and compare it to and see that C/S was complied with and ensure Standard Tech was applied. If you can't read the reports, send it back to have the Auditor over-print illegible words. Never try to case supervise (C/S) an illegible worksheet as you'll only run into head-aches. The After Session Examiner's Report gives you the first clue of how suspicious you should be in examining the folder and whether or not auditing reports contain falsities. Standard Tech You're never led by anything into departing from Standard Tech. The only reason it doesn't work is that it hasn't been applied. The main question of a Case Supervisor is: Was it applied? If you follow this exactly, you'll never miss. CASE SUPERVISOR DATA A Case Supervisor should watch for Ethics record of pcs who have been C/Sed. If they fall on their head, get into low conditions, the folder should be reviewed. Most probably the auditor did not do what was ordered and, if folder looks okay, chances are the auditing report is false as something is wrong or pc would not be in trouble.

A Case Supervisor cannot properly C/S a case without having this data. To not do this is out admin. OUT ADMIN – LIABILITY Much has been said about the importance of admin in auditing but auditors just aren't getting it – so...... it now becomes a liability to have out admin in pcs' folders. Folders are to be submitted with the latest session on top. Auditor's report form is sta-pled to Worksheets which are dated, numbered and in order, latest on top. Summary Report is then attached to the auditing report and W/Ss with a paper clip. This of course is as well as the usual admin such as legible writing, re-writing illegible words, marking reads and F/Ns, and all End Phenomena, etc. The C/S instructions for that session go under that session, so you get C/S 4/6/68, Au-diting Session 4/6/68, C/S 5/6/68, Auditing Session 5/6/68, C/S 7/6/68, etc, etc. As the whole purpose of Class VIII is to minimize the time in auditing, by doing per-fect Standard Tech, this cannot be done if it takes 15 minutes to put the folder in order, so it can then be case supervised, so it can then be audited. GROSS CASE SUPERVISION ERRORS 1. Failing to use progress and advance programs when needed. 2. Ordering unnecessary repairs. 3. Trying to use repair processes to get case gain instead of getting the pc onto the next grade. 4. Not writing down C/S instructions, but giving them to an auditor verbally. 5. Talking to the auditor re the case. 6. Talking to pc re his case. 7. Failing to send pc to examiner if you're unsure why his folder has been sent up for C/S. 8. Being reasonable. 9. Not having enough Ethics presence to get his orders followed. 10. Issuing involved repair orders. 11. Biggest Gross Case Supervision Error for C/S is not to read through the pc folder.

The Auditor writes down the left-hand col-umn and then down the right-hand column. CONTENT OF WORKSHEET The most important parts of the session to be noted are: A. When the TA goes up (on what?) B.

For example, the repetitive process: Recall a change Recall a no-change Recall a failed change is run as a bracket (the pc is given the first command, then the second and then the third and then the first and then the second, etc.). The first command can be abbreviated to 1, the second to 2, and the third to 3. The W/S therefore would look like: 1232   2.8        a 9 failed 9 (note that each word of the command is cleared before clearing the command as a whole) change 9 no-change 9 recall 9  F/N    1.         cleared 2.       cleared 3.       cleared "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE WORKSHEETS 3 BTB 6.11.72R VII DIANETIC CS COURSE 109 17.11.12 1249   2.6        1.

Whatever system of abbreviation is used by the auditor, the worksheet must communicate to the c/s what actions were taken during the session. LEGIBILITY Worksheets should be written legibly.

The Auditor should always read over his W/sheets before turning in the folder to the Case Supervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read, they should be put in in block print, in red.

At the most it should just run into one or two corrections to a page. If the Auditor is having to correct the page more than that he should learn how to write rapidly and legibly.

All High TAs depend on unflat or restimulated engram chains. TAs go high on Overrun because the overrun restimulates engram chains not yet run. Engram (or secondary or lock) chains can be keyed out. This does not mean they stay out. In a few minutes or hours or days or years they can key back in. A pc will also de-stimulate in from 3 to 10 days usually. This means he \"settles out\". Thus a pc can be overrun into new engram chains (by life or an auditor), TA goes up, 3 to 10 days later the TA comes down. When a pc is audited to F/N VGIs and then a few minutes later has a high TA the usual reasons are 1. Has had his comm chopped or full Dianetic or Scientology End Phenomena not reached or 2. Has been run on an unreading item or subject or 3. Is overwhelmed or 4. Has a lot of engrams keying in or 5. Has been run in the past without full erasure of engrams or attaining End Phenomena. 6. Lists badly done or other misauditing cause a pc to feel bad and key in chains also. 7. A pc can be audited when too tired or too late at night. The solution to any of these is easy – on (l) always see that the pc attains full EP, par-ticularly on engram chains. On (2) make auditors check for read even in two-way comm sub-jects, list questions or Dianetic items before running them. On (3) see also (2) and get the pc a proper Progress (Repair) Program. On (4) Repair or isolate pc so his PT isn't so ferocious looking (meaning Repair [Progress] Pgm him well or let him change his environment and"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"GETTING THE F/N TO EXAMINER  2  HCOB  16.8.70  DIANETIC CS COURSE 112 17.11.12 then audit him) or (5) look into his folder to see who audited him on so many chains when, with no real erasure or EP. (6) You use Repair lists (like L4A, LIB, etc) and other usual ac-tion. On (7) you make the pc get some rest and if he can't, make him go for a walk away until he is tired and then walk back and get some sleep. All these really add up to keyed in or unflat engram chains. Whether the pc can handle them depends on Repair and the usual. Of all these the past auditing without attaining EP on engram chains (whether done in Dianetics or Scientology) is a usual reason for a much audited pc to have a high TA. The answers to any high TA that won't come down and to any pc who continually ar-rives at Examiner after an F/N VGI session end with his TA up are A. Faulty auditing not letting pc go to Full Dn EP when running engrams. B. A false auditing report (PR type report meaning promoting instead of auditing). C. Too many engram chains in past restim by life or auditing. Any correct Standard Dianetic Auditing will eventually handle. But it is usual to do a Picture Remedy (see HCO B 5 June 1969). A pc who has a chronic somatic would get programmed like this: I Repair (Progress) Pgm until pc feeling better. II Picture Remedy with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP. III Health Form – with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP. IV Somatics of the area with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP. V Run the engram chain of the incident (operation, accident, etc) he believes caused it. R3R triple. VI HF to F/N on the HF itself and attest full Dianetic result as per Class Chart. That's maybe 50 hours, all done in Dianetic triples, of course, in steps II to VI. If the Dianetic Auditing is standard and to Dianetic EP (F/N Cog VGIs) you will see this pattern at the Examiner or a few minutes after session. First few sessions TA 4.0 or more at Exam. Doubtful GIs. Next few TA 3.75 and blowing down to 3.25 at Exam. GIs. Next few TA 3.75 BD to F/N at Exam. GIs to VGIs. Next two or three TA 3.5 BD to F/N at Exams VGIs."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"GETTING THE F/N TO EXAMINER  3  HCOB  16.8.70  DIANETIC CS COURSE 113 17.11.12 Finally TA 2.5 F/N VGIs at the Examiner. Another pass at the HF finds it F/N and pc can and will attest Dianetics. That's what you would expect to see if the Auditing was standard, if the case was straightened out of past flubs in the Repair step. Errors such as running unreading items or firefights caused by out TRs or false auditing reports or Dn EP not reached at session end or pc needing ruds put in at session starts would prevent this pattern from happening at the Ex-aminer's. So if the pattern doesn't happen you know the auditing is goofy or something is out which had better be found. One pc for instance had a huge W/H of having a disease and was audited over it for 2 years = auditing over a W/H and PTP = no case gain. Silly pc. But also a very dull C/S not to alert to some outness there and find it. Another pc had a high TA and the fault was just that she never got any auditing at all! So they kept operating on her! Somebody didn't know Dianetics and auditing was for use. HIGH TA AND ILLNESS Pcs with high TAs feel ill and get ill. No use to elaborate on that. It's just a fact and is the fact about pcs who get ill. So maybe you see why this HCOB is important! LOW TA AT EXAM Pcs with low TAs are more or less in apathy. If it F/N VGIs at session end and is low at Exam (like l.9) (or if it went low in session and didn't F/N), then the pc is (a) overwhelmed and needs auditing and life repair (b) can have been run on a flat or unreading item that invalidated his former win. Example: Pc listed on an unreading list few sessions later worrying about it and com-ing to Exam with low TA. Repair is the answer. Low TA pcs need a Life Repair also. Note: The new Hubbard Consultant Assessment List is now under test at this writing and may become essential as a pre-repair function and if so would be before repair in the chronic somatic list of actions as a pgm.

PAST LIFE REMEDY Actually, there are 3 ways of getting a pc to run past track incidents in Dianetics. 1) For a pc that does not run incidents or somatic chains back to basic, in past lives, you would list \"What pains, somatics, sensations, unwanted emotions or attitudes would make one unwilling to go earlier that this life?\" You get the best reading item, check for interest and run the item by R3R. You reas-sess, if pc has not gone earlier than this life while running first item from the list, get the next best reading item, check for interest and R3R. Somewhere along the line, the pc will go earlier than this life, and that is the result of this first action. 2) Children Some children respond positively and successfully to the above remedy. However, children are very burdened cases. They speak of \"remembering\" all the time. They say they can't go backtrack \"because they don't remember.\" They don't seem to take it from pictures. Contrary to psychology theories, LRH has found children in very rough case shape, nervous, frightened, griefy, etc. They are stuck in the books and movies they see. They run very shal-low, which means they F/N too easily and they run incidents very close to PT. The easiest ways to unburden cases is by: 1) Contact processes (CCHs etc.) 2) Recall. The second way to unburden a case, on children, has been tested at Flag on pcs who had been running, for 2 months, Dianetics very shallow. The actual action was performed by an VIII as follows: 1) Fly all ruds – use suppress and false. 2) Assess Auditors – Auditing – Dianetics – Scientology – Preclears – Past Lives – Time – Erasure. 3) Prepcheck any item that reads twice. 4) Run each leg of ARC SW Triple way, to F/N. Clear the commands well."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 2 BTB 3.10.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 118 17.11.12 The pcs run on the above action, unburdened tremendously, there was a lot of TA ac-tion observed, and they cognited either on Prepchecking or on Recall that the actual way to look at past lives was to look at the pictures that flashed to view when they were being run on the above action! And there we had pcs running incidents at 1800 and 1600 etc, ...! Right away! After the above action has been performed, the Case Supervisor would send the pc to Dianetics for a new HF and there you have a pc running on Dianetics very successfully, win-ning all the way. 3) Children again There exists also a category of children that have fear from going into Past Lives, even though they had been run on the 2 above remedies, they still did not make it. You would list that type of pc as follows: \"What pains, sensations, unwanted emotions, or attitudes would make you not want to look at earlier lives? You get the best reading item, check for interest and run R3R on that item, and some-where along the handling of the list made, the pc will look at the pictures that he doesn't rec-ognize easily, can't date, etc. The Dianetic Auditor handles those inabilities, premature of course, as per Standard Dianetic procedure, and off you go with a pc looking at pictures of earlier lives, cogniting and winning and F/Ning on erasure of incidents with VGIs! B. THE ANATEN PC – DOPES OFF IN SESSION – HIGH TA The handling of the pcs or pre-OTs that fall under the above category, even though they were well rested before session, consists of three ways: 1) The Case Supervisor sends the pc or pre-OT to a Dianetic Auditor who would list: \"What pictures or masses have you touched in life or in auditing that have been left unflat?\" The Dianetic Auditor would get the best reading item from the list, gets the somatic or pain, or sensation or unwanted emotion or attitude that goes with that picture or mass, makes sure that it reads well, and he would follow down to basic and erasure that item that read with the picture or the mass, by Standard R3R. The list is reassessed and is exhausted as above. When the above action is performed, the TA of that PC or pre-OT will come back to its normal range, i.e., between 2 and 3, and the pc brightens up as the list is handled. 2) There are some PCs or pre-OTs that keep talking in Dianetic or Review Sessions about \"this huge automaticity of pictures coming in, faster and faster.\" They also dope off somewhat in session and they are somewhat hard to get an F/N on. The Case Supervisor would send such PCs or pre-OTs to a Dianetic Auditor, who would list: \"What pictures have you seen in Auditing?\" The list is handled exactly as in 1) above. And the results are exactly the same as in 1) above also."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 3 BTB 3.10.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 119 17.11.12 3) The final handling of such PCs and pre-OTs is performed in Review. The Case Su-pervisor would issue the following C/S: a) GF to F/N b) Assess for:  Overts on unconscious people  Overts on anaten people  Overts on asleep people  Overts on sick people The C/S here would vary the assessment list, add if necessary, in accordance with what the pc or pre-OT motivates from. c) Itsa Earlier Itsa to F/N on each reading line, taking up of course the hottest line on down. 4) When the above actions are performed, you will have a PC or pre-OT who will have no other chance to fall asleep while being audited, and there will be more wins than losses.

It is not given by the C/S be-cause an auditor is a friend or because he would be offended if he didn't get one. \"Well Done\" given by the C/S for a session means the pc had F/N VGIs at the ex-aminer immediately after the session. This then presupposes that session lines include an Examiner even if it's a receptionist and it includes the use and understanding of Exam Reports. (See HCO PL 26 Jan '70, Issue III, or any rewrite and Exam tech.) It presupposes the Examiner has a meter to hand and that the pc makes a statement. Thus, if there are no Exam Reports there can't be a well done given, eh? True enough. A C/S who C/Ses without Exam Reports done by a different person than the auditor is asking to fly blind and to get auditor \"PR\" (public relations or brag) and false auditing reports. No F/N at Exam no well done. This is harsh as early on pcs often get no F/N at Examiner. But in every case there are current earlier tech errors on the case when the F/N doesn't get from the session to the Examiner. It is also harsh because the failure to get the F/N to the Examiner could be a C/S error! But (see HCO B 24 May '70, \"Auditor's Rights\", C/S Series 1), the auditor should not have accepted the C/S. The C/S could be too heavy, or the case needed a repair first or the process ordered is not part of a proper program.

Let him go on flubbing and getting no results. 2. Direct invalidation of his intentions or future or potential. In 1, nearly all auditors who stop auditing never really knew how to audit in the first place or have gross misunderstoods or have accumulated intentional or unintentional overts on pcs or have been too harshly invalidated. When they don't really grasp the ease and sim-plicity of auditing they get into other troubles. A really well trained, smooth auditor never gets any real charge on his case on the sub-ject of auditing. When you let an auditor flub, the whole subject gets invalidated and he loses his value because he goes into doubt. This can be said with complete confidence today as the whole of Dianetics and Scientology is there and it works very very well indeed if it is used and if the C/Sing and auditing is correct and flubless. AUDITOR HANDLING The C/S is really not just the Case Supervisor, he is also the auditors' handler. Like a boxer's trainer or a star's director, the C/S handles his guys. They are all a bit different, auditors. There are prima donnas and meek mousey ones and steady-on ones and all kinds. They get the credit for the sessions from the pcs most often. They really don't like not to be C/Sed. And they value the well dones and the very well dones and they flinch at the flunks. And the honest ones know all about it before they turn it in. And some don't mention the flub but think you're a fool if you miss it. So it's important to have a constant in assigning what the auditor is given for the ses-sion. Well Done Auditing Hours are all that's valid for a stat. So a C/S must be very exact and correct in his determination of well done, very well done, no mention and (forlornly) a flunk. This should remove argument from the matter and bring certainty. L.

Recently I took over a whole series of these non F/N VGI at Examiner cases and very very carefully studied each one. In every examiner non F/N case I found flagrant out tech in (a) the Programming (b) the C/Sing and (c) the Auditing. All three outnesses existed. These cases were taken as all the Non F/N Exam reports on a line containing hundreds of folders and over 600 W.D. hours a week. So you can see that these errors had been missed by expert C/Ses and Auditors. The errors were missed because hope was being used instead of study. There was a hope that just routine C/Ses and auditing would work it out eventually. The fact of non F/N at Examiner was not given sufficient importance. The fact is that many who F/Ned at the Examiner had small flaws in them yet still got by. The Exam Non F/N indicates flagrant out tech in the Programming and the C/Sing and the auditing. That's what it takes. After a bug is found and corrected the case still may not F/N at the Examiner for a while. But after that while is passed the failure to give the Examiner an F/N means another bug and more study. One case I found had had a major grade done twice two years apart. This was pointed out and rehabbed. But after 2 or 3 sessions the TA remained high. A restudy now found Re-call Flow 2 of the Exteriorization Rundown had been run months ago to F/N and then contin-ued for dozens of commands with the TA rising to 4.5. This was then repaired. The case then began to F/N at the Examiner. It now runs like an ordinary case. There is always a bug, not necessarily current, often very old, in these Exam Non F/N Cases. There are sometimes two or three bugs. The answer is not go on C/Sing and hope. The answer is, study and find the bug."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"NON F/N CASES 2 HCOB 6.4.71 DIANETIC CS COURSE 126 17.11.12 Cases run on triples after a long list of singles is a type of bug.

Cases given false reads or5 already run W/Hs, cases who don't tell their cogs, cases who were on drugs but drugs were never run, cases that Rockslammed but no crime found, any of the GF 40 or GF reading items, cases with lists out, cases that are always sad or tired... well these types of cases are the usual bugged cases. But even they sometimes F/N if only to roller coaster. The general rule of going back to where the case was running well and coming for-ward still holds. But an audit past Exteriorization can be before that and only eventually catch up. General repair is harmful when a big bug exists. Every case I examined had a big bug. Flagrant god-awful overruns, messed up Exteri-orization Rundown, three major programs begun, each incomplete, engram after engram botched and run to high TA then walked off from. The errors were real! They had been sitting there for some time unnoticed. Session after session mounting up into piles of wasted audit-ing. Sick pcs are another indicator. Pc F/Ns at Exam, then reports sick. Look behind it you find some wild program, C/S and auditing error. So the answer is to study the case. Get a total FES done if one has never been done. Get a current FES done or do it your-self. Then examine the programs and the FESes and Folder Summaries and suddenly you'll find it. Fortunately there aren't many things that can really foul a case up. 1. Overruns concealed within work sheets. Major grades twice. 2. Auditing past Exterior or flubbed Ext RDs. 3. Earlier unrun flows restimulated by later runs on those flows. 4. GF + 40 Items. 5. Never handled out lists. 6. Undetected drugs or drugs never handled by Dianetics. 7.

There can be combinations of these. So there aren't many. It's really knowing what is right so well that the wrong shows up like skywriting. Sometimes the errors are silly. A bogged Dianetic case had gotten tons of VI repair. The C/S, an VIII, had never realized Dianetic C/Sing is its own brand of C/Sing. He didn't shift gears to Dianetic C/Sing when C/Sing Dianetics sessions. The auditor way back had not known that when the pc originates \"It's erased\" and the TA remains high, his correct action is one more A B C D. This C/S had then tried Class VI remedies instead of telling the auditor \"Flatten or rehab the last chain\". When the chains left unflat were rehabbed all was suddenly well. Another case was interrupted for a year on a major action and when returned to audit-ing was begun on a long, long repair program. Inches of folder later the interrupted program was found and resumed and the case did great. All that \"hopeful\" repair was lost work. Ten minutes of case study would have saved twenty hours of useless repair. The stable datum is cases moderately well programmed, C/Sed and audited run well. So cases that don't run well (unchanging Exam natter comment, Non F/N) have a big error in Programming, C/Sing and Auditing. Look well and you will find it. And if that isn't it, there was another to be found as well. If you can't find the folder or data in it you should take every imaginable measure to acquire more data. D of P Interviews, 2WC sessions, telexes to his last org and telegrams to his auditors. But get data from somewhere somehow. Soon, when hours pick up and skill, all auditing will be sold by package not by hours. So learn economy of hours! An auditor or C/S who really knows his theory and has a good grasp of practical ap-plication knows the right way. From that he can easily see how things are wrong.

And a third rule: In an Advanced Org the Adv Cse Admin must also be informed of students en-rolling on a TR course. And a fourth rule: A sign must be placed in Qual and in a TR classroom \"While working on TRs and until they are passed, do not accept auditing.\" In an AO or SH this reads \"While working on TRs and until they are passed, do not accept auditing or do Solo.\" The reason for these rules lies in the major C/S rules: Do not begin new programs to end old. Do not start a new action before completing the existing one. And the auditor rule: Obtain an F/N before starting the next C/S action. If unable to do so, never begin the next C/S action but end session and return the folder to the C/S. The surest way in the world to bog a case is to: 1. Begin a new process without obtaining an F/N on the one just run. 2. Begin a major action without completing the old one. 3. Begin a major action without setting up a case with ruds and F/Ns."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"TRS COURSE AND AUDITING 2 C/S-SERIES 38 – HCOB 26.5.71 MIXING MAJOR ACTIONS DIANETIC CS COURSE 130 17.11.12 4. Begin a new program without completing the old one. 5. Start several programs without finishing any. 6. Enter a new major action into a case already in progress on another incomplete major action. I have seen a case on as many as five major actions with none complete. And when I see this the first thing I take up is the first unflat incomplete program and get it finished, then the next, then the next. The case comes out all smooth. Example: Case is on but not complete on Dianetic auditing. Switched to grades. In-complete on grades, gets a Prog Pgm. Incomplete on a Prog Pgm, shifted to Power. The only apparent exception is a repair. A case can be repaired if bogged providing the original action is rehabbed if O/R or completed to EP. A Progress Pgm may reach EP before the written up program is completed. Thus a Process Completion is defined as the End Phenomena of the process. A Pro-gram is complete when the End Phenomena of the Program is attained. TRs Any course or program containing TRs 0-4, 6-9 or Admin TRs is a major program in itself. It produces case gain – if run right – and has an End Phenomenon. Further, by actual experience when a person is on a real (not a patty-cake and weak) TR Course and is also being audited at the same time, the C/S and Auditor if they don't know the person is also on TRs can be utterly baffled and worried as the case does not run right. \"What did I do?\" \"What C/S was wrong?\" \"Look, his TA is high.\" \"Now it's low.\" \"Last ses-sion he____.\" And the C/S and auditor engage in efforts to handle the odd case behavior. But the person, unknown to them, was also on a real TR Course and his case was changing! INTERJECTED PGMS You can also run into this same oddity with a mystic who does \"bathe the body in light\" every night or a wife whose husband audits her between HGC sessions or a self-auditor. The principle is the same. The C/S and auditor are going down Wellbeing Street and hidden trucks keep dashing out of alleys and running into the pc. LIFE The reason auditing should be done in intensive packages, not 1 hour a week or a ses-sion a month lies in the fact that life can run a new action in on a pc. It's a great way to waste auditing to let a pc have a session once a week. You can't even keep his ruds in if he lives in any confusions."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"TRS COURSE AND AUDITING 3 C/S-SERIES 38 – HCOB 26.5.71 MIXING MAJOR ACTIONS DIANETIC CS COURSE 131 17.11.12 So nothing is done for the case, all the auditing goes to handle the life interjections! CROSS PROGRAMMING A case runs on cycles of actions. This is true in the auditing comm cycle. It is true in a process cycle. It is true in a program cycle. New things being crossed into old incomplete things make a sort of ARC Break situa-tion like a cut comm cycle. One could do everything with a process or a program or a course that you find on an L1C. It would not be very wise. No case gain can be created by lack of a comm cycle in an auditor, lack of an action cycle in processes or messing up a program cycle. If you don't believe it, run an L1C on a pc with \"Processes\" and \"Programs\" and \"Courses\" as a prefix. You'd be amazed. Further the fellow who doesn't reach the EP of a Course is likely never to use that material or be faulty with the subject. Usual study courses like admin or tech give case gain. One can carry on with auditing parallel to them. But still expect a case to change a bit by study and baffle a C/S once in a while. But a real TR Course produces changes up and down and up that are not possible to also audit around. So they don't mix.

This is not an Admin point I'm making. It is a technical point. Every so often a pc is found hung up in not having declared and attested the state at-tained. A Declare completes his cycle of action and is a vital part of the action. One never forces or feeds one to the pc. I recall one org where the entire tech and in-come structure crashed, the C/O and several personnel had to be removed because they were forcing \"clear cogs\" on their Dianetic pcs who hadn't had them (and then telling them they couldn't be audited further on Scientology) (Connie Broadbent, ASHO, March '70). So this goes two ways. The pc or pre OT who knows he made it must be sent to exams and C&A to at-test. The pc or pre OT who hasn't made it must never be sent to exams to declare and attest. This gives us a third: Pcs and pre OTs who haven't made it must be handled until they have made that specific declare, even though it means signing up for more auditing. Truth is the keynote, the essence, the point here. All the \"PR\" (slang for promotional talk) in the world will not supplant truth. The pc knows he made something. Therefore he must be sent to declare it whether it's a standard grade or not!

It is used \"On Dianetics lists\" as the start of each of its questions when employed for this purpose. When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be found the C/S should suspect some listing error and order an L4BRA to be done \"On Dianetic lists \" at the start of each question.

We used to say that \"the Auditor's TRs were out\" as the most fundamental reason for no results. This is not specific enough.

It became evident when one could take almost any \"null\" (no read) list in a pc's folder, give it and the pc to an Auditor who could assess and get nice reads on it with consequent gain.

The advent of \"Expanded Grades\" and the C/S Series of HCO Bulletins and Triple Flow Dianetics does not cancel the basics of Dianetics Case Supervision; these developments clarify and complement Dianetic Case Supervision. Dianetics is Dianetics. It is for use. The use of this Dianetic C/S's Index will help you to achieve the maximum gains at-tainable with Dianetics. Use it. ___________"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE DIANETIC CASE SUPERVISOR’S INDEX 2 BTB 25.4.71R DIANETIC CS COURSE 148 17.11.12 THE DIANETIC CASE SUPERVISOR'S INDEX This index lists categories of preclear \"situations\" and HCO Bulletins and BTBs that give the proper handling for the situations.

Remimeo All Auditors All C/Ses (Cancels and replaces BTB 3 Oct 69R DIANETIC REMEDIES) DIANETIC REMEDIES The remedies given here will handle pcs who go anaten or dope off in session even though they are well rested beforehand. They will also handle high TAs caused by chains left in restimulation by reason of not taking them to a full Dianetic EP. WORD CLEARING One of the beginning pc's first steps in auditing is a thorough and complete CS-1. This is given as ACTION SEVEN on NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 2, FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE. It must be done until the pc well understands the commands of R3RA and knows what is ex-pected of him as a pc. (Ref: HCOB 9 Jul 78, DIANETIC CS-1.) Do not attempt to run R3RA on a pc who is not properly indoctrinated. Clear the commands. Clear the list words and clear the procedures with him. It is the auditor's responsi-bility to ensure the pc understands the commands and the procedure he is being run on. So the first remedy given here is Word Clearing. A pc who does not understand R3RA commands, assessment procedures, etc. will only restimulate masses in Dianetic ses-sions, he will not be able to erase them. If there is any doubt that your pc understands the commands and procedures of R3RA, you clear these up immediately. There are uniformly two things that prevent pcs from running engrams. They are the failure to fully clear all the commands and procedures of R3RA as we have covered above, and unhandled drugs. Hence, the following remedies are to be done in their correct sequence on the pc's Dianetic program, after a full and complete drug handling per New Era Dianetics Series 9, DRUG HANDLING. (Ref: New Era Dianetics Series 2, FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE.) PICTURES OR MASSES The following remedy is ordered by the C/S when the pc has no misunderstood words but still goes anaten in session, even when assessment and R3RA procedure are correctly done and the pc has had sufficient sleep, with no unflat chains evident by folder inspection but has a very high or low TA."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 2 HCOB 24.7.78 DIANETIC CS COURSE 160 17.11.12 The auditor asks: \"What pictures or masses have you touched on in life or in auditing that have been left unhandled?\" The most obvious remedy is simply to take the best reading picture that was left unflat in auditing and simply finish the chain. If the pc had only run it single flow at the time then finish it single flow for certain and check the other flows to see if they read and run them if they do. The question one checks is Step One narrative or Step One regular R3RA. One uses narrative when it is simply an incident and regular R3RA when he remembers what somatic he was running at the time. The essence of this is simply to complete something that was already started and was-n't completed. If it was a picture which simply appeared in life, one can treat it as an original item per the Assessment HCOB and carry on from there. Caution should be observed in running a pc on Quad who hitherto had only been run on single or triple flows. One can get onto the subject of bypassed charge when he suddenly runs a new flow (like Flow 0) that has never been run before on a new item. What happens is the pc, audited on single or triple on other items in previous auditing, collides with some of the unrun charge of previously unhandled chains of that flow and can get quite upset. The best handling of this sort of thing is called \"Quading up a pc\" as contained IN HCOB 7 MARCH 71R, USE OF QUADRUPLE DIANETICS. Masses are handled simply by treating them as an original item as in the Assessment HCOB. In pictures or masses remedies, one is best off following New Era Dianetics Series 4. Just treat the picture or mass as an original item. Therefore, when the pc gives you a list of pictures or masses that have been touched on in life or auditing he is really giving you a list of original items so far as handling is concerned. The auditor takes the best reading item from that list and does a preassessment on it. \"Are/is (preassessment item) connected with (item)?\" is the preassessment question. The auditor then follows the procedure outlined IN HCOB 18 JUNE 1978 NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4, doing a full preassessment and runs out R3RA Quad all reading items with pc interest. When this action is correctly performed the TA of the pc will be back in range, and the pc will be bright. AUTOMATICITY OF PICTURES There are some pcs who keep talking about \"this huge automaticity of pictures coming in, faster and faster.\" They also dope off in session and they are somewhat hard to get an F/N on. The thing which is really wrong with the pc is instability. He can't hold things still."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 3 HCOB 24.7.78 DIANETIC CS COURSE 161 17.11.12 A C/S could order HCO TRAINING BULLETIN OF 6 FEB 1957 (Technical Volume III) – \"Hold It Still.\" Objectives are also indicated, particularly SCS, as the pc can't control things. After flattening Objectives it will be found that the pc's bank is more stable. As the multipictures may also have keyed something in a C/S, after Objectives are flat, could order the following: \"Ask the pc 'What pictures have you seen in life or auditing?' and treat the best reading items in the resulting list as original items, handling them per NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4.\" The phenomenon of automatic pictures is also called \"an avalanche\" and data on it is available in the Technical Bulletins Volume II, page 39, Volume VIII, page 106. The above section is the best handling. OVERTS When the pc goes anaten in session but there is no evidence of unflat chains, the C/S issues this C/S: \"Assess for:  Overts on unconscious people  Overts on anaten people  Overts on asleep people  Overts on sick people. \"Run each reading item with interest R3RA Narrative Quad, running F2 first.\" The C/S could vary the assessment list, adding items if necessary in accordance with what the pc was motivating from. IMAGINARY INCIDENTS Sometimes a pc cannot confront the actual incidents that are keyed-in by life or audit-ing. Such a pc will not go backtrack. In this case the running of imaginary incidents is quite productive. Sometimes the preclear will run them, quite astonishingly, with somatics. But he is not being required to face any reality about them and the auditor is not insisting that any reality exists concerning them. In a surprisingly high percentage of times, however, he will be running actual incidents. So long as he does not have to admit that these incidents are actual he can do something about them. It should be understood that no amount of imaginary incidents can supplant the run-ning of real incidents. The first value that this technique has – the invitation to the preclear to run avowedly imaginary incidents in his past – is to build up, the preclear's confidence in the auditor. The preclear begins to feel that he will not be censured for indulging in fantasy."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 4 HCOB 24.7.78 DIANETIC CS COURSE 162 17.11.12 When the preclear discovers that he has an auditor who not only will listen to imagina-tion but who encourages it, the affinity level rises and the preclear's ability to differentiate in terms of reality will itself rise. The auditor must never, after the incident has been run, then insist that the incident was real. This would be a break of faith. He and the preclear have entered into a contract that what is being run is pure imagination, and the auditor must not break his contract. To run imaginary incidents, the auditor discusses with the pc how they will be running imaginary incidents and gets the pc's agreement to do so. The auditor then asks, \"What imaginary incidents or pictures have you touched on?\" All the pc's responses to this question, with their meter reads are noted by the auditor. He then takes up the best reading incident or picture and runs it out R3RA Narrative Quad, first checking interest. Lesser reading items are then taken up. This action is done until the pc is brighter and more able to confront actual incidents as they come up in auditing. In doing this remedy be certain the pc understands R3RA procedure and has no mis-understoods. L.

One does this by R-3-R but there is a slight change in wording when asking the pc to go earlier. One asks for an earlier similar incident. \"Is there an earlier similar incident?\" A session, when audited, does not always erase. Instead it has become part of a chain. Therefore one has to run R-3-R on it and get an earlier similar incident. The chain may go back vast amounts of time. Whereas the pc may only have been in Scientology 3 days, before Scientology there were other types of \"sessions\" such as psychoanalysis. And before that, in Rome and Greece, dream therapy in which one was \"visited by a God\". And before that – well, the chain can have a very far back basic.

Running a session out has the liability that one is running a narrative chain, a similar experience rather than a similar somatic. One of the major 1969 breakthroughs was that chains are held together mainly by somatics. The body condition or somatic is what keeps the chain in association. One can of course run \"narrative incidents\" by which one means similar experiences. \"Locate an earlier time your mother spanked you.\" \"Locate an earlier wreck.\" These will run and sometimes even get to and erase a basic. But they are long and sometimes don't ever get to basic at all and the chain may not erase. Running only narrative incidents is what made early Dianetics run up such fabulous numbers of hours in processing. Somatic chains go quickly to basic and are the important chains. Thus when we erase a chain of sessions we sometimes run into a very long chain. Sometimes the TA goes up to 4 or 5 (particularly if the auditor grinds).

Not doing it. Not doing it at all. Finding something but not running it out. Not con-tinuing down the chain. Not continuing to audit what is now troubling the PC. Not finding a new chain or somatic to erase. 2. Crossing Dianetics WITH Scientology. These are two separate subjects. All the data of Dianetics that is used in practise is contained in the Dianetics course. 3. Invalidating what the pc says it is. Changing what the PC says on the Health Form. Refusing to take what the PC gives as the incident because the auditor considers it not to be a Lock, Secondary, or Engram. 4. Not discharging each incident contacted on the chain. Only doing one run through an incident then going earlier leaving restimulated incidents all over the track. 5. Ceasing to run the chain after obtaining an F/N on a lock or secondary. Failure to distinguish between key-out and erasure. 6. Failing to use Dianetic assists on person who has had recent operation, accident, or severe loss. Failing to erase the engram chain as soon as possible after the accident. Neglecting one's fellows and not using Dianetics to help them. 7. Following narrative chain instead of somatic chain. 8. Attempting to run out a medical term. Running migraine headache, sciatica, etc. in-stead of finding out what it feels like to the PC and using that for a chain. 9. Assigning a pc with psychotic history to a non-standard auditor. With such a PC you have to be very careful to go to F/N or erase and not let them be goofed up by an auditor who doesn't follow exact procedure and the Auditors Code. 10. Failing to erase the cause of something. When you fail to erase the cause of some-thing you can expect it to come back. It may even come back at the end of the session. 11. Assigning husband-wife type auditing teams. This should be avoided when ever possible as it requires a very good auditor indeed to be effective when he or she is also the husband or wife."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"MAJOR AUDITING FAULTS 2 BTB 4.5.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 180 17.11.12 12. Running items taken randomly instead of doing a meter assessment, taking largest read, checking for PC interest and then running. 13. Taking up a new somatic when the pc mentions it instead of continuing to erase the chain already started. 14. Improper R3R procedure. Particularly doing duration step on second and subsequent runs through the same incident. See HCOB 27 April 1969. 15. Running an incident or somatic chain pc is not interested in. Read was on protest, not on the somatic. 16. Not asking the pc after second run through if it is getting more solid or erasing. 17. Out admin. Mainly illegible reports and not stating what chain is being run or how. 18. Invalidating pc ability to erase. Done by trying to get an earlier incident when the current incident is erasing, or by continuing to grind on with something already erased. 19. Grinding on an incident too late on the chain. 20. Auditor not understanding erasure. Common one is auditor thinking a picture get-ting more visible is erasing. 21. Auditing a pc who doesn't know what is happening. PC doesn't understand what a session is or what Erasure, Locks, Secondaries, or Engrams are. 22. Giving altered training or evaluative examination. Messing up the material being taught or the standard so he fails to learn the exact simplicity of Dianetics in the first place. The main fault of Dianetics has been not doing it.

These instances and others actually occurred in sessions and the sessions failed. There was no mention of them in the Report Form Summary or Worksheets and only asking the pc brought them to light. 1. Auditor not remembering one or more of the commands. 2. Auditor delaying the pc while thinking of the next command. 3. Auditor failure to give the next command. 4. Giving wrong or altered command. 5. Incorrect procedure. 6. Invalidating the pc's cognitions. 7. Not recognizing that the pc has gone through the incident and just waiting or saying \"OK continue\" when the pc had said that was all. 8. Auditor during session looking up something he (the auditor) didn't understand that the pc said. 9. Auditing pc in circumstances where the pc is expecting he may be disturbed at some time later in the session. 10. Auditor walking out of auditing room leaving pc folder in room with pc. 11. Continuing to audit on a chain that the pc insists is erased (usually because auditor missed the F/N). 12. Not acknowledging pc originations. 13.

In going through an incident the second time one does not ask for date and duration again or any description. After the 1st time through an incident and when pc has recounted it the auditor A. Tells pc, \"Move to the beginning of the incident.\" B. \"Tell me when you are there.\" C. When pc has said he is, \"Scan through to the end of the incident.\" D. \"Tell me what happened.\" The second, 3rd, etc run through the same incident use the above or some variation thereof. ERASURE OR GOING SOLID After the second time through, find out if it is erasing or going more solid. If it is eras-ing go through it a third time, etc until it is erased. Erasure is usually accompanied by a Float-ing Needle and a cognition immediately afterwards. PC INTEREST In doing R-3-R it is necessary that (a) one chooses things the pc is interested in and (b) one does not force a pc to run things he is protesting being run on. ERASING LAST INCIDENT FOUND If you ask if there is an earlier incident and the pc says \"No\" you do not just walk off from the one he was just running. You send the pc through it again and it will erase."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"R-3-R RESTATED COMMANDS ON 2 HCOB 27.4.69 SECOND RUN ON AN INCIDENT DIANETIC CS COURSE 184 17.11.12 COMPLETING CHAINS If you do sloppy R-3-R and do one thing after another without getting an F/N or an erasure, you will get the pc stuck up on the track. You complete each chain to F/N or erasure. F/Ns vs. ERASURE If a Lock F/Ns you can get earlier incidents on the same chain until the pc actually runs the engram or chain of engrams. While it is not always safe to pass an F/N and go earlier to the real engram and erase it, a pc who is only F/Ned on locks will get the engram keyed in again later. The somatic may return unless engrams are run to erasure. ENDING SESSIONS An R-3-R session can be safely ended on a cognition and Good Indicators such as a cheerful happy pc.

The pc cannot see a chain but he can see a picture. Hence pictures or masses are asked for per HCOB 5 June 1969. A TA can be high at start of session due to a chain in restimulation. The appropriate somatic would normally read well on assessment and the TA would come down with Std R3R to F/N and erasure. If the TA does not come down and the pc goes anaten in session then the assessment was incorrect and the pc probably has previous unflat chains. The auditor action is to end the session and send the folder to C/S. If the Case Supervisor by folder inspection finds an earlier unflat chain he orders it be completed. If no unflat chain is found by folder inspec-tion the C/S orders assessment of pictures or masses left unflat, the somatic found, and the chain run to erasure by R3R.

PRECISION DIANETICS – THE COMMANDS OF R3R Dianetics is precision run. Altering commands, skipping commands, stumbling over commands, re-arranging the sequence of commands drives a preclear out of session and often throws him into different chains, leaving un-erased masses in restimulation and causes unhappy sick pcs. Altering, skipping, stumbling re-arranging sequence of commands has the additional consequence of adversely training the preclear to be wary of auditor control and seek to con-trol his own session. This has a deadly result for a pc as it makes him massy, sick and difficult to control in subsequent sessions. It also causes the pc to lose confidence in auditors and auditing. A \"fast\" pc is never too fast for a precision auditor. There is a difference between a fast pc and a pc whom the auditor is not controlling. There is no such thing as a \"slow,\" \"bad\" or \"rough\" pc. It is the auditor who \"edu-cates\" the pc into being difficult to control. An auditor who permits a pc to skip commands and jump steps not running R3R but is permitting the pc to run some poor form of Recall on himself. Such an auditor could ruin that pc's chances for gains in future auditing as he has \"educated\" the pc to be \"difficult.\" Since most pc's start their auditing with Dianetics, it therefore is very important to do precision: R3R, have flawless TRs and metering and session control so that the preclear is handled and controlled correctly from the start. It is the auditor who controls the pc's time track and the session and educates the pc for good or for worse. It is the auditor's full responsibility to audit the pc flawlessly. Thus the myth of \"rough PCs,\" \"slow\" and \"bad PCs\" will disappear and all PCs will audit like a dream. THE PROCEDURE – PRELIMINARY STEP Establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment. This is done usually by us-ing the Health Form."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"PRECISION DIANETICS – 2 BTB 8.3.71 II THE COMMANDS OF R3R DIANETIC CS COURSE 188 17.11.12 The item that reads best and has the pc's interest is the one you will run. The same item is run on all four flows. There is one chain to each flow. Each chain is run to F/N, Cog, VGIs – Erasure. FLOW ONE STEP ONE: Locate the first incident by the exact command: \"Locate an incident that could have caused _________(the exact item worded exactly as assessed from Health Form or list.)\" STEP TWO: Date the incident. This is done by asking the exact question: \"When was it?\" Take what the pc gives you. It may be a date – or \"years ago.\" It may be \"a long time ago\" or \"during the Middle Ages\" or \"when there were Dinosaurs.\" He has told you when it was. Take it. Or the pc may answer \"I don't know.\" You can place the incident by location, signifi-cance or time by asking \"Is there any way you can place the incident?\" He'll answer \"Oh yes, there's a hill with a tree on it\" or some such. Take it. STEP THREE: \"Move to (date pc gave in Step Two.)\" If pc didn't give a date in Step Two but said \"A long time ago\" you'd say \"move to a long time ago\" or if he said \"during the Middle Ages,\" you'd say \"move to during the Middle Ages.\" You would never say \"move to I don't know\" but you'd include the content – i.e. \"move to the time there's a hill with a tree on it.\" STEP FOUR: \"What is the duration of the Incident?\" Use this exact command to establish duration (length) of incident. An incident may be anything from a split second long to 15 Tril-lion Trillion years long. STEP FIVE: \"Move to the beginning of the incident at _________ (date pc gave in Step Two.)\" Wait until meter flicks or pc indicates OK. If date was not given but content was given: \"Move to the beginning of the incident at a long time ago\" or \"Move to the beginning of the incident at the time there's a hill with a tree on it,\" etc. STEP SIX: (If pc's eyes are open, say softly \"Close your eyes.\") Ask the exact question, \"What do you see?\" Acknowledge whatever the pc says. Do not ask a second question here ever. STEP SEVEN: \"Move through the incident to a point _________ (duration pc gave in Step Four) later.\" Send the pc through the incident with this exact command. STEP EIGHT: Ask nothing, say nothing, do nothing (except make quiet notes) while pc is going through the incident. If pc says anything at all, let him say it. Do not interrupt him in any way. When the pc has finished saying whatever it was, just gently acknowledge with the exact command \"Okay, continue\" and let him continue. If the pc has obviously finished going through the incident you would not say \"Okay, continue\" but go on to the next step. Do not coax, distract, prompt or question the pc during this period. STEP NINE: When the pc reaches the end of the incident (usually pc moves or looks up) say only \"What happened?\""},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"PRECISION DIANETICS – 3 BTB 8.3.71 II THE COMMANDS OF R3R DIANETIC CS COURSE 189 17.11.12 Take whatever pc says, acknowledge only as needful, say nothing else, ask nothing else. When pc has told little or much and has finished talking, give a final acknowledgment. After 1 to 9 (the first time through,) go through the incident a second time. On going through the same incident a second or third or fourth etc. time, one does not ask for the date and duration again or for any description. The exact steps for the second, third, fourth, etc. time through are done exactly as fol-lows: A. \"Move to the beginning of the incident,\" B. \"Tell me when you are there.\" Steps A and B can be done at one time. They will sound like one sentence, \"Move to the beginning of the incident; tell me when you are there.\" C. When the pc has said he is, \"Scan through to the end of the incident.\" D. When the pc has finished, \"Tell me what happened.\" The second, third, fourth, etc. time through the same incident one uses the same A to D commands as above, exactly. ERASING OR GOING MORE SOLID After the second time through and every time through the same incident thereafter (but not after the first time through) find out if the incident is erasing or going more solid. You ask: \"Is the incident erasing or going more solid?\" If pc says it is erasing, you go through steps A to D again a third etc. time, asking at the end of \"D\" each time if the incident is erasing or going more solid. But you would ask if the incident were erasing or going more solid only if the Tone Arm were not rising by the end of Step D. (i.e. You ask if it's Solid or Erasing if the Tone Arm has been blowing down.) Tone Am blowing down usually means incident is erasing. See HCOB 28 MAY 69 HOW NOT TO ERASE. Occasionally the Tone Arm may be going down but the incident may be fading for the pc or it may appear more solid to him because an earlier incident is coming up and he may say \"I don't know.\" In any of these instances do not go through A to D again. You must go earlier (see exact commands for going earlier later in this HCOB.) If the Tone Arm is higher after Step D than it was just previously you would not ask if the incident is erasing or going more solid because tone arm going up = increased mass, increased pressure or intensified somatic. If the Tone Arm is higher after Step D, you know it is going more solid and do not ask if it is erasing or going more solid. Do not run the incident on Steps A to D again. You must now find an earlier incident on the same chain."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"PRECISION DIANETICS – 4 BTB 8.3.71 II THE COMMANDS OF R3R DIANETIC CS COURSE 190 17.11.12 The idea is, if after a few times through, the incident is not erasing, you'll want to go earlier. If it is erasing, you'll want to continue running the incident. The Tone Arm indicates if the incident is erasing by blowing down, and it indicates that the incident is not erasing by rising or going high and sticking. GOING EARLIER If after Step D the Tone Arm is higher than previously – gone up at all – or if in an-swer to \"erasing or going more solid?\" the pc says it's going more solid, or if he doesn't know, you ask for an earlier incident on the same chain with the exact question: STEP ONE A: \"Is there an earlier incident that could have caused _________ (the ex-act somatic or feeling – the item assessed from the Health Form or list) as was used in Step ONE. Then you go through Steps One to Nine and A to D in the same way, always going down the chain to an earlier incident whenever the incident you are running is going more solid after the second time through. EARLIER BEGINNING Sometimes when you ask for an earlier incident the pc will say there isn't an earlier in-cident. In this case, the incident you have been running may start earlier. You would therefore ask, \"Does the one we are running start earlier?\" If the pc says \"yes,\" then you give the command, \"Move to the new beginning of the incident,\" Then continue on to B, C, D and continue as usual. The important thing is to give the pc time to find the earlier incident or the earlier be-ginning. If the pc can't find an earlier incident or an earlier beginning, run the incident you were doing on A to D again.

A pc here at Davis had his Dianetics Triples done by another Center and we were do-ing his set-ups for Triple Grades. While doing the GF 40 items, this pc ran a this-lifetime prenatal engram on many dif-ferent chains in a row. Whenever the pc got near that time period, whether we were running \"Anger\" or \"Pain in the Foot\", that same incident came up with the same date, duration, somat-ics, and misemotion. Then upon closer folder inspection, I found that the pc had run this incident 1 thru 9, A thru D, a total of 28 different times, each on a separate chain and it hadn't yet erased. The pc always passed through it as he went earlier than this life, so it was near the top of each chain. Looking at basics, it became obvious that this \"kink\" in the case could be called a com-posite incident or mass as it contained many different somatics, misemotions, and attitudes. The only problem was – TA slowing down and pc having extra trouble on every chain that this inci-dent was on after going past it. And the incident wouldn't blow. Here is what resolved it. I oriented the pc to the incident's date and duration and asked for somatics, sensations, pains, misemotions, and attitudes in the incident itself. We got a LFBD item with tremendous upsurge of interest and did R3R Triples to full EP. While doing this, TA action increased markedly and there was much visible relief on the whole case as the incident blew apart. The assessment list had no more reads or interest after this and I then ran R3R earlier similar incident (like a Dianetic Assist) starting from the prenatal engram down a very hot chain of births, abortions, etc., with good TA and high interest to basic and the area finally blew com-pletely. The pc's case is now moving faster and the incident hasn't come up again since. Here are the symptoms of this phenomena per this pc's folder: 1. Pc running the same incident on many different chains which doesn't erase along with these chains."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"COMPOSITE ENGRAMS 2 BTB 24.4.70 DIANETIC CS COURSE 194 17.11.12 2.

No further items on the assessment list read but, b. The pc still has these somatics. This is quite a problem. It cuts short the number of hours that can be delivered and leaves an unhappy pc. But what do you know, the list isn't null. It is suppressed or invalidated. Here is where the Dianetic auditor bridges over into Scientology, to which this action properly belongs. However, the great importance of the problem of a null or apparently dead list makes it necessary to teach the Dianetic auditor this technique. Situation: No item on the health form or list now reads, one or more have been run, the pc still has symptoms that are on the list. But they won't read. Solution: The Dianetic auditor nulls by suppress \"button\" and if needed, the invalidate button. This is normally called \"getting in the suppress button\" or \"getting in the invalidate button.\" It is called button because when you push it (say it) you can get a meter reaction. All right, the list comes out all X – nothing reading. The auditor, watching the needle out of the corner of his eye and also looking at the list (a trick you must be able to do so as never to miss a read on the meter), nulls down the list on all unrun items. \"On the item 'dizzy feeling,' has anything been suppressed?\" \"On the item 'painful head,' has anything been suppressed? (read).\" Pc: \"Yes, I suppress it all the time.\" Auditor: \"Are you interested in running that item?\" Pc: \"Yes! I kept wondering why it never read.\" The auditor then runs R3R. In the case of invalidate, if suppress doesn't read, one \"puts in the invalidate button.\" Auditor, reading an apparently null list: \"On the item 'dizzy feeling' has anything been invalidated?\" \"On the item 'sore feet' has anything been Invalidated? (read)\" Pc: \"Yes, because it didn't read in the first place.\""},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"SUPPRESS AND INVALIDATION BUTTON 2 DIANETICS TODAY, P. 344 DIANETIC CS COURSE 196 17.11.12 Auditor: \"Are you interested in running that item?\" Pc: \"Yes!\" So the auditor runs R3R. When the pc suppresses or invalidates something, the read transfers to suppress or in-validate, whichever he did. Suppress or invalidate now read, the item itself doesn't until one puts the button (suppress or invalidate) in. Don't let a Dianetic pc off auditing just because his unrun list items won't read on the meter. Get in suppress and invalidate on the items as above. It is a rapid action, not two-way comm between items. You ask the meter, not the pc. L.

A. He can grind and grind and grind (ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, on and on) with the TA going up up up and never once tell the pc to go earlier. B. He can watch the TA come down to between 2 and 3 and go loose on the last incident run, ask the pc \"erase or solid\" get a non-committal answer and send the pc earlier. He can keep sending the pc earlier and earlier on another chain without ever noticing he's finished the first chain. These are the two extreme cases. In Case A it is obvious from TA rise that the chain has an earlier incident. In Case B it is obvious from the TA that the chain erased. In A the student is preventing the pc from going earlier when he should. In B the student is forcing the pc to go earlier when he shouldn't. In both cases the student hasn't a clue of what an engram chain is. ____________________ It is marvelous how students demand \"the exact phrase\" to use as an effort to avoid having to really understand what he is doing in auditing. If a student hasn't a clue about what he is doing then a thousand goofy outnesses will keep cropping up, each one requiring (a Supervisor thinks) a special instruction. After a while you get a course text weighing one ton, and all because the student didn't grab the basic defi-nitions in the first place. A student who will do either A or B above has not grasped that an engram chain is held in place by the basic for that chain and that basic is the first time and that the clue to erasure is unburdening down to first time and erasing first time and that all picture chains are there because the first time is there. The student assumes one always asks \"solid or erasing\". Or that one always does only what the pc says. Or some such consideration."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO ERASE 2 HCOB 28.5.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 198 17.11.12 I would damned well never ask \"solid or erasing\" if I saw the TA start to climb.

Honest, it's awful easy. ____________________ A very odd outness a student will encounter when he is so dedicated to the exact words is the fast pc who erases before he can tell about it. Along about no. 3 of R3R the TA blows down and the needle F/Ns. A student who knew his business by understanding would ask, \"Did it erase?\" of course. The pc would say, \"It vanished,\" and VGIs would come in. A fast running pc on a light chain can occasionally blow an engram by inspection. If it was basic for that chain, one would be committing the crime described in B above. The pc is likely to go into another chain or a heavy protest. So you see, there's no substitution for actually understanding what's going on. There's the pc, there's the bank, there's the meter needle, there's the meter tone arm and there's the auditor, there's the procedure, there's the report. That's all the parts there are to a session.

When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be found the C/S should suspect some listing error and order an L4BRA to be done \"On Dianetic lists \" at the start of each question. Each read obtained on the list is carried earlier similar to F/N as per HCOB 14 Mar 71 \"F/N Everything\" or, preferably the list is found in the folder and properly handled in accor-dance with what read on L4BRA. Dianetic lists can be carried to an item that blows down and F/Ns. This does not mean the item found is now wholly clean. Even though it F/Ned it will in most cases need to be run on secondaries and/or engrams (R3RA Quad) to erasure and full Dianetic end phenomena. (Ref: New Era Dianetics Series 1 through 18.) A C/S must be alert to the fact that: (a) Extreme upsets and deep apathies are almost always list errors. (b) That a Dianetic list can be conceived to be a formal list and can behave that way.

These persons can be grouped under \"sources of trouble\". They include: (a) Persons intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial ties) of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even when they approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong. They, by experience, produce a great deal of trouble in the long run as their own con-dition does not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism. Their present time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous, and so long as it remains so, they should not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor. (b) Criminals with proven criminal records often continue to commit so many undetected harmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should not be accepted for processing by organizations or auditors. (c) Persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publicly attacked Scientology or been a party to an attack and all their immediate families should never be accepted for processing by a Central Organization or auditor. They have a history of only serving other ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or audi-tor. They have already barred themselves out by their own overts against Scientology and are thereafter too difficult to help, since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure.

By responsible-for-condition cases is meant the person who insists a book or some auditor is \"wholly responsible for the terrible condition I am in\". Such cases demand unusual favours, free auditing, tremendous effort on the part of auditors. Re-view of these cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing, that they are losing a planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing, that they are not as bad off as they claim, and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them, even their own families. Establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly. (e) Persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are a liability as they are forced into being processed by some other person and have no personal desire to become bet-ter. Quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrong and so do not get better. Until a personally determined goal to be processed occurs, the person will not benefit. (f) Persons who \"want to be processed to see if Scientology works\" as their only reason for being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate. News re-porters fall into this category. They should not be audited. (g) Persons who claim that \"if you help such and such a case\" (at great and your expense) because somebody is rich and influential or the neighbors would be electrified should be ig-nored. Processing is designed for bettering individuals, not progressing by stunts or giving cases undue importance. Process only at convenience and usual arrangements. Make no ex-traordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons. Not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal of notoriety, not betterment. (h) Persons who \"have an open mind\" but no personal hopes or desires for auditing of knowingness should be ignored, as they really don't have all open mind at all, but a lack of ability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyone's efforts \"to convince them\". (i) Persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better. They have a purpose far being audited entirely contrary to the auditor's and so in this conflict, do not benefit. When such persons are trained they use their training to degrade others. Thus they should not be accepted for training or auditing. (j) Persons attempting to sit in judgment on Scientology in hearings or attempting to in-vestigate Scientology should be given no undue importance. One should not seek to instruct or assist them in any way.

If a person can't see for himself or judge from the obvious, then he does not have sufficient powers of observation even to sort out actual evidence. In legal matters, only take the obvious effective steps – carry on no crusades in court. In the matter of reporters, etc., it is not worth while to give them any time contrary to popular belief. They are given their story before they leave their editorial rooms and you only strengthen what they have to say by saying anything. They are no public communication line that says much. Policy is very definite. Ignore. ____________________ To summarize troublesome persons, the policy in general is to cut communication as the longer it is extended the more trouble they are. I know of no instance where the types of persons listed above were handled by auditing or instruction. I know of many instances where they were handled by just ignoring them until they change their minds or just turning one's back. In applying a policy of cut-communication one must also use judgement as there are exceptions in all things and to fail to handle a person's momentary upset in life or with us can be quite fatal. So these policies refer to non-Scientology persons in the main or persons who appear on the outer fringes and push toward us. When such a person bears any of the above designations we and the many are better off to ignore them. Scientology works. You don't have to prove it to everyone. People don't deserve to have Scientology as a divine right, you know. They have to earn it. This has been true in every philosophy that sought to better man. All the above \"sources of trouble\" are also forbidden training and when a person being trained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings (a) to (j) he or she should be advised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanation should be given them at that time. Thus the few may not, in their own turmoil, impede service to and the advance of the many. And the less enturbulence you put on your lines, the better and the more people you will eventually help. L.

The auditor may feel that auditing did it. It didn't. The auditing given would have to be non-standard for this to happen, but the auditing is not to blame. According to my friend Dr. Stanley Lief, over a century ago Hahnemann developed a healing technology known as homeopathy which administered minute doses of medicine. The original theory seems to have been that the disease or illness was still in the body and would be released. The person would be wildly ill again and then permanently recover. This is probably a poor statement of the whole subject of homeopathy and its basic techniques may have worked well but have been lost. In any event, the phenomenon has application here. We would say that the mental image picture of the incident was stopped at a \"stuck point\" and that it would \"run out\" of itself if it were unstabilized. A touch assist can do this. The person may become wildly ill after one and then re-cover. What apparently happens is that the chain of incidents becomes unsettled and the same incident on the chain in which the person has been stuck for a long while runs out physically. It completes itself, which is to say, it finishes its cycle of action. At a hospital where I studied, this was part of the things I observed. Medicine sometimes will not work on a patient. It works on others but not on a par-ticular one. If that particular one is given mental attention even as mild as brief Freudian analysis, it will be found that medicine will now work on the person. This formed one of the first application discoveries I made. From it I inferred that function monitors structure and proceeded to investigate mental actions and reactions in the field of illness. From this came Dianetics some years later. Mental therapy prior to 1945 was so ineffective, consisting only of 19th Century psy-choanalysis and Russian and East European psychiatry, that no one else seems to have ob-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"SICKNESS    2    HCOB    14.5.69    DIANETIC CS COURSE 208 17.11.12 served, then or now, that \"mental blocks\" are able to obstruct medical treatment of a real physical nature. The proof is that when one even reduces the mental block slightly, medicines such as antibiotics or hormones will now be effective when they were previously ineffective on some patients. It is this factor which gives purely medical treatment a somewhat random appearance. The patient is \"stuck\" at some point in time. Even inadequate handling of him mentally (such as a touch assist or a poorly or partially done session or even a \"bad\" session) \"unsticks\" the person from the frozen or fixed \"stuck\" point. One of three things can now happen: 1. The person can be treated medically for his illness with greater effect. 2. The person in two or three days gets apparently sick or sicker but eventually recovers and is not subject to that exact sickness again – (it \"ran out\"). 3. No further result is noted. ____________________ These data are very useful to a Dianetic auditor or a medical doctor. A person can be ill and the illness not surrendering to the usual treatment. Brief mild Dianetic auditing can be done. The medicine may now work. An auditor who specializes in keying out locks at the first F/N will find occasionally that his preclear becomes ill in two or three days from some occasional but longstanding ill-ness which then \"runs out\" and doesn't appear again. An auditor who gives a non-standard, very poor session may find a preclear occasion-ally becoming ill within the next three or four days. The auditor and others blame the audit-ing. Any auditing is better than no auditing. Standard Dianetics is much more powerful than old Dianetics and should only be done by auditors trained to do it exactly. Sessions which are non-standard should be corrected as soon as possible, certainly within two days or you may find the preclear beginning to go through an illness cycle. The cycle was waiting to complete itself for a long time. The auditing unsettled it. It \"ran out\" physically because the pc was moved in time in the incident in which he has been \"stuck\". An understanding of this phenomena is necessary. It is useful data.

It is not fatal. That illness won't recur again as it has in the past. However, that it is not fatal to the pc is no excuse not to do a good standard job of auditing. If Standard Dianetics is used with no departure from its technology and procedure the phenomenon will not occur and no pcs experience a physical aftermath.

Now I'm going to give you the 99 Dollar kick. I have been re-searching very, very hard. I have been researching very, very, very hard actually to find out why they kick in bad pictures and why they kick in pictures at all. And, well, it's been a very long time I've been looking at this, a long time. And I finally unraveled it. So it is one hell of a breakthrough. I've been interested in it because we're working with Expanded Dianetics, and it is one hell of a breakthrough. It is actually why people get sick. Pasteur came along in the last part of the 19th century and he invented germs, and it gave everyone and his brother an awful curve, because they do exist. But in the practice there is a thing called predisposition. Here's some marvelous words for you – predisposition. In other words, before the fact, the guy is disposed to get sick. And then there's precipitation and that means what precipitates this illness. Now he's already predisposed; this guy's going to get sick. Now he's suddenly sick; that's precipitated. The illness precipitated. And then he doesn't get well and that's called pro-longation. In other words, it's just continuously gone on with. There's these three factors: pre-disposition, precipitation, prolongation. Now in most of these cases you were handling prolongation. But you also could be handling Preventive Dianetics – precipitation. Now those facts are merely academic, and they have been known to medical professions on this and other planets for a very long time. They've never known how anybody got sick. Now why do you get sick? Well, actually a body is made sick or is given accidents by the being who is running it. Now a fellow can be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and be hit by an artillery shell that is the only one fired in this century in Central Park. Well, that's not necessarily his fault. So barring that accident, which is sort of the thing that triggers it in the first place, he predisposes himself to a very marked degree to become ill. If he's going to become ill he predisposes himself to becoming ill. How does he do that? Well, he misses the boat. He takes his finger off his number, other clichés of this character. He forgets to eat his Wheeties for two months, you know. [laughs] Something like this you see. He does something. He knows this babe he's going with is out-ethics and yet he goes on going with her, that sort of thing. She knows this guy has al-ready had 115 girlfriends but she thinks she's going to be permanent. In other words, she pre-disposes herself. You got the idea?"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 2 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 212 17.11.12 Now the precipitation is exactly at this point, exactly at this point – the threat of loss. Any inkling or belief or idea that the person is going to be unsafe or insecure or is going to lose and go a little bit further south and a little less viable, if you want to use such a word. It would be innumerable, absolutely innumerable reasons why a person believes that this is go-ing to occur. But that is what is going to occur. It's going to be some loss. His existence is threatened. His positions or possessions are threatened or somebody around him is threatened. It could be on the other two flows. It could also be on flow 0. In other words, he's going to become less secure, because he's going to lose a body. Something happens to his friends, therefore, he's not going to have any friends. So, not going to have any friends, why that will make him stand alone. He knows \"he can't\" – quote, un-quote – that he can't stand alone so therefore it is inevitable that then something will happen to him and then he won't be able to support the body and then... Do you get the chain, the chain think? And that will come down to his loss of a body. And that will come down to loss. All right. Well, we know people get sick when they're threatened with loss. We have known this for a long time. As a matter of fact, on TV, in front of half of San Francisco that was at their TV sets one time, I took the announcer or the girl who was showing this. She was on before the camera, she had a cold and she was before the camera with a cold. She went off from the camera. I saw her in the waiting room. I had just given a talk, by the way, on TV. Saw her in the outside vestibule waiting to go on again, saw that she had a cold, just gave her a couple of commands of straightwire. Ping, ping and that was the end of her cold. I just asked her who she'd lost lately or something like this. And got the exact person and that was it. And she all of a sudden brightened up madly. Terrific, terrific PR. And she walks back in the room to announce her next product and instead of announcing what she's selling, she says, \"You know that fellow who was just on here... You know I had a cold when I was talking to you before and he said a couple of things to me and it's gone.\" Very good PR. I used to do this occasionally, almost a parlor trick. And I tried to teach the MOs to do it down here, and so on. They kept it up for a little while but because the TRs are not, you know, just not... not being swift about the thing, they dropped it out. But it probably would be bunged up anyway. But there you have an interesting display on a minor recall basis of somebody getting well by having a threatened loss spotted or a loss spotted, see? You can actually take somebody who looks about 49 or something, some girl maybe about 30 and she looks about 49. She's lost her husband. You erase it just as a narrative. It might take you hours and hours and hours and all of a sudden have her again looking good. And if you carried it up and did the whole chain and that sort of thing why you'd have some-body looking about 25, see. Well, we've done that sort of thing. We know about that, but what's the mechanism? Why does this exact thing happen? We know that it happens but why it happens? Now if you knew why it happened, boy could you do something with it. Well, I'll tell you why it happens. The thetan promptly and immediately mocks up mass to substitute for the loss instantly. And that is exactly what he does. And if his accep-tance level – or he is feeling goof-goof, his acceptance level, you know, what he really could"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 3 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 213 17.11.12 have is low – that is, he couldn't have very much – he will mock-up pretty bad things because nobody else wants those. And now hold your hat. One of the basic uses of mock-ups was magic curing, curing by magic. Now the way the magician works in even primitive tribes, like in the Philippines, is a woman has a horrible pain in her stomach. And the magician, with sleight of hands, will lie down and groan and so forth and produce a brightly red painted stone from his own stomach, at which moment she gets well and walks away. Well, that would be very difficult to understand if you didn't know old time match terminaling. You can actually get two things to discharge, one against the other, if they are the same or very similar. So she's got a pain in her stomach and she's told him that it just feels like a red hot stone is in there and she's chattered along. So he goes out and he gets his boy to paint a stone red in a hurry and he comes back in, he lies there and he got rid of it and so therefore she would get rid of it. And he's given her a matched terminal. There's a lot of technical stuff that we used to have about this. This is all out of crea-tive processing. But the way a thetan \"cured himself\" – quote, unquote – was if he, body got bashed in, he mocked up the incident so that that body would recover from it. Let's say his face was bashed in. So if he mocked up a bashed-in face – I'm really giv-ing you stuff way the hell and gone out of OT levels to end off the thing – but if he got a bashed-in face, the body got a bashed in face, then if he mocked up that bashed in face, then the bashed-in-ness of the body's face would of course discharge against his mock-up. And, theoretically the body's face would get all right. Well, what do you know? It works once in a while. What an idiot trick. And that's why he has mock-ups of all his accidents, and all of his illnesses. And because he did this urgently when loss is suddenly threatened and he urgently mocks up, he tricks the other mechanism. He tricks the cure mechanism. Curing by mocking up bashed-in faces. So he's about to lose the body, so the thing to do is to suddenly mock-up. And his im-pulse to mock-up will unfortunately trigger the fact that he has mocked up in the past – bashed-in faces; gutted stomach, half eaten by a lion – but that was loss, too. So it's a sympa-thetic note in it. You see, one incident's similar to the other incident. He didn't mock-up a bashed-in face except he's might going to lose his body. So his impulse to mock-up is just buck!, see. And he just hits. He doesn't say, \"Now I'm going to mock-up a body which is nice\", you see. He doesn't do that. It's pung! So Bessie Ann standing there, you suddenly say, \"Your father was just killed.\" And she goes, Pow! and she turns white and she does this or she does that and she has a horrible pain in her stomach, you got it? But because he's now lost, she will continue to mock that up and you'll get prolongation. Now she either ceases to mock it up and she gets well or she continues to mock it up and will get sick. And I don't care how many gallons of antibiotics you pour into this girl, if this happened to also result in a stomach somatic or an infectious type of wound or some-thing, it's not going to recover. It's just not going to recover. You can pump the penicillin to him just left and right and any other antibiotic or drug that you can think of. And you could make them more comfortable but that's about all. And then they suddenly break out with it"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 4 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 214 17.11.12 again and the trick is, it's just whether or not they cease to mock-up. Now when they first were working with penicillin, it, they thought, prevented, inhib-ited, suppressed the reproduction of the disease cell. The disease couldn't breed cells any-more. In other words, couldn't mock-up. That was one of the first theories on it. I don't know what theory they're operating on now. But that was one of the first theories – that it prevented mock-up. And I think it does just that, only I don't think it had anything to do with the bugs. If you can restore circulation to an area, the body itself is perfectly capable of healing up almost anything except maybe having lost both legs. But there are some animals which even grow new tails. I remember a bunch of little lizards that I had terrible overts on in my teens. Because a lizard would be sitting there and so forth and you put your finger on his tail, and he'd walk off and separate from his tail. That was it; he'd just leave his tail sitting right there and so forth and you watch him a few days later if he crawled around on screens and that sort of thing. He'd just grow a new tail. So Lord knows what bodies will or won't do because they are so considerably inter-fered with. I'm not saying that bodies will grow new bodies and all that sort of thing. So what is this cycle, see? Threat of loss, mock-up. Mock-up what? Mock-up having matched terminals, some-thing to cure it. He'd double terminalled the thing. If I remember rightly, matched terminals was four. But he'd just \"bang\". So you tell this fellow that he has lost all of his money in the bank. You can't say now that he will always get tuberculosis. You can't say he's going to get a cold. You can't say he's going to get pneumonia, you can't say he's going to come down with a nervous breakdown. You can't tell what the hell he's going to do, do you follow? Because it's only what he has in the past mocked up, to match what things have happened in the past. So the sky's the limit. So you've got this terrific variation, see. You got almost infinite variation so nobody could get down to the bottom of the mechanism because they just ran into pieces of the mechanism. Threat of loss, pong! Now we already have had people running secondaries of loss and all that, and there's a lot of technology about that. We're not necessarily talking about that now. Now I could give you more – I could go on talking about this in its theory. But I'm sure you grasped it. There are various reasons why they do this, that and the other thing. But the main point that we've got here is that Expanded Dianetics has just moved into the realm of havingness. Now we used to run havingness for a few months and then we would forget it for six months. And then I would say to people, \"I don't know why this works but it's a good thing to run havingness.\" If you listen to old tapes and that sort of thing you will find that was the case, see. It's the discussion of the thing. Puzzled me. How come? How come? \"Look around here and find something you can have. Good. Look around here and find something you can have. Good,\" and the guy feels better. You say, \"All right, all right, but the physical universe isn't necessarily his friend.\" Now yes, by observation, running havingness in any one of its hundreds of different processes"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 5 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 215 17.11.12 or forms would do some remarkable things. It often did very remarkable things. Objective processes like the CCHs, they do remarkable things. You know this is Command Control Havingness whatever this line is. Havingness is all I'm giving you the point on. Havingness, see, was part of the CCHs. It gave people havingness. Now what is havingness? Is... that is simply the idea that they can have something. It's changing their mind and basically you could put it down to a reassurance. So they're sick, so the cycle goes this way. Pardon me. They're threatened with loss, they mock-up something obsessively that they used to cure themselves with, bang, and then you come along with hav-ingness. And you show them they still have something, and so they cease to mock these pic-tures up. Now as you run these things out, you are also performing a very remarkable thing be-cause they did those obsessively and they really don't know they're doing them, and they ap-pear so magically and there are some other factors involved, which you needn't pay much attention to. But there they are. So the next time they lose something they don't mock-up that chain. Now this can go so far that a person knows that he's losing and he's got to keep it mocked up all the time. And you try to audit him, and he's rather resistive. He isn't quite sure that he wants to, \"What do you mean...\" So it looks like he wants his stomach ache. He does-n't know where his stomach ache comes from. He just knows above all other things that he had better continue to mock-up as solidly as possible, because he's had it. Now if you run out the shocks of loss, his fathers death, you run out these various things, any somatic chain, go down the chain, any emotion, any attitude – you are in – to some degree or another – straightening out this threat. But the fellow who will only run one chain, and I told you earlier that I was going to tell you some more about that. Now what he's really withholding is the fact that he's not about to give up any mass because, boy, has he had it. Now the acceptance level of people is what gets in your road in havingness. They have the idea that if they've lost something then they can't have – and havingness is just an idea. Like money, money is just an idea backed up by confidence but don't try to tell a pawn-broker that. It's terribly real to him. If you tried to tell somebody in – one of these interna-tional bankers and so forth that, or not... no, they know money isn't anything. They just throw it around in scoop shovelfuls. But you try to tell the local small town rich man, who counts on his cash as the totality of his power. Otherwise a very nasty character. You take this guy and now you try to tell him and educate him into the idea that money is not that important, you're going to lose. And you're going to lose that argument. As a matter of fact, he's going to think you're a silly ass. He knows what's important. Now that's what you're doing when you're talk-ing to some pc and he just runs one chain after another chain. Now there can be something very bugged in this pc's auditing that causes him loss. Now the strange part of it is that a per-son can't exteriorize and apparently not have anything, and be perfectly happy. Now there's an oddity. But they didn't at that moment really lose anything. Now why is it that after they've been exteriorized their TA goes up? If they acciden-tally exteriorized and weren't smoothed out in any way, what would happen to them?

If he accidentally startles himself half to death as having exteriorized or something – I've had a pc stuck on the ceiling that was begging me, for Christ's sakes, to do something. I've had phone calls in the middle of the nights from auditors and so forth. \"What do we do, she is in the attic and we can't get her out.\" [laughter, laughs] That's right, fact!

This auditor had a pc and the pc did a bunk. Well, when they really do a bunk, boy they do a bunk. They're going past Arcturus, as I've said before, at 90 miles an hour, or two light years a sec-ond, and really did a bunk. When they do that the whole body collapses and their arms will hang down and they look like an old rag doll that somebody has just grabbed half the stuff-ing's out of. They really go Bzuhhhh, that's it. They don't roll up on the floor in a prenatal or something like that. They just go. That's it, you know, boom. And this auditor talked and talked because they're still in dim communication, you see. And he talked and talked to her – \"Think of your husband, think of your children, think of...\" and so on and he talked and talked to her. He couldn't get her to come back and pick up the body at all. Till all of a sudden he happened to think, \"Think of your poor auditor,\" and she came back and picked up the body. [laughter] I was just a couple of minutes late. State cops were in my way, but a Negro had been drowned and I was just... They were in my road to a point where I couldn't get to the guy and tell him to pick up the body again, where he would have, don't you see. And they were busy resuscitating him and that was the end of that. I was too late. He really had done a bunk. He finished. We've actually brought little kids back to life and that sort of thing – just tell them \"pick up the body,\" you know. Now, you just tell them with tone 40, just say it around the vicinity. They're still around. And back they come again. As a matter of fact, Washington, DC, got very mad at a Scientologist one time. He de-cided he was going to do a bunk and he was going to drop the body and he did. He just had an unpleasant afternoon with IRS, and he came back and he just kicked the bucket. That was it, colder than ice and he just wouldn't pick up the body again. And they told him and they told him and they told him and he wouldn't. That was it. He, by the way, has shown up again call-ing for his favorite cigars at two years old. [laughter, laughs] But anyhow, the upshot of all of this is, is this opens the door to a fabulous amount of action on your part which will sometimes look very magical, because remedy of havingness in various ways. Now the only thing that gets wrong with the thing is, \"What can the guy have?\" And you will find that I have just given a demonstration here to the Flag Medical offi-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 7 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 217 17.11.12 cers which is HCO B 7 Apr 1972, \"Touch Assists, Correct Ones\", which I call your attention to. Now what's that all about? Yes, well, this is all about equalizing and it says at the begin-ning that this is how you tell a medical doctor about it. \"On assists, when you are speaking with medicos you talk to them in terms of restoring comm in blood and nerve channels.\" No-tice that is in there; because that isn't what you're doing. You're giving him back the having-ness of his body. And if he finds he can occupy this body and he can have it back, he will start turning off the obsessive 'mock it up'. Guy runs into a wall with a car. First thought – lose the body, mock it up. So he's got a nice engram sitting there and he will let go of it when you run a touch assist because he becomes aware of the fact that he still has the body. It might be in a little second hand shape but he's still got one. And if you remind him of this today, and the other thing that people don't do with a touch assist is they don't give them the next day. I don't know, what the hell, we got quickie touch assists of all other things. Sure, it's short sessions. You just run it to a cognition. But where's the touch assist the next day, and where's the touch assist the day after that and where's the touch assist the next day? Oh, the guy didn't get to-tally well, so there must be something still there. The body's ability to recover is phenomenal. Why won't it recover? Well, he gets to thinking it over and he meets a friend and he says... and the friend says to him, \"Boy, you sure were lucky. I had my brother was killed in an accident like that. Yeah...\" It's a little loss, you see. And he goes out and sees his wrecked car, a loss. You give him another touch assist, the guy says, \"Well, I still got a body.\" You get the idea. Now that could keep up, you could also run out the incident, which is fine, and what you should do. But the touch assist will go all the way down to somebody who was very un-conscious. And you tell them to – they can say \"yes\" by squeezing your hand once and say \"no\" by squeezing it twice. And they're unconscious and they've been in a coma for weeks and you come in and you start picking up their hand and making them touch the bed and make them touch the pillow and that's another type of touch assist. Now all of a sudden they come out of the coma but it's sort of little by little. They're just mocking up being awful dead, that's the only thing they're doing. They got a loss so, well, \"I'm dead now.\" So they're just mocking it up so thoroughly and it's too horrible, facing life is just too horrible for words so that on a gradient, why, they come up the line gradually and come out. It looks quite magical. Well, what are you really doing? You're restoring their havingness. In other words, you are bringing about, again, a higher state of security. You'll find out that every person you are operating with at this particular moment and anyone who will be run on Dianetics, on Expanded Dianetics, is suffering – because they're ill and not doing well – they're suffering from a threat of loss. Their security is bad. You'll find out that you'll pick up people after their comm evs or before their comm evs or something or they're about to be off-loaded or shot or demoted or... this goes hand in glove with it. What is that? Security. Now their security is so bad that nothing will restore this security apparently. If you just go on auditing out those pictures, they themselves are the last thing they've got, in spite of the fact they're killing them. John McMasters, after he got tagged and so forth, the poor guy let himself in for a hell"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 8 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 218 17.11.12 of a blackmail line-up. And this guy, however, afterwards began to go around and say, \"Well now, Ron should let people have their pictures.\" But he said that after he himself got into se-vere trouble. He actually apparently got across the lines of the Mafia. They really set him up to fall on his face. And the loss was great and then he was busy trying to compensate for this one way or the other, which he easily could have done. But he was finding some fault about it and the thought, you know, \"Well Ron ought to let people have their pictures\". Well, what the hell. It says a Clear can mock anything up. But you don't have to do it unknowingly. It says it in Book 1. You want to know how far a Clear can go. The ability to mock-up is an ability. But if it is done unconsciously it's hell of a liability. But nobody says people shouldn't have pictures. Only let's be a little selective about it. [laughter] Now if the guy was good enough, he could mock-up another body. So he dimly recalls that this is true. And that probably is what gives him this sudden impulse to mock it up. But he knows he can't have, and knows he can't mock-up another body so he's got to repair the one he's got. So the first thing he does is send for a doctor. Because the doctor comes in, he, himself, is engaged in curing himself. Now how is he engaged in curing himself? Now he's engaged in curing himself by mocking up the terminal which matches the condition of his body when it was killed in the Roman Army in... only that isn't what's wrong with him. So anyhow, the doctor comes in. He instantly keys in. But he still has some reassur-ance. So the bedside manner is very, very important to a doctor. Because, because he's there reassuring the guy, he's trying to reassure the guy the guy will at least still go on having this body. So actually if his bedside manner was good enough, the guy would get well. Now, I mention to you and have mentioned in lectures, a guy who treated TB could always detect TB just by laying his hands on a person's chest. Now the people got well be-cause he expected them to. Just as simple as that. And that was all there was to it. It sounds too simple. But he was very, he's a person that you would be very aware of. So they expected him to, he expected the patient to get well. The patient had no other choice, to get well. He was down there just south of Pasadena in California. He had a hospital down there for a long time. He was very famous. He's probably the most famous name in TB in the world, was. So what's this? What's this? Well actually, if you run out the bad pictures, now the guy has an explanation for what has been worrying him. Because each time, do you see, he was about to lose something and then he mocked something up and so forth, he was worrying about whether or not he was going to lose it and this problem and so forth. So he's still got the problem of how he might have lost it, and he's still trying to answer that. And when you run the engram chain you erase that and then you erase his overts on the thing and you erase a few other things, and what have you got? Well, he is relieved now because he isn't obsessively mocking this up. But he will only be relieved if, at the same time, you haven't overwhelmed him by trying to take too much away."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 9 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 219 17.11.12 Now if you suddenly go down the track and try to run pain out of this character and try to run heavy engrams out of this character, that's too much loss. So he doesn't do that, so he will come back and not respond. He'll natter at you and so forth, and he sounds like he's got withholds. Well, yes he does have withholds. And the main withhold that he's got is he's just not about to give up any mass, thank you. He's finished it, only he doesn't even really know that he himself has the withhold. So he's very uncommunicative. So therefore, we have two things that a Dianetic spe-cialist would have to be able to do. And one of those things would be to run a touch assist. Sounds remarkable. And then run a touch assist sufficiently well that you remember to run it the next day, and the next day and the next day. And really run a proper touch assist. And we have this 7 April HCO B. I did this quite a little time ago. It is not the date of the touch assist. It's the date of the HCO B just to keep the time track straight. But this gives an explanation that will pass most anything, and it does respond like that. Standing waves, and the thing you're liable to come up against is the standing wave is not necessarily described in basic elementary physics. Now you're talking about nuclear phys-ics and so forth, and that is, a wave form comes up and either because it meets another wave form, or for some other reason, it just becomes a rigid form. If you can imagine an ocean wave not any longer rolling but just sitting there all peaked. Well, electricity strangely enough will do this and a thetan is very good at this because he's trying to stop further injury so when he mocks up at that point, he mocks it up with a stop. And he's got the standing wave stuck in his spine and his arms, legs. They're all through the body. He'll just be a mass of standing waves. As you do a touch assist, two things happen. It smoothes those out because his inten-tion is, attention'7s going down the line. But that's just the mechanical action. The truth of the matter is you're making him aware of the fact that he's still got a body – smoothly, smoothly, smoothly. Now if you add to this a good bedside manner and you expect that he will recover, he is reassured. And his reassurance is such that he's willing to have another go at it, without keeping it all so muddily mocked up. There's some hope. Now the medical profession and other, the drug professions and so forth talk about hope. That's all they talk about – hope, hope, hope, hope. So it must be a somewhat interest-ing thing. But it's a rather pathetic thing to read a medical conference where they've talked for seven days and it's all about some miracle drug that somebody someday might develop. It's really remarkable. \"We have a series of two cases we have tried this on and there is much hope for it and we expect, and of course we must be conservative in it.\" These wild, wild imaginative some-thing or others. They don't read their last decades' minutes. They had the same number of drugs for which they had great hope ten years ago but most of them are gone. Most of them are gone.   7 Editor's note: Slip of the tongue: It smoothes those out because his attention's going down the line."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 10 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 220 17.11.12 Now it's not that they can't do a job. It's not that they aren't needed. Nobody's saying anything about this at all. When you get a broken leg, you had certainly better have somebody who could put the leg back together again. But now to get it healed. Because the guy has got a broken leg over this broken leg. And now we're into the whole explanation of what is psychosomatic medicine. That is the whole explanation of it. Now later on, if somebody said to him, \"You're a dog,\" at the moment he got his leg broken, he will think of himself as a dog while he limps, perhaps. And there we get mental aberration. This strange thought that keeps occurring to him. You got it? So there really isn't anything else to it but the fact that you, by reassurance – you've got a hope factor there. You can imagine running a touch assist now, \"Well, feel my finger. Thank you, very good. Well, there's probably not much chance for him so I... Feel my finger, you know. OK, fine.\" You could say, \"Well that matches his tone.\" But it doesn't match what's wrong with him. Now sometimes he'll tell you, \"Oh, there just isn't any hope for it anyhow,\" and so forth. He's just chattering. He was responding to the same mechanism. But his havingness is so low that he doesn't think it's possible. But at the same time he doesn't think it's possible and he's given up and practically quit and so forth, why, he is still accepting, to some degree or another, his havingness. So therefore your first level of entrance which you can pick them up from, from all the way into total unconsciousness, coma for three months in a hospital on up through to doing a touch assist to do something or other. The guy is really quite, he's quite ill. He has pneumonia or something. He's quite ill. They've come in, pumped him full of antibiotics, fine, alright. Touch assist is about all you can do to him. He can't even, he can't even concentrate long enough to talk to you. High temperature, something like that. It makes him aware of the fact he's got it. You say, \"Yeah, well it's a sick body so who'd want it?\" Well, once in a while you run into somebody who says, \"I don't want this body anymore. It's too old and too messed up and I don't want this body anymore. And I don't want this body anymore,\" and so forth and they're going on and on and on. You're just talking to somebody at the lowest rungs of hav-ingness. Their idea of loss is fabulous. So a person who is very, very ill, you could pick them up the line with techniques like a touch assist, of which there are several. I won't even try to catalog them at this particular time. There's an awful lot of literature on this. I did this basically because there's some errors in the literature. Other people have written them. They've never seen me do one. So I did one, so let somebody write it up. You call actually make an unconscious person touch a blanket, \"Touch that blanket,\" you know, \"Touch that blanket.\" Still talking, still communicating, \"Touch that blanket, thank you,\" moving their hand. And so forth. You can do a touch assist on them and so forth. Hold onto their hand and say, \"When you have felt my finger, squeeze your hand.\" The guy's to-tally unconscious. You wouldn't believe that he would, but he will. He'll give you a little pulse, a little pulse and so on. Touch at the knees, thighs and the feet, the head and the ears and so forth each time. And he'll start picking up on it after a while. He's getting what medical"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 11 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 221 17.11.12 care he can, fine. That's all part of the same thing. Now where does havingness come in? Well, now you've got the session, and you had certainly better learn how to run havingness. And if you're going to do anything at all with Specialist Dianetics, you better learn something about using havingness. And I'm not going to tell you all there is to know about havingness in this particular lecture because there's a lot to know about it. But PAB 72, page 25, gives you material about havingness. Now you realize, of course, that all of this material is giving you, by observation and experimentation, is giving you the observation, experimentation and so forth, that went on about the subject of havingness. It isn't until now that you have the exact reason it works. Now in the tapes on the subject, in lectures and in this literature itself – I haven't read it all – it maybe, I said I do not know how it works or why it works, so just ignore that in the litera-ture. This just tells you how to do some of these things. We also have PAB 23, 2nd April 54, and it's an item – Havingness, \"Starvation for en-ergy is the keynote of any case that maintains facsimiles in restimulation.\" Now as you read all this, you will say, \"Well, he knew all this all the time. Why are we talking about this now?\" No, that's an observation. I didn't know why. See, I didn't know how. It's true, starva-tion for energy. Yeah, but starvation for energy, that's saying something else. So the guy's energy-starved, so he'll maintain a facsimile and so forth. What, what, see that's not quite on the groove. You got it? But again it is perfectly honest because I did not know exactly why it worked. But I knew it's a starvation for energy. Guy's starved for energy, he'll maintain a fac-simile. Why? All right. There's Professional Auditor's Bulletin number 49, The Remedy of Having-ness. \"Just why a thetan should let himself so completely snarled up in energy might be an entire mystery to anyone who did not realize that a thetan has to cut down his knowingness and his total presence in order to have a game.\" True, perfectly true, but it is not the basic reason. All this, however, is material which you should know. Now it's not for release HCO Training Bulletin June 11th, 1957 \"Training and CCH processes not to be copied. The varia-tions in some of the most potent processes are not included in this Training Bulletin but will appear in the Student Manual when published in September, '57.\" Now this was labeled that way simply because it was experimental at that time. You find out this is all standard now. What are you looking at? You're looking at the TRs. But they basically were a havingness process. Now we have CCH 88, Enforced Nothingness – HCO B April 11th '58. Now you'd say, \"Well, the easy way out of this is just to cure him of mocking up these facsimiles and take away this automaticity. This automatic 'mock-it-up' the second he's going to lose some-thing. That'd be easy.\" Noooooo, nooo, no. I'm afraid that isn't true and that's why you saw creative havingness, the creative processing laid away in mothballs, it's not in its grave. Be-cause he can restimulate moments of loss and think he is losing harder and therefore mock-up harder and they get solid. You can shoot a TA up every now and then on pcs. You could do remarkable things with creative processing but it has a limited action in that every few pcs you really lay an egg. So it's too limited, see."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 12 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 222 17.11.12 HCO B of September 12th '58 gives havingness, new commands. Factual havingness – \"Look around here and find something you have. Look around here and find something that you would continue. Look around here and find something that you would permit to vanish.\" Now that isn't one, two, three because they can't do the third one usually until you've done the first one. But sometimes they'll obsessively do the third one – permit to vanish and so forth. Now that opens up a process which I don't know if we have on record here. That opens up a process which is fabulous, it's absolutely fabulous. It's the weirdest process that anybody ever had anything do to with. And you know the process but it may not be expressed in these issues which I'm giving you here. And that is, \"What will be here in...?\" \"What around here will be here in one minute?\" Now that's right on the button because that's contin-uum into the future. And that's why it was so weird. The reactions to that process. \"Look around here and find something that will be here in... \" and you keep extending the time span. And sometimes you, the guy is, says no, he can't find anything, you see, for a minute, you know. Well, it's too bad because you've given him a lose. So you always cut it early, you know. What'll be here in one half a second? One second? Something like that. Oh, yeah, he can find things that will be here in a second. Then you can build him up to a minute. \"What'll be here in ten minutes?\" \"Uhhhhhh.\" But you keep building him up. You see what you're do-ing? You're giving him a future, which is right on the groove of this. Loss, he thinks he's go-ing to lose it forever. All right. Now we're really getting down someplace here. Here's April 21, HCO B April 21, '60, \"Presession Processes\", HCO B 1 September 1960, \"Presession Two\", HCO B of September 8th, 1960, which is the Presession of the first Saint Hill ACC and it gives commands for pre-session II-X – that's experimental. And by the time that had been grooved in, we then got 20 – HCO B 22 September 1960, \"Presessions and Regimens\". Regimen would be a certain settled schedule of things. Now strangely enough this Regimen One-Six in here is ask the pc what's wrong with him and we will run, something else. Sounds like if you read it fast and if an audi-tor just did it time and time again, it'd be perfect Q & A. So it's things like that that laid some of these... so that the auditor starts going something like this: \"What do you think is wrong with you?\" \"My wife.\" \"OK, we'll run a wife. All right, what about your wife? Good. All right, what's wrong with you?\" It won't work. You'd have to flatten what you ran. You had to know something about F/Ns and so forth. All right. And then we've got 29 September 1960, HCO B, Havingness and Duplica-tion. And then we've got 6 October 1960, Thirty-Six New Presessions. Got such things on it as \"Point out something in this room you could confront\". And what this did would be have and confront which merely asked the fellow to go slightly toward something when you said confront. You know, there it is, don't run away. And \"have\" would be an actual flow of some kind or another. But actually these are not necessarily \"run a have and a confront\". You can still do this. These things are all runnable but it isn't necessarily true that you would have to run an alternate side. The only, you're not worried about flows. Most of these things were put out on the basis that there were flows, and there could be a stuck flow and the fellow would boil off and so on. So there had to be a balanced flow of some kind. Boil off is usually a flow running too long in one direction, is the datum back of that. So you broke the command to get the flow going the other way."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 13 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 223 17.11.12 And here's October 27, 1960, \"Revised Case Entrance\", and it gives you failed help which, of course, is reassurance. Did you ever think of help as a havingness process? Yeah, well, that's the bedside manner of the doctor. If you're a confident sounding and looking audi-tor why you will find out there is no great difficulty in getting a pc up the line. Well, so if you ran out all the time he wasn't helped he might have some... and he's sure been trying to help himself. Now this gives you 14 September '61 is \"New Rudiments Commands\". But we wouldn't be too interested in that at this time. And CCH data. I remember when I really ran some CCHs at Saint Hill on a TV demonstration. And all of the, all of the auditors in the lec-ture hall groaned and Reg Sharpe was terribly disappointed and people were actually quite upset because it was quite obvious that I didn't know how to run CCHs. [laughter, laughs loudly.] The way you ran the CCHs is you acted like you were mad as hell and overran each process. [laughs] And I was just going to a change or a no change on the pc from one to the next to the next to the next to the next. The pc felt great, but that was beside the point. [laughs] You could have knocked me down with a feather. They were all very polite about it, of course. [laughs] I had to reteach everybody how to run CCHs and they started getting some results. HCO B 9 February '69, here's some havingness and so on. And then there is Scientol-ogy 8-8008 and in this edition at least there is Expanded GITA. Now this was a mock-up process, positive gain and this is a mock-up process. But this all of a sudden opens the door to something with you, because this is a marvelous list of items, what a gorgeous list of items. You're gonna half kill a pc if you ran some of these, I mean, ran them as engrams. I'm just looking, men stopping at motion, changing motion, women changing motion and so forth. Things, God, the devil, spirits, bacteria, glory, dependence, responsibility, wrongness, right-ness, insanity and so on. A lot of those items, though, are very, very hot attitudes, very, very hot attitudes. When you ask a pc to give you his attitudes, you're really leaving him in the dark. The guy has got 1,665 misunderstood words just on the morning papers he's read, much less any-thing sensible. You expect this guy to say something to you; he isn't going to say anything to you. Say, \"What attitude do you have?\" They don't know the word for it, see? But if you did this sort of thing you'd have to clear words. See, if you're giving him the words they have to be cleared. If he's giving them to you, why, you usually don't. But this is interesting because it gives you really what's going on. A person can waste something before they can have it. And you can actually watch somebody walking around and working and you can tell after a little while exactly what he has to waste. That's the funniest thing you ever saw in your life. You know what he can have but, you'll be able to, you'll be able to spot finally what he can have. But you can spot what he'll have to waste. One of the tricks. Well, one guy, he could waste file cards. I was watching somebody work one day and boy could he waste file cards. Wow. He actually needed about four file cards, so he wasted about 50 to get about 4. I was watching all this proceeding and so on. That was all he was wasting around there. He was wasting file cards. He really could waste them. Gave him a great deal of pleasure, too. Now, by the simple action of just handing him file cards and which file card did he have, so on, and throw them away dramatically not covertly, and put a"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 14 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 224 17.11.12 hundred file cards in the waste basket one at a time and so forth. Why, the guy finally got reluctant to do this. What's the matter? \"Well, they might have some value, you know.\" [laughter, laughs] I used to wonder if sometime some persons weren't wasting, if some persons actually weren't wasting processing or wasting something like that. They couldn't have it and so on. And I've never found anything to support this really. But I know they will waste things in an organization, like machines and things like that. And they will sometimes say they don't want to be audited or something like that. But it usually has another explanation. Processing is ter-ribly valuable. Page 120 of Scientology 8-8008 and then we have PABs Book 4, PAB No. 50, \"Rem-edy of Havingness – The Process\". It says, \"When in doubt remedy havingness. This was a motto which can well be followed by an auditor doing any process on the preclear.\" That's so true. Now what does this do, what does this do to your Expanded Dianetics? I'm going to tell you everything you do with havingness because, as you see, there's quite a few references there and there's probably quite a few tapes on the subject, if they're still around. Well it means you can start a session with havingness. And it means you could end one with having-ness. And it would be something like putting a high speed zip onto your line-up. We've got one case right now who always runs the same thing. He's not about to run anything. It doesn't handle what's wrong with him, too, he said. I think it's remarkable. Been audited all over the place and now he's telling us he has a hidden standard. He's sort of fend-ing off the auditor, he's being rather contemptuous, sneering, snide is the term being used and so on. But he's – here he is now telling us that he never made any case gain, or words to that effect, or something of that sort, and he always runs the same thing and we haven't handled what he did. Well, he's had XII auditing and everything else. Now what's the matter with this guy? From what I've told you in this lecture, it should be rather obvious! He is on his last thetan penny, boy! If you made him spend that he would be a bankrupt thetan. [laughs] So, now, I can't tell you precisely whether this is true or not, whether he would best respond to some touch assists or to some havingness, but that would depend on how sick he is. That would depend on how sick he is. If he's so sick that it's difficult for him to sit in the chair, it certainly would be touch assists. Where the touch assist might have some slight ad-vantage over trying to talk to him, because he's very withholdy. If you can get him to answer you on a touch assist you could at least get him into communication. Now, in-sessionness could always be increased with a touch assist. Now I find out touch assists have normally been thrown into – relegated, I was going to say, which means put over into – the category of, the guy has banged his hand or burned his wrist or something, and they think that is it. Otherwise, if he's just got a slow pain in the back or something like this, or a constant earache or an infected boil or something, you wouldn't use a touch assist. Well, I don't know where that think would come from. You see, it was never there to begin with, it's just that they get used for that, so people think they are for that. Somebody has a tremendous amount of stomach upset. Well, if you gave him a touch assist, you couldn't audit him maybe too much, but you could give him a touch assist every day you would find, until"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 15 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 225 17.11.12 all of a sudden, he'd start improving. As a matter of fact, if you gave touch assists long enough you can get rid of warts. He's probably weeks and weeks of five or ten minutes of touch assists a day, weeks. See, two things have happened, nobody has continued the process to find out what it could do and it's just been relegated to a quickie emergency on a little local injury. Well, it has much wider application because you're giving the guy a body. He knows he hasn't got one, so he can only waste one or something. But you can change his orientation. Now you leave a touch assist flat or you overrun one or something like that and you mess it up one way or the other, and then, of course, you're in trouble. But it's pretty hard to mess one up unless you get very absent-minded. The guy has the faintest of cognitions and so forth, come off the thing. Where he has a surge of pain, and so on, that was a jolt somatic, you say \"Well, that's good, that's fine.\" If the person was in very good condition it would be fine, too. It wouldn't be needed the next day. But you're dealing with sick people. They're going to be sick the next day, and do you follow? They've been knocking themselves off for the last many quadrillion so they're expected to get sick in a split instant – I mean, get well in a split instant when they been sick so long, it isn't going to be done. There is no magic button be-cause a thetan doesn't convince that fast. [laughs] So, the long and the short of it is that you could take that case that we were just dis-cussing and you might find out just experimentally, just run him on a bit of a touch assist or something like that. You could also find his hidden standard because there's a computation sitting there someplace or another. But, it would be very very smart, before you began that session to find out anything about hidden standard or something like that, is find a havingness process that worked. Run that, briefly at the beginning of the session. If you can get a having-ness process to run to an F/N, why great. Then if you get the right one, why, it'll produce an F/N. And at the end of the session, why, finish him off so as to make up for the mass you've taken away. That's what's important. Now, what you're doing, is straightening up his obses-sive, cockeyed mocking-upedness. So you see, as you're running it out you're straightening up the bank. Well, that's important to do that because that's what's making him goofy. But at the same time you give him back some physical universe. Now, you're going to find some guys who won't want anything to do with this physical universe. Now they're not about to have anything to do with it, and so forth, but they will take some reassurance and that's havingness, too. So, in such a case they will respond to one or another havingness process. And the test of a havingness process is to go way the hell and gone back, I'll give you a thing, is you get a can squeeze, run a couple of commands of the thing and if it broadens the command [can] squeeze you've got his havingness process. Now, it might be of interest to you on this case we were just discussing, that if we simply gave him a little bit of a can squeeze, you might find that he had a very very small movement. Now, as long as, then, a person on a can squeeze has a short movement you know you're up against havingness. That is, it doesn't give you much of a surge when the cans get squeezed. So you just better make it the standard operating procedure; pick up the cans and he's comfortable and you've got the session all going and so forth, give it a can squeeze. Now, if he's got a whole dial wham, and that sort of thing you're just going to be wasting your time running any havingness. Go ahead and run what you're going to run. But if this person was ill you would still follow it up with some havingness at the end of the session. Now, you say"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 16 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 226 17.11.12 \"Well but he had this terrific win and he's F/N, cog, VGIs and he just feels marvelous and something changed then and boy, that's great!\" Well let him tell you all about that and so forth and run some havingness. Because he's been sick. Now what's the test? He's been sick, that's the test. He wouldn't be getting Expanded Dianetics unless he were running a bit sick. Do you follow? Well, why is he sick? Because he is mocking up obsessively trying to make up for his great loss! That's all there is to it. That's why he's sick. And it's as simple as that. So now if you weave havingness into it by a can squeeze test, if you don't get much surge, you better find his havingness process right away. And it doesn't matter, you don't wear one out today, and never use it again tomorrow, and that sort of thing. They run for a long time, eventually they'll run out. And then you find a new havingness process. You're alerted by the fact that the fact this guy isn't doing too well on this havingness process now. He was, but he isn't now. And it's not a precise action. But it is a precise action to get a can squeeze, find out how long it goes. If it isn't go-ing to go very much he's not going to give you any engram. Also, he isn't going to erase his pictures. And you have somebody who will not erase a picture, who does not get an erasure. Now, you can straighten it out with an L3B, and you should. But, you will find, magically, that the individual will all of a sudden begin to erase pictures when his havingness is up enough to make up for the fact that he is certain that he has lost all. It's certain he's losing, losing all, mocking up obsessively, and so forth. Well, you show him he's still got something left. Now, there's probably more that can be worked out on this subject because you make a breakthrough like this, there's more can be worked out. But there's sure plenty of material here to work with. And if you do that, and you make that your standard operating procedure on the thing, well, I can assure you, you will have some remarkable changes of case. Not only will the guy then straighten out his bank, but then he gets into the reassurance that it's okay. Now those incidents then which have to do with threat and loss and that sort of thing are of great interest to you. They're of considerable interest to you. And when he gives one of those, let us say, you had a long fall on \"mother's death\" and you had a long fall on \"exhilara-tion\" I am sure that you would take \"mother's death.\" You're not going to push the whole sub-ject over into running nothing but losses because there's many covert ways to lose things. Now, do these guys make sense to you that you're auditing right now? They make more sense. All right. Well, I'm sure we can make some fast headway on the thing. And there's one or two or three of these cases you would find yourself grinding a bit on, otherwise. But the thing to do with them, the thing to do with them is to restore their havingness. Those that are chronically ill and are gimping around and falling on their heads, of course, hard to get into an auditing chair, and talk, that sort of thing, well, you've still got touch assists that you can work on them. So, just as a standard action you can add it in the program. One more thing I want to tell you about a program is every time you add something onto a C/S except rudiments, you put it over on the margin in the program. In other words, you don't write a C/S, something or other, something or other, without putting it over on the program, if it's extra to the program. So therefore, the program doesn't look like you ran three"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ILLNESS BREAKTHROUGH 17 XDN-4 – 7.4.72 DIANETIC CS COURSE 227 17.11.12 actions but actually the C/Ses say that you ran fourteen. Do you follow? You never, by the way, run, never run a case at all without a program. Don't ever pick up a folder and run with it without a program of some kind or another. Always do a program. You say, well, it's only going to be one C/S that's different and there's only one session, we're just going to do one session on this thing, there's no sense in putting up a program. One session, one program. Be-cause you'll find out that'll become two sessions and then it'll be something else. And then you'll wander of into the wild blue yonder and nobody's got... you haven't got a programmed case. And that's where they all go adrift. So, that means you had better amend the programs which you have on these people. Just amend it to whatever action you're going to take with havingness. And that could be simply amended by just writing across the top of your pro-gram, or over to the side or so forth, \"Havingness added each session\" or something, or \"Hav-ingness added before the body of a session is begun,\" or whatever you've decided to do with the guy with regard to havingness. Because you're not going to start all of your sessions by running havingness because it won't be necessary. But you're going to have them start some of them for sure. And actually if you just ask the guy to can squeeze once you can tell whether you're going to have to run this case with havingness before we start a session and then run it afterwards. All of them you're going to run the havingness afterwards, that's for sure. Okay, all right. Well I hope I haven't given you too many misunderstoods. And I've given you a rather long lecture here, actually it's a pair of lectures, and if you noticed, they're quite separate one from the other. So that you... you should have very very good luck on this because you're straightening out the two things which make a person ill. When I look at the number of doctors and the number of places and times and when I look at myself back in the West Indies or some place like this, God knows when and where, and so on, I always used to look at these cats and I used to say there's something to know. There's something here to know. What is it? I've been asking the question for a long time, finally answered it with a crash, so there you are.

Ron Hubbard given 3 Oct. 1968) The Touch Assist is a form of Dianetic Assist. It is given to an injured person. A Con-tact Assist as written up elsewhere is faster than a Touch Assist but is not always possible. It is done by having the injured person close his eyes and giving the command \"feel my finger\". You touch him with your finger and he is supposed to feel the finger. Don't articu-late the command more than you have to. The pc gets the idea very quickly. After a few commands you will find he will give you a blink or a nod. You then knock off the verbalization. You wait for him to acknowledge after touching his body each time. The most difficult area to do an assist on is the head. The head and nerve system of the body is a pain absorption cushion. With an electric or impact shock you will find there is a wave of shock or pain goes through the body. In the case of a hit head you will find a wave of shock that went all the way down the nerve channels, through the spine to the extremities of the body. You will normally find somebody who has had a head injury has something wrong with his spine afterwards. The shock wave is locked up in his spine. So the touch assist should include going from the head to the extremities of the body. You are just trying to get him back onto his feet as later on you will run it out as an engram. The touch assist is not just in the area of the head or injured part. You have to ap-proach the injury, go away from the injury, approach closer, go away further from the injury and so on until you gradually get to where you can touch the injured part. When going away and coming up you. Try to follow the nerve channels of the body which includes the spine and the limbs. There are certainly relay points like the knees and the elbow and the finger tips. These are the points you head for. These are all points the pain can get locked up in. What you are trying to do is to get the communication again flowing through the body because the shock of injury stopped it. If you do anything on the right side of the body you also do it on the left side of the body. If you do a touch assist on an injured hand you go further away from the body and closer to the injury and touch and pass the injury. Then you do exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the body."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"TOUCH ASSISTS 2 BTB 5.5.69 DIANETIC CS COURSE 230 17.11.12 If the fellow is bleeding from an artery and is going to bleed to death in the next few minutes you first apply a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and then proceed with the touch as-sist. When you have got him somewhat up the line end off the assist and let the Medicos have their day setting any bones, patching him up, morphine etc. Try to minimize conversation around the injured person. Conversation just puts con-tent into the engram. When the structural trouble is patched up and he is somewhat recovered a day or two later, or as soon after as possible, you give him a session that runs out the engram. This is the Touch Assist. If done in the standard way as described it produces miracu-lous results and greatly speeds up healing time. Brian Livingston CS5 for L.

Very often antibiotics do not function unless the illness or injury is also audited. The basic failures of antibiotics apparently stem from a traumatic condition which prevents the medical treatment from functioning. When a person is medically treated for an illness, it is best to back up the action with auditing. Sometimes the patient is too ill to be fully audited. It is difficult to audit someone who is running a temperature. In such a case, let the antibiotics bring the temperature down before auditing. But if the temperature does not come down, in the interest of the patient's recovery, auditing should be done. It is usually too late when the patient is in a coma. But one can still reach a patient who is unconscious by touching the patient's hand to parts of the bed with \"Feel that (object)\". A patient will sometimes respond to commands even when \"unconscious\" if you tell them to squeeze your hand to acknowledge they have done the command. Years ago the auditing of unconscious persons was worked out and successfully done. Needless to say, auditing any sick person requires the most exact, careful auditing, strictly by the Auditor's Code. POSTOPERATIVE AUDITING A person who has been operated on or medically or dentally treated or a mother who has just delivered a child should have the engram audited out as soon as possible by Dianetic R3R. The after-effects of anaesthetics or the presence of drugs or antibiotics is to be ne-glected. The usual action is to 1. Get them medical treatment."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"ANTIBIOTICS   2   HCOB   27.7.69   DIANETIC CS COURSE 234 17.11.12 2. Audit them as soon as possible on the illness or injury. 3. Audit them again when they are well. 4. Get them a Review if they seem to be showing much later after-effects despite Dianetic auditing. Heavy doses of vitamin B1, B complex and C should accompany all such auditing actions. __________________ SAVING LIVES All this comes under the heading of saving lives. At the very least it saves slow recovery and bad after-effects and resultant psychoso-matic illnesses. Dianetics is the first development since the days of Rome that changes and improves the rate of healing. Dianetics is also the first development that removes traumatic barriers from the path of healing. Medicines and endocrine compounds quite often are effective in the presence of Dianetic auditing which were once inexplicably ineffective in many cases. The barrier to healing was the engram. With that removed, healing can occur. OBJECTIONS TO USE Any barriers or objections to using Dianetics to assist the effectiveness of medicine or to increase the rate of or even secure effective recovery place the patient at risk as certainly as failing to use antiseptics. Such objections can be dismissed as stemming from barbaric or superstitious mentali-ties or from motives too base to be decent. It would not be possible to count the number of lives Dianetics saved in the 19 years even before the advent of Standard Dianetics. Few human betterment activities have been so widely successful and so uniformly helpful as Dianetics.  L. RON HUBBARD  Founder LRH:ldm.ei.rd"}]
