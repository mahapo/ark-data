REFERENCES HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 19 JULY 1971 Remimeo C/S Series 52 INTERNES The word Intern or Interne means \"An advanced graduate or a recent graduate in a professional field who is getting practical experience under the Supervision of an experienced worker\". An Internship then is serving a period as an Interne, or an activity offered by an org by which Experience can be gained. Internships have been arranged this long while for every auditing class. The apprenticeship of an auditor is done as an org Interne. C/Ses very often have Internes on their lines and sometimes have trouble with getting them to audit. The why of this is that the Interne seldom knows the definition of the word \"Interne\" (which is as above). They sometimes think they are still students. They do not know this fact: A course graduate becomes an auditor by auditing. That means lots of auditing. The failure of \"auditors\" is that they go from one level to the next, HDC to IV to VIII, without ever becoming an auditor for that Class. Thus you can get a silly situation where a Class IX can't audit or C/S well. Thus you get tech going out. An HDC graduate who doesn't then audit under an experienced Case Supervisor who knows and demands the standard actions rarely gets to be an HDC Auditor. It takes tons of hours to make a real Dianetic auditor who can toss off standard sessions and get his routine miracles. So if an HDC doesn't Interne, but simply goes on to the Academy Courses or SHSBC he has skipped his apprenticeship as a Dianetic Auditor. If he gets his Class VI and never Internes but goes on to VIII – well, we now have somebody who has long since lost touch with the reality of why he is studying."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTERNES 2 C/S SERIES 52 – HCOB 19.7.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 2 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Therefore you can't take a Class VI graduate who was never a Dianetic Auditor and Interne him as a VI. He'll goof-goof-goof. So you have to Interne him as an HDC. When he can turn out flawless Dianetic sessions on all kinds of pcs you can Interne him as a IV etc. In other words you have to catch up all neglected Apprenticeships. I don't care if the guy is an VIII, if he wasn't ever a Dianetic Auditor and a Class VI Auditor and isn't Interning as an VIII then he is only a provisional. Flubby auditors are the biggest time wasters a C/S has. If auditors on his lines aren't good, he'll take forever to get his C/S work done. And he won't get results. The answer is, regardless of Class as a course graduate, a C/S must Interne his Audi-tors for each Internship missed on the way up. The \"ok to audit\" system is used. One takes any graduate and Internes him on the lowest Internship he has missed. He reviews his material, gets his drills checked, gets his misunderstood words cleared and gets an \"ok to audit\" for that level. If he goofs he is crammed. And sometimes wholly retreaded. The \"ok to audit Dianetics\" would be his first okay. This suspends if he has to retread. When he then has turned out pcs, pcs, pcs, pcs, 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day for weeks and weeks and is a total success as a Dianetic Auditor, he can go on up. At first as a Dianetic Interne he is part time studying Dianetics. Then as he gets flaw-less and while he is getting experience and practice on Dianetics, he can gradually phase over into re-studying his next Internship, usually IV or VI. Then one day he is word cleared, checked out on his drills, and he qualifies for \"ok to audit\" for IV or VI. Now it begins all over again. Flubs – Cramming, midnight oil, audit audit cramming audit audit new word clear new drill work audit audit audit audit 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day. Now he is a IV or VI auditor. His next real step is a VI or VII Interne at an SH. If he has been a good IV Interne Auditor his VI Internship after his SHSBC will be a VII Internship. VII is an Interne activity. When he's an Auditor that can do VI and Power, he is ready for VIII and IX. If he is going to be a good VIII-IX auditor he will Interne in an AO or SH under an experienced C/S. Now when he goes to his own org, you have a real honest to goodness C/S. And as a C/S he must know how you use Internships to make auditors."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTERNES 3 C/S SERIES 52 – HCOB 19.7.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 3 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Wherever this function is neglected, you don't get auditors. You get doubtful students and out-tech. On Flag C/Ses have to catch up every missed Internship to make a high volume high quality auditor. The world renowned Superiority of Flag Auditors is built just like I am telling you here. There is no reason just that same quality can't be built in any org. One does it by the Interne method. By using this method you get in tech and high volume. Any auditor in any org that is limping and fumbling simply has never been properly Interned. The way to remedy it is to set up a good Cramming that uses only HCOBs and has them available (and no verbal tradition), a Good Word Clearer and a Qual \"okay to audit\" Interne system. The Internes are a Section in Qual. They have a Course Supervisor. They study and audit cram audit cram study audit, audit audit audit. And one day you have in tech and high volume high Class auditing all over the place. Otherwise you just have a bunch of students, in doubt, chewing on their misunder-stood words and failed tech. There is a right way to go about it. It is by Internship. L.

Org Exec Sec Communicator for Qual WW is the final authority for any checksheets on this matter and is responsible for preparing and standardizing them from time to time. But the lack of a checksheet from ES Comm Qual WW does not set aside any provision or penalty of this policy letter. This policy letter is issued in the complete knowledge that the absence of this policy in full effect is the primary reason for orgs not growing and is based on actual experience.

Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 11 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 12 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 13 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 14 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 15 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don't muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions.

Remimeo All Hats BPI SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY For some years we have had a word \"squirreling\". It means altering Scientology, off-beat practices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why. Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or a perfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system. In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workable system. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another. Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of Scientology. Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact mark-ings in the tunnels. It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out. It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also a clear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth. Therefore it is a workable system, a route that can be traveled. What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy guide. What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure the su-pervisor knew worked. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor. What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You'd think he was a pretty heartless guide. You'd expect him to say at least, \"Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn't go that way.\" All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his pre-clear eventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition? People have following the route mixed up with \"the right to have their own ideas.\" Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions – so long as these do not bar the route out for self and others."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY 2 HCO PL 14.2.65 ARC SW & GRADE 0 20 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth. If there were no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in the sticky dark, alone. Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess. So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. He isn't following the route. Scientology is a new thing – it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all the sales-manship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routes are being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery. Scientology is the only workable system Man has. It has already taken people toward higher IQ, better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor. Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now the route only needs to be walked. So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don't let them off of it no matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them.

To people who have no personal reality on the results of processing it is especially easy to be \"reasonable\" about no results. The public is not result conscious. This is proven by a century of botched up psychia-try and psychology. At no time in that century has a government or a society recognized or demanded results. The evidence that this is a fact is very plain. Psychiatry and psychology have never achieved a positive lasting result of any benefit but on the contrary downgrade, injure and kill. Yet they are still functioning as professions. Now this seems to be an invitation or justification for an org not to try for any results. But the truth is that the public is with you just so long as results are achieved. As soon as they aren't achieved, areas become upset. And as for psychiatry and psychology, they are functioning but resultless, are in seri-ous trouble and are despised. So there is no tradition of or any general belief in results in the society or its govern-ments. Thus an org can become sloppy as there is no visible demand for results. There is only an invisible hope. And a definite reaction when they don't occur. We can and do achieve results beyond anyone's hopes. So long as we continue to do this our area control will expand. When we don't it will contract. In view of the above lack of demand, it is up to us to hold up our own standards. Qual-ity is a matter we must give constant attention. We must produce: 1.

TRs TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH LRH has been recently coaching, on tape, the TRs of Flag Auditors and Internes for many weeks. Each night Messengers have been lugging in a great batch of tape recorders, each containing one or more auditing tapes. Some real breakthroughs were made on TR training that have never been seen or re-leased. The Tech of making an assessment really impinge and read was completely wrapped up. Pcs, very early in this, began to comment that their Auditor was \"much better\". The Auditors had a great many wins. They are released here for your use in upgrading the quality of your org's auditing. TYPES OF TRs There are two different kinds of TRs. These are General TRs and Assessment TRs. General TRs are for use in regular auditing. They are natural, relaxed, while fully controlling the session and the pc. Assessment TRs are used to get a list to read. Assessment questions are delivered with impingement, the Auditor accenting or \"barking\" the last word and syllable. An assessment is done crisply and businesslike with real punch (not shouting) so each line is to the pc. This is not to say that an assessment is done Tone 40 or with antagonism. Its friendly but businesslike and impinged. TRAINING TIPS In training Auditors and Internes, the person supervising the TR Training, and tapes trains them first on General TRs to a pass, then on Assessment TRs to a pass. A full TRs pass requires both."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 2 BTB 13.3.75R ARC SW & GRADE 0 26 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES All previous tape cover notes to the Supervisor and his comments should be attached together in sequence so he can see that progress has been made and which points are being worked on. Care must be given to ensure that the Auditors learn how to set up a tape recorder, po-sition the mike so the Auditor and pc can be heard easily and keep the heads clean so that recordings are not faint but easily audible. The proper position of the mike is either hung from the ceiling a bit to the side of the Auditor and pc with the mike at the same height as the Audi-tor's face, or sticking out from under the meter behind the meter shield. A poor recording is as worthless as an illegible auditing report. The person supervising the TRs tapes (usually the Interne Super with a final pass by the Senior C/S or KOT) must not invalidate or evaluate for the Auditors but must use lots of encouragement and ARC. When an Auditor backslides the Supervisor must tell him not to backslide and see that the Auditor is sorted out and improving again. This TR training is not a pattycake affair, but must be demanding and tough enough to get the Auditors through it. Pc results are at stake. LRH has when warranted, ordered an Auditor to 12 hours a day TR Training and increased it to 14 hours a day to bring up the Auditor's necessity level and get him through it when he had been lagging and was overdue to fire to his org. GENERAL TRs TRAINING Tools used in General TR Training were LRH model auditing tapes, lots of Word Clearing, use of the TR Booklets, study of Original Thesis Primary Axioms (Chapter 2) and the rules that permit engram running (Chapter \"The Laws of Returning\"), use of Mood Drills (later described), drilling out attitudes about pcs that interfere with the session, knocking out automaticities by having the Auditor drill doing them, causatively and the TRs themselves. In knocking out faulty or inconsistent TRs, the tech used is to drill the entire scale from one extreme to another up and down. For example: Auditor has a problem with loudness and tends to mumble – have him drill the faulty TR 1 or 2 on a gradient from the barest mum-ble to Tone 40 and back again until it's cured. The idea is to get General TRs up to a level of real polish and consistency (not just barely passing one tape) so they are live, natural, interested in the pc, delivered to the pc, re-laxed and smooth. USE OF TR 0 TR 0 is ordered when it is obviously out, or when other TRs drills don't seem to be re-solving. TR 0 is used so that the Auditor can be with the pc easily, is comfortable in session and not anxious or impatient. TR 0 is ordered done where there is not much Auditor there in session."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 3 BTB 13.3.75R ARC SW & GRADE 0 27 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES TR 0 was ordered in recent TR training when the following showed up in the Auditors' tapes: when an Auditor was clearing his throat, when an Auditor was fumbling assessment lines, when TR 1 and 2 were way out and not improving, when an Auditor went mechanical in session, to handle a timid Auditor, when an Auditor's mood wasn't resolving with Mood Drills, when the pc was unaware of the Auditor and wasn't working well in session = not much Auditor there. TR 0 can also be used with Mood Drills and when knocking out an Auditor attitude that is interfering. What is usually ordered is to have the Auditor look over his attitude to pcs and drill that attitude to free it up, then practice other attitudes. And also do TR 0. TR 1 TR 1 in General TRs must be friendly and real, natural, positive with each command given in its own unit of time. Poor diction can get in the road and have to be drilled out. TR 1 must also be live and interested with adequate volume and crispness to arrive at the pc. Com-mands must be given without hesitation or being slowly dragged out because that gives a slow session pace and violates the rule on number of commands given and answered per unit of time determines gain. A lilt on TR 1 loses any impingement the question could have. It can be cured by drill-ing lilting and then the opposite, monotone, until the automaticity is broken. The opposite of this is where the Auditor drops the end of the line or swallows it. This also loses impingement and must be drilled out. An Auditor whose TR 1 is too soft and low volume can be ordered to do 50 foot TRs. A breathless TR 1 can be cured by having the Auditor practice being breathless to get rid of the automaticity. A timid Auditor can practice being a mean tiger to get the softness out of his TR 1. He should also review the Primary Axioms of Original Thesis. Timing is an important part of TR 1. Session pace depends on it. Where commands or questions are too far apart auditing time is extended. Flubbed command are out. Having to re-read a command is a flub and shouldn't be necessary if the Auditor drills the procedure so it's smooth. When taking questions or commands from an HCOB the Auditor can sound like he's reading the question and must learn to sound like he's saying when he's in fact reading. These were some of the points picked out on TR 1. TR 2 \"The essence of TR 2 is session control.\" \"The pc's comm is begun with TR 1 and con-trolled in flow with TR 2.\" (LRH) There are really different types of TR 2, a whole range that go from a ½ ack to a full ack up to a Tone 40 ack."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 4 BTB 13.3.75R ARC SW & GRADE 0 28 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES \"A full ack is really a stop ack. If you break it down, there's a degree of acks going from 'go on, I'm listening' order mutter to an 'okay, that's enough of this phase of this' to 'well we got through with that and that's it'. One doesn't use such words. It is done by tone and in-tention. It's called session control. There's also a Tone 40 ack which ends off the whole scene and that's that.\" (LRH) \"A half ack keeps the pc going and also keeps a pc from over-itsaing.\" \"Half ack when it is going to go on, like Earl Sim.\" (LRH) You use half acks to show the pc you are still there and to let him know you're interested. On R3R you use half acks on 1 to 8, full ack on 9, half acks on A to C and a full ack on D. Where a pc over-itsas it is caused by a slow TR 2, a lack of TR 2 especially half acks, too strong a half ack and over-acking. A lack of half acks shows up with a pc who is unaware of the Auditor and so is out of control or doesn't work well in session. Practice on half acks and full acks so as not to fall between and drilling acks that con-trol comm from making it continue to making it stop utterly, the full range of ½ acks to full acks to Tone 40 acks, cures an Auditor who flubs on the above. Where TR 2 is interruptive and overrides the end of the pc's answer, it will put the pc on a W/H. Practice on timing of TR 2 and perception of when the pc has said all corrects that. Double acks, multiple acks such as: \"OK. Good.\" and \"All right. Thank you. OK.\" are not OK and must be knocked out by drilling the Auditor so he learns to ack with one ack. TR 2 repeated makes an overack. Too cold a TR 2 can be corrected by Mood Drills (see below). TR 2 expresses mood and interest in the pc's incidents and itsa. TR 2 must be to the pc so he gets it. Sometimes an Auditor has TR 2 and the next TR 1 colliding, running together so that they nearly overlap. This is corrected by drilling timing of TR 1 and TR 2 and the next TR 1 so that each TR 1 is in its own unit of time and each TR 2 ends that comm cycle. Use of LRH model auditing tapes is necessary in training Auditors on TR 2. MOOD DRILLS Mood Drills were developed by LRH to handle stuck or fixated Auditor moods or where some Auditor's mood entered into the session would rough up or upset a pc or slow his progress. Mood Drills consist of TRs 1 to 4 done out of session on each tone level of the full tone scale, hitting each mood up and down the scale. The coach calls the mood, the Auditor does TRs 1 to 4 in that mood. It doesn't really require much coaching. \"You just start low on the scale and TR that mood then the next, then the next. Like all TRs done 'hopeless', etc. Lots of laughs doing it really. Doing TRs as a dead Auditor is pretty tricky.\" (LRH)"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 5 BTB 13.3.75R ARC SW & GRADE 0 29 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES An Auditor drilling these must beware of mis-Us and make sure that he understands each mood (tone). Any moods that are too easy to do or too hard should be spotted by coach and Auditor and repeated until the automaticity is broken. Once begun mood drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the Auditor doesn't get stuck on the Tone Scale but can do any mood easily and without strain. \"TRs are a matter of sound not how an Auditor feels.\" (LRH) Where an Auditor is upset about his voice you can have him try – out of session – speaking melodiously, boringly, enthusiastically, until he can change his mood about at will. Mood drills can be done on TR 104 when R3R is mechanical, brush off, not interested or done with a set emotion. You have the Auditor drill TR 104 by mood, up and down the tone scale, and to the pc. The coach calls the mood as with TRs 1 to 4. 50 foot Mood Drills can be used to cure a fixed mood that doesn't seem to budge with regular Mood Drills. A timid Dn Auditor is cured with 104 at each mood level including doing it as a pan-ther, a lion, aggressive. As a bird, scared stiff. This breaks the automaticity. Mood Drills can be done on Assessments where the Auditor's mood would rough up the pc, where the assessment has an up lilt, or when it's dull or monotonous or when it's an out mood of any sort that's fouling up the Auditor's assessment. The Auditor can be drilled on assessments in the E-Meter Drill book at different moods or he can use a prepared list in a dummy session at different moods. Mood Drills can also be used to fix up a TR 1 that's too variable or rushed, on a set emotion, choppy, pushy, monotonous, sad, dreary and even on TR 2 when it's an out moods. Mood Drills are not only fun to do but also enable an Auditor to pass off a session without strain and without his own feelings interfering with it. The session will sound live, the Auditor will be interested in the pc and with good TRs get maximum pc gain. ASSESSMENTS Assessments are done to impinge and get a meter to read. The Auditor barks the last word and the last syllable so it does impinge. You don't go ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄\\, ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄\\. Go /, /.You don't drop your voice or downcurve your voice tone at the end of the line as that will cost you reads. You punch the last syllable to make it read, and to the pc. This is different from a lilt which is a —/. The accent is at the end of the sentence routinely, not on the earlier part. This must be drilled, drilled, drilled until the Auditor can do it easily and consistently with good bark. A lot of automaticities will come off with the drilling and it may sound \"strange\" at first but you'll be surprised at the reads you otherwise wouldn't get. An example is the line \"Were you ashamed to cause an upset\" (usual emphasis underlined) which when assessed goes \"Were you ashamed to cause an upset\" (bark on last syllable)."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 6 BTB 13.3.75R ARC SW & GRADE 0 30 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Don't get the idea that assessments are harsh or forceful. You don't have to shout. They must be natural without strain, consistent, friendly but businesslike, with good impingement and bark. Done as above your assessments will read when they should and not when they shouldn't. VERBAL TECH Beware of verbal tech on TR training. You can detect verbal tech when several Audi-tors are making the same TR errors. Locate the source of the verbal tech, the \"expert\" giving advice and knock it out. It can cost you your results.

Ron would listen to these and make invaluable corrective comments. The stress of course was on TRs and session presence. The Interne, after listening to LRH model auditing tapes, and correcting the outnesses noted in his own taped session, would tape another session and submit it. And so on until Flag standards were attained, at which time the Interne passed on his TRs with an LRH OK. Needless to say, Ron sets a very high standard and the results achieved from this pro-gram once again highlight the datum, \"Do what Ron says!\". The following advices and corrections were aimed at particular TR outnesses heard in the taped sessions of specific Internes. They are quoted here exactly as Ron wrote them.

But TRs are too dull. LRH\" Interne B: This Interne indicated by her C/S comments that she really didn't understand what was going on with the pc. LRH commented in the next C/S: \"...certainty of auditing affects TRs. One doesn't have good TRs on a case he doesn't dig. And lack of such knowledge makes one think he is losing when he isn't...

The Auditor is tense. Pc keeps talking after ack. This 'afraid he'd ARC Break the pc' is actually TR 0. Have this Auditor listen to some of my demo tapes. TR 3 is supposed to be a newly originated TR 1, not a mechanical action. He is not doing badly. But there is no reason why a really good job of training can't be done. If he's this tense or anxious, if his zero is not natural and easy and if TR 1, 3 are out then it falls back to an uneasy 2 and pc not under control. Clear also definition of 'in-session'.

Number: TR 6 Name: 8-C (Body Control)\" Commands: Non-verbal for first half of training session. First half of coaching session, the student silently steers the coach's body around the room, not touching the walls, quietly start-ing, changing and stopping the coach's body. When the student has fully mastered non-verbal 8-C, the student may commence verbal 8-C. The commands to be used for 8-C are: \"Look at that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Walk over to that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Touch that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Turn around.\" \"Thank you.\" Position: Student and coach walking side by side; student always on coach's right, except when turning. Purpose: First part: To accustom student to moving another body than his own without verbal communication. Second part: To accustom student to moving another body, by and while giv-ing commands, only, and to accustom student to proper commands of 8-C. Training Stress: Complete, crisp precision of movement and commands. Student, as in any other TR, is flunked for current and preceding TRs. Thus, in this case, the coach flunks the student for every hesitation or nervousness in moving body, for every flub of command, for poor confronting, for bad communication of command, for poor acknowledgement, for poor repetition of command, and for failing to handle origination by coach. Stress that student learns to lead slightly in all the motions of walking around the room or across the room. This will be found to have a great deal to do with confronting. In the first part of the session stu-dent is not allowed to walk coach into walls, as walls then become automatic stops and the student is then not stopping the coach's body but allowing the wall to do it for him."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 2 HCOB 7.5.68 ARC SW & GRADE 0 40 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES History: Developed by L.

Number: TR 7 Name: High School Indoc. Commands: Same as 8-C (control) but with student in physical contact with coach. Student enforcing commands by manual guiding. Coach has only three statements to which student must listen: \"Start\" to begin coaching session, \"Flunk\" to call attention to student error, and \"That's it\" to end the coaching session. No other remarks by the coach are valid on student. Coach tries in all possible ways, verbal, covert and physical, to stop student from running control on him. If the student falters, comm lags, fumbles a command, or fails to get execu-tion on part of coach, coach says \"Flunk\" and they start at the beginning of the command cy-cle in which the error occurred. Coach falldown is not allowed. Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student handling coach physically. Purpose: To train student never to be stopped by a person when he gives a command. To train him to run fine control in any circumstances. To teach him to handle rebellious people. To bring about his willingness to handle other people. Training Stress: Stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence by student. Start gradually to toughen up resistance of student on a gradient. Don't kill him off all at once. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, England, in 1956. Number: TR 8 Name: Tone 40 on an Object. Commands: \"Stand up.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Sit down on that chair.\" \"Thank you.\" These are the only commands used. Position: Student sitting in chair facing chair which has on it an ashtray. Coach sitting in chair facing chair occupied by student and chair occupied by ashtray. Purpose: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 commands. To clarify intentions as differ-ent from words. To start student on road to handling objects and people with postulates. To obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands. Training Stress: TR 8 is begun with student holding the ashtray which he manually makes execute the commands he gives. Under the heading of training stress is included the various ways and means of getting the student to achieve the goals of this training step. During the early part of this drill, say in the first coaching session, the student should be coached in the basic parts of the drill, one at a time. First, locate the space which includes himself and the ashtray but not more than that much. Second, have him locate the object in that space. Third, have him command the object in the loudest possible voice he can muster. This is called"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 3 HCOB 7.5.68 ARC SW & GRADE 0 41 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES shouting. The coach's patter would run something like this: \"Locate the space.\" \"Locate the object in that space.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" That would complete two cycles of action. When shouting is completed, then have student use a normal tone of voice with a lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object. Next, have the student do the drill while using the wrong commands – i.e., saying \"Thank you\" while placing in the object the intention to stand up, etc. Next, have the student do the drill silently, putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of the com-mand or the acknowledgement. The final step in this would be for the coach to say \"Start\" then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\". Here, the coach would attempt to distract the student, using any verbal means he could to knock the student off Tone 40. Physical heckling would not be greater than tapping the student on the knee or shoulder to get his attention. When the student can maintain Tone 40 and get a clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement, the drill is flat. There are other ways to help the student along. The coach occasionally asks, \"Are you willing to be in that ashtray?\" When the student has answered, then, \"Are you willing for a thought to be there instead of you?\" Then continue the drill. The answers are not so important on these two questions as is the fact that the idea is brought to the student's attention. Another question the coach asks the student is, \"Did you really expect that ashtray to comply with that com-mand?\" There is a drill which will greatly increase the student's reality on what an intention is. The coach can use this drill three or four times during the training on Tone 40 on an Object. As follows: \"Think the thought – I am a wild flower.\" \"Good.\" \"Think the thought that you are sitting in a chair.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that thought being in that ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that ashtray containing that thought in its substance.\" \"Good.\" \"Now get the ashtray thinking that it is an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to go on being an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" \"Have the ashtray end that cycle.\" \"Good.\" \"Put in the ashtray the intention to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" This also helps the student get a reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself. Stress that an intention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice, nor is it depend-ent upon thinking certain words. An intention must be clear and have no counter-intention in it. This training drill, Tone 40 on an Object, usually takes the most time of any drill in Upper Indoc, and time on it is well spent. Objects to be used are ashtrays, preferably heavy, coloured glass ashtrays. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1957 to train students to use intention when auditing. Number: TR 9 Name: Tone 40 on a Person. Commands: Same as 8-C (Control). Student runs fine, clear-cut intention and verbal orders on coach. Coach tries to break down Tone 40 of student. Coach commands that are valid are:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 4 HCOB 7.5.68 ARC SW & GRADE 0 42 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES \"Start\" to begin, \"Flunk\" to call attention to student error and that they must return to begin-ning of cycle, and \"That's it\" to take a break or to end the training session. No other statement by coach is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off Tone 40 or in gen-eral be stopped. Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student in manual contact with coach as needed. Purpose: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress or duress. Training Stress: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus a compel-ling, unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed, since each jerk is a stop. Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coach execute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone 40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too little force defi-nitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk. Here the coach should check very carefully on student's ability to place an intention in the coach. This can be checked by the coach since the coach will find himself doing the command almost whether or not he wants to if the stu-dent is really getting the intention across. After the coach is satisfied with the student's ability to get the intention across, the coach should then do all he can to break the student off Tone 40, mainly on the basis of surprise and change of pace. Thus the student will be brought to have a greater tolerance of surprise and a quick recovery from surprise. History: Developed in Washington, D.C., in 1957 by L. Ron Hubbard. Purpose of these four training drills, TR 6, 7, 8 and 9, is to bring about in the student the will-ingness and ability to handle and control other people's bodies, and to cheerfully confront another person while giving that person commands. Also, to maintain a high level of control in any circumstances. L.

This is because they have not understood what it is. Nearly all their auditing failures stem not from using wrong processes but from Q and A. Accordingly I have looked the matter over and re-defined Q and A. The origin of the term comes from \"changing when the pc changes\". The basic answer to a question is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formula completely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A later definition was \"Questioning the pc's Answer\". Another effort to overcome it and explain Q & A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home. The new definition is this: Q and A is a failure to complete a Cycle of Action on a preclear. A cycle of action is redefined as Start – Continue – Complete. Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking a question the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging that answer. A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Arm action into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it. A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action and completing it. Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle before it is complete is \"Q and A-ing\". This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing any part of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask the different idea, thus abandoning the original question. An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pc cog-nition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing. A programme such as \"Prepcheck this pc's family\" is begun, and for any reason left incomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A. Unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Q AND A 2 HCOB 7.4.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 44 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Since Time is a continuum, a failure to carry out a cycle of action (a continuum) hangs the pc up at that exact point. If you don't believe it, prepcheck \"Incomplete actions\" on a pc! What Incomplete ac-tion has been suppressed? etc. cleaning the meter for real on every button. And you'd have a clear – or a pc that would behave that way on a meter. Understand this and you'll be about ninety times as effective as an auditor. \"Don't Q and A!\" means \"Don't leave cycles of action incomplete on a pc.\" The gains you hope to achieve on a pc are lost when you Q and A.

When a Tone Arm has to be moved rapidly down, the needle appears to float to some but it is just falling. To see if a needle is floating the TA must have stopped moving down. A Blowdown is a period of relief and cognition to a pc while it is occurring and for a moment after it stops. Therefore it is a serious goof for an auditor to speak or move during the blowdown or for a moment afterwards. This was noted years ago and is given in early materials on goals. An auditor must not speak or move during a blowdown. When the auditor has to move the TA from right to left to keep the needle on the dial and the movement is .1 divisions or more then a blowdown is occurring. The needle of course is falling to the right. That is a period of charge blowing off the bank. It is accompanied by realizations for the pc. Sometimes the pc does not voice them aloud. They nevertheless happen. If the auditor speaks or moves beyond adjusting the TA quietly with his thumb the pc may suppress the cognitions and stop the blowdown. To see if a needle floats the TA must be halted for the moment between 2 and 3 on a calibrated meter. A floating needle cannot be observed during a blowdown. For an auditor to sit up suddenly and look surprised or pleased, or for an auditor to say the next command or \"That's It\" during a blowdown, can jolly well wreck a pc's case. So it's a real goof to do so. To get auditing results one must audit with a good comm cycle, accept the pc's an-swers, handle the pc's originations, be unobtrusive with his auditing actions, not hold the pc up while he writes, not develop tricks like waiting for the pc to look at him before giving the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"AUDITING GOOFS BLOWDOWN 2 HCOB 3.08.65 INTERRUPTION ARC SW & GRADE 0 48 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES next command, not prematurely ack and so start compulsive Itsa, and be very quiet during and just after a blowdown.

I have seen auditors let a pc talk and talk and talk and talk and run down and talk and run down and talk again until one wondered where if anywhere that auditor had been trained. In the first place such an auditor could not know the meaning of the word ITSA. The word means \"It is a ........\" Now how an auditor letting a pc talk believes he is getting a pc to spot what it is is quite beyond me. This pc has been talking all his life. He isn't well. Analysts had people talk for five years and they seldom got well. So how is it supposed to happen today that a pc, let talk enough, will get well. It won't. The auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills. That's all. These are the TRs. An auditor who can't do his TRs can't audit. Period. Instead he says he is \"letting the pc Itsa\". If by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches, then this isn't auditing. In auditing an auditor guides. He gives the pc something to answer. When the pc an-swers the pc has said \"IT IS A .. \" and that's Itsa. If the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into an anxiety – he has been chopped. So he talks more than he wanted."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"“LETTING THE PC ITSA” 2 HCOB 5.2.66 II THE PROPERLY TRAINED AUDITOR ARC SW & GRADE 0 50 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES If the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge, then the pc talks on and on, hoping for an acknowledgement that doesn't come, \"runs dry\", tries again, etc. So premature or late-or-never acks result in the same thing – the pc running on and on and on. And they call it \"letting the pc Itsa\". Bah! If a pc talks too much in session he either is getting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasn't got an auditor at all. It isn't \"Itsa\". It's lousy TRs. (The one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to get better with proper TRs used on him.) The proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes: 1. The auditor asks the questions. 2. The pc says what is the answer, \"It's a ........\" 3. The auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pc's satisfaction and 4. The auditor acks when the pc has finished saying \"It's a .......\" And that's Itsa. Scientology auditing is a precision skill, not a gag blop goo slup guck blah. 1. The auditor wants to know ........ 2. The pc says it is ........ 1. 2. 1. 2. 1. 2. etc. TECH SAVVY Now an auditor who doesn't know his technology about the mind and his processes of course never knows what to ask. So he or she simply sits like a lump of sacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better. A sure sign that an auditor doesn't know an engram from a cow about processes is see-ing a pc \"Itsa\" on and on and on. In Scientology we do know what the mind is, what a being is, what goes wrong in the mind and how to correct it. We aren't psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or Harley Street witch doctors. We do know. The data about beings and life is there in Scientology to be learned. It isn't \"our idea\" of how things are, or \"our opinion of\" .... Scientology is a precision subject. It has axioms. Like geometry. Two equilateral tri-angles aren't similar because Euclid said so. They're similar because they are. If you don't believe it, look at them. There isn't a single datum in Scientology that can't be proven as precisely as teacups are teacups and not saucepans."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"“LETTING THE PC ITSA” 3 HCOB 5.2.66 II THE PROPERLY TRAINED AUDITOR ARC SW & GRADE 0 51 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Now if we get a person fresh out of the study of \"the mystical metaphysics of Cuff-bah\" he's going to have trouble. His pcs are going to \"Itsa\" their heads off and never get well or better or anything. Because that person doesn't know Scientology but thinks it's all impre-cise opinion. The news about Scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exact sciences. If one doesn't know that, one's pcs \"Itsa\" by the hour for one doesn't know what he is handling that he is calling \"a pc\". By my definition, an auditor is a real auditor when his or her pcs don't overtalk or un-dertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate. So how to tell an auditor, how to determine if you have trained one at last, is do his pcs answer up or do they talk on and on. If I had an auditor in an HGC whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yapped while the auditor just sat there like a Chinese pilot frozen on the controls, I would do the fol-lowing to that \"auditor\": 1. Remedy A, Book of Case Remedies. 2. Remedy B, Book of Case Remedies. 3. Disagreements with Scientology, technology and orgs and Scientology personalities all found and traced to basic and blown. 4. A grind study assignment of the Scientology Axioms until the \"auditor\" could do them in clay. 5. A memorization of the Logics, Qs (Prelogics) and Axioms of Dianetics and Scientol-ogy. 6. TRs 0 to 4 until they ran out of his or her ears. 7. TRs 5 to 9. 8. Op Pro by Dup until flat. 9. A hard long study of the Meter. 10. The ARC triangle and other scales. 11. The Processes of Level 0. 12. Some wins. And I'd have an auditor. I'd have one that could make a Grade Zero Release every time. And it's lack of the above that causes an \"auditor\" to say \"I let the pc Itsa\" with the pc talking on and on and on.

Some pcs get a bad name with some auditors, some don't appreciate the auditing, some conflict with a particular auditor's own personality. There are such instances. It does not mean certain pcs cannot be helped by others. It is also true that an auditor who dislikes a pc may not do a good job so the rule also has a practical side to it. One auditor disliked young men and did a bad job on them. Another disliked old la-dies and chopped them up in session. One pc had messed up several Scientologists and could-n't find anyone to audit him at all. We are not auditing people to make amends to the world. Thus an auditor has a right to reject or accept the pcs he is given. ACCEPTING A C/S When the auditor gets a C/S to do on a case and if he thinks it is not the correct thing to do he has the right to reject the C/S for that pc and require another one he can agree to. The auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the ses-sion except as noted below. The auditor may not C/S in the auditing chair while auditing the pc. If he has no Case Supervisor at all the auditor still audits from a C/S. He writes the C/S before session and ad-heres to it in session.

This is called a \"Stale Dated Pgm\" or a \"Stale Dated C/S\" meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss. It is dangerous to accept a Repair (Progress) Pgm if it is old. The auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justified in demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 3 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 61 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES A program written in January may be completely out of date in June.

The real remedy is reorganize and hire more and better auditors. ENDING THE SESSION When the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/S. Ending the session is totally up to the auditor. If the auditor just doesn't complete an action that was producing TA and could be completed it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic engram the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and simi-lar actions would be an auditor error. The judgement here is whether or not the auditor's action is justified in ending the ses-sion. Even though he may have made an error, the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc on something else whose ruds are out is a Major Auditing Error. Even if the C/S omits \"Fly a rud\" or \"Fly ruds\" this does not justify the auditor auditing the pc over out ruds. The auditor can do one of two things: He can Fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. The Dianetic Auditor is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in an HGC must be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for a new C/S. Better still he should learn to Fly ruds. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS If an auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is justified in start-ing a Green Form. The auditor solution to no F/N on ruds is to do a GF whether the C/S said to or not. This is an expected action. It is understood the auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to Fly ruds."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 4 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 62 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES SESSIONS FAR APART When a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions days apart, ruds must be flown. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds. This can develop mental mass. Optimum session scheduling is a series of sessions or a whole program done in a block of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc's ruds out be-tween sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life's annoyances and keeps the pc there. UNREADING ITEMS When an item the auditor has been told to run doesn't read on the meter, even when the auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the auditor must not do anything with the item no matter what the C/S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn't read he will be expected not to run it. LISTS When an auditor whose C/S told him to list \"Who or what ______\" or any list question finds that the list question does not read, the auditor must not list it. When doing a list ordered by the C/S it is assumed that the auditor will test it for read before listing and that he will not list an unreading question. (A read is an actual fall, not a tick or a stop.) LIST TROUBLE When an auditor has trouble doing a list and getting an item it is expected he will use a Prepared List like L4B to locate the trouble and handle it. As it is very hard on a pc to mess up a list it is expected the auditor will handle the situation then and there with no further C/S directions. HIGH TA When the auditor sees the TA is high at session start yet the C/S says to \"Fly a rud\" or run a chain, the auditor must not try to fly a rud and he must not start on a chain."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 5 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 63 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Trying to bring a TA down with ARC Brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren't the reason TAs go up.

Seeing a high TA at start the Scientology auditor (Class III or above) (a) checks for exteriorization in a recent session and if so the session is ended and the C/S is asked for an \"Interiorization Rundown\"; (b) if the pc has had an Interiorization Rundown the auditor asks the C/S for permission to do a \"C/S Series 53\" or a Hi-Lo TA assessment or whatever the C/S indicates. The Int RD may have been (usually is) overrun and needs rehab or correction and it is usual to check it – it is included in a \"C/S 53\" and a Hi-Lo TA. These actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the C/S. GOING ON HOPING When a case is running badly session to session the last thing you do is go on hop-ing, either in auditing or C/Sing. \"Let's try _____\", \"Then this\", \"Then this\", is not going to solve the case. You get data. You can get data by a White Form (Pc Assessment Form). You can get data from a GF fully assessed (Method 5). You can get data by 2-way comm on various subjects. You can have the D of P interview and get answers. You can even ask his mother. You look for case errors. You study the folder back to where the pc ran well and then come forward and you'll find the error every time. Do not just go on session after failed session hoping. That's pure idiocy. You get data! from prepared lists, from life, from the pc, from the folder. Find the bug! Ah, good Lord, he is a Pinkerton Agent sworn to secrecy! He does yoga exercises af-ter every session. He was tried for murder when he was 16 and nobody has run the engram of it. Various auditors ran the same engram chain four times. An auditor ran Int RD twice. After Power she had her baby and nobody ran the delivery. He doesn't like to talk but is a \"Grade Zero\"! A dozen dozen reasons can exist. An auditor does not let a C/S C/S hopefully.

RUDS GOING OUT When the ruds go out during the session the auditor recognizes the following: Pc Critical = W/H from auditor Pc Antagonistic = BPC in session No TA = Problem Tired = Failed Purpose or no sleep Sad = ARC Break Soaring TA = Overrun or Protest Dope Off = By-passed F/N or not enough sleep No Interest = Out Ruds or no interest in the first place. An auditor who isn't sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc (except on lists which he handles at once always) is smart to end off the session quickly, write down the full observation and get it to the C/S.

The auditor has no business trying to do the C/S given when it collides with and isn't designed to handle any of the above. If the previous session disclosed such an error and this session C/S was designed to handle and doesn't, the auditor should end off and the next C/S should be \"2-way comm for data\". CASE NOT HANDLED When the auditor or the Examiner collides with a pc who is asserting his case has not been handled, there should not be a new set of actions based on little data but the auditor should end off and the C/S should order a \"way comm on what hasn't been handled\". The auditor should not at once take this up as part of any other C/S. In other words an auditor doesn't change the C/S to a 2-way comm on something not called for by C/S. MAJOR ACTIONS An auditor should never begin a major action on a case that is not \"set up\" for it."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 8 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 66 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES As this can occur during a session it is vital to understand the rule and follow it. Oth-erwise a case can be bogged right down and will be hard to salvage as now a new action to repair has been added to an unrepaired action. Now, if the auditor starts a major action on a case not \"set up\" we get two things to repair where we only had one as the major action won't work either. Repair = patching up past auditing or recent life errors. This is done by prepared lists or completing the chain or correcting lists or even 2-way comm or prepchecks on auditors, sessions, etc. Rudiments = setting the case up for the session action. This includes ARC Brks, PTPs, W/Hs, GF or O/R listing or any prepared list (such as L1C, etc.). Set up = getting an F/N showing and VGIs before starting any major action. It means just that – an F/N and VGIs before starting any major action. Such may require a repair action and rudiments as well. Major Action = any – but any – action designed to change a case or general considera-tions or handle continual illness or improve ability. This means a Process or even a series of processes like 3 flows. It doesn't mean a grade. It is any process the case hasn't had. Grade = a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. Program = any series of actions designed by a C/S to bring about definite results in a pc. A program usually includes several sessions. The vast bulk of auditing errors come about because C/Ses and auditors seek to use a Major Action to repair a case. It is a responsibility of an auditor to reject a C/S which seeks to use one or more major actions to repair a case that isn't running well. The auditor must understand this completely. He can be made to accept a wrong C/S for the pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error and mess up the case. Example: Pc has not been running well (no real TA or had a grumpy Exam report). Auditor sees C/S has ordered a major action, not a repair by prepared lists, ruds, etc. The auditor must reject the C/S as he will be made to fail in session by it. Example: Auditor gets a C/S, \"(1) Fly a rud; (2) Assess LX3; (3) Run 3-way recall, 3-way secondaries, 3-way engrams on all / / X items\". The auditor can't get a rud to fly. Does the LX3. In other words he flunks by failing to set up the case. It could also go this way. Auditor can't get a rud to fly, does a GF, gets no F/N. He must not begin a major action but must end off right there. It is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if the case is not F/N VGIs. The pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not F/N VGIs must be set up by repair actions!

The pc will sooner or later begin to fly. Now at session start you put in a rud, get F/N VGIs and can start major actions. So the auditor has a responsibility not to be led up a garden path by a C/S which or-ders a major action on a pc who isn't repaired or by not being able in session to get an F/N VGIs by repair. The only exceptions are a touch assist or life ruds or the Dianetic assist all on a tempo-rarily sick pc. But that's repair isn't it? PROGRAM VIOLATIONS When an auditor receives a C/S and sees that it violates the pc's program he should re-ject it. The pc, let us say, is supposed to finish his Dianetic Triples but is suddenly being given a Group Engram Intensive. That violates the program and also the grade. If the pc is running badly, a repair should be ordered. If not, the program should be completed. Example: An effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack. This is a program con-taining several major actions which probably consists of several sessions. Before this program is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack, the C/S orders \"(1) Fly a rud, (2) 3 S & Ds\". The auditor should recognize in 3 S & Ds a major action being run into the middle of a program and reject it. The correct action is of course the next backtrack process. GRADE VIOLATIONS A pc who is on a grade and hasn't attained it yet must not be given major actions not part of that grade. Example: Pc is on Grade I. C/S orders a list having to do with drinking. It is not a process on that grade. It could be done after Grade I is attained and before Grade II is begun. The C/S is incorrect and should not be accepted. ABILITY ATTAINED Now and then before the full major action is complete or before all the grade processes are run, the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of the action. This is particularly true of valence shifters or Interiorization Rundowns and can hap-pen in grades. The auditor should recognize it and, with the F/N VGIs always present at such mo-ments, end off."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 10 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 68 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES I know of one case who had a huge cog about Interiorization on Flow 1 Engrams and was pushed by both C/S and auditor to do Flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badly that it took a long while – weeks – to straighten the case out. The ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on. On the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse. \"I think he cogged to him-self so we ended off.\" It must be a real \"What do you know!\" sort of out-loud cog with a big F/N and VVGIs and directly on the subject to end off a major action or a program or a grade before its actions are all audited. REVIEWING REVIEWS An auditor who gets a C/S or an order to repair a case that is running well should re-ject doing the action. I have seen a case ordered to repair who had Ext Full Perception Doing Great. The re-pair bogged the case. The case then got running well again but a second C/S ordered a new repair which of course bogged it. Then major actions were done. The case was again repaired and rehabbed and became OK. Three times the auditor should have said no. FALSE REPORTS The vilest trick that can be played on a pc is for an auditor to falsify an auditing report. It may be thought to be \"good Public Relations\" (good PR) for the auditor with the C/S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. Integrity is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc. OVERTS ON PCS When an auditor finds himself being nattery or critical of his pcs he should get his withholds on pcs pulled and overts on them off. An auditor who goes sad is auditing pcs over his own ARC Break. An auditor worried about his pc is working over a Problem.

If breath shows on a mirror held to his face he can audit. Faint afterwards if you must but see that the pc gets to the Examiner with his F/N. Then get yourself handled. \"WHAT HE DID WRONG\" An auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCO B have been violated. But an auditor's TRs can go out or his listing and nulling is in error. After a session that went wrong somebody else (not the auditor) should ask the pc what the auditor did. This sometimes spots a false auditing report. But it also sometimes is a false report by the pc. In any event, the auditor has a right to know. Then he can either correct his auditing or his know-how or he can advise the C/S the pc's report is untrue and better repair can be done on the pc. Savage action against an auditor is almost never called for. He was trying to help. Some people are hard to help. Not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCO B, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCO B or tape. Don't be party to a \"hidden data line\" that doesn't exist. \"You ruined the pc!\" is not a valid statement. \"You violated HCO B page ____\" is the charge. No auditor may be disciplined for asking, \"May I please have the tape or HCO B that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming. \" If it isn't on a tape, a book or an HCOB it is not true and no auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. \"If it isn't written it isn't true\" is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. ____________________ These are the rights of the auditor with relation to a C/S.

So the Auditor cuts the line the Pc has to the bank in order to get the Pc to talk, because \"It's the Itsa line that blows the charge,\" he says. So the Auditor cuts the Pc's communication line with his bank in order to bring about an Itsa line – and then he wonders why he gets no TA action and why the Pc ARC Breaks. This cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye. It's hidden because it's from the Pc – a Thetan unseen by the Auditor – to the Pc's bank – unseen by the Auditor. The Auditor is simply there to use the What's-it line in order to get the Pc to confront his bank. The charge blows off it to the degree that it's confronted and this is represented by the Itsa line.

EVALUATION Far more serious than Invalidation above, is the accidental evaluation which may oc-cur when the auditor repeats what the pc said. Never repeat anything a pc says after him, no matter why.

If it did not he leaves the grade line blank as it is a No Grade session (see F/N and well done hours) as the Auditor gets no hour credit for the session. If the C/S and other Admin is ok he writes OK with his initial in the session grade space. If none of it is okay he leaves it blank and does the C/S form or programs completely new. In this last case he enters a subtract figure in his log for the auditing time for the week against that Auditor's name. If the Exam form F/Ned, but the Admin is not okay and the session actions were not okay the C/S writes \"Well Done by Exam\" on his own new C/S in its proper place and ignores the form and subtracts the Admin time in his book to subtract the Admin from the Auditor's week's stat. If the session was not okay with no F/N at Exams yet the Admin and next C/S are ok, the Auditor loses the session time in the C/S but gets the Admin time credited to his week's stat. The C/S subtracts the session time in his book, not the Admin time.

By the C/S writing in the session grade (Very well done, well done, okay, flunk, to cramming) the Auditor is receiving acknowledgement for his work and is not just acking him-self. THE NEW LINE The Ideal Folder-C/S line can shift the number of well done hours from a ceiling of 250-300 to 600-800 with one C/S. No matter how many Auditors an org has, older lines put a 250-300 top ceiling on the org's well done hours. When hours could go above 600 due to the available Auditors (20 or 30), a new paral-lel line has to be manned by a new C/S, new D of P and another Examiner and more Tech Services personnel. Despite how hard the C/S and anyone else in tech works, a line not so run will ceiling at about 250 hours, no matter how many Auditors are hired. A C/S using the old lines can C/S for about 5 working Auditors only with the line run-ning any old way. And even so will work himself half to death. In trying to get pcs handled, Auditors will be added. The C/S will not be able to han-dle his job. The line, being faulty, gets pegged at about 250 hours no matter how hard the C/S and Admin people work.

The Auditor marks in a box (2 columns) on a sheet stapled to the inside front cover the process, the Exam result, the session time and the Admin time he has just put in. 13. The Auditor hands his completed folders in to Tech Services. 14. Tech Services gets the folders to the C/S using a Folder Page who comes on late and works the C/S's hours. 15. Fed the folders rapidly by the Folder Page who is standing in the C/S area, the C/S does his C/S work. If the Folder Page is fast, removing folders and putting the new one in, chasing up data and other bits for the C/S, the time of C/Sing even when done very carefully will be found to average 3 to 5 minutes a folder even when some re-quire full programming (but not FESing). This makes a ceiling of about 100 folders (sessions) a day for the C/S, an output of 30 Auditors. Needless to say the C/S and the Auditors have to know their business and Qual Cramming is used extensively both for new material and for flubs both in auditing and C/Sing by Auditors. 16. The Folder Page gets the folders over to the D of P office preserving the piles per Auditor as much as possible. The C/S posts the data he wants Auditors to know or do on the AUDITORS' BOARD of the Auditors' Admin Room. He turns in his Cramming Orders into the D of P bas-ket. This finishes his actions.

New tech in use, fantastic completions and utter dog cases nobody can make anything out of go on this senior C/S hot spur line. There are very few of these, only two or three a day in a very busy org. The sen-ior C/S \"does\" these and sends them back to the C/S. They are then sent on as usual to the D of P. 17. The Director of Processing comes on duty very early. The C/Sed folders will all be there. The D of P has assignment master sheets that are kept up by the D of P. The D of P does the day's schedules, a list for each Auditor. The lists preferably have a few too many pcs on them.

The D of P now goes to the Auditor Admin Room and begins to muster Auditors from her muster list as they come in and gets them over to Tech Services. 19. A Cramming personnel will be in there trying to get any crammings scheduled. 20. Tech Services hands out folders (which are in neat piles for each Auditor) and sched-ules to the Auditors as they turn up and handles any arguments or shifts in sequence. 21.

The D of P interviews any hung-up or curious pcs or as requested by the C/S or gets new Auditors or keeps up Admin. This goes on until the C/S comes in when the DofP is off. 23. The Auditor picking up his folders begins the cycle all over again at (1) above. ABOVE 600 When the well done hours go above 600 a week, a whole new HGC is put in duplicat-ing the first, with its own C/S, D of P, T/S, auditing rooms and Auditor Admin Room.

More HGCs are added to the Department at each multiple 600 wd hours. SENIORS The two chief seniors in the area are the C/S (for tech) and the D of P (for Auditors and bodies). It is the D of P who must see that Auditors exist and are on post. It is Tech Services who sees pcs are rounded up and audited. The D of T/S is actually in charge of pcs and all folder files and all board keep-up work. The D of P should have some tech training. The D of T/S need not have any. The C/S of course is the Tech Expert and should be an HSST. If there are no Auditors it is the D of P's neck. If there are no C/Ses it is the C/S's neck.

CRAMMING You will notice no pcs are sent to Review on this new line. Review actions are done in Tech as a patch-up in Tech. The Qual Sec is responsible for overall tech quality but does it by Cramming C/Ses or Auditors. Thus Cramming is a busy street. Cramming must be good, check-outs excellent. If an Auditor doesn't grasp a C/S he has received he gets help from Cramming. Auditors new to the HGC are given a fast hard grooving in in Cramming or a Qual In-terne Course. (New Auditors never audit until grooved in.) Tech will be as good as the Cramming Officer can cram. This line is grooved in by the HAS and kept in by Qual. Or if there is no Qual, it is kept in by the HAS who will find no Qual very embarrassing. DUMMY RUN The line should be dummy run by folders, \"pcs\" and Auditors until they understand it. People are often totally unaware of lines and get very sloppy. Thus this line has to be drilled hard on old and new tech personnel. All must know this exact line. It is a good line. Fully in, it raises the well done hours stat from 250 per week maximum at total over-load to an easy 600 to 800. Auditors must audit five hours a day, 25 minimum per week of well done hours for any bonus to be paid at all. In the SO they get no pay at all much less bonuses if short on their 25. Tech Services and an unenergetic D of P or a bad Dissem Sec and Registrar set-up can cause a no pc situation. And often do unless pushed.

PROCUREMENT The D of P has always had new pc procurement responsibility when all else failed or even when it didn't. Old folders, for example, are a marvelous source of new auditing repairs and inten-sives. An FES done on an old folder and a letter to \"come in and get audited before you fall apart\" is excellent pc procurement, usually neglected by Registrars. Any procurement by a D of P is legitimate. Auditors who have no pcs can write procurement letters and have for 20 years. SUMMARY This is a beautiful line. It has been piloted hard. It will serve as well as it is checked out, drilled in and used. This line is the key to affluence from pcs alone. (But if the org isn't training Auditors heavily, you'll soon have no Auditors to be on it and the org will not gain its high income low cost cushion from training.)

A long C/S also permits an auditor to adjust his own length of session.

This gets checked off as done. The C/S could consist of half the program or even (in shorter programs) all of it. Handling One speeds a line by taking repeated handlings out of it. Less sessions mean less handling. Thus the session is more economical if long. Getting the pc and folder rounded up 5 times when it means the same number of hours to do it 2 times saves wear and tear. This is the benefit of very long C/Ses.

Thorough C/Ses Thus you can have long C/Ses only when you have long programs already done and pinned to the inside of the front cover, a pink one for Progress (non grade) and a green one for Advance (back up the grades). Don't try to save auditing time. Save instead repeated handlings. This does not go into \"over-repair\". A Progress Pgm contains all sorts of bits like 2-wc on \"What do you feel you owe your family\" (as the pc is always getting off about his family in Ruds). The advance of a case is the amount of charge you get off it. Long C/Ses ease your Admin lines greatly. They also give less chance of having ruds go out between sessions.

This may not always be possible in orgs where the Senior C/S has other duties. In no case should this take more than 24 hours and, in most, it should be handled the same afternoon or evening. None of this, of course, relieves the Auditor (even if taken off the case by reason of re-tread, retrain or higher class Auditor needed) of his responsibility for seeing that his Pc is rap-idly handled and F/Ning again.

This means two or more people who mutually have ruds out on the wider group or other dynamics and do not get them in. Example: A husband-wife co-audit team never run O/Ws on the rest of the family be-cause both of them have similar overts and so consider it usual. Example: Prisoners engaged in co-auditing (as in Narconon) may have similar overts, withholds, ARC Brks and/or problems with the rest of society and so do not think of handling them as out-ruds. Example: Two top class auditors co-auditing, have similar overts on the junior audi-tors and the org and so never think to get them in. This can stall cases! A C/S has to take this factor into account wherever he has a possibility of its occur-ring. In one instance mutual out ruds went so far as four auditors, co-auditing, agreeing never to put their overts down on W/Ses \"so they would not lose reputation\". Needless to say all four eventually blew. If the C/S had done a routine check for mutual out ruds, this whole scene would have been prevented and four beings would not have ruined each other. In any situation where a small portion of a larger group is engaged in co-audit the C/S must check routinely for mutual out ruds. This could even apply to an org or vessel which was separate from the rest of society around it: its members could develop mutual out ruds from the rest of society and cases could fail on this point.

C/S Series 97 AUDITING REPORTS, FALSIFYING OF Probably the most covert and vicious crime in auditing is falsifying an auditing report. At first glance, to someone who is trying to PR himself as an auditor or to escape con-sequences of session goofs, this might not seem to be the huge crime that it is. When an auditing report is falsified, means of repairing the pc are denied, out tech and a need for restudy or redrilling of materials is covered up, out tech is spread about and the repute of the org and Scientology are at risk. There are many ways of falsifying an auditing report. Chief amongst them is omission of vital data in the report. Another is faking the things run or the pc's actions or reactions. To the person doing this it may seem that he has covered up his incompetence but in actual fact it is eventually detected. A twice declared person recently messed up the cases of several VIPs by simply omit-ting some of their disagreements with what was being done. Three SPs, now declared, some years ago had a mutual understanding that they would not put down each other's withholds. These three also falsified auditing reports to the effect that they had run certain things on pcs \"and there was nothing on them,\" when in fact they either had not run them or there was reaction which they did not put into the report. They messed up about a dozen people before they were caught and it took many, many hours of careful C/Sing and auditing to salvage those cases (and it also took about two years). They made several hundred serious enemies for themselves and today I doubt any Scientologist would even speak to them and their names are remembered with scathing contempt. It is not only easy to detect a falsified auditing report, it is also inevitable that it will be detected."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"AUDITING REPORTS, FALSIFYING OF 2 HCOB 26.10.76 ARC SW & GRADE 0 102 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The person whose auditing reports have been falsified is easy to spot in folders and re-cords. The auditor marks \"VGIs, F/N\" and the Examiner notes bypassed charge and bad indi-cators. An auditor seeking to prevent this being detected has been known to take the Exam-iner Report from the folder but that there is no Examiner Report would be the first thing a C/S would notice. Examiner Reports have been forged and exchanged with the actual one but this too is very visible. Lack of a proper success story points directly to out tech and if it is not visible in the folder then that folder contains falsified auditing reports. The pc in the midst of his auditing, refuses to re-sign for more. An inspection of folder either finds the out tech in the auditing reports or it doesn't. If the Folder Error Summary finds no out tech, the next thing that is looked for is falsified auditing reports and this is extended to looking at the other cases this auditor has handled to see if there is any similarity of reaction. A D of P interview with the pc will reveal falsified auditing reports. It will contain data that does not appear in the auditing reports. The first thing suspect is the auditing reports. Basically, correct tech applied by a competent auditor who has been trained and in-terned, works and works every time. When it \"doesn't work,\" a C/S begins to look for the real scene. There are many ways he can ascertain the actual scene. Amongst these are outside-the-door session taping, monitors, interviews, lack of success stories, failures to declare, failures to re-sign, Examiner Reports at variances with the session reports, personal check-up into the case and many others. The only thing which temporarily misleads a C/S is a falsified auditing report. But in all our experience with these, the detection of such reports is inevitable even if it occurs a long time afterwards. The person who would falsify an auditing report is usually found to be a suppressive with abundant R/Ses and evil intentions who never should have been trained in the first place. Therefore, the penalty for knowingly falsifying an auditing report in order to make oneself seem more competent than one is or to hide departures from the C/S or to omit vital data necessary to C/Sing, resulting in upsets to a case and time spent in investigation by sen-iors, is actionable by a Committee of Evidence and if the matter is proven beyond reasonable doubt, a cancellation of all certificates and awards, a declare and an expulsion order are man-datory. Should the person perpetrating the falsification of auditing reports run away (blow) before action can be taken, the result is the same and is enforceable even if the person is not present. A green auditor may look upon the offense as slight. If he is too untrained to realize that proper application of tech works every time and that improper application is a gross overt act, he may not realize the seriousness of his action. This however cannot be pleaded as a de-fense. It is not a light thing to end the hopes and close the door on a pc just because one is trying to cover up his blunders.

Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms, as needed. In the chair opposite the Auditor is a doll, as the PC. Coach sits beside doll and is the bullbaiter and gives answers as PC, not about his own case. Training Stress: The drill is the same as for auditing in that the \"PC\" Coach bullbaits the student Auditor using \"fruit\" answers during the session in an attempt to throw the student of a session. Where necessary, the Coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still using \"fruit\" answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak.

The student Auditor must be able to get his own PC, on his own if necessary. Position: Student Auditor and Coach seated at a table. Training Stress: The Coach and student Auditor are seated opposite each other at a table. First the Coach has the student give him the steps in order until he thoroughly understands them and could use them. When the Coach calls off situations, for example, the D of P says he doesn't have any PCs. Or, all PCs on lines need actions you cannot audit, etc. How will you get a PC? Keep throwing situations at the student Auditor until you are confident he could get a PC no matter what barriers existed. Flunks are given for any mishandling, or failing to satis-factorily obtain a PC. The student is passed when he knows how to get a PC. Steps: 1. Inform the D of P that a PC is needed. 2. Hound the D of P to assign you a PC, if he hasn't. 3. Independently go through current PC folders looking for any ready for an action you can do, get their Auditor to complete them to where you can audit them, fast. 4. Hound the D of P if he won't prepare you a PC. 5. Study PC folders of PCs currently not on lines with your Org. Also study the person's CF folder, find out from the study: A. What hasn't been handled. B. What goals he has had for processing. C. What the person's own statement is of what is wrong with him or what he wants handled or improved. D. What person came into Dianetics/Scientology for. (Above are usually liberally stated through-out PC and CF file but almost always on first White form or letter Reg. questionnaire.) Get in comm with the person through a letter and get him in to see the Registrar. PC must sign up with the Registrar and pay the Cashier for processing. Reception pro-vides the routing form.

ED-3 OBSERVING THE OBVIOUS UNBULLBAITED ED-4 (No Bullbaiting on this Drill.) Ref: BTB 26 OCT 70 OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE. Purpose: To train an Auditor to see what is there without additives or opinions. Position: Coach and student seated at table or ambulatory as required. Training Stress: To train an Auditor \"The art of observing the obvious. It's the only way you ever see anything. You look at the is-ness of something, at what is actually there.\" LRH Commands: \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"What do you see?\". Steps: 1. Coach and student may be seated or standing in the class room to start with and may move around to other areas. 2. Coach says \"Start\", \"What do you see?\". 3. The student Auditor tells the Coach what he observes that is plainly visible. 4. The Coach accepts nothing that isn't plainly visible to the student Auditor. Eg. The student is looking at another person in the room: Student: Well, I can really see he's got ears.\" Coach: All right, but from where you are sitting, can you see both ears right now as you are looking at him? Student: Well, no. Coach: Okay. What do you see? Student: I see he's got a left ear. Coach: Fine. 5. After the student has caught on to what observing the obvious is you flunk him for any tacit assumptions, conjectures, deductions of what might be there from what he does see there. (Something the bank says ought to go in company with what is there.) The Coach only accepts what is visible and plain to the eye. 6. The Student Auditor passes this Drill when he can obnose flawlessly. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1957 for the Advanced Clinical Course to help train students to observe the obvious.

The rules of clearing commands are: 1. Under no circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the pc and tell him what the word or command means. 2. Always have the necessary (and good) dictionaries in the auditing room with you. This would include the Tech Dictionary, the Admin Dictionary, a good English dic-tionary, and a good non-dinky dictionary in the pc's native language. For a foreign language case (where the pc's native language is not English) you will also need a dual dictionary for that language and English. (Example: English word \"apple\" is looked up in English/French dictionary and \"pomme\" is found. Now look in the French dictionary to define \"pomme.\") So for the foreign language case two dictionaries are needed: (1) English to foreign language (2) foreign language itself. 3.

Clear the command (or question or list item) backwards by first clearing in turn each word in the command in backwards sequence.

Note: F/Ns obtained on clearing the words does not mean the process has been run. 5. Next, clear the command itself. Auditor asks the pc, \"What does this command mean to you?\" If it is evident from the pc's answer that he has misunderstood a word as it is used in the context of the com-mand: (a) Re-clear the obvious word (or words) using the dictionary. (b) Have him use each word in a sentence until he has it. (The worst fault is the pc using a new set of words in place of the actual word and answering the al-ter-ised word, not the word itself.

Note: that a word reads when clearing a command, an assessment question or listing question does not mean the command or question itself has read necessar-ily. Mis-understood words read on the meter. 6. When clearing the command, watch the meter and note any read on the com-mand. (REF: HCOB 28 FEB 71, C/S SERIES 24, IMPORTANT METERING READING ITEMS.) 7. Don't clear the commands of all ruds and run them, or of all processes and run them. you'll miss F/Ns. the commands of one process are cleared just before that process is run. 8.

(REF: BTB 5 NOV 72R II, REV. 24.7.74, AUDITOR ADMIN SERIES 6R, THE YELLOW SHEET.)

Then, when the need for these correction lists arises one does not need to clear all the words as it has already been done. Thus, such correction lists can be used with-out delay. It is also standard to clear the words of the Word Clearing Correction List early in au-diting and before other correction lists are cleared. This way, if the pc bogs on subse-quent Word Clearing, you have your Word Clearing Correction List ready to use. 9. If, however, your pc is sitting in the middle of an ARC break (or other heavy charge) and the words of the L1C (or other correction list) have not been cleared yet, don't clear first. Go ahead and assess the list to handle the charge. Otherwise it's auditing over an ARC break. In this case you just verify by asking afterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list. All the words of the L1C (or other correction list) would then be cleared thoroughly at the first opportunity – per your C/S's instructions. 10. Do not re-clear all the words of assessment lists each time the list is used on the same pc. Do it once, fully and properly the first time and note clearly in the folder, on the yellow sheet for future reference, which of the- standard assessment lists have been cleared. 11.

Here they are given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved. (Note 2: These have not been written before because I had not deter-mined the results vital to each Level.) There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom of performing actions. A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how the auditor addresses his task. Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point. Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But an auditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Heal-ing but of any repetitive process. Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can do each one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way to handle the tools of auditing. LEVEL ZERO LISTEN STYLE At Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does is not a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is really listening. Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they did reach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this, evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the HAS student. Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this: Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 128 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Adding on higher skills like \"Is the pc talking interestingly?\" or even \"Is the pc talk-ing?\" is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won't talk or isn't interested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc. It really isn't \"Itsa\" to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, \"It's a this\" or \"It's a that.\" Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won't. It's the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa. The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. One doesn't cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that's at Level Zero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles. LEVEL ONE MUZZLED AUDITING This could also be called rote style auditing. Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and not anything else added. It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated, discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a \"muzzle was put on them\", figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack. Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completely muzzled. This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called \"Muzzled Style\" for the sake of brevity. It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn't make gains with the par-tially trained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment. At Level One we don't expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask the question) with no variation, acknowledge the pc's answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said. Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to \"Two-Way Comm\". Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One ses-sions don't disintegrate to Level Zero. Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out – not pc wanderings. A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditor will do. The pc is even put through a few \"do birds fly?\" cycles until the pc gets the idea. Then the processing works."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 3 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 129 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past \"ther-apy experience\", is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pc never got above Level Zero). It's the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains. To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short or-der, using the processes of this Level. To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles – Totally Permissive and To-tally Controlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It's been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are different enough – Listen Style and Muzzled Style – to set anybody straight. LEVEL TWO GUIDING STYLE AUDITING An old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing. We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing. One first guides the pc by \"two-way comm\" into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands. Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style and Muzzled Style Auditing well. Formerly the student who couldn't confront or duplicate a command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or \"Two-Way Comm\". The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa without chop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands. We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at this Level that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, the two things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can ob-serve the actual situation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.) Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what's what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy. Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To use those, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc's case ac-cordingly. The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 4 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 130 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers the pc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been re-vealed. One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc. One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needle except as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what's to be done by the action of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running what's being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numbered accordingly.) At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but not session ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by a higher classed auditor if they occur). To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must have a pc \"willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties\". That presupposes we have an auditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled. Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One under-stands, when one doesn't, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it. Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc's comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this is easy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimu-late the PTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn't being driven to do something about it) as the finite result. The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pc toward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA. The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style. One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commands with good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc's case. O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn't an overt and so eventually blow it. Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II – the ways of keeping a pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2. Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 5 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 131 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES LEVEL III ABRIDGED STYLE AUDITING By Abridged is meant \"abbreviated\", shorn of extras. Any not actually needful audit-ing command is deleted. For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, \"I will repeat the auditing command\" and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when it isn't necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it. In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. We still use repetitive commands expertly, but we don't use rote that is unnecessary to the situation. Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitive commands. At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc. But at the same time, one doesn't necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown. In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This is done more often by observation than command. Yet it is done. We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe. Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don't mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question. On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed. Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing. Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleaned up on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn't stop the pc from doing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a bigger auditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged. One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pc's relief. And one sees it isn't clean by the continued puzzle on the pc's face. There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesn't tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. And so doesn't check it again. Example: \"Has anything else been suppressed?\" One eye on pc, one on needle, needle didn't quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, \"All right, on \" and goes on to next question, eliminating a pc's possible protest read that can be mistaken for an-other \"suppress\"."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 6 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 132 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it im-pedes case advance. But that doesn't mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thorough with Abridged Style Auditing than in rote. One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected re-sult. By \"Abridged\" is meant getting the exact job done – the shortest way between two points – with no waste questions. By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time. The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions. The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes – CT Healing, Prepchecking, Auditing by List. Again it's the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result. LEVEL IV DIRECT STYLE AUDITING By direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner. We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it is direct. By direct, we don't mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc's attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct. It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear. Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed. At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes. These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at the Reactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner. In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a ses-sion to another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all. Thus we have another implication in the word \"direct\". The pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all. In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc's bank and wants no pc in front of it thinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action. All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It looks easy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 7 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 133 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The trick is to be direct in what's wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what's to be done, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, at-tentive, completely relaxed. In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks or assessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list. And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch. The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breaking the pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesn't understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARC Breaking the pc. You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a ses-sion of CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on. In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you'd see the auditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, \"Let's see that in Clay.\" Or the pc doesn't really give an ability he wants to improve and you'd hear a quiet persuasive auditor voice, \"Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Just something, some ability you know, you'd like to improve.\" You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after that it's all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruc-tion. When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assess-ment action hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used. This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward – direct. But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed, but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done. (Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.) LEVEL VI ALL STYLE So far, we have dealt with simple actions. Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa's and Cognites and gets PTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and who must be handled, handled, handled all the way. As auditing TA for a 2½ hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster. So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 8 HCOB 6.11.64 ARC SW & GRADE 0 134 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs. It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding. Use the wrong style on a situation and you've had it. ARC Break! No progress! Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can't continue – or shouldn't. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. The auditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn't really know), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged and bothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress. The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles. Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit. So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can be co-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn't mastered one of the lower level styles. SUMMARY These are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are only variations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing. It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice. As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalize Styles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is. Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs. L.

The \"note\" in the introduction was inserted and processes 3, 7 and 8 accordingly changed by adding brackets to F3. In process 12 F2-F0 were deleted as they change the process. This Bulletin gives a checklist of the Expanded Quad Grade Process Commands. It is not all the possible processes for this level. If more are needed to attain full EP for the level, additional processes can be found in LRH Bulletins, Books, Tapes, PABs and other issues. Each process is run to its full End Phenomena of F/N, Cog, VGIs. Any previously run are re-habbed or completed and any missing flows run. A copy of this checklist is placed in the folder of a pc being run on Expanded Grades and the processes checked off with the date each is run to EP. On any of these processes where the pc answers only\" yes\" or that he did it, find out what it was by asking\" What was it?\" This keeps in the itsa line from pc to auditor. (Reference HCOB 30 June 62.) This Bulletin does not replace Source data. Note: where F2 and F3 of a process are identical except for changing the word \"another\" to \"oth-ers\" F3 is put in brackets. It is recommended to ask the pc for interest before taking the F3 up, as these are really not different flows and many pcs run the F2 with a concept that covers the singular as well as the plural; thus, running F3 without further notice could constitute an overrun and/or lead to protest. 1.

Purpose: To improve the quality of auditing by familiarizing Auditors with the exact procedure of each auditing action through the use of drills. How to use: These drills are in order by levels. The first number indicates the level taught on. Those that begin with TR 00 – (drill No.) are Level Zero Drills. The double zero is to differentiate the drills from TR 0-4. Unbullbaited drills end in odd numbers; and bullbaited end in even numbers. Most drills are done within the basic formats as laid out. Any that don't will be fully covered in the specific drills themselves. Simply start with the first actions and work through the drills in the order given as it's the same order as the ARC SW. Wire Expanded Grade BTB 4 Jan 72 RA. Each drill is done until you know you can do it flawlessly, even while being bullbaited. If a student has trouble on a drill, locate whether the student has a misunderstood or has a skipped gradient and handle either or both with standard Study Tech. This can lead back to outnesses on basics such as TRs, codes or scales. Whatever it is, find out why and handle. Note: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in the place of the process Key Words, for bullbaited drills only. FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLS Name: Auditing on a doll unbullbaited. Commands: As for each separate process. Purpose: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands and proce-dures of each separate auditing action with the actual doingness of auditing."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"ARC STRAIGHTWIRE DRILLS 2 BTB 9.10.71RA ARC SW & GRADE 0 142 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed. In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the PC. (During drill the coach is seated or standing beside the Auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.) Training Stress: This drill is coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheets ex-actly as in a session – as follows: 1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills. 2. Set up shield to prevent TA and admin being seen by PC (doll). 3. Have extra pens under the E-Meter. 4. Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table. 5. Have W/S and Lists readily available in sequence required for the session. Auditor starts the session and runs a standard session with the particular auditing action being taken up on the doll, keeping full session admin and using all standard procedures of the au-diting action. Coach watches drill and points out any outnesses noted giving a \"that's it\" and a re-start. Outnesses should be handled one at a time until none exist... The drill is done on a steeper and steeper gradient until the student can very quickly do the action correctly. The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good TRs 0-4, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion; i.e. flawlessly! FORMAT TO BE USED FOR BULLBAITED DRILLS Name: Auditing _____________ Bullbaited. Commands: As for each separate auditing action. Purpose: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands and proce-dures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session and thereby become flawless in applying it. Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms, as needed. In the chair opposite the Auditor is a doll as PC. Coach sits beside doll and is the bullbaiter and gives an-swers as PC, not about his own case. Training Stress: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the \"PC\" coach bullbaits the student Auditor using \"fruit\" answers during the session in an attempt to throw the student off session. On any list, the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses \"fruit\" answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student Auditor reads off the list items (e.g. L3RF) he squeezes the cans for reads. When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should throw in various signs of pc out of sessionness. (Per HCOB on Good Indicators and BTB on Bad Indicators.) The student Audi-tor must: 1. Obnose the out of sessionness."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"ARC STRAIGHTWIRE DRILLS 3 BTB 9.10.71RA ARC SW & GRADE 0 143 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 2. Align this to the process run. 3. Handle. An example is, on a Listing and Nulling procedure an out of sessionness is observed, the Auditor queries and follows through with an L4BRA at once. (An L4BRA is a repair list.) The PC bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc. But he must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968 \"Coaching\", especially the second paragraph – \"Coach with reality\". Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student Auditor to carry it out, and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation. Stress is on training the student Auditor to have his TRs 0-4 in on the bullbaiter. The coach (bullbaiter) does the \"start\", flunking or \"That's it\". Flunks are given for any im-proper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin. Each drill is to be done thoroughly, building up the speed of Auditor commands and actions. (\"It's the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains in a ses-sion.\" LRH) When the student Auditor has done these steps to his satisfaction, he gets a starrate checkout. The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0-4, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion. These are the drills that train the student Auditor to handle all the elements in a session, so be exact and be real. Note: Clearing of commands is per BTB 2 May 72R and other Bulletins and PLs on the sub-ject (i.e. clearing each word of command backwards). TR 00-1 \"REMEMBER SOMETHING\" UNBULLBAITED.

This data is contained in the book and must be thoroughly studied with particular attention to the \"Processing Section.\" These processes prepare the pc's case for auditing on Dianetics. In running these lists the Auditor directs the PC to moments action took place, not when somebody said it took place or merely the concept that it did happen. You get the actual physical occurrence. Each time you ask the PC to recall an incident of a certain kind you then ask, after he recalls it, to pay attention to a certain sense channel which was present during the time he experienced it. The"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"ARC STRAIGHTWIRE DRILLS 8 BTB 9.10.71RA ARC SW & GRADE 0 148 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES circular disc is provided for the purpose of directing which sense to pay particular attention to. You place the disc over the question you are going to ask and the sense perception at the top is asked for. When you go to the next list question you move the disc over it and rotate it one sense counter-clock-wise so that you have a new sense to ask for. When you go to a new page of questions in the book you turn over the disc so that you have a new set of senses to ask for. If you don't have a disc use the same senses as listed on the bot-tom of each page and tick them off one after the other as you go along. The Auditor should make sure that the PC speaks aloud the things he is recalling. The pre-clear's nod or \"yes\" to signify that he has recalled something is insufficient. Have him select an actual moment in his life called for by the question. Try to get him to re-sense that moment with the perceptic called for on the disc. If the PC finds it extremely difficult to recall any one question in these lists, simply pass over it and go to the next question. You can go over a list more than once if the PC does not reach EP the first time through. Steps: 1. R-factor to PC – \"We are now going to run the Self Analysis lists from the book Self Analysis. I will be asking you to recall specific incidents in your life. Try to recall the moment it actually occurred, not just the concept that it did occur. When you have re-called it tell me what it is.

The questions – would be: Sight: \"Try to 'see' what you saw in the incident.\" \"What did you 'see' at that time?\" Smell: \"Recall the odors that you smelled in the incident\" \"What odors did you smell at that time?\" Touch: \"Recall what you were touching in the incident.\" \"What were you touching at that time?;' Color: \"Try to perceive the colors in the incident.\" \"What colors did you perceive at that time?\" Tone: \"Try to contact the tone of the sounds present in the incident.\" \"What tones were present at that time?\" External \"Try to perceive the external motion in the incident.\" Motion: \"What external motion did you perceive at that time?\" Emotion: \"Try to recall and feel again the emotion you felt in the incident.\" \"What emotion did you feel at that time?\" Loudness: \"Pay particular attention to the loudness of the sounds in the incident.\" \"What was the loudness of the sounds at that time?\" Body Position: \"Pay particular attention to your own body position in the incident.\" \"What was your body position at that time?\" Sound: \"Pay particular attention to the sounds in the incident.\" \"What sounds were there at that time?\""},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"ARC STRAIGHTWIRE DRILLS 11 BTB 9.10.71RA ARC SW & GRADE 0 151 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Weight: \"Pay attention to the weight of things in the incident.\" \"What was the weight of things at that time?\" Personal \"Pay attention to your personal motion in the incident.\" Motion: \"What personal motion was there at that time?\" Each list is run to F/N Cog VGIs.

EXCERPT From the process known as \"Two-way Communication\" we move on to the process known as \"Elementary Straightwire.\" Elementary Straightwire has two basic commands. One of these commands is used continually, over, and over, and over, and over, until the commu-nication lag is entirely flat on it and then the other command is used over, and over, and over until the communication lag is entirely flat, at which time it will be discovered that the first command will now give communication lag. And so it is used over, and over, and over, and then the second one is used over, and over, and over. In other words, what we do here is to use this process of Elementary Straightwire with just two commands, continually, one com-mand at a time, flattening each communication lag encountered. While one is doing this, of course, one maintains two-way communication. He acknowledges the fact that the preclear has recalled something and is in general alert to receive from the preclear an originated com-munication, answer it, and give further orders. The two commands of Elementary Straight-wire are: \"Give me something you wouldn't mind remembering,\" \"Give me something you wouldn't mind forgetting.\" This can be varied with: \"Tell me something you wouldn't mind remembering,\" \"Tell me something you wouldn't mind forgetting.\" This Elementary Straight-wire is a standard form. If it is varied it should be varied towards simplicity. A simple form of straightwire is \"Remember something,\" over and over, again, and again, and again, and again, and again. Do not use, however, \"Forget something,\" since this is far too rough for the pre-clear. Another even simpler form is to apply \"Remember something\" to the Dynamics, such as \"Remember a man,\" \"Remember a group.\" The only error that can be made in Elementary Straightwire is to get too fancy, for one does not believe that an auditor who has advanced this far in auditing would make an error in communication. There is an entire gamut which we call \"The next to the last list in Self-Analysis\" published in the original edition of \"Self-Analysis\" which has many times been known to break a person from a neurotic to a sane state. This is: \"Can you recall a time that is really real to you?\" \"Can you recall a time when you were communicating well to someone?\" \"Can you recall a time when someone was communicating well to you?\" \"Can you recall a time when you felt Affinity for someone?\" \"Can you recall a time when someone felt Affinity for you?\" By keeping this in the Under-standing or Affinity line a case advances more rapidly than if mis-emotion and other factors are addressed."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" ARC SW & GRADE 0 155 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE WASHINGTON, D.C. Staff Auditors' Conference Of February 16, 1959 EXCERPT Past and Future Experience Now, the next thing we're going to run into here is Past and Future Experience. This is a bid for two things: One, the lowest level case there is – because experience, to him, is a dub-in, usually. Or it's a figure-figure, or it's something, so it compares to the Reality Scale. His definition of experience compares with the Reality Scale. His definition of experience is a direct index to the Reality Scale, by the way. What does experience mean? He'll say, \"Experience – that's very easy. To consider.\" There you've got your figure-figure level. \"What does experience mean?\" Well, \"To write about it or make something out of it – experience is that thing which you use to manufacture the future.\" He's dub. \"Now, what is an experience?\" \"Well, experience is that which you try not to have.\" That's probably black or invisible. Or, \"It's the thing you forget,\" would be blackness. \"Ex-perience is something you try to forget\" – invisibility level. \"Experience is something you have to cope with.\" Obsessive confront. \"Experience is – ah – well, experience – that's pretty hard to define – experience. I guess it's to go through something.\" You're getting a fairly sane response – to go through something. To have an actual adventure, something of this sort. You're getting a fairly sane reaction to experience. So don't think that Past and Future Experience is pegging up at the highest level of the Reality Scale. It isn't. This process was found, in the 21st American, to be the undercut proc-ess. This was the lowest undercut process. And this is a killer, and it is very trying to an audi-tor. A very trying process, because it offers so many wonderful temptations. And that's what's wrong with this process. Now, you run these two questions, one after the other, with no assessment, no E-Meter, nothing. You just put the E-Meter down after you've done the Dynamic Straight Wire thing, because on Dynamic Straight Wire, when you said, \"Children,\" the needle was going on a gradual shift over here, and a little theta bop now and then. You said, \"Children,\" and it fell a dial, or all of a sudden started doing a big theta bop in the middle. When you got off of children, it settled down to the other pattern. That told you that you had something to be run on the subject of children. That he will also, at the same time, give you a daffy reading, he will tell you some daffy terminal to represent – so you needed the E-Meter there.

Say, \"We're going to run something about experience. Now, we're going to see how you get along with this little process, and here are the commands of it: What part of your life would you be willing to re-experience? And the other command is: What part of the fu-ture would you be willing to experience? Now, here's the first command: What part of your life would you be willing to re-experience?\" The answer actually called for is a time, isn't it? And this is a time process. But there are very few preclears that will find this out for a very long period. They won't give you any-thing but super-significances and ball-up, and the pc who is real bad off will give you a type of experience. You accept all these things. You say, \"What part of your life would you be willing to re-experience?\" He says, \"Well, eating cake.\" That's an answer? That's an answer. And that's followed with this: \"What part of the future would you be willing to experience?\" He says, \"Well, more cake.\" That's an answer. So you just accept any answer that he gives you on the line. It gradually will boil down to a time answer. And it will gradually go back-track. The longer you run it, the more track you're going to cover, the more future you're go-ing to cover. And there will be periods when the individual is absolutely sure that he is totally predicting the future. He gets into implants, let us say, that tell him what the future is all about. He's stuck 8000 years ago, but he's telling you about the future. All kinds of odd phe-nomena show up. But engrams come up and slap you in the teeth, one right after the other. You run this for a while, and the individual says, \"Oooh, well, you know I really wouldn't be willing – well, I would be willing – I don't know – I would – oohh, well – I really don't know – dental operation there, I was a young boy – I don't know if I'd like to re-experience that – I guess I could re-experience sitting in the – no, no, no. I could re-experience – I could re-experience the next day after it.\" You say, \"That's fine,\" and just mark it down with the ball-point: \"Dental experience as a child.\" That one he can't confront. Now, you're never going to run it as an engram, but you're going to have some tag of it as an en-gram. See, it may show you something. As you go along and he runs into hot experiences, real, real hot experiences one right after the other, it is about time you put the E-Meter back in his paws. Get the idea? You don't have to start it with the E-Meter, but if he starts running into hot experiences, or if he gets into an engram and he can't seem to get out of the thing, the thing to do is not run the engram but give him an E-Meter and spot it in time for him. Get it spotted in time. If he's running into them hot and heavy, one right after the other, just leave him with the E-Meter. But if there is only one you have to spot in time, and then in a little while he doesn't seem to be running any more, take the cans away from him again and put the E-Meter aside. But if he starts running into one that obsessively sticks with him, don't let him flounder in the thing for an hour. Don't let him wallow in this one. Because he will just wallow in it, and this is no process-this is not a good process to run an engram with. So you let him out, OK? And the way you let him out is to locate it in time with an E-Meter. And you go on running the process. Now, as I say, it offers enormous temptations to the auditor – beautiful temptations to run the things contacted. As you sit this out, you actually are going to change the characteristic of the engram you will ultimately run on the case. But you keep listing engrams that he runs into. Keep listing en-grams that he runs into, well knowing that he will favor motivators. For every one of those motivators there is an overt. Now an engram that he consistently and persistently keeps hit-"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"STAFF AUDITORS’ CONFERENCE 3 EXCERPT – HCOB 16.02.59 ARC SW & GRADE 0 157 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES ting and hitting and hitting, you are going to find in that engram probably the engram you will run, eventually. But not until he is in PT, out of the engram, it seems to have dropped out, and so forth, and he seems to be all smooth on this thing, are you going to reach for that one again. You are going to flatten the process and then go to the engram. Here we go. Engram Running. Of course, that is run all the way through with an E-Meter. Give him the cans and start out on this engram that you more or less found with Past and Future Experience. Now, this is going to undercut cases, and I don't care how long you run it. I don't care if you run it for two weeks, because this is a very productive process. But if you are going to run it over that period of time, it isn't noted here, but some Third Rail had better be brought in here some place. And he'd better be shifted up finally until havingness. And you put in Past and Future Experience, right after that line, \"Combine With Third Rail If Run More Than 8 Hours\". If you run it eight hours, this guy's havingness is going to start dropping on him, and you are going to run into difficulties. You could get into difficulties. All right. .... \"Recall a Time\" Q. Is \"recall something\" preferred over \"recall a time\"? I have heard \"Recall a time you did something to somebody,\" and also \"Recall something you did to somebody,\" which is slightly different. A. \"Recall a time\" is always a superior process, unless the individual is consistently not recalling a time, at which time he is not obeying the auditing command. So you should say, \"Recall something you have done to\" to somebody who can't spot something on a time track. Q. What's the difference there? A. You are running really two processes with \"Recall a time you did something,\" and you are running only one process, \"Recall something you have done.\" Q. Can he continue to do that without recalling a time? A. Yeah. Definitely. Anything else? \"Recall a time,\" all by itself – you just sit down and say to a pc, \"Recall a time. Thank you. Recall a time. Thank you.\" Some interesting things would happen to a case. Time, you see, is the single aberration.

Find the auditor, find the pc, find the auditing room. Establish a goal for the session. Ask for present time problem. Present time problem: If PTP exists then run it as follows and in no other way. Do not yak around about it. Just ask if there is one, see if one registers on the meter. On the PT problem that registers on the meter (not some other one) do the following. Ask for and write down all the persons connected with this problem. That problem in-cludes the preclear. On each of these persons, one after the other, beginning with the one most real to the pc, run this: \"Think of something you have done to (selected person).\" \"Think of something you have withheld from (selected person).\" These commands are run one after the other until the selected person chosen is some-what flat. (Pc begins to repeat things he has recalled before.) Do this to each person involved in the problem. PT Problems were cut out of HGC because auditors burned up half an intensive on them. A PT Problem never requires more than a couple of hours to flatten. No \"when\" is used with PT problem by Selected Persons. Use Rudiments and check PT Problem each session and handle as above.

When list is completed, take those items written down and run: \"Think of something you have done to (selected terminal you wrote down).\" \"Think of something you have withheld from (selected terminal, same one).\" Run these questions on each, one after the other, until pc seems flat. If no daffy terminals are found on survey, survey it all again. If none are found this second time, skip this process. Do this only once per auditor per pc. Past and Future Experience: This process goes rapidly into engrams but can be continued even if engrams are con-tacted. Run these two questions one after the other, one time per each. \"What part of your life would you be willing to re-experience?\" \"What part of the future would you be willing to experience?\" Keep an accurate record of any engrams contacted. When engrams persist in the pc's view, carefully spot them in time for him. Engram running: Find the engram necessary to resolve the case. Once you have chosen it and have begun to run it, be sure you have the motivator and the overt and then do not do not do not do not depart from that incident to run another that \"drops better\" or comes up. In other words once you have found an incident stay on it until it is flat. Not-is Straight Wire: When you have flattened an engram thoroughly with all five commands gone over twice, run Not-Is Straight Wire between incidents. In other words, flatten an engram, then run Not-Is Straight Wire, get that a bit flat and locate and run the next incident.

Also, remember that these things (Recall Processes) take the pc out of PT and put him back in. You stop one with the PC back in PT. The Comm bridge to be used on this process is: \"When you next get an answer close to present time we will end this proc-ess if it is all right with you.\" Then don't go on for an hour or two, catch it with 8 or 10 com-mands by seeing the pc is doing a short cycle at the time and has started back up. \"Recall Exhaustion\" is a simple, very effective version of a work process. \"Recall Creating\" is a good way, apparently, to mop up Step 6 flubs. Therefore you can use these processes in the HGC or you can, when it is okayed, use them in training. These are individual processes and not co-audit.

Op Pro by Dup and Forgetting are a pair that recently showed up as having a possible specific value – i.e. to create a specific effect upon a specific difficulty. Evidently Admiration and Critical are a dichotomy. Maxine Kozak suggests that Du-plication is Admiration. From this I looked over Critical on the APA (OCA) profile and saw that the low critical might be influenced by Op Pro by Dup. A test should be made of this. The other process is less nebulous in action. The specific for a bad memory is Forget-ting run in Brackets. You will ordinarily find an automaticity of forgetting when you ask \"Re-call something you wouldn't mind other people forgetting.\" This is a \"bad memory\". Nothing like a good conscience to retain a good memory. The commands of Forgetting would be a 6-way bracket. Recall (or think of) something you wouldn't mind 1. Forgetting yourself 2. Another person forgetting 3. Forgetting about another 4. Another forgetting about you 5. Other people forgetting 6. Another person forgetting about another person. Each command is cleared.

Once each over and over. End process only with pc in present time on cycle. \"Recall communicating to someone\" \"Recall a time you felt affinity for someone\" \"Recall something that is really real to you\" Now people do have time tracks, the time span of the individual from beingness to present time on which lies the sequence of events of his total existence. And when the pre-clear is in session and is being run on a recall type process, he, with his attention, goes up and down this time track. He may recall things only from this life or he may recall things from his whole past track; but however that may be, his attention cycles from early on the track to pre-sent time or from present time to early on the track to present time. This is known as the cycle aspect of recall type processes. In ending such a process, it is of utmost importance that the auditor end it with the preclear in present time on the cycle. The auditor wants to watch end-ing the process when the preclear has not made a smooth cycle into present time, but has made a big jump from way back in the past to present time. In such a case, the preclear has really bounced out of the past incident into present time, and it is only an apparency that the preclear is in present time. So when ending such a process, the auditor must exert caution to be certain the pre-clear is in present time. Being left with one's attention back on the track is not a comfortable sensation and sometimes can be quite painful, despite any justification offered by an auditor who himself has no reality on the time track, and I hope there are no such auditors. With Cause ARC Straight Wire, the auditor must forget his fastidiousness about end-ing the process precisely so on the last command, \"Recall something that is really real to you.\" He ends the process, no matter on what command of Cause ARC Straight Wire, when the preclear's attention has come into or close to present time, close to present time being the last day or two. In ending such a process the communication bridge used is as follows: \"The next time you come close to present time I am going to end this process.\" He continues to give the commands using the question, \"When was that?\", after each answer the preclear gives and before the acknowledgement. When the preclear gives an answer close to present time, he"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"EXPANSION OF OT-3A PROCEDURE, 2 HCOB 9.03.60 STEP TWO HGC ALLOWED PROCESSES ARC SW & GRADE 0 166 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES says, \"That was the last command of that process; end of process.\" Bang. With processes that cycle, there can be no communication bridges like, \"If it's alright with you in a few more commands I am going to end this process.\" It could take fifty more commands until the pre-clear is close to present time; and by that time, the preclear has entirely forgotten that there ever was any intention on the auditor's part to end the process as it seems to him that the audi-tor must have changed his mind and decided to run the process longer than a few commands. An auditor should not get upset with a preclear when the auditor, in an effort to get the preclear to give an answer right in present time, starts the preclear back down the time track again. Remember it is the auditor who calls the shot, and if he misses, then he had better learn to gage it a bit better. A good auditor allows himself time in which to properly end a process. Now two further cyclic processes which can be seen under Step Two of OT-3A are: 1. \"What would it be all right for you to make forgotten?\" 2. \"What would you permit to have happen again?\" These are called Cause Elementary Straight Wire and are two separate processes which are not to be run alternately. The first process puts the preclear at cause over forgetting, and the second process re-habilitates the preclear's ability to duplicate. These are both terrific processes in turning on recall in the preclear. All processes under Step Two are unlimited, with the \"make forgotten\" one only slightly less unlimited as it has a bit of a tendency to run down havingness. Having-ness, however, should be checked upon in each session and run as needed. The auditor should not consider Step Two of OT-3A lightly. These processes are, in reality, very potent and will certainly do more for CCH-step cases than anything we have had before. An example of this is how preclears broke through from psychosis to neurosis to san-ity with the simplified version of ARC Straight Wire as given in the original Self Analysis. So use these processes and win faster. Note: On second thoughts for purposes of differentiation, the first process, \"What would it be all right for you to make forgotten?\", should be termed Cause Elementary Straight Wire; and the second process, \"What would you permit to have happen again?\", shall be called Duplication Straight Wire. These two processes were first used in early Advanced Clinical Courses in Phoenix and were called at that time \"Elementary Straightwire\". The commands of \"Elementary Straightwire\" as given in Dianetics 1955 were: \"Give me some-thing you wouldn't mind remembering\" and \"Give me something you wouldn't mind forget-ting\". As the ability to recall depends upon the mechanisms of forgetting and remembering (the ability to duplicate) you can easily understand the importance of these in Step Two of OT-3A. L.

RON HUBBARD Via Hubbard Communications Office 163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11 _______________________________________________________________________ 18 February 1955 STRAIGHT WIRE The oldest form of psychotherapy involved the questioning of the patient about his dreams. This is currently dramatized by psychology. A more modern type of psychotherapy consists of asking a preclear about his past. Both of these, and many other activities in Dianetics and Scientology could be in-cluded under the heading of Straight Wire. Effective particularly from 1.1 on the tone scale to 1.8, the processes embraced under the heading \"Straight Wire\" have all one purpose in common: this is the purpose of making the preclear stretch a \"straight wire\" between Cause and Effect across the intervening dis-tance, whether this \"distance\" could be a distance in terms of location or a distance in terms of time. Any process in Dianetics or Scientology is a Third Dynamic process. Thus, any proc-ess in Dianetics or Scientology requires communication. In Straight Wire and any other proc-ess, this fact must be observed by the auditor: that a two-way communication must be main-tained. Thus, when administering any process which could be called \"Straight Wire,\" the auditor should be careful at the same time to maintain two-way communication. When he originally started the session the auditor captured some ground. He established two-way communication, whether by mimicry, conversation, or discussion. He must never lose this captured ground. Thus, when running Straight Wire, when running Opening Procedure of 8-C, Opening Procedure by Duplication, Remedy of Havingness, Spotting Spots in Space or any other process, it is necessary that this gained ground be maintained. The term \"straight wire\" itself is meant to describe the imaginary straight line between Cause and Effect. The trouble with a preclear is that he is doing too many things VIA. He is doing anything and everything in life VIA. He is obtaining via food. He is looking via glasses. He is feeling and expressing emotion via glands. He is utilizing or experiencing effort via muscles. He is thinking via (he thinks) a brain. He is obtaining sensation, sustenance, and even revenge, via food. He is experiencing sensation and making the future via his genitals, and he is even trying to experience the origin of life, in most cases, via a church."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"STRAIGHT WIRE 2 PAB 46 – 18.02.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 172 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES His dependency upon objects and services is such that his own creativeness becomes suppressed, submerged, for this working law is always present: that upon which one becomes dependent becomes, at length, one's enslaver. When anyone sets up anything automatically, that thing becomes his randomity at some future date. We can observe this in many ways, but the entire summation of this can be grouped under the heading \"VIA.\" Should the auditor bring the preclear to a point where a certain cause and a certain ef-fect can be joined together without the intervention of a VIA, then the auditor has materially gained. Such a process is the Opening Procedure of 8-C, for here the preclear is being asked to connect, at least as a body, directly with a wall. As he reaches out to touch a spot on that wall, he is, in effect, stringing a straight line. It is notable that the Opening Procedure of 8-C was first designed for use upon an exteriorized person, and when one has a preclear exterior-ized, running through the steps of the Opening Procedure of 8-C and the remainder of 8-C as given in Issue 24-G of the Journal of Scientology produces very marked effects. If your preclear cannot have an effect he certainly cannot change. If he cannot cause an effect to occur, he certainly cannot change himself. All time is change – change is time. While, basically, time is simply a consideration, the considerations of time itself are mechani-cally tracked by the alteration of the position of the particles in space. Your preclear is stuck wherever there was no motion of particles, whether the moment is a pleasure moment, a tri-umph, a failure, or even death. In the absence of particle motion, as far as he is concerned, if he has lost his power to change his considerations, no time has existed. Thus, those things which you find in the engram bank which are most readily available to the preclear are things which contain no change in them, or things which have a change immediately before them and after them, but have no change between. In the absence of this change, we get a condition of timelessness in an engram or facsimile which permits that incident to \"float\" on the track and thus rise up to present time. As the preclear becomes more and more embedded in motionless incidents he be-comes harder and harder to change himself. Or, as he dramatizes to a marked degree his own bank, in the most ordinary living, then, he dramatizes the changeless moments, and he, him-self, does not change. The basic confusion of a preclear lies in the fact that an awareness of awareness unit basically has no mass, meaning or mobility. It has qualities and potentials, but it does not have position in space, nor, in its highest form, any movement in space. It can be at will in various positions in space, but it is not, itself, in space. As this is the case you can see that a preclear is dramatizing the truth when he is holding himself and motionless incidents mo-tionless. In other words, if change to him is totally a particle shift in space, then he is apt to consider himself moving as the particles move. If he is moving he is actually to some degree disobeying the most basic quality of theta. Motion, then, to him, becomes antipathetic. On the lowest toned catatonic one finds this dramatization in full progress. A motionless person is then dramatizing the truth. But in all aberration we discover that it is the ingredient of truth which maintains the aberration in force. He is dramatizing motionlessness, and is motionless, but the truth of the matter is that, as a thetan, he should be able to make things move at will and appear in various positions in space. Thus, in clinging to the truth he loses his ability to move particles, and thus loses his ability to have time. This is best manifested as his commu-nication, but as his communication drops, so drop his reality and his affinity. In other words, although he clings to the motionlessness of being a thetan, he loses the basic qualities of be-ing a thetan, which are those of Knowingness and Understanding."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"STRAIGHT WIRE 3 PAB 46 – 18.02.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 173 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The basic confusion of any preclear, then, is to move or not to move. Shakespeare has said \"to be or not to be\" is the question. When it comes to getting a preclear upscale, the ques-tion is \"to move or not to move.\" The basics of Straight Wire are designed to bring the preclear into the realization that he, himself, can be at either the cause or effect point of a communication line, and that he, himself, does not have to be the particle moving on that line. Being the particle and insisting upon the truth that he isn't moving simply stops his communication entirely. Particles move on the straight line between Cause and Effect. Cause and Effect themselves are not in motion. The task is to get the individual to assume the re-sponsibility of moving particles. With this comes the realization on his part that he, himself, does not have to move in order to move particles, and thus he will come upscale. Getting him to move his body around the room is an excellent method of accomplishing this, but to many preclears the movement of a body is a near-impossibility. And these can contemplate only the moving of a memory or an idea. Thus, from 1.1 to 1.8 on the tone scale we find the best ther-apy to be that which directs itself toward the thinkingness below effort – the moving of ideas. There is no particular reason to concentrate solely upon a preclear's past. Actually, a preclear is not the product of the past, he is the product of himself. All the past can do for him is to accumulate and hold for him the information that it is bad for him to move, or act, or do. So, let us take a preclear whom we have gotten into communication and work with his more elementary ideas and thus get him to string straight lines between Cause and Effect. Elementary Straight Wire has two commands. The auditor takes the first of these and uses it as long as is necessary to entirely flatten the preclear's hesitancy as represented by his communication lag. His communication lag is merely the expression of VIAs on the line, which amounts to the preclear's unwillingness to string a straight line. The questions are: \"Give me something you wouldn't mind remembering,\" \"Give me something you wouldn't mind forgetting.\" A more elementary form of this would be: \"Remember something,\" \"Forget some-thing,\" but this is far too direct for our preclear. If you will notice, a very direct and forth-right person, if surrounded by people who are more covert, gets a very bad going-over for it. Thus it is in processing when you try to string a very straight line with a preclear he will sometimes resist. Slightly less elementary than Elementary Straight Wire as above is the next-to-the-last list in Self Analysis: \"Can you recall something that is really real to you,\" \"Can you re-call a time when you were in good communication with someone,\" \"Can you recall a time when someone was in good communication with you,\" \"Can you recall a time when you felt some affinity for someone,\" \"Can you recall a time when someone felt some af-finity for you.\" The entire text of Self Analysis, in its original edition now available from the Founda-tion in Phoenix, is devoted to rehashing the preclear's past to show him that it is not quite as dangerous as it is made out to be, and that it won't bite him if he remembers some things about it. From this form of Straight Wire we go into a more complicated form as given in Self Analysis in Scientology, a converted edition of the original Self Analysis. The edition is con-verted, by the way, simply by substituting everywhere in its text for the word \"recall\" the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"STRAIGHT WIRE 4 PAB 46 – 18.02.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 174 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES word \"mock up.\" Simply by substituting \"mock up\" in the directions at the beginning of each list, one has a modern Self Analysis. Now it is very remarkable that the less specific and sequitur the auditor's questions are, the better the results with the preclear. Another form of Straight Wire is quite superior to those above, but is a very vicious and violent process. It is contained in The Creation of Human Ability, which is the printed edition, much expanded, of the earlier Auditor's Handbook. The basic command of this proc-ess is: \"Start Lying,\" \"Keep on Lying.\" This can be particularized with: \"Tell me some lies about your past,\" \"Tell me some lies about me present,\" \"Tell me some lies about the future,\" the auditor each time making sure that the preclear is using non-actual places and times. Remember that while running Straight Wire one must maintain a two-way communi-cation. Many a case has been lost simply because the preclear wanted to say something and the auditor was so intent upon the process that he paid no attention whatsoever to the pre-clear's urge to communicate. Remember that one-way communication is a First Dynamic op-eration; that two-way communication is necessary for a Third Dynamic operation; that under one-way communication a preclear will not get well; that under two-way communication a preclear will get well. Thus, in running Straight Wire do not begrudge the preclear a few mo-ments' discussion of the incident he has just recalled, or discussion of phenomena he has sud-denly noticed. Do not crush him simply because he wishes to express himself. This is essentially a subjective process, and the auditor should make sure that the pre-clear speaks aloud the things he is remembering. The preclear's nod or \"yes\" to signify that he has recalled something or has invented something is insufficient, and should always be sus-pect, for preclears who are very bad off pervert or invert every communication line they use and so they will not be doing the process if given any slightest opportunity. Elementary Straight Wire and other forms of Straight Wire are intensely beneficial from 1.1 to 1.8 on the Tone Scale, but after you have your preclear up to 1.8 or above, re-member that there are better processes.

Get the pc, sit the pc in his or her chair, and then sit down across from the pc, knees a few inches from the Pc's. 5. Ask the pc if it is all right to audit in the room and if not, make things right by adjust-ing the room or location of auditing. 6. Tell the pc the purpose of such sessions (Reality Factor) – \"I want to improve your abil-ity.\" An hour would be a good approximate length for a session. The process win point may occur before that and if it does, end off the session. 7. Tell the pc \"Start of Session\" and start your worksheet.(These will be kept throughout the entire session, as the Auditor goes along.) 8.

Use a dictionary and have the pc make up sentences to clear any words until the pc understands all the commands. (Note quickly on your worksheets what the commands mean to the pc and any words you have him look up.) Repeat this procedure for the other two basic commands (Ref.: BTB 2 May 72R Clear-ing Commands). 9. Give the pc an R-factor that you are going to be using different endings on the ques-tions as you go along, and that you will clear each new ending as you come to it. 10. Give the pc an R-factor that after each question you will be asking him to recall a par-ticular sense in that incident. 11. Clear the \"senses\" one at a time with the pc and find out what each means to him. Use the dictionary and the definitions as given below, and have pc make up sentences to clear any words until the pc understands all of the senses. Clear \"sight\" as what the pc actually saw at the time the incident was taking place. Clear \"smell\" as what odors were present during the scene he is recalling. Clear \"touch\" as anything he was actually touching at the time with the sensation of touch including pressure. Clear \"colour\" as the actual colour contained in the scene called for.

This is the watchword of processing. Although com-munication, as completely outlined in Dianetics, 1955! is a universal solvent, remember that there are also two other comers to the triangle, and that one of these corners is Reality. That R corner of the triangle is very important to you as an auditor because you, having very great certainties on this and on that, are very prone to forget that your Realities are greater than those of your preclear. The reality level of the preclear is dependent on how much he is \"not-ising\" his envi-ronment. If he is not-ising it, he must believe that it is dangerous, and must believe that he himself does not have the power to make anything in it disappear or vanish for himself. Therefore, his reality level is as great as he is strong, and it is as poor as he is weak. Do you know that you are processing preclears who do not believe that thought has anything to do with action? You are processing preclears who believe that thinking a thought will influence nothing. You are processing preclears who believe that thinkingness is one thing and acting-ness is an entirely different thing, and that no amount of thinkingness is going to influence any amount of actingness. This is apathy, indeed, and along with that goes an unreality which would appall you. Yes, these preclears can get mock-ups. They can get concepts. They can be very obe-dient. They can even be run with SOP 8-C and somehow or another muddle through it, but the joker here is that the auditor is actually monitoring the body of the preclear, and of course a body can respond to orders, and will respond probably faster to the auditor's orders than to the thetan the auditor is processing. Thus a preclear can be put through any number of contortions and convolutions in processing without getting anywhere at all. The auditor is simply doing it. Find the reality level of your preclear. Unless you find the reality level of the preclear you are not going to reach the preclear, because the preclear is as alive as things are real. Now, if this is so important, then let us see how far south we would have to go to reach some preclears. Mechanical two-way communication might very well be much too tough for 75% of the preclears you will process. Just ordinary conversation is actually over"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"REALITY LEVEL OF PRECLEAR 2 PAB 54 – 10.06.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 184 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES their heads. People that we are trying to reach do not know the auditor is acknowledging them when he says \"Okay.\" Let us look at this acknowledgment of the preclear, and let us discover that the audi-tor, in order to acknowledge the preclear, must also make the preclear aware that he is being acknowledged. Thus, when an auditor says \"Okay,\" or \"All right,\" or \"That's fine,\" the other part of the statement is to make the preclear aware that an acknowledgment has been deliv-ered. Thus, a \"Did you hear me?\" is quite often beneficial. When the preclear finally admits that he did hear the \"Okay,\" and when the auditor makes sure that he time after time hears the \"Okay,\" you will notice that the communication, on the acknowledgment level, starts to work with the preclear. But it won't work as long as the preclear is oblivious of the \"Okays\" the auditor is giving. Of course, you must give the preclear an \"Okay\" for every action or com-pleted thought he performs. You must acknowledge what he has said or done, but you must also be very sure that he receives that acknowledgment. It is not out of order to face him squarely and hold up one finger and say, \"Wait a minute, did you hear me say 'Okay'?\" Now there are two processes which are at once the most basic of processes and which are very low on the Reality Scale as well as high on it. A person processed on these processes should not believe that the auditor believes his reality level is low. Quite the contrary. Such a process as this one happens to be very good anywhere on the tone scale. And this process is, \"Think a thought,\" \"Receive a thought.\" You are in essence processing thinkingness. I wonder how long and how often you have processed preclears who could not clearly or differentiatively understand that they were thinking a thought? The auditing command is simply, \"Think a thought.\" The preclear is given this command time and time again, and he vocalizes the thought back to the auditor, and the auditor acknowledges the fact that he has received that thought, aloud. And the pre-clear is run until the preclear knows, absolutely, that he himself, not some machine, not some energy mass, not his toe, or his hat, is thinking the thought. The preclear will start out think-ing thoughts which are actually handed to him from some mysterious source. When the com-munication lag on this is entirely flat, and when the preclear knows that he himself is thinking the thought, the auditor can then run the other side of the process. \"Receive a thought\" is run with the following auditing command: \"Tell me a thought you would be willing to receive.\" This is then run until it, as a process, is entirely flat: when it is no longer producing any result or comm lag. Part of the \"Think a thought\" process is to have the preclear place the thought in vari-ous locations after he has thought it. Have his shoe think a thought, have his hat think a thought, have a lamp think the thought, have a rug think the thought. This gets the preclear into the practice of placing the thought somewhere. Thus, thoughts are less likely to appear suddenly and magically out of his machinery. Very curious phenomena result from \"Think a thought\" and \"Receive a thought.\" It will be found sometimes that it is easier for the preclear to think a thought for another uni-verse than for himself to think a thought. Let us take for example a preclear who is entirely interiorized into the universe of his mother. It would, therefore, evidently be much easier for him to have his mother think a thought than for the preclear himself to think a thought. As a"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"REALITY LEVEL OF PRECLEAR 3 PAB 54 – 10.06.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 185 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES matter of fact it might be an enormous struggle, resulting in rebellion, for the preclear himself to think a thought, but it would be very easy for the preclear to have his mother think a thought. The way to go about this would be to take an E-Meter, or simply estimate, by finding out who the preclear most resembles, the probable universe into which the preclear is interior-ized. Having established this (and you would only do this if the preclear were rebellious about thinking a thought himself) you would then have this likely universe think a thought, with the auditing command (having established that he is interiorized into his mother's or his father's universe): \"Have your mother (father) think a thought.\" This would then be carried out until the preclear was absolutely sure that he was making his mother or his father think a thought. This would betoken an initial division of the universe. Slicing up universes with communication processes is a very easy thing to do. All one has to do is use the process: \"What could you say to your father?\" and have the preclear say it, and get an Okay from his father. And when this was flat, \"What could your father say to you?\", and when the preclear has vocalized this, the auditor would say, \"Now give your father an 'Okay' to this.\" However, this workable process which splits universes (in old-time parlance \"valences\") is yet much too high for a preclear who is very low on reality, and would take a very long time to do. It would be a process into which you would eventually move the preclear who had been thinking a thought for his mother, but remember that think-ing a thought for his mother would be only a start into communication processing, and would be an elementary process, run until the preclear is entirely certain that he is thinking a thought that his mother would think or that he can make his mother think a thought – the latter being the most desirable condition. You should be aware of the fact that you are processing thinkingness. You are not processing spaces, you are not processing masses at this day and state of development of Dianetics and Scientology. You are processing thinkingness. A man is as well as he thinks. The more masses and spaces, phrases and engrams you process, the less you are validating the fact that you are actually processing a thinkingness: a thinkingness that we call a thetan. To process this directly is, of course, the most indicated process there could be, and sure enough, we are producing good results with it. But the remarkable thing about the process is that it works on people who heretofore have had very, very poor reality. Now there is a process which is a little bit lower than this \"Think a thought\" process, and this is the process of finding something real in the room. Recently I have had some very excellent results with \"Find something in this room that is comfortably real.\" This is a variation on the initial auditing command as given in the early SOPs. It is apparently better. A preclear who is not-ising everything in sight will find things real, he says, but actually he is not comfortable about it, and if you ask him to find something that is comfortably real, it may take him a long time to discover anything that he would tolerate to continue existence, and once you have begun this process of toleration you would be able to do a great deal for his case. \"Find something comfortably real\" is not necessarily a low-toned process. It will work in varying degrees on anyone. It is not recommended for any particular case level. If a pre-clear utterly bogs on \"Think a thought\" (which isn't likely), then you should have him \"Find something in this room that is comfortably real to you.\""},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"REALITY LEVEL OF PRECLEAR 4 PAB 54 – 10.06.55 ARC SW & GRADE 0 186 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES I am reminded of an auditor recently processing a very bad arthritic, who processed him as an exteriorized case for some little time without any apparent gain in the case before it occurred to this auditor that something must be wrong. Actually, a great amount of time was invested. The auditor asked Nibs, my boy who was then instructing the ACC course in the United States, and who is at this writing in England, teaching the BScn course there, what could possibly be wrong with this hung-fire preclear. Nibs looked him over and discovered that the auditor had never yet gotten the preclear into any kind of a situation which was even vaguely real to the preclear. The auditor in one chair and the preclear in the other chair was not a real situation to this preclear, and yet the auditor was running him as an exteriorized case. Of course he was exteriorized, but with such a low level of reality that very little benefit of course was resulting from the processing. Processing is as beneficial as it is real and factual to the preclear, and if you cannot raise the preclear's reality level by the use of Affinity and Communication, then you are let-ting the whole triangle hang fire. This triangle of ARC may have suddenly gotten very impor-tant on the C corner, but it is still foremost in the tool-kit of the auditor. Now you will want to know why you should use \"Think a thought\" when what is ob-viously wrong with the preclear you have in mind is a withered leg. Let me assure you that if you process directly this withered leg, you are processing something and somebody who probably has a very low level of reality. He wouldn't have a withered leg if he had a high level of reality. Where you have anybody who is neurologically, physically, or psychosomati-cally ill, unless it be from an acute infection or an accident, you have somebody who has been trying to not-is his body. When an individual is not-ising his body, making his legs wither, or his stomach get ulcers, or his head get migraine headaches, or his teeth fall out, you have somebody who is trying to not-is the environment. He is already going in the direction of suc-cumb. The one thing that would make him very happy would be the entire disappearance of the physical universe. Well, with modern processing you can make this happen, too, and maybe this is something you should have happen for him in order to demonstrate that it could happen. Of course, if you did this you would have to go through a modern BScn course at least, for this is a very tricky procedure. In view of the fact that unreality is the action of real-izing things are there and then saying they aren't there (not-ising them; see Creation of Hu-man Ability and the Axioms of Scientology) you are dealing with a protest against reality which results in unreality. A person will let things be as real as he is willing to let them exist. When an individual isn't willing to let a leg or a tree, or this universe exist, then things are not real to him. One of the best ways you could get him to raise his level of reality would be to give him some reality on thinkingness. It isn't actingness, it isn't getting tired, it isn't being unable to work, it isn't the second dynamic that impedes your preclear – it is his thinkingness. All you have to do is to get him to change his mind. If you could get anyone to change his mind enough he could then command anything that was bothering him. But a preclear who is not-ising things is trying to use force and pressure of one kind or another against physical objects and spaces in order to push them out of existence. This will never win, let me assure you. Energy will never destroy energy, I don't care how many atomic bombs the peanut whistly brigade builds, they will never destroy any space or energy with them.

He no longer conceives that thought can generate or handle or give existence or life to space and energy. Now you take this to heart, and take a good, hard look at some of these preclears you have been processing on very fancy and frilly processes, and you take a think back over all of these preclears who, after you processed them, didn't think anything had happened. When the preclear didn't think anything had happened, nothing happened. What was in error? You were processing him above his level of reality. If you could get him to think a thought and know he thought it, and receive a thought and know he had received it, even though he put it there to receive it, which is what he does, you would then be directly addressing the very thing that is doing unreality and reality. An individual who has a compulsive outflow is simply unwilling to receive a thought. An individual who is silent simply can't think of anything. Thus, if an individual had control of his thoughts he would have control of the universe. We can prove this now in a process. And don't think you are going to finish this process, either side of it, in a half-hour or forty-five minutes. Some of these glib preclears you process will \"fall in\" on this process and begin to comm-lag an hour or two after you start processing them on it. The main errors which have been made with this process so far have been failing to run it long enough to have the preclear really know and really understand that he, himself, has thought the thought and that he, himself, has received the thought, or is willing to receive the thought. \"Find the reality level of the preclear\" is one of those bywords that you can't use too often or look at enough."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" ARC SW & GRADE 0 189 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 0-IV EXPANDED GRADE PROCESSES – QUADS PART B GRADE 0 PROCESSES based on BTB 15 Nov 76 II Revised 22 Mar 2008 according to Qual Board Recommendation Bulletin of same date.

Simply start with the first actions and work through the drills applying them unbullbaited and bullbaited, until you are thoroughly familiar with each separate auditing action and can apply it flawlessly, even with distractions. If a student has trouble on a drill, cut back the gradient. On a bullbaited drill this could mean returning the student to the drill on a doll or even to TR 0-4. Important: Also check that the student himself has no misunderstood words on the bul-letin or drill, as this will cause him to alter-is and have difficulty. Get him word cleared. Note: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in the place of the process key words, for bullbaited drills only.

Purpose: To train the student to be able to co-ordinate and apply the commands and proce-dures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session and thereby become flawless in applying it. Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms as needed. In the chair opposite the Auditor is the coach (bullbaiter), as PC. Training Stress: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the \"PC\" coach bullbaits the student Auditor using \"fruit\" answers during the session in an attempt to throw the student off session. On any lists the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses \"fruit\" answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student Auditor reads off the list items (ex. L3RD) he squeezes the cans for reads. When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should throw in various signs of pc out of sessionness. (Per HCOB on Good Indicators and BTB on Bad Indicators. The student Auditor must: 1. Obnose the out of sessionness. 2. Align this to the process and to his level of training."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"DRILLS FOR AUDITORS LEVEL 0 DRILLS 3 BTB 9.10.71 ARC SW & GRADE 0 201 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 3. Handle. The PC bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc. But he must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968, \"Coaching\", especially the second paragraph, \"Coach with reality\". Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student Auditor to carry it out and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation. Stress is on training the student Auditor to have his TRs 0-4 in on the bullbaiter. The coach (bullbaiter) does the \"Start\", flunking or \"That's it\". flunks are given for any im-proper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin. Each drill is to be done thoroughly building up the speed of Auditor commands and actions. (\"It's the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains in a ses-sion,\" LRH) The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0-4, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion. These are the drills that train the student Auditor to handle all the elements in a session, so be exact and be real.

This applies to machines, habits, twitches, etc. There is a gradient scale of exteriorization which could be described as follows: first, the thetan without contact With a universe then a thetan in full contact with a universe then a thetan in contact with part of a universe, who considers the remainder of the universe barred to him then a thetan in a universe without any contact with any part of the universe then a thetan unknowingly in contact with a large part of a universe. The first condition would be a true Static, the last condition is called colloquially in Scientology, 'buttered all over the uni-verse. As it is with a universe such as the physical universe, so it is with physical bodies. The thetan who has already gone through the cycle on the universe itself may be in contact with a physical body in the same order. At first he would be without association with a physical body then with occasional contact with bodies then with a fixed contact on one body, but ex-teriorized then interiorized into a body, but easy to exteriorize then in contact with and interi-orized into a body, but withdrawn from the various parts of the body and then obsessively 'buttered all through the body' then obsessively and unknowingly drawn down to some small portion of the body, and so forth. This is the gradient scale which includes inversion and then inversion of the inversion. The auditor will discover preclears are very variable in the matter of exteriorization. Some preclears, even when they have a dark field, exteriorize rather easily. Others, after a great deal of work, are still found to be difficult to exteriorize. The matter of exteriorization is the matter of which level of inversion the preclear is in. One of the more difficult levels to work is so inverted that he thinks that a thetan is running him. In other words, here is a thetan functioning in a body and actually running it through various covert communication lines, who yet believes he is a body to such an extent that he considers him-self, or any life around him to be some other being. When discussing the matter of a thetan, this preclear is likely to tell the auditor, 'I'm over there'. This is about the only signal the audi-tor gets from such a case which tells him that the preclear is being a body, and considers that he is being run by another thetan. Very often an auditor will 'exteriorize' such a person, he thinks, only to have the preclear say, 'I'm over there'. A thetan who knows he is a thetan is always 'here' and never 'there'. The diagnostic manifestation, however, which the auditor first encounters in any case where he is having difficulty with exteriorization is contained in Beingness. Those on lower levels of inversion are having a great deal of difficulty being anything. Such people are below the level of being a body, therefore it would be far up- scale for this person to be able to be a body with certainty. A person who cannot exteriorize easily must be brought up to the level where he can be a body before he can then be exteriorized from the body. In other words, an auditor exteriorizing anyone has to follow such a scale as Beingness Processing."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"R2- 31: BEINGNESS PROCESSING 2 COHA ARC SW & GRADE 0 216 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Oddly enough, Beingness Processing is an excellent exteriorization tool, and I say 'Oddly enough' because, in one sense, Beingness Processing is an Alter- is- ness process. When a case is extremely inverted it is necessary to get the case up to a level where it can identify itself with something. Beingness is essentially an identification of self with an object. The commands used in Beingness Processing should begin with the environment and the vicinity of the preclear. One has the preclear look around the auditing room and select an object, let us say a chair. The auditor does this by saying 'Look around the room and discover some object which you don't mind being present'. Remember always, that when an auditor asks a question, that question has to be answered by the preclear. It is the auditor's bad luck if he asks a question which introduces an enormously long communication lag in the preclear. The preclear must still answer the question. At this question, then, 'Discover something you don't mind being present', it is necessary that the preclear actually locate something, even if a dust mote. The auditor then asks the preclear to 'Locate something else you don't mind being present'. And when all communication lag is gone from this level of process, the auditor then picks out an object which the preclear was comfortable about and says: 'Now see this (chair) here', 'All right, what else wouldn't you mind this (chair) being? ' And then, as the preclear answers this, and using this same object, the auditor continues to ask the same question until all communication lag is gone from the question: 'What else wouldn't you mind this (chair) being?' The auditor then selects other objects in the area and uses the same question on them: 'What wouldn't you mind this (couch) being? ', 'What else wouldn't you mind this (couch) being? ' When the preclear is perfectly willing to have anything in the room be a large number of things, including the walls, the ceiling, and the floor the auditor asks: 'Now what wouldn't you mind your body being? ' And whatever the preclear answers, 'And now what else would-n't you mind your body being? ' Finally, when the preclear is able to do all the foregoing in Beingness Processing, the auditor commands him: 'Now let's find something you wouldn't mind being', and, as this is the question for which the auditor has been working, he uses this question for a very long period of time, asking over and over, 'What else wouldn't you mind being?' It will be discovered in working Beingness Processing that the entire mechanism of winning Valences occurs. Here, for instance, is a thetan who is caught in a theta trap. After a while he will consider that the trap itself is surviving, which is to say that the motions of the trap have themselves set the thetan into motion so that he now thinks of himself totally as a trap. (This is how anybody gets to be anything – by getting set into motion by the vibrations in his vicinity.) At first the thetan is willing to be the trap, but after a while, if asked to be the trap and then asked to be the thetan (and this is not a process), the most terrible apathy will be found to intervene between the two steps. The thetan, while fairly comfortable being the trap, on be-ginning to recover some of his own identity, will be found to be at a point on the tone scale so low as to contain an unbearable and agonizing apathy. Beingness Processing recovers the various valences which the thetan is trying to avoid.

If this is the case, then we would also discover that the one person in this world our preclear does not want to be is her mother. In other words, by being unable to be her mother, she is also unable to be all those things which her mother could do or be. In other words, the matter of valences is also a matter of packages of abilities, and where an individual is unable to be something which has certain definite abilities, he also cannot achieve those abilities, and this, in itself, is the heart of disability. In running Beingness Processing it will be discovered that the imagination of the pre-clear revives to a marked extent.

No. 56 PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR'S BULLETIN From L. RON HUBBARD Via Hubbard Communications Office 163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11 _____________________________________________________________________ 8 July 1955 AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION PROCESSING Let me give you a small review on communication. Axiom 51 says that MEST cannot change MEST, and we find that postulates and live communication do change MEST. MEST cannot change MEST, therefore a pair of forceps cannot basically change a tooth condition. This is sweeping and I want you to realize how sweeping it actually is. A medical doctor would not be able to alter completely a broken leg. You may say, \"That's silly, of course he could. He could come in and snap the bone back into place and the fellow would feel a lot better.\" No, I'm sorry, a medical doctor cannot over a period of time change a broken leg. Do you know what will happen? Let's look at it from the standpoint of life, now, and we find out that the individual got attention for his broken leg, didn't he? It will emerge as rheumatism some day. In the next life it will emerge as two broken legs! We're going to get a repetition of this because as soon as you attempt to change MEST with MEST in one fashion or another you are going to get persistence, and that is all. Persistence of what? In view of the fact that all conditions are postulated conditions, and that the considera-tion behind them that they are bad or good is simply again a consideration, if we say persist it doesn't mean that it is either bad or good, it simply means that condition. What condition is it? The condition we are trying to change. And whenever we try to change MEST with MEST we get a persistence of that condition. It will crop up one way or another, and you will see this time after time. Dealing as we are in a very high echelon of live communication, when we try to alter a condition with MEST we get this persistence. Restimulation is the condition persisting in the auditor, as an auditor who goes around altering energy masses gets restimulated. The auditor comes along and says, \"Now all I have to do is change this energy mass one way or the other,\" and he may succeed in doing so as far as he can see for the moment. So he goes off restimulated. That is the condition persisting. It's going to persist, one way or the other. The only motto back of MEST is \"Persist.\" But we have this licked. Hence Axiom 51. Postulates and live communication actually can bring about a permanent change and can actually stop a persistence."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION 2 PAB 56 – 8.07.55 PROCESSING ARC SW & GRADE 0 220 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Now, this process, \"What wouldn't you mind ____ communicating with?\" \"What wouldn't mind you communicating with?\" is actually not a low echelon process. A low-echelon preclear, one with no mock-ups and very little reality, one who is not well off, will not be touched by this process. He cannot assimilate the process. Why? Because, to run this process, you have to have the cooperation of the preclear's ability to as-is. You have to have the ability of the preclear to have a cognition and the ability of the preclear to as-is a piece of energy, that is, to make a perfect duplicate of it. Where, then, does that leave this process to be totally functional? It leaves it upstairs, because when you run it downstairs, the individual begins to \"chew energy.\" Just \"chewing the energy around\" doesn't make it persist, but, with all this chewing, he isn't as-ising any-thing. All he is doing is moving mass \"A\" to position \"B.\" Anybody who is doing this gets no cognition out of it at all. He is waiting for that piece of energy to tell him something, and this tells you a great deal about the preclear who couldn't run an engram. He was waiting for the MEST to say something. The preclear who could run engrams could still play a game well enough to make the MEST say over and over again what the MEST had imprinted on it. That is exactly why an engram could run and why we had success in running engrams, and when an engram disap-peared that is exactly what happened. It was up there all right, it was up there in lights, but it wasn't saying anything. It was a bunch of sound waves imprinted on a bunch of molecules of one kind or another, and the preclear had to sort of pretend it was saying these things over and over. In other words, he made it talk. Now today an individual gets an engram in front of his face and you just tell him to make it talk. Make it say, if you please, exactly what is in the engram, or make it say anything – it doesn't matter which. As we look over this running of an engram, let us say that we are getting an individual to run birth. What we are doing is to get an energy mass called birth to articulate to an indi-vidual, and it would run very handsomely indeed if we had the preclear saying Okay. This is actually a terrifically effective way to run an engram. If we wanted to start today running en-grams, we could, full out, and achieve tremendously superior successes because we could certainly run any kind of an engram in the bank. We could dream it up, and the preclear could dream it up, could do anything he wanted to, just to make these energy masses talk. Of course very strange phenomena happen on an occluded case when you have him dream up the fact that he has the concept of an engram in front of him. You just look at him and you say, \"Now let's make believe that you have birth in restimulation in front of you.\" (This would be a roughie, and a weird way to go about it.) \"And now let's pick up the engram at the point where the doctor is saying, 'If you will just take this pint of strychnine, mamma, the child will be born much earlier.' \" You have him to make this concept say this, and have him say Okay to that. The strange part of it is that you don't have to pay any attention to whether birth shows up or not. I counted the number of births on an individual one time and it was several thou-sand, believe me, and they all go back to Fac Ones and things like that. So we just have him get the idea that he has birth in front of him and have it articulate. Quite often this totally oc-"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION 3 PAB 56 – 8.07.55 PROCESSING ARC SW & GRADE 0 221 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES cluded case will have a complete birth show up and begin to run off. But, he was totally oc-cluded, wasn't he? He couldn't run an engram. We could just buckle right down at that point and actually run that engram with Okays from the preclear, just as it showed up, or we could go on running a synthetic engram. In ei-ther case facsimiles would go out of restimulation in the individual. As long as we have communication those energy masses will disintegrate and you will stop the persistence of the condition. So let's look at the optimum way that I know of at this moment – the best way I know of – to separate universes, on which I have had considerable success and to date have had no failures as long as the preclear could at least articulate anything. As long as you can make him do anything at all you can make him do this. You have seen the process already. \"Give me some things you could say to your mother.\" If you wanted to make this very perfect, if he is unable to play a game you don't have to (very often the preclear is unable to play a game), you would say, \"Now get the idea mamma is out there saying Okay to all of this.\" \"Now give me something else you could say to your mother.\" Then you say, \"Get the idea mamma is out there and have her say 'Okay.' \" \"Now give me some things that mamma could say to you.\" Now you will get a positive blow-apart in a fairly rapid order of the interiorization of the universe. We know very well that people interiorize into a body, into other bodies, into MEST objects, into planets. So, if you were to run this one all the way backward you would take somebody who is obviously seen to be interiorized into earth, and what would you have him do? You would say, \"All right now, give me something earth could say to you.\" If he is really interiorized into earth he'll think up something. Then you have him say Okay. The next thing you know he will get the ball of earth 'way out there somewhere. Maybe it's the first picture he has ever had! You will say, \"That's fine. Now give me some more things that earth could say to you.\" \"Now give me some things you could say to earth,\" and very ordinarily he will come right on up the tone scale. You will never see such perfect behavior of a tone scale as when you use a MEST object. Then we would pick out (if we really were bent on exteriorizing Mr. Doakes and Mr. Doakes was interiorized into the interiorizations) another universe when we knew that we had the first one blown, and we would know that because his physiological condition would very definitely alter. We would go on to the next likely universe. We find this fellow who has been a linotype operator for eight thousand seven hun-dred and sixty-two months, or something of the sort. We don't have to be specific. We pick a linotype machine, and we say if he got into earth he certainly got there via some sort of appa-ratus he was controlling, so we say, \"All right, what could a linotype machine say to you?\" He would think it over for a moment. A very literal-minded fellow would probably say, \"It could say 'clank.' \" \"Okay, have it say clank.\" \"You know, I don't get any sonic on this,\" he'd say. (I've had this happen.)"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION 4 PAB 56 – 8.07.55 PROCESSING ARC SW & GRADE 0 222 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES \"Well, just get the idea of its saying clank.\" \"Well, it's going clank, all right.\" (\"Oh no you don't,\" says the auditor, aside and to himself.) \"Have it say clank.\" \"Have it say clank? A linotype machine can't... well, I guess it could. On thinking it over I guess a linotype machine could.... All right, I'll have it say clank.\" \"All right. Now have it say something else.\" He does, and we blow him out of the uni-verse of the linotype machine. Now let's pick the wife he hates worst, or something like that. What could she say? etc. Admittedly this is not a short process, but it keeps going faster and faster. Next we would pull him out of papa and mamma, and maybe grandma and grandpa, and so on. We are doing one of these schoolbook, by the table, separations. Then we say, \"Now give me something your body could say to you.\" \"My body say something to me?\" And away we would go, and we would blow him out of his head. It will work with almost that mechanical ease. The question is, how many hours of au-diting would it take to bring somebody who is totally interiorized into a planet out through these various stages and finally out of his head? As far as I'm concerned it is the minimum number of hours he could be audited for maximum result. We could do a tremendous number of things for him. We could do a momentary patch-up on a lot of things, we could do this and we could do that, but if we were going straight toward the goal of making this individual into the highest level of condition that we could make him into, we would follow a process just about like this. It would be slow, and it would be arduous, but we would get better, and better, and better. He would finally get to a point where he could feel these things blow off and blow out on him. I went so far one time as to try to exteriorize a fellow from his engram bank. I think I exteriorized a lot of thetans from that bank, but I never got the fellow out of it entirely be-cause I didn't have the time. His track finally stretched out in all directions and he could view it clearly, and then he was terribly interested and wanted to run and have to do with each in-dividual engram – and there were about seventy-six trillion years worth of them. Then there was the whole GE line. So I abandoned that attempt. He felt wonderful, though, and went around telling everybody he was cleared. Compared to his earlier state he sure was. He was cleared easily from eight or nine heavy engrams in about eight or nine hours' auditing. The articulation of the actual communication would be something you would do on an individual who is having the vaguest difficulty playing a game, who couldn't as-is birth at a glance. And this is the conclusion I have reached rather arduously over these past weeks on this. I give you data when I have it. Axiom 51 is right. It says you can't change MEST with MEST, but postulates and live communication can change it. But realization on the part of a preclear with no cognition is not possible. So if he can't realize, that means he can't as-is, so if he can't as-is, there he is. But I have seen preclears pass right on up the line from cognition zero to almost instantaneous cog-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION 5 PAB 56 – 8.07.55 PROCESSING ARC SW & GRADE 0 223 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES nition.

There is no restimu-lation involved.

First of these is confidence. The auditor, going over practised ground, feels more confident and, startled by some sudden action or new development, does not lose session control by seeming incapable to the pc. The preclear, accustomed to repetitive session pattern, feels a security when all his sessions are predictable as to pattern of address. And if he changes auditors he is still able to feel confident that he is getting real auditing. A second reason is duplication: Just as old repeater technique done by the auditor to the pc will run out a phrase or charged word, so do session patterns, well followed, tend to run out earlier sessions. Duplication does not make all things seem alike. Duplication of a session adds communication to the session and speeds up the willingness of the pc to communicate to the auditor. The basic freeing action of auditing depends upon the separation of thought from form, matter, energy, space and time and other life. We see in \"science\" as currently practised a nearly total identification by the \"scien-tist\" of mass with thought. \"Man from mud\" is a natural conclusion by anyone who has all his thought bound up in mass. The reason a clear's needle is so free (and you've seen, certainly, how an E-Meter nee-dle gets sticky, then freer and freer) is that his thought is separated from a matter, energy, space, time consequence. The \"deadin-'is-'ead\" case is totally associating all thought with mass. Thus he reads peculiarly on the meter. As he is audited he frees his thinkingness so that he can think without mass connotations. What auditing is doing is making the preclear think key thoughts until they can be thought without creating or disturbing matter, energy, space and time. As most pcs associate themselves with thought, only when they can think a thought without ploughing anew into mass can they exteriorize. Difficult exteriorization or exterior-ization with bad consequences is all caused by a person's considerations of thought being mat-ter, self being matter, etc, etc. The basic overt act is making somebody else want mest. This recoils so that self wants mest. Thus we have the \"necessity for havingness\". Running havingness restores the pc at cause over matter, permits him to be separate from matter to some degree."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"STANDARDIZED SESSIONS 2 HCOB 17.03.60 ARC SW & GRADE 0 226 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Thinking, then, is separated from mest by repetitive thinking on the exact points that pin a particular person to mest. If a person is aberrated, say, on the subject of women, the shortest cut to de-aberration (barring havingness difficulties – see below) would be the repeated command \"Think of a woman.\" At last he would no longer have pictures or masses just because he thought that thought and you would then find he could think about women as opposed to reacting about women. This naturally leads to an obvious basic process, \"Think about matter\" \"Think about energy\" \"Think about space\" \"Think about time\" \"Think about a thetan.\" In theory each one could be run flat in turn and then all run again. In actual practice this is pretty steep for most cases and would not be real to many. A more complex approach containing more significance is more real to the pc. The pc's mind is trapped into forms of mest and life, rather than merely mest and life. Thus, what falls on the E-Meter needle shows what form of mest and life his attention is fixed upon. Havingness is a complicated subject when viewed in a pc's mind. Familiarity, which is to say, predictability, is strongly connected with his ability to have or own. When he receives shocks or surprises, his ability to predict is invalidated and he can't have. The reason a thetan \"dies\" is his loss of the familiar by the introduction of the unpre-dictable. Rapidity of change of state, unpredicted, would be a definition of surprise, also of death and forgetfulness. The more change he is subjected to, that he did not predict, the less he can have. Thus when he is given a \"rough session\", the pc's havingness goes down. Not predict-ing the shifts and changes of the auditor, the pc ceases to be able to have the session or its appurtenances – the auditor, the room, etc. The smoother the auditing the better the pc's hav-ingness stays up. The model session is designed to avoid unpredictable changes. Thus it is designed to retain havingness by retaining pattern, which is to say, retaining predictability by l;he pc. Auditing, done smoothly, duplicatively session by session as to session pattern, runs itself out, even if the pc has a constantly changing bank. A pc began to use pictures when he changed lives and sometimes, therefore, language, but only after he had already adopted language for thought. So an ultimate step in processing could concern itself with separating the pc from the significance of words. Some such process as \"Think of a word,\" followed by \"Think of a meaning,\" would in theory, if it could be run (but has not been tested and would violate havingness), discharge the pc of his dependence on language for thought and would find him less fixated on having pictures (which of course bridge the language barrier). Appearing in a form composed of matter, running on energy, existing in space and keeping pace with others in time is a favour pcs do one another (or an overt act depending on how cynical you may feel when you consider it)."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"STANDARDIZED SESSIONS 3 HCOB 17.03.60 ARC SW & GRADE 0 227 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The games condition of havingness is have for self, can't have for others. Appearing in a form violates this games condition. Also, giving another words violates it. Thus actors and writers tend to go downhill by violating their own games condition if they are in one. A games condition evolves from separateness. Running some form of separateness can then re-sult in exteriorization not from willingness to lose the mass of the body but by curing the games condition. Separateness is of course handled on lower cases by running out obsessive connectedness. But separateness itself can be run. Any auditing is a solution: Solutions are ordinarily an alter-is of problems. Thus get-ting people to confront problems or even solutions can resolve not only case but auditing where auditing itself has now and then, in absence of smooth analysis and session handling, become a problem to the preclear. A fine process for this is \"Tell me a problem that auditing would be a solution to,\" and for that matter, this also applies to any psychosomatic illness. A person with a bad leg would experience relief if audited on \"Tell me a problem a bad leg would be a solution to,\" as a re-petitive process. Similarly, it might work if one asked \"Tell me a solution to a bad leg you could confront,\" or \"What problem about a leg could you confront?\" which last is very good as a process. The separation of thinkingness from a problem, from particular forms, and from Life and Mest are the primary targets of auditing. And just as the repetitive auditing command runs out not only the connection with a mass but itself, so does a repetitive session design eventually free the pc from not only his aberrations but auditing itself. A person gets as able as he regains confidence – and he gets as free as his auditing is a constant not itself a wild variable. L.

In 'Scientology 8- 80' and 'Scientology 8- 8008' you will find a scale which begins at its lowest rung with 'hidden'. Above that is 'protection'. Above that is 'ownership'. I have re-cently discovered that the DEI cycle and the above low scale join to make the scale read: Curiosity Desire Enforcement Inhibition Ownership Protection Hidden and I have discovered that the road upward through this scale is communication. Knowingness condenses. Trying to know becomes the first level of communication. This 'looking to know' condenses into 'emoting to know', which condenses into 'effort to know', which in turn becomes 'thinking to know', which then condenses into 'symbols to know' which, and this is the astonishing thing, becomes 'eating to know', which becomes 'sex-ual activity to know', which then turns into oblivion of knowing or 'mystery'. An energy particle is a condensed knowingness. Trying to discover or move one is an action with the goal of knowingness. Gravity, grim thought, becomes in the mind, and is, the effort to know, to pull in knowingness. Other- determinism is only other knowingness. The aspects of know are the common denominators of any scale in Scientology. When knowingness is done by communication, we get emotion and effort particles changing position. This struggle to know is not just me and thee working on Scientology and gone mad in the process, it is life and all its manifestations including space, energy, matter and time. Each is only a barrier to knowingness. A barrier is a barrier only in that it impedes knowing-ness. Barriers do not exist for complete knowingness. And what is there to know? Only that knowingness can vary. One has to invent things to know for there is only knowingness, and knowingness has no data since a datum is an in-vented, not a true, knowingness. The motto of any particle below knowingness is 'Only en-ergy can tell you'. We handle R2- 60 HIDDEN KNOWINGNESS in this wise: 'Spot some hidden communi-cations', 'And now spot some more hidden communications', and so forth. We may have to direct the preclear closely with, 'Point to the spot', 'How far away does it seem? ', 'Are you spotting a hidden communication there?

It is curious that the above 'Spot some hidden communications' does not seem to re-quire a remedy of havingness. But it will turn on many heavy ridges and somatics. Having thoroughly worked 'hidden communications' you can now use this command: 'Spot some pro-tected communications', and when that is null, 'Spot some owned communications', and after that has no communication lag, 'Spot some inhibited (stopped) communications'. Then: 'Spot some enforced communications', and then, 'Spot some desired communications'. Now when all that is done, proceed as follows: 'Spot some hidden knowingness', 'Are you spotting it in the physical universe? If so all right, point to it', 'How far away does it seem? ', 'Spot some more hidden knowingness', and so on until after an hour or two (or six) this command is comm- lag- flat.

Then: 'Spot some en-forced knowingness'. Then: 'Spot some desired knowingness'. Then: 'Spot some knowingness that people could be curious about'.

By the way, don't take my remarks on salesmen as being \"all for the best\". The basic overt act is making people want useless objects and spaces, and unfortunately for him that's often part of the business of the salesman. He, unlike us, sometimes isn't fishing people out of the mud. He's often more likely pushing them in. Therefore he needs our help to get square with the world. As his income depends on making people want things and buy things (even though sometimes they need them), we haven't much choice but to show him the mechanics of selling, to the end of getting him to help pull others out of the mud. Making somebody want something they really need is no crime, but the salesman is on very shaky ground. What do people really need? We had best not try to get involved in the ethics of all this, or to per-suade them to sell only needed items. The whole economic structure needs the salesman; he is the key of the whole struc-ture.

Possessing now tremendous processes at lowest levels, we need a new understanding of processing and assessment. The broad tone scale is divided into three general parts. Highest is Pan Determinism. Mid-range is Self-Determinism. Low range is Other-Determinism. The fundamental difficulty is that something has so thoroughly overwhelmed the pc that he is it. This is Other-Determinism become the person. Mild locks use this route to fur-ther overwhelm him. A person doesn't really find anything in this lifetime that would have overwhelmed him enough to aberrate him. It took great doing. Things like prenatals and op-erations and shocks just use the existing overwhelm channel. The picture of aberration is this. The person causes an effect, time and time again. Usually this is not aberrative. But one day he causes an unintended effect. He didn't mean to. It was wrong. This is the true overt act – an unintended bad effect. It is not deserved by the recipient. It is a wrong, unintended, undeserved effect. The person now tends to limit his ef-fects or withhold his effects. Having been wrong once, he now becomes cautious. Next thing he knows he has assisted himself to be overwhelmed. He now has an inflow channel over which other things, all locks, can now overwhelm him. Eventually he becomes an \"other-determinism\". This, of course, can get nothing done, doesn't outflow, etc., etc., which adds up to all the faults we find in an aberrated person. For example, if the pc has been overwhelmed by money, he, in money matters, is now money. If you took some money and threw it on the bed it wouldn't do a thing. It wouldn't stack itself up or add up accounts. Money doesn't do anything. Therefore, the pc, as an other-determinism, does nothing really about money – and this we find annoying in him. It is his aberration. Clearly all one need do as an auditor is to reverse this flow and put the pc at cause over the button, money, to have the other-determinism (and the overwhelmingness) fade away. Using Problems of Comparable Magnitude or Overt-Withhold Straight Wire or simple reaching, the effect is turned to cause and the pc comes out of it. Assessment is only discovering what has overwhelmed the pc. Auditing is the reversing of other-determined flows by gradient scales, putting the pc at cause again."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"NEW PROCESS 2 HCOB 7.05.59 ARC SW & GRADE 0 246 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES THE BASIC ERROR The question was asked me, and a fine question it was, \"Why does a thetan make his postulate fail to stick in the first place? Why would he say, 'I can get my postulates all messed up and so cause an overt act'?\" Obviously all aberration is third dynamic. The entrance into self-determinism requires that a thetan conceive the idea of other beings. Also he must then conceive that there are zones of privacy from which he must not communicate. This error leads to obsessive or fixed channels on which one can be overwhelmed, since he \"may not\" take the position of cause on this channel. Avoidance of the places he must not communicate from leads into all manner of diffi-culties, since this is inhibited communication. A person, therefore, becomes as aberrated as he cannot communicate, as aberrated as he is overwhelmed by Other-Determinisms, as aberrated as he himself dare not assume cause points. A NEW PROCESS This leads to a new process, for use \"in individual sessions\". The final phrasing is not established at this time. \"From where could you communicate?\" or \"Find a place from which you could communicate,\" or \"Recall a place from which you have communicated.\" My first tests show this to be very strong but workable. I have not established the depth this reaches nor the complete effectiveness up scale. But it does reverse Other-Determinism heavily. (This, of course, does not supplant Selected Person Overt-Withhold Straight Wire as fundamental and is not for use in HAS Co-auditing, where Selected Persons Overt-Withhold Straight Wire is the tested allowed process.) This new process may open a faster route to theta clear, even though that route is al-ready very fast. Note: Apparently this process, Locational Communication, relieves the face pres-sures and terror stomachs (after turning them on) which have proved reluctant. Terror stom-achs we have a specific for.

At Level 0 we do not expect or lead people to expect any sudden miracle of physical or mental recovery. Rather, we emphasize that we are getting their feet on the ladder and as they progress up through levels they will achieve all they ever hoped for and more. Jumping to higher levels leaves the lower level disabilities untouched and while trying to audit somebody at, say, Level III, we will find ourselves struggling with things that should have been handled at Level 0. Further, this target is the one that beginning pcs make the most gains on in my experi-ence. I recall one near miracle on a girl who couldn't bring herself to talk to her parents and all I did was get her to tell me what she'd say to them if she could talk to them. Recalling is too steep for a starting pc. They can't recall well really until about Level IV when they can be cleaned up on their ARC Breaks with Life. Here we have the whole design of Level 0: \"Recover the pc's ability to talk to others freely.\" If you realize that a pc can't be in session unless he is willing to talk to his auditor, you will also realize that he can't be in life until he is able to communicate freely with others. Thus any process that does not forward this end is not for Level 0, no matter how fran-tic the case may be to become clear yesterday. The more hysterical a pc is about getting advanced processes or a case gain, the less strenuous the process administered must be. The psychiatrist erred on this one point and it wiped him out as a social benefactor. The more desperate the case, the more desperate were his measures. He was just echoing his patients. It is very important for an auditor to realize this one datum for it is the second guiding rule of Level 0. It is a very senior datum. One must not become desperate and use desperate measures just because the pc is desperate or the fam-ily or society is desperate about the pc. The worse off the pc, the lighter the approach to that pc must be."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   2   HCOB   11.12.64   ARC SW & GRADE 0 250 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Psychotics (real, gibbering ones) are below auditing treatment in sessions. The meas-ure used for them should be just rest and isolation from their former environments. And the first process used should be just getting the person to realize you are safe and safe to talk to. So, although a few cases are psychotic, this still holds good. The auditor must get the pc to realize he is safe – won't punish, scold, reprimand or betray confidences – and that the auditor will listen. It doesn't give the auditor a withhold to not speak of another's withholds. One can only withhold what one oneself has done. What the pc did or said isn't even subject for a session on the auditor for withholding it had no aberrative value. Even when we're Class IV, we still start all our pcs at the pc's level, which is, for a be-ginning pc, Level 0. So what we are trying to do with our pcs at Level 0 is the following: 1. Recover the pc's ability to talk to others freely; 2. Teach the pc by example the auditor is safe to talk to and won't scold, reprimand, pun-ish or betray, and 3. Refuse to engage in desperate measures just because the pc is desperate; and therefore get a real, lasting gain for the pc. ROUTINES A routine is a standard process, designed for the best steady gain of the pc at that level. The remedy is different. It is an auditing process which is designed to handle a non-routine situation. The only real remedy at Level 0 is patching up having failed to hear or understand the pc. The rest is all done by routine. The Case Remedies are at Level II and while we all realize that every Level 0 case needs a lot of Level II remedies, we also know that no remedy will work well until the pc is able to talk to others. When you run into trouble at Level 0, there are only 3 reasons possible: 1. The pc was not run in a direction or on a process to improve his or her ability to com-municate to others; 2. The auditor failed to understand the pc's statements, either words or meanings; or 3. The auditor engaged in desperate measures, changed processes, or scolded or did something to lower the pc's feeling of security in the session. That's all. As you go on up through the levels, you will find many other ways a pc can get upset. But at Level 0, the pc is not close enough to reality on his own case to even be touched by these at first. The pc is a long way off when he first starts getting audited. He can only approach his own case by degrees. So a pc, no matter how wildly he or she dramatizes at Level 0, is really only capable of a reality of the smallest kind about self. And such a pc must be able to talk before anything else can happen. Pcs can be ruined by someone who doesn't"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   3   HCOB   11.12.64   ARC SW & GRADE 0 251 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES grasp that simple fact. Psychiatrists, failing to grasp it, murdered several million people – so it's no light matter. It's an important one. A pc at Level 0 usually can't even conceive of an overt (a harmful act) done by him-self. When they can, they go religiously guilty and seek to atone or some such thing. Become a monk. Or commit suicide. The reason 331/3 percent of all psycho-analytic patients are said to have committed suicide in their first three months of treatment is not that they \"came too late\" but that a lot of wild data was thrown at them to get at their \"source of guilt\" and they went head on into the reactive bank, sought to demonstrate their \"guilt\" by making others guilty and killing them-selves. You don't want anything out of the pc but an increased ability to talk relaxedly to oth-ers without fear, embarrassment, suspicion or guilt. So all processes at Level 0 are arranged accordingly. WORDINGS To give all possible wordings of routines that will accomplish the above is completely beyond need. Once you have the idea of it straight, you can invent them by the dozens. One doesn't even have to think of a particular pc. All Level 0 processes are good only when they apply to all pcs. ROUTINE 0-0 (ZERO-ZERO) The starting routine is the most basic of all auditing routines. It is simply \"What are you willing to talk to me about?\" Pc answers. \"What would you like to tell me about that?\" At Level II, the first question alone becomes a remedy. Here the two questions make a routine – and a very effective one it is! ROUTINE 0-A This is how the auditor puts together Routine 0-A: 1. Make a list of people or things one can't generally talk to easily! That includes parents, policemen, govemments and God. But it's a far longer list. The auditor must do this. It must never be published as a \"canned\" list. 2. Using any one of the listed items: \"If you could talk to____(listed item) what would you say?\" All right, that's all there is to finding the commands for Routine 0-A."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   4   HCOB   11.12.64   ARC SW & GRADE 0 252 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES One doesn't get the pc to do the list. The list isn't done in session. The auditor does it himself on his own time. And each auditor must do his own list for his pcs and add to it from time to time as he thinks of new ones. The pc isn't necessarily given any choice of items. The auditor picks one he thinks may fit. That's easy to do after one session. The pc keeps complaining about parents. OK. Run 0-A on parents. And flatten it! By flatten is meant to use that one subject until the pc is darned sure he or she could now talk to the item chosen. If the pc still wants to abuse the item, it isn't flat. If the pc still wants to do something about the item, it is not flat. When the pc is cheerful about the item or no longer fascinated with it, it's flat. Remember, there's no need to find out what the pc can't talk to. In fact, most cases you're better off just to take an item of your own for 0-A and use it. May seem strange, but you'll have a smoother time of it with the pc. Further you'll not restimulate (churn up) the pc's bank so hard. ROUTINE 0-B The second routine consists of things to talk about. One puts the routine together this way: 1. The auditor makes a list (not from the pc but himself) of everything he can think of that is banned for any reason from conversation or is not generally considered accept-able for social communication. This includes non-social subjects like sexual experi-ences, W.C. details, embarrassing experiences, thefts one has done, etc. Things no-body would calmly discuss in mixed company. 2. An item from the list is included in the auditing command, \"What would you be will-ing to tell me about ?\" Add the item you choose. 3. When they have \"run down\" (as in clocks) ask them, \"Who else could you say those things to?\" 4. Rechoose a subject on the list. 5. Repeat 3. 6. Continue to repeat 4. and 5. Above all, don't be critical of the pc. And very calmly hear and seek to understand what the pc said. (You never, by the way, seek to find out why the pc reacted or responded in some way. A real blunder at Level 0 is \"Why did you feel that way?\" Or \"Why do you think you can't say that?\" You're not after the causes of things at Level 0. You will find out why at Level VI!) At Level 0, just keep them talking while you listen. And you use only the subject chosen to keep them talking."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   5   HCOB   11.12.64   ARC SW & GRADE 0 253 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES ROUTINE 0-C Routine 0-C is, of course, old R-1-C renamed.

In all the above routines it is vital not to alter the commands given above. ____________________ There are many more possible routines. But to be a Level Zero Routine it must have as its goal only freeing up the ability of the pc to talk freely to others. This is not a level to be regarded with a brush-off. It takes a lot of skill to restore a pc's ability to communicate freely. When an auditor has that skill he will succeed at all higher levels. When a pc has that skill regained, his world will look to him to be a far, far better place. So it is very important to get over this first hurdle. And very important not to dodge it and try to climb the hill anyway. It will become an awfully steep hill. L.

Scientology Instructors and Scientology Per-sonnel should not be listed on it as it leads to upset in sessions. STEP 1. The auditor chooses one of the subjects off the list and uses it in Steps 2 and 3 below until the pc is comfortable about it. Subjects from the list can be chosen in sequence or at random. A chosen subject is not left until the pc is comfortable about it. By this is meant, the pc would not feel disturbed talking to the subject chosen. The auditor does not ask the pc which subject or if it is all right to choose that subject as the pc at the moment of selection is not likely to feel comfortable about any of the listed subjects and so will just reject. No, the auditor just chooses one and starts on it. STEP 2. The auditor asks, \"If you could talk to______ (chosen subject), what would you talk about?\" Pc answers one or more things at greater or shorter length. STEP 3.

If the pc seems bright and cheerful, a new subject is chosen from the list for a working over with Steps 2 and 3. If the subject in 1 is retained, the auditor again does Steps 2 and 3 above over and over until the pc is cheerful. A subject chosen in 1 is not left until the pc really can respond cheerfully. When this is accomplished, a new subject is chosen as Step 1 and the process is continued with Steps 2 and 3 using the new subject. The whole of Routine 0-A is flat when the pc feels far more comfortable about talking to specific items and isn't shying off from items on the list. It is flat, therefore, when an ability is regained on specific items on the list and the list items aren't producing big new changes in the pc's communication ability. LISTEN STYLE CO-AUDIT It is expected that by the time an auditor is permitted to do the Zero Routines, Individ-ual Listen Style will have been entered upon. Until the class seems able to run individual sessions, old \"R-1-C\" can be used by the auditing supervisor on a group basis using Listen Style Co-audit until the group has the idea of sessions. Routines work best on Individual Listen Style. The pc is always wondering, in Listen Style Co-audit, if the auditing supervisor is listening to him personally. The auditor is not the receipt point of the pc's comm in many instances. Old R-1-C is the best training mechanism to get auditors to run sessions. In this proc-ess the auditing supervisor just chooses something for all the pcs to talk to the auditors about, like a dynamic or a common social problem. L. RON HUBBARD LRH:jw.rd"}]
