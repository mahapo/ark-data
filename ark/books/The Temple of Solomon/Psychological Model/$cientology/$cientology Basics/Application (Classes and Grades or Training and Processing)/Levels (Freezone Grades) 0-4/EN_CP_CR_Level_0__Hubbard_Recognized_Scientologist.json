COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 7 FEBRUARY 1965 Reissued 15 June 1970 Remimeo Sthil Students Assn/Org Sec Hat Case Sup Hat Ds of P Hat Ds of T Hat Staff Member Hat Franchise (issued May 1965) Note. Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. \"Quickie grades\" entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not \"entirely a tech matter\" as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can't get the technology applied then you can't deliver what's promised. It's as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what's promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 2 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 3 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 4 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 5 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 6 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 0 7 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don't muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs.

It was published in 1957. OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE Somewhere in your possession, in your desk, or tucked into a bookcase, are two large pieces of paper. They are covered closely with data invaluable to an Auditor. You have pored over them, and quoted from them many, many times. They are, of course, the Chart of Human Evaluation and the Chart of Attitudes. The data in them is a large part of an Auditor's stock in trade, and every Auditor in the world is, in some degree, familiar with them. But how about getting the data off the charts and applying it to life, to some real per-son? It's not hard to do casually, for some acute tone. \"Joe was on a 1.5 kick last night.\" Sure, he turned red as a beet, and threw a book at your head. Simple. Mary breaks into sobs, and grabs for the Kleenex. Couple of Auditors on the scene exchange looks, nod sagely. \"Hmm. Grief!\" But how about chronic tone, with that thin, shiny veneer of social tone slicked over it? How sharp and how certain are you about that? Now, take a pc that you are familiar with. What, exactly, is his chronic tone? If you don't know, you had better read on. If you do, read on, and learn more about it. The title of this article starts with an odd word: obnosis. It's been put together from the phrase, \"observing the obvious\". The art of observing the obvious is strenuously neglected in our society at this time. Pity. It's the only way you ever see anything; you observe the obvi-ous. You look at the isness of something, at what is actually there. Fortunately for us, the abil-ity to obnose is not in any sense \"inborn\" or mystical. But it is being taught that way by peo-ple outside of Scientology. How do you teach somebody to see what is there? Well, you put up something for him to look at, and have him tell you what he sees. That is what is done in an ACC class, the ear-lier in the course, the better. A student is asked to stand up in the front of the classroom and be looked at by the rest of the students. An instructor stands by, and keeps asking, \"What do you see?\" The first responses run about like this: \"Well, I can see he's had a lot of experi-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE 2 HCOB 26.10.70 LEVEL 0 20 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST ence.\" \"Oh, can you? Can you really see his experience? What do you see there?\" \"Well, I can tell from the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth that he's had lots of experience.\" \"All right, but what do you see?\" \"Oh, I get you. I see wrinkles around his eyes and mouth.\" \"Good!\" The instructor accepts nothing that isn't plainly visible. A student starts to catch on and says, \"Well, I can really see he's got ears.\" \"All right, but from where you're sitting can you see both ears right now as you're looking at him?\" \"Well, no.\" \"Okay. What do you see?\" \"I see he's got a left ear.\" \"Fine!\" No conjectures, no tacit assumptions will do. Nor are the students permitted to wander in the bank. For example, \"He's got good posture.\" \"Good posture by comparison with what?\" \"Well, he's standing straighter than most people I've seen.\" \"Are they here now?\" \"Well, no, but I've got pictures of them.\" \"Come on. Good posture in relation to what, that you can see right now.\" \"Well, he's standing straighter than you are. You're a little slouched.\" \"Right this minute?\" \"Yes.\" \"Very good.\" You see what the goal of this is? It is to get a student to the point where he can look at another person, or an object, and see exactly what is there. Not a deduction of what might be there from what he does see there. Not some-thing the bank says ought to go in company with what is there. Just what is there, visible and plain to the eye. It's so simple, it hurts. Along with this practice in observing the obvious about people, the students receive a lot of information about particular physical and verbal indications of tone level. Things very easy to see and hear, by looking at a person's body and listening to his words. \"Thetan-watching\" has no part in obnosis. Look at the terminal, the body, and listen to what's coming out of it. You don't want to get mystical about this, and start relying on \"intuition\". Just look at what's there. As examples: You can get a good tip on chronic tone from what a person does with his eyes. At apathy, he will give the appearance of looking fixedly, for minutes on end, at a par-ticular object. Only thing is, he doesn't see it. He isn't aware of the object at all. If you dropped a bag over his head, the focus of his eyes would probably remain the same. Moving up to grief, the person does look \"downcast\". A person in chronic grief tends to focus his eyes down in the direction of the floor a good bit. In the lower ranges of grief, his attention will be fairly fixed, as in apathy. As he starts moving up into the fear band, you get the focus shifting around, but still directed downward. At fear itself, the very obvious characteristic is that the person can't look at you. Terminals are too dangerous to look at. He's supposedly talking to you, but he's looking over in left field. Then he glances at your feet briefly, then over your head (you get the impression a plane's passing over), but now he's looking back over his shoulder. Flick, flick, flick. In short, he'll look anywhere but at you. Then, in the lower band of anger, he will look away from you, deliberately. You know, he looks away from you; it's an overt communication break. A little further up the line, and he'll look directly at you all right, but not very pleasantly. He wants to locate you – as a target. Then, at boredom, you get the eyes wandering around again, but not frantically as in fear. Also, he won't be avoiding looking at you. He'll include you among the things he looks at. Equipped with data of this sort, and having gained some proficiency in looking at the isness of people, the ACC students are sent out into the public to talk to strangers and to spot them on the tone scale. Usually, but only as a slight crutch in approaching people, they are given a series of questions to ask each person, and a clipboard for jotting down the answers,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE 3 HCOB 26.10.70 LEVEL 0 21 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST notes, etc. They are public-opinion poll-takers from the Hubbard Research Foundation. The real purpose of their talking to people at all is to spot them on the tone scale, chronic tone and social tone. They are given questions calculated to produce lags and break through social ma-chinery, so that the chronic tone juts out. Here are some sample questions, actually used: \"What's the most obvious thing about me?\" \"When was the last time you had your hair cut?\" \"Do you think people do as much work now as they did fifty years ago?\" At first, the students merely spot the tone of the person they are interviewing – and many and various are the ad-ventures they have while doing this! Later, as they gain some assurance about stopping strangers and plying them with questions, these instructions are added: \"Interview at least 15 people. With the first five, match their tone, as soon as you've spotted it. The next five, you drop below their chronic tone, and see what happens. For the last five, put on a higher tone than theirs.\" What does an ACC student gain from these exercises? A willingness to communicate with anyone, for one thing. To begin with, students are highly selective about the sort of peo-ple they stop. Only old ladies. No one who looks angry. Or only people who look clean. Fi-nally, they just stop the next person who comes along, even though he looks leprous and armed to the teeth. Confrontingness has come 'way up, and he's just somebody else to talk to. They become willing to pinpoint a person on the scale, without shilly-shallying. They say, \"He's a chronic 1.1. Social tone 3.5, but real phony.\" That's the way it is, and they can see it. They also become quite gifted and flexible at assuming tones at will, and putting them across convincingly. Very useful in many situations, and lots of fun to do. They grow adept at punching through a comm lag in an informal situation. At sorting out apparencies from reali-ties. The rise in certainty of communication, and in ease and relaxation of manner while han-dling people, in the students who have been run through this mill, is something which must be seen or experienced to be believed. The one most often repeated request in every ACC Unit is: \"Can't we please have some more obnosis this week? We haven't had enough of it yet.\" (This statement is very funny to the ACC instructors, because these same students said at the beginning, \"If you make me go out there, I'll walk out on the course.\") Obnosis is quite impor-tant, and should be learned as thoroughly as possible by all Scientologists.

This presented a mystery, as I have always been able to teach TRs effectively in about a week's time, give or take a few days. Once the student has his basics in it's done by simply getting the student to DO it, as TRs are not a \"think\" action nor a subjective action. They're practical drills on the comm cycle. There's nothing subjective about them. TRs are a doing-ness. But we suddenly had entire corps of student auditors unable to master these drills. What had happened to the teaching of TRs? A good many months were spent in isolating exactly what had gone wrong, and it has now all been boiled down to a very few factors: 1. Hard TRs had been dropped out. 2. Doing the communication formula in clay had been omitted. Those were the two major points of change and when these two were omitted, that was it. That was the end of anybody being able to do TRs. One can't master TRs without familiar-ity with the comm cycle. One can't master TRs with permissive, pat-a-cake drilling. TRs are gotten in by drilling them hard."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"TRS BASICS RESURRECTED 2 HCOB 24.12.79 LEVEL 0 26 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST It is one thing to try to teach Hard TRs to raw public and it is quite another to make an auditor. People studying to become auditors have to be made into auditors. It's all right to teach a mild TRs Course in Division 6 and one should, but when it comes to making auditors, there is no substitute for Hard TRs. Somewhere along the line doing the communication formula in clay as the beginning part of the TRs Course was dropped out. This left the student with no slightest concept of why he was doing TRs. The communication formula is a Scientology discovery and when you omit teaching it, the student suffers from out-basics. So the omission of doing the communi-cation formula in clay on a TRs Course was fatal. There were also three additional factors found to be further influencing the scene: 3. Student auditors had no real understanding of the ARC triangle. Thus, their Commu-nication was stuck because their Affinity and Reality and, therefore, their Understand-ing, were deficient. 4. The lack of a bona fide TRs checksheet had opened the way for all kinds of false data to be entered into the subject. 5. Ignorance of the end phenomena of a TRs Course or why they were doing TRs. The result of this past year's study and piloting and the isolation of these factors has now culminated in a full and final TRs Course which will be issued very soon in unalterable book form. Meantime, this bulletin is being issued as a holding action to make these errors and omissions in the teaching and drilling of TRs broadly known so that they can be remedied at once wherever auditor TRs are being taught. OMITTED CHECKSHEET AND FALSE DATA Since the cancellation of HCO PL 24 May 71 THE PROFESSIONAL TR COURSE, there has been no real TRs checksheet, complete with the basics of communication and the theory of communication which underlie the TRs. That was a huge out-basic right there. TRs as drills appeared on various checksheets, sometimes with several accompanying bulletins, but omitted was any thorough preliminary in-sequence study of the theory upon which the TRs are based. Here we had a course without a checksheet, which made it possible for false data to spring in from various quarters. And so it did. It wasn't that people were willfully entering false data into the subject. It was simply that there was no standard checksheet which took the student through the true data, and only the true data, on the simple basics (the ARC triangle and the communication formula) underlying the TRs and then the TRs drills themselves. With that situation you can get all kinds of false data coming into an area. And that is exactly what was found. Almost one for one the students coming onto the special piloted courses con-ducted this past year were ridden with false data, various types of \"think\" and figure-figure and alter-is of the tech of the TRs."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"TRS BASICS RESURRECTED 3 HCOB 24.12.79 LEVEL 0 27 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST A number of BTBs and BPLs on the subject contributed to this scene and actually per-petrated out-tech in the area, and these have now been canceled, by specific title, by HCOB 23 Sep 79, CANCELLATION OF DESTRUCTIVE BTBs AND BPLs ON TRs, which lists and corrects the outnesses these issues introduced. A further handling is to give the student the true data on communication and TRs, as covered in the chapters on ARC in Problems of Work and Fundamentals of Thought. the chapters on communication in Dianetics 55!, and HCOB 16 Aug 71R, TRs REMOD-ERNIZED. As he studies this, one then digs up and strips off the false data accumulated on the subject or drill, using HCO PL 7 Aug 79, FALSE DATA STRIPPING. Where false data on a subject exists it hits immediately and directly up against the true data, and until this conflict is blown by False Data Stripping the person can be untrainable on the subject. Thus this brand new tech tool, False Data Stripping, is and has been tremendously use-ful in correcting TR outnesses and ensuring correct training on the TRs. It might be noted in passing that the most false subject on the planet at this time is psychology because the mission of a psychologist is a government one – to make the popula-tion into controllable zombies – the subject is being taught earlier and earlier in schools and a lot of your students and even Supervisors have been subjected to this propaganda and false data about Man and the mind. I recall that the people it took longest to get through TRs Courses were professional psychologists. The basis of this is false data – they are loaded with it. It is not that psychology teaches anything about communication (they never heard of the subject until we came along) but that they simply have so many false data about life that they actually can't study or drill in a life subject such as Scientology. And you may find it neces-sary to clean this up. This prevents horrible slows on TRs Courses. It's not an action that would be done in the course, of course, but would be done in Review. THE COMMUNICATION FORMULA IN CLAY The TRs are drills on the various parts of the communication formula. This basic datum seems to have become obscured in recent years. It appeared that, to many, TRs were considered to be drills that were done for the sake of doing drills, with only some vague accompanying idea of their actual use or application or how they related to audit-ing and an auditing session. The truth of the matter is that TRs are simply the drills that enable a person to polish and perfect his comm cycle. But if one doesn't know what the cycle of communication is to begin with, if one isn't totally familiar with the various parts of the communication formula, the TRs as drills are not going to make much sense to him. Drilling becomes a struggle because he doesn't even know what it is he's trying to handle. So one of the first things a TRs student needs is a sound understanding of the commu-nication formula."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TRS BASICS RESURRECTED 4 HCOB 24.12.79 LEVEL 0 28 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST The way to learn the communication formula is to do it in clay. That defines it, puts it there in the physical universe for him. By demonstrating the communication formula, all of its parts, in clay, he will actually see how it works. It becomes real to him. Now he knows what it is he's drilling. Unfortunately, with the cancellation of the 24 May 71 TRs Checksheet the basic ac-tion of demonstrating the communication formula in clay was dropped out and with that a real understanding of the use of TRs was obscured for many. Representing the comm formula in clay is now reinstated firmly as a vital preliminary step to drilling TRs. USE OF THE ARC TRIANGLE Even below an understanding of the communication formula comes an understanding of the ARC triangle. Now we are getting more basic. This turned up as a very interesting technical factor in reviewing countless TR video tapes this past year. It was actually a very interesting technical bug. I studied and studied these flunked video TR sessions to find the common denominator of all of them, and I finally nailed it. What I found was that they were specializing in \"C,\" communication, on the ARC triangle. They were specializing in \"C\" but what was out was their \"A\" (affinity) and \"R\" (re-ality) and their \"C\" was being pegged – it would go up just so far – because they weren't any-where up the line on their \"A\" and \" R. \" As a result they couldn't understand anything the other guy was saying. Most of the flubs were on this basis. They didn't have any pc there, they weren't listening to what the pc said, the ARC was out the bottom. The person gets stuck without full use of the ARC triangle. You can raise the commu-nication level but then you have to raise the reality and then you have to raise the affinity and then you get some understanding. Only then can you continue to improve each point of the triangle. On most of those videos they were stuck with the communication being raised just a bit, and that was that, because they weren't raising the affinity and reality levels along with it. So they did not advance or improve. A handling is to make sure the student gets a very sound understanding of the ARC triangle and its use before he tackles the TRs. This can be accomplished by having him represent it in clay, using the chapters on ARC in Fundamentals of Thought and Problems of Work and Chapter VII of Dianetics 55!. When he knows how A and R and C interrelate and how they're used to bring about Understanding, he's then prepared to really grasp the communication formula. And when he has a good familiarity with the communication formula he can drill the TRs and polish up his own communication cycle and improve with comparative ease."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TRS BASICS RESURRECTED 5 HCOB 24.12.79 LEVEL 0 29 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST TRS THE HARD WAY When TRs the Hard Way slipped out of use and permissive TRs entered the picture. the results were less competent auditors and less case gain for pcs. Auditor TRs must be taught rough, tough and hard. This does not mean invalidative drilling or coaching or supervision. It does mean you get the student to DO the TRs. He's got to drill the TRs, not figure-figure on them or dive into his case to avoid them. TRs the Hard Way means stringent, spot-on coaching and supervision on the proper gradient. Each button found on the student is flattened before it is left. Flunks are given when the student flunks. And when he flunks he goes right back in again and he drills it until he's got it. The TRs are taught and drilled per the 16 Aug 71R bulletin, TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED, and per the advices in HCOB 23 Sep 79, CANCELLATION OF DE-STRUCTIVE BTBs AND BPLs ON TRs. The student is coached to wins, not losses. You make sure he understands the drill and after that it's a matter of his DOING it. It's a matter of keeping him at it, getting him through it, regardless of what buttons crop up to be flattened, until he's mastered each TR and can handle any comm cycle with ease. Permissive, namby-pamby, pat-a-cake TRs have no place in the training of an auditor or on a bona fide TRs Course. A student who hasn't mastered his TRs won't master any of the training that follows them. The way to master TRs is to drill them the hard way. It is Hard TRs that make an auditor. (A more gradient approach to TRs would be taken on the HAS Course where the new Scientologist is getting his first taste of how to handle communication in his everyday life and livingness.) Given sound training on the basics, ARCU and the formula of communication with any false data stripped off, and the student then drilled on TRs the Hard Way, to perfection, you'll find he comes through with flying colors to a smooth, flubless comm cycle. And it doesn't take a year or even months to accomplish it. END PHENOMENON OF TRS As the students really had no idea of the communication formula as such due to the omission of the requirement that they do it in clay and learn it, they of course didn't know where they were going. A surprising number of students were heard making stupid remarks like, \"I would never use the TRs in auditing\" which is about the same as saying \"I would never use food when I eat.\" Practically no students on TRs Courses had any idea why they were doing TRs or what had to be achieved in order to be a finished product on a TRs Course. This unfortunately included the Supervisors and of course the coaches. So one got all sorts of silly, invalidative, evaluative teaching and coaching. If they didn't know where they were going and what the end phenomenon of a TRs Course was, of course they couldn't train a student toward it and so TRs Courses which would"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"TRS BASICS RESURRECTED 6 HCOB 24.12.79 LEVEL 0 30 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST only involve a week or two turned into months and months of floundering around due to mis-coaching and mainly destructive criticism which had no purpose. Instruction and coaching are not based on opinion. They should be based on producing the end phenomenon. The Primary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. The Secondary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A person with the session and social presence of a professional auditor and that pres-ence can be summed up as a being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation no matter how rough. The End Phenomenon of TRs is: A being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out. That's the EP and that's the direction all instruction and coaching must take. Each TR must be in against the standard above. As we know the communication formula and as the TRs are parts of it, the end phe-nomenon can be achieved relatively rapidly. It is that we know, for the first time in man's his-tory, the communication formula that makes it possible to drill people on it and produce the above end phenomenon. This was a major point that was being missed – that one was trying to produce something. If you don't know what you're trying to produce it can take forever, can't it? PREREQUISITE There is one factor that would effectively block a smooth run through this training, ba-sics or no basics. You're not going to get a person who has been loaded up with drugs to grasp this data and come out the other end as any kind of product until he's had his drugs handled. You now have the Purification Rundown to handle that, along with Objectives and the Drug Rundown. With this fantastic new rundown, which is an undercut to all training and processing, we have the means to make even the seemingly untrainable trainable. SUMMARY I wanted to let you know what has been happening in regard to TRs study and training over the past year, and what bugs have now been uncovered.

Communication is the Consideration and Action of impelling an Impulse or Par-ticle from Source-Point across a Distance to Receipt-Point, with the Intention of bringing into being at the Receipt-Point a Duplication and Understanding of that which emanated from the Source-Point. The formula of Communication is: Cause, Distance, Effect, with Intention, Attention and Duplication with Understanding. The component parts of the full Communication cycle are: Observation, Confront, Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Par-ticle or Impulse or Message, Distance, Estimation of Distance, Control (Start, Change, Stop), Direction, Time, and Timing, the Velocity of the impulse or particle or mes-sage, Volume, Clarity, Interest, Impingement, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, An-swer, Acknowledgment, Understanding, Nothingness or Somethingness. A non-communication consists of Barriers. Barriers consist of Space, Interpositions (such as walls and screens of fast-moving particles), and Time. A communication by definition, does not need to be two-way. When a communication is returned, the formula is repeated, with the receipt-point now becoming a source-point and the former source-point now becoming a receipt-point. L.

The Thetan in this universe has begun to consider himself MEST and has begun to consider himself mass and the being that considers himself mass of course responds to the laws of electronics and the Laws of Newton. He is actually incapable of generating very much or as-ising very much. An individual considers himself mesty or massy and therefore he has to have a second terminal. A second terminal is required to discharge the energy. Here we have two poles. We have an auditor and a pc and as long as the auditor audits and the pc replies we get an exchange of energy from the pc's point of view. Many auditors think they are being a second terminal to the degree that they pick up the somatics and illnesses of the pc. Actually there is no backflow of any kind that hits the auditor but if he is so convinced that he is MEST he will turn on somatics in echo of the pc. Actually nothing hits the auditor, it has to be mocked up or envisioned by him. You have set up in essence a two pole system and that will bring about an as-ising of mass. It isn't burning the mass, it is as-ising the mass and that's why there is nothing hitting the auditor. Now that is the essence of the situation. The magic involved in auditing is contained in the communication cycle of auditing. You see now you are handling the smooth interchange between these two poles."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE MAGIC OF THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE 2 BAS-01 – HCOB 23.5.71R LEVEL 0 36 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST When you look over the difficulties of auditing realize that you are handling simply the difficulties of the communication cycle and when you yourself as the auditor do not per-mit a smooth flow between you as a terminal and the pc as a terminal, and the pc as a terminal back to you, you get a no as-ising of mass. So you don't get TA action. Part of the trick of course is what has to be as-ised and how do you go about it, but that we call technique – (what button has to be pressed). We find, oddly enough, if the auditor is actually capable of making the pc willing to talk to him, he wouldn't have to hit a button to get tone arm action. (He cannot make the pc get tone arm action basically because a com-munication cycle doesn't exist.) The person who is insisting continuously upon a new technique is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing which is the communication cycle of auditing. When the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session we get this horri-ble compounding of a felony of trying to get a technique to work but the technique cannot be administered because there is no communication cycle to administer it. Basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique. A communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist. The fundamental entrance to the case is not on a level of the technique but is on a level of the communication cycle. Communication is simply a familiarization process based on reach and withdraw. When you speak to a pc you are reaching. When you cease to speak you are withdraw-ing. When he hears you, he's at that moment a bit withdrawn but then he reaches toward you with the answer. You'll see him go into a withdraw while he thinks it all over. Then he reaches the rea-son. Now he will reach the auditor with the reason and he will say that was it. You have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor and will see it reflect on the meter because that exchange now is giving an as-ising of energy. In the absence of that communication you do not get meter action. So the fundamental of auditing is the communication cycle. That's the fundamental of auditing and that is really the great discovery of Dianetics and Scientology. It's such a simple discovery but you realize that nobody knew anything about it. L.

At times over the years when it has been dropped out or obscured or misunderstood, auditor training quality and results have suffered."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  2  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 38 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Therefore, this full and final definition is to be posted in large letters in any course room where Professional TRs are taught. It should be emblazoned upon the foreheads and minds of TR Course Supervisors and all students on TRs Courses in training to become audi-tors. It should be known broadly and understood and emphasized. In 1971, due to the following factors, I found it necessary to modernize TRs 0 to 4. 1. The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs. 2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit. 3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their sub-jects but TRs. 4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic proc-esses stem directly from inability to do the TRs. 5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further. 6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. The preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubs without ARC breaks. These factors hold very true today and always will. Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. Profes-sional TRs Courses are not a tea party. The TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy and HGC and in the future should never be relaxed. A more gradient approach to TRs is taught on specially packaged co-audits for those with no prior technical training, where the same degree of flawlessness and skill demanded of a professional auditor is not demanded of the untrained co-auditor. And there is still another gradient of TRs found on courses for new public in Division 6, where the person is getting his first experience in handling communication in his life and livingness. But on a Professional TRs Course for auditors absolutely no standards are lowered. Professional auditors in training are given real TRs – rough, tough and hard. To do oth-erwise is to lose 90% of the results. There is nothing pale and patty-cake about TRs. This HCOB means what it says. It does not mean something else. It does not im-ply another meaning. It is not open to interpretation from another source. THE A-R-C TRIANGLE As TRs are methods of drilling the communication cycle, one cannot expect to master TRs without familiarity with that cycle. And basic to the drilling or any real use of the comm"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  3  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 39 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST cycle is an understanding of Affinity, Reality and Communication, which make up the ARC Triangle. There is no attempt here to repeat all of the existing data on the ARC Triangle and its use. Any student put on TRs must first have done a sound study of this theory. The data exists in the books: THE PROBLEMS OF WORK, Chapter 6: Affinity, Reality and Communication THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THOUGHT, Chapter 5: The ARC Triangle DIANETICS 55! and in various HCOB Bulletins in the Technical Volumes. A student ready for TR drills would know and would have demonstrated how Affinity, Reality and Communication interrelate. He would be familiar with how one improves the level of ARC by first raising one side of this important triangle in order to raise the next side and the next, and how ARC brings about Understanding. When he has that data he's better prepared to handle the comm cycle. THE FULL CYCLE OF COMMUNICATION Communication Defined If one were to put it very simply, it could be said, correctly, that communication is the interchange of ideas across space. A finer statement of this is given in the following definition from Axiom 28: Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or parti-cle from source-point across a distance to receipt-point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt-point a duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source-point. The simplest statement of the formula of communication is Cause-Distance-Effect. When we do a close inspection of this formula and the cycle involved, its many ele-ments come to view. The Parts Of The Full Communication Cycle The full cycle of communication is made up of these components: Observation, Confront, Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Par-ticle or Impulse or Message, Distance, Estimation of Distance, Control (Start-Change-Continue-Stop), Direction, Time and Timing, Velocity, Volume, Clarity, Interest, Impinge-ment, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Answer, Acknowledgement, Understanding. It also includes Nothingness or Somethingness."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  4  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 40 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Each TR drill is designed to train the student in one or more of these various compo-nents, until he has become expert in handling each part of the communication cycle and the communication cycle as a whole. When a student understands and has fully demonstrated the basic theory of communi-cation in clay, including the theory of the ARC Triangle and how it works in practice and the use of the communication cycle and all of its parts, he is well equipped to begin his training in TRs. DRILLING TRs ON A PROFESSIONAL TRs COURSE The student first studies the TR, clears any misunderstood words in it and makes sure he understands it. Then he drills it. He must do TRs. If during the drilling he has questions about the TR, he restudies it and gets right back onto drilling it. At no time may a coach or supervisor give a verbal interpretation of the HCOB. All queries and questions are handled by referring the student to the HCOB, getting him to restudy or re-word clear the drill. Then getting him to do the drill. In addition to this Bulletin, the supervisor may have the student and his twin study, in HCOB 18 Apr 80 TR CRITICISM, the section on the specific TR drill they are trying to do. On professional TRs, done the hard way, students drill each TR to a pass, one at a time. This is the rough, tough way it was done earlier, in the '60s, with results. The earlier action of getting a student through each TR itself, one at a time, and increasing the gradient of toughness as he does that TR, is what has proven successful. If a student has trouble and hangs up and can't pass an upper TR, he hasn't made it on the lower TRs. This has been proven conclusively. Start him back at the be-ginning of the TRs again. He re-drills each TR until he does it competently to a pass. If he then hangs up on the lower TRs, you would put him all the way back to restudy ARC and the cycle of communication, as there will be something there he hasn't grasped. TRs are coached and supervised with attention and with the intention of getting the student to win. By win we mean honestly mastering each TR as he goes. There's got to be a supervisor there to ensure this occurs. Lax, permissive coaching or lax, permissive supervision have no place on a Profes-sional TRs Course. They are simply an extension of the permissiveness of modern education where nobody winds up educated. This is not how we train. Permissiveness is nothing more than a symptom of the inability to confront. A professional TRs Course is taught and taught hard, not permissively. The above points are those which make up the expertise of how it is done. There are not many of these points but they have to be emphasized."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  5  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 41 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST TRAINING DRILLS 0-4 These TRs are done exactly per this HCOB without added actions or change. NUMBER: OT TR 0 1971 REVISED 1980 NAME: Operating Thetan Being There THEORY: OT TR 0 is the drill which provides an undercut to the actual use of the communi-cation formula. For any communication to take place, it requires somebody there. On OT TR 0 the student is drilling simply being there as potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Receipt-point. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Two students sit facing each other with eyes closed, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train the student simply to be there comfortably. The idea is to get the student able to BE there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there and not do anything else but be there. TRAINING STRESS: Students sit facing each other with eyes closed. There is no conversa-tion. This is a silent drill. There is no twitching, moving, confronting with a body part, \"sys-tem\" or vias used or anything else added to be there. One will usually see blackness or an area of the room when one's eyes are closed. Be there, comfortably. This does not mean the stu-dent is supposed to be completely unfeeling or unaware. And he does not get into a figure-figure or go into weird additives or considerations. There is no complexity to this drill. It means exactly what it says – simply be there, comfortably. Students do not coach each other on OT TR 0. The Supervisor does the coaching, covering the whole classroom, spotting any twitches, squirming, etc., and flunking them. If a student goes to sleep or starts boiling off, the supervisor gets him back onto the drill. He simply keeps the students at it. PATTER: None for students. Supervisor starts the drill with \"Start\" and uses\"That's it\" to ter-minate the drill. When he needs to flunk a student he uses \"Flunk\" and indicates what the flunk is on. When a student can BE there comfortably for some time, the drill is passed. NOTE: OT TR 0 would only be coached on a student by his twin if the student had flunked a later TR and been put back onto OT TR 0. It is then up to his twin to get him through, coach-ing him as the supervisor would, with the supervisor also keeping an eye on it. This means the student coach (who would have his eyes open for this coaching) sits across from the student who is doing OT TR 0, observing him and flunking twitches, squirming, etc. During this coaching, the coach would use \"Start\" \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\" as given in the Patter section above.

NUMBER: TR 0 CONFRONTING REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting. THEORY: On TR 0, in addition to potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Re-ceipt-point, the following parts of the comm cycle are entered in: Observation, Distance, Con-sideration, Attention, Confront. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other with eyes open, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront another person with auditing only or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there comfortably and confront and not do anything else but be there and confront TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making any con-versation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and do noth-ing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle, be embarrassed or anaten, or ex-hibit any reactive body motion which would be distractive to a preclear. TR 0 requires some coaching. It can be done uncoached for an initial period to accustom stu-dents to confronting and to permit some time for student to get through the initial manifesta-tions he may encounter when first doing the drills. Thereafter, the drill is coached on a student by his twin, and vice versa, on a turnabout basis. It will be found the student tends to confront with a body part, rather than just confront, or tends to use a system of confronting rather than just be there. This can show up in any number of ways including fidgeting, giggling, twitching, or any distractive motion or manifestation. Flunks are given for those as they are indications of non-confront, and they would be taken up and coached on the drill. Automatic body functions which are not distractive, such as normal breathing, swallowing, blinking, are not taken up by the coach or the supervisor. To clarify what has been known in the past as \"Blinkless TR 0\", the statement should be made that this does not mean the person never blinks. It is defined here finally and in full to mean that when a person's TR 0 is in he doesn't exhibit manifestations of inability to confront, in-cluding blinking nervously or flinching or doing anything else that would be distractive to a pc and shows a non-confront. PATTER: When TR 0 is coached, coach uses \"Start\" to begin the coaching period. He uses \"Flunk\" when the student shows any manifestation of non-confront, indicates what the non-confront is, and uses \"Start\" to begin the drill again. \"That's it\" is used to terminate the drill."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  7  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 43 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST NOTE: The drill is mis-named if Confronting means to do something to the person. The whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of another person without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self. Confront-ing with a body part can cause somatics in that body part being used to confront. The solution is just to be there and confront. On a Professional TRs Course the student passes when he can just be there and do a straight, uninterrupted 2 hours of good, acceptable confront. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\". Revised by L. Ron Hubbard April 1961 on finding that SOP Goals required for its success a much higher level of technical skill than earlier processes. Revised by L.

NUMBER: TR 0 BULLBAIT REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting Preclear Bullbaited. THEORY: On TR 0 Bullbaited the student drills being there as potential Cause or Source-point and being there as Effect or Receipt-point, with Duplication. He is also drilling Obser-vation, Distance, Consideration, Attention, Confront and particularly confronting a preclear who is being Cause or Source-point. The gradient of confront is increased on this drill, with emphasis on the fact that the student is confronting a preclear no matter what the preclear says or does. COMMANDS: Coach: \"Start\" \"That's it\" \"Flunk\". POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably and confront a preclear in a position three feet in front of the preclear without being thrown off, distracted or reacting in any way to what the preclear says or does. It is on TR 0 Bullbaited that the student learns to confront a preclear. TRAINING STRESS: After the student has passed TR 0 and he can just BE there comfortably and confront, \"bull baiting\" can begin. Anything added to being there and confronting the preclear is sharply flunked by the coach. Twitches, sighs, fidgets, anything except just being there is promptly flunked, with the reason why. PATTER: Student coughs. Coach: \"Flunk! You coughed. Start.\" This is the whole of the coach's patter as a coach. Coach then repeats whatever he had said or done that caused the student to react. He continues to coach the student on that \"button\", flattening it to a win for the student before going on to another button or other bullbaiting."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  8  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 44 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Button: An item, word, phrase, subject, voice tone, mannerism, anything that causes a person to react, causes him discomfort, embarrassment, upset or to laugh uncontrollably, etc. It is called a \"button\" because when you push it you get a reaction. PATTER AS A CONFRONTED SUBJECT: Bullbaiting is done on a gradient, giving the stu-dent lighter situations to begin with so student is not plunged into overwhelm at the start. Coach gets the student through the lighter situations and confronting those, then gradually stiffens the gradient, giving the student more and more to confront. The coach may say any-thing or do anything except leave the chair. The student's \"buttons\" should be found (these will be spotted by the coach during drilling) and each button flattened before it is left. A but-ton is never left unflat. Any words that are not coaching words may receive no response from the student. If the student responds, the coach is instantly a coach (see patter above). Student passes when he can BE there comfortably and confront a preclear without being thrown off or distracted or reacting in any way to anything the coach says or does. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\".

NUMBER: TR-1 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Dear Alice THEORY: On TR 1, the student is using Observation, Consideration and confront as previ-ously drilled. He is also drilling being Cause or Source-point, awareness of Effect or Receipt-Point, and as Cause getting a Message (or Impulse or Particle) across a Distance to Receipt-point with Attention, Interest, Control, correct Direction, correct estimation of Distance, Time and correct Timing, correct Velocity, correct Volume, Clarity and Impingement, and with the Intention that it is received and duplicated at Receipt-point. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver a command newly and in a new unit of time to a preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using a via, and to deliver a command with the intention that it is received. COMMANDS: A phrase (with the \"he said\" omitted) is picked out of the book Alice in Won-derland and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where he is. In other words it must be received by the coach. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to the coach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural not artificial. Diction and elocution have no part in it. Loudness may have."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  9  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 0 45 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST The coach must have received the command (or question) clearly and have understood it be-fore he says \"Good\". The operative word here is received. The communication must be re-ceived at Receipt-point as when that has occurred duplication can take place. Any datum that every command must sound exactly like the last command is false. Each question or command is delivered in a new unit of time. When that does not occur the same tonality will be noted, command after command, and the student appears robotic. A command delivered naturally is one that is delivered newly in a new unit of time. Don't buy an unchanging student or a wrongly done TR. If a student is unchanging (delivers 3 or 4 robotic TR-1s in a row) flunk him, coax him to do it correctly, make sure he knows and understands the drill and do all possible to get him de-livering a command naturally that arrives. But if there is still no change, put him back on OT TR 0 as he hasn't made it on his lower TRs. PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", says \"Good\" without a new start if the command is re-ceived. He says \"Flunk\" if the command is not received. \"Start\" is not used again. \"That's it\" is used to end the activity or to terminate for a brief discussion. Any discussion is kept to a minimum. If student has a question it is acknowledged, student studies the TR again for any necessary clarification and is put back on the drill. If session is terminated for a discussion, coach must say \"Start\" again before it resumes. This drill is passed only when the student can put across a command naturally, without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures, and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly. When the coach thinks the student has done it he asks the student if he has done it. If the coach is satisfied that he is receiving the commands, each newly in a new unit of time, and the student is satisfied that he has done it, he passes on to the next TR. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to teach the communication formula to new students. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard 1961 to increase auditing ability. Fur-ther revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to emphasize the purpose of the drill and to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 2 REVISED 1978 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Acknowledgments. THEORY: On TR 2, the student is using all of those parts of the comm cycle previously drilled. He is also drilling switching from Cause (Source-point) to Effect (Receipt-point) in order to receive, Understand and Duplicate the preclear's Answer, and then back to Cause to give the Acknowledgement. The real emphasis here is on the drilling of Control (the Start-Change-Stop of a communica-tion), as he uses the Acknowledgement to bring the communication to a full stop. Timing, Velocity, Volume and Impingement also enter into this drill. PURPOSE: To teach the student that an acknowledgement is a method of controlling preclear communication and that an acknowledgement is a full stop. The student must understand and appropriately acknowledge the comm and in such a way that it does not continue the comm."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 10 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 0 46 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from \"Alice in Wonderland\" omitting the \"He said\" and the student thoroughly acknowledges them. The student says \"Good\", \"Fine\", \"Okay\", \"I heard that\", anything only so long as it is appropriate to the pc's comm – in such a way as ac-tually to convince the person who is sitting there as the preclear that he has heard it. The coach repeats any line he feels was not truly acknowledged. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knows it was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and under acknowl-edgement. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgement across, then even him out. Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle of communica-tion or an encouragement to the preclear to go on and that an acknowledgement must be ap-propriate for the pc's comm. The student must be broken of the habit of robotically using \"Good\", \"Thank you\" as the only acks. To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc with an acknowledgement or can take a pc's head off with an acknowledgement. PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", reads a line and says \"Flunk\" every time the coach feels there has been an improper acknowledgement. The coach repeats the same line each time the coach says \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate the ses-sion. \"Start\" must be used to begin a new coaching after a \"That's it\". HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach new students that an acknowledgement ends a communication cycle and a period of time, that a new command begins a new period of time.

THEORY: The same parts of the comm cycle are drilled on TR 2 1/2 as on TR 2, with one exception; the emphasis here is on drilling Acknowledgement and Control in such a way as to bring about the \"Continue\" (or \"change\") part of the Control cycle. PURPOSE: To teach the student that a half acknowledgement is a method of encouraging a pc to communicate.

NUMBER: TR 3 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Duplicative Question. THEORY: On TR 3 the student is drilling using all the parts of the comm cycle, with empha-sis on getting a communication duplicated and completed. PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each time newly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions, and to acknowledge it. To teach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked. COMMANDS: \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone be-fore. Duplicating the auditing question without variation in a new unit of time does not mean a robotic duplication of tone of voice, command after command. It means that the original ques-tion asked is asked in a new unit of time without variation of the question. Any idea that the student must give every command sounding exactly like the last command is a false datum and only serves to mis-train the student into robotic delivery. The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time. The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she fails to repeat the exact questions, if he or she \"Q and As\" with excursions taken by the coach. Q and A means: Asking a question that is based on the last answer. It never completes any cycle. (REF: HCOB 5 APR 1980, Q & A, THE REAL DEFINITION.) The student is also flunked for ro-botic delivery of the question or command. PATTER: The coach uses \"Start\" and \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" is used to terminate the session. \"Start\" must be used to begin a coaching session again after a \"That's it\". The coach is not bound after starting to answer the student's question but may comm lag or give a commenting type answer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer. Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the stu-dent. Example:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 12 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 0 48 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Yes\" Student: \"Good\" Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Aren't you hungry?\" Student: \"Yes.\" Coach: \"Flunk\" When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, \"I'll repeat the auditing ques-tion\", and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgement and as needed, the repeat statement is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A is flunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utter the next com-mand (or with a long comm lag) is flunked. A choppy or premature acknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) is flunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" or \"That's it\" should have no influence on the student except to get him to give a repeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, \"I'll repeat the auditing command.\" \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" and \"That's it\" may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Any other statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If he succeeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as \"I just had a cognition.\" 'Coach divertive' statements should all concern the student, and should be de-signed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing. The student's job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, using only command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or her hands to prevent a 'Blow' (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than the above, it is a flunk and the coach must say so. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is no longer needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. This TR was redesigned to improve that frailty. Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to in-clude the definition of Q and A, flunks for robotic delivery of question, and to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Preclear Originations.

All the parts of the cycle of communication come into play in this drill."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 13 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 0 49 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination. COMMANDS: The student runs \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" on coach. Coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list (see Attachment of this HCOB, taken from the Preclear Origination Sheet at the back of The Book of E-Meter Drills). Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1. Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he cor-rects the student into better handling. PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concern the auditor. Otherwise the coach's patter is the same as in TR 3 (\"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"That's it\" and \"Start\" to resume the coaching session after a \"That's it\"). The student's patter is governed by: 1. Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving the repeat statement \"I'll repeat the auditing command\", and then giving it. Anything else is a flunk. The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem that concerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3.) Flunks are given if the student does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session. Flunks are also given for too abrupt a shift of attention or too slow a shift of attention back to the session, or for failure to return the pc to session at all. Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student's failure to differentiate between these (by trying to handle them) and coach's remarks about self as \"pc\" is a flunk. Student's failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should not always read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. By Originate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. By Comment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations are handled, Comments are disregarded by the student."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 14 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 0 50 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST The coach uses the Comments & Originations Sheet, attached to this issue, choosing items at random to drill the student in handling. When the student has mastered 1. Understanding; 2. Acknowledging; 3. Returning pc to session, the gradient is upped and the student is flunked for any part of the comm cycle being out. This would include non-confront, failure to get a communication across, using a half acknowl-edgement improperly (and thus inviting the pc to continue endlessly when the pc isn't even answering the question asked) when a full stop acknowledgement is required, failure to en-courage the pc to continue when it is necessary, failure to get the question answered or to de-liver each command in a new unit of time, as well as any flub in handling preclear origina-tions. The drill is passed when the student can handle cycles of communication smoothly and natu-rally. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks, Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the comm course TRs despite its appearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors. ROBOTIC TRS Stiff, unnatural TRs are robotic TRs. Students and auditors who haven't mastered the TRs will handle communication robotically. Anatomy Of A Robot It can be said of robots that: 1. They don't know what a comm cycle is. 2. They have never really passed OT TR 0. 3. They have never really passed TR 0. 4. They have never really passed TR 0 Bullbait. 5. They don't do TR 1 in a new unit of time each time they give it, so they all sound alike and they probably have TR 3 mixed up with TR 1, or they are stuck in an unflat 0 Se-ries (OT TR 0, TR 0, TR 0 BB)."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 15 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 0 51 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 6. They don't realize their TRs are addressed to the person in front of them but are probably addressed to the instructors for a pass. And so, with a combination of the above, these students and auditors will look like robots. They would never get the product of a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. And it's possible that they don't know that that is their product. The point is, however, that it would be almost impossible for any student or auditor to go on looking like a robot if he actually did the TRs. The remedy for robotic TRs is to put the student back onto restudy of the basics, the ARC Triangle and the cycle of communication, and then to re-drill the TRs from OT TR 0 on up, each one this time to a real pass. With these standard actions done he will reach the EP and wind up a Valuable Final Product. VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCT AND END PHENOMENON OF TRs ON A PROFESSIONAL TRs COURSE The Primary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A Professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. The Secondary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A person with the session and social presence of a professional auditor and that pres-ence can be summed up as a being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation no matter how rough. The End Phenomenon of TRs is: A being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out. With honest drilling of the cycle of communication on TRs these skills are fully achievable. And any being mastering these skills is capable in the extreme. L.

He volunteers something all on his own; and do you know that is a very good index of case – whether the person volunteers any-thing on his own? An old-time auditor used this as a case index. He said, \"This fellow isn't getting any better. He hasn't offered up anything yet.\" You see, he didn't originate – he didn't originate a communication. So remember that the preclear is as well as he can originate a communication. That means he can stand at Cause on the communication formula. And that is a desirable point for him to reach. But how about in the walk-away world – the world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly, or noisily, as the case may be? Do you ever have to handle an origin in it? Well, I dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not handle an origin. Every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody, you can trace it back along the line you didn't handle. If a person walks in and says, \"Whee! I've just passed with the highest mark in the whole school,\" and you say, \"I'm awfully hungry, shouldn't we go out and eat?\" – you'll find yourself in a fight. He feels ignored. He originated a communi-cation to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid. Most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents don't handle their originations properly. Han-dling an origination merely tells the person, \"All right, I heard it, you're there.\" You might say it is a form of acknowledgment, but it's not; it is the communication formula in reverse. But the auditor is still in control if he handles the origin – otherwise, the communication formula goes out of his control and he is at effect point, no longer at cause point. An auditor continues at cause point. So let's look this over. The handling of an origin has a great deal of use and, until re-cently, it was the least pat step in Scientology. How did you handle an origin? And we finally found out. I finally had a cognition myself. I tried for a long time to communicate this to peo-ple and they still blundered on it occasionally. And I finally found out something that did seem to communicate."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"STEP FOUR – HANDLING ORIGINATIONS 2 HCOB 30.3.73 I LEVEL 0 58 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST There are three steps in handling an origin. Here is the setup: The preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear, and the auditor is saying, \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" and the preclear says, \"Yes.\" Here is the factor, now, entering: \"Do fish swim?\" The preclear doesn't answer Do fish swim, the preclear says, \"You know – your dress is on fire,\" or \"I'm eight feet back of my head,\" or \"Is it true that all cats weigh 1.8 kilo-grams?\" You see, wog-wog – where did this come from? Well, although it is usually circuitry or something like that at work when it's that far off beam, it is, nevertheless, an origin. How do you handle it? Well, you don't want the preclear to go out of session, and he would if you handled it wrongly, so (1) you answer it; (2) you maintain ARC (you don't spend any time at it, but you just maintain ARC); and (3) you get the preclear back on the process. One, two, three. And if you spend too much time in (2), you'll be doing wrong. What is an origin? All right, he says, \"I'm eight feet back of my head.\" It's an origin; what are you supposed to do with it? Well, you're supposed to answer it. In this particular case, you would say to him something in the order of, \"You are?\" (You mean something like, \"I've heard the communication – it's made an effect on me.\") Now, in maintaining ARC you can skimp that second one if you handle the third one expertly enough. The least important one is the second one, but the most deadly thing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining ARC. That's deadly. But you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one, which is to say, get him back into session. So he says, \"I'm eight feet back of my head,\" and you say, \"YOU ARE???\" (What he said really hit, you know.) He's kind of wog-wog about this – he's not sure what this is all about. You say, \"You are?\" and the fellow says, \"Yes.\" \"Well!\" you say. \"What did I say that made that happen?\" \"Oh, you said 'Do birds fly?' and I thought of myself as a bird and I guess that's the way it is, but I am eight feet back of my head.\" \"Well, that's pretty routine,\" you say – reassure him, maintain the ARC. \"Now, what was that auditing question?\" \"Oh, you asked me 'Do birds fly?' \" And you say, \"That's right. Do birds fly?\" Back in session, you see. You can't do this: You can't put it into a can and put a label on it and say \"This is how you do it always,\" because it's always something peculiar; but you can say these three steps are followed. I will give you another example. You say, \"Do birds fly?\" and he says, \"I have a blind-ing headache.\" \"You do?\" you say. \"Is it bothering you (that's the ARC) too much to carry on with the session (and you've reached number three at once)?\" \"Oh no – it's pretty bad though.\" \"Well, let's go on with this, shall we?\" you say. \"Maybe it'll do something with it (maintaining ARC).\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"STEP FOUR – HANDLING ORIGINATIONS 3 HCOB 30.3.73 I LEVEL 0 59 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST He says, \"Well, all right,\" and you're right back onto it again: \"Do birds fly?\" One of the trickiest of these is \"What in my question reminded you of that?\" The fel-low says, \"Well, so and so,\" and he explains it to you and you say, \"Well, good.

Communication lines depend upon reality and communication and affinity and where an individual is too demanding the affinity tends to break down slightly. Processing goes in two stages. 1. To get into communication with that which you are trying to process. 2. Do something for him. There is many a pc who will go around raving about his auditor, whose auditor has not done anything for the pc. All that has happened is that a tremendous communication line has been established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that he then consid-ers that something miraculous has occurred. Something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has to-tally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place. He formed it in the first place to do something for the pc. He very often mistakes the fact that he has formed a communication line, and the reac-tion on the pc for his having formed one, with having done something for the pc. There are two stages. 1. Form a communication line. 2. Do something for the pc. Those are the two distinct stages. It is something like (1) Walking up to the bus, and (2) Driving off. If you don't drive off you never go anyplace."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE TWO PARTS OF AUDITING 2 BAS-02 – HCOB 23.5.71R II LEVEL 0 62 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST It is a very tricky and no small thing to be able to communicate to a human being who has never been communicated to before. This is quite remarkable, and is such a remarkable feat that it appears to be an end-all of Scientology to some. But you see that's just walking up to the bus. Now you have got to go someplace. Any upset that the individual has is so poised, it is so delicately balanced, that it is dif-ficult to maintain. It is not difficult to get well. It is very hard to remain batty. A fellow has to work at it. If your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing disci-pline is perfect so you don't upset this communication line and if you just made a foray of no more importance than saying something like \"What are you doing that's sensible and why is it sensible?\" and kept your communication line up all the while and kept your affinity up with the pc all the while, did it with perfect discipline, you would see more aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist. Now that's what I mean when I say do something for the pc. You must audit well, get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in. Don't ARC Break the pc, let your cycles of action complete. All of that is simply an entrance. You see, the discipline of Scientology makes it pos-sible to do this, and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and could never get near anybody was because they couldn't communicate to anybody. So that discipline is important. That is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you can't get to the door you can't do anything. The perfect discipline of which we speak, the perfect communication cycle, the perfect auditor presence, perfect meter reading – all of these things are just to get you in a state where you can do something for somebody. So when you're real slow picking up the discipline, real slow picking up keeping in the communication cycle, when you're pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles from the ball. You're not even attending yet. What you want to be able to do is audit perfectly. By that we mean keep in a commu-nication cycle, be able to approach the pc, be able to talk to the pc, and be able to maintain the ARC. Get the pc to give you answers to your questions. Be able to read a meter and get the reactions. All of those things have to be awfully good because it's very difficult to get a commu-nication line in to somebody anyway. They all have to be present and they all have to be per-fect. If they are all present and they are all perfect, then we can start to process somebody. then we can start to process somebody.

It takes a process now. We used to have it all backwards. We used to try and teach people what they could do for somebody. But they could never get in communication with him to do it, so therefore you had failures in processing. The most elementary procedure would be – \"What do you think is sensible?\" – or any-thing of that sort. The pc says, \"Well, I think horses sleep in beds. That's sensible.\" The audi-tor says, \"Alright. Now why is that sensible?\" The pc says, \"Well ... ah .... Hey! ... That's not sensible. That's nuts!\" You actually wouldn't have to do anything more than that. He's cog-nited. You've flattened it. It's so easy to do, but you keep looking for some magic. Well, your magic is in getting into communication with the person. The rest is very easy to do, all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you are do-ing this, and realize that these huge aberrations he's got are poised with the most fantastic-ally delicate balance on little pinheads. All you have to do is to phooph and these things crash. Now if you're not in communication with this person he doesn't cognite. He takes it as an accusative action. He tries to justify thinking that way. He tries to make himself look good to you and tries to put on a public front of some kind or another. He tries to hold up his status. Anytime I see a bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something else be-cause sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else, and they never have to be run on the crazy one, I right away know their auditors are not in communication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himself and trying to uphold his own status. So he must be defending himself against the auditor. The auditor couldn't possibly be in communication with him. So we are right back to the fundamental of why didn't the auditor get into comm with the pc in the first place. You get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing proper Scientology discipline. That is not any trick. It goes off 1, 2, 3, 4. You sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and his problems and that sort of thing and you do it by completing your communication cycles and not cut-ting his communication – the very things you are taught in the TRs, and you find you are in communication with the person. Now you've got to do something for the person. Unless, having gotten into communication, you do something for the person, you lose your communication line because the R-Factor of why you're in communication with the pc breaks down. He doesn't think you're so good, and you go out of communication with him. That having happened, the person will be in a sort of status defensive and wonder why he is being processed. On the other hand, if you have done something for the pc and he has had his cogni-tion, and you try and go on and get more TA action out of the fact that \"all horses sleep in beds\" – you don't get there as you've already flattened the process. You can over-audit and you can under-audit."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE TWO PARTS OF AUDITING 4 BAS-02 – HCOB 23.5.71R II LEVEL 0 64 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If you don't notice that one answer come your way, that indicates you have done something for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing, your TA action will dis-appear, your pc will get resentful and you'll lose your communication line. He's already had the cognition you see. You are now restimulating the pc. You have gotten your key-out destimulation factor – it has occurred right before your eyes. You have done something for the pc. One more mention of the subject and you've had it. There are a lot of things you could do with the pc, without doing anything for him. You can turn on some very very handsome somatics on a pc at one time or another without turning them off either. You've got to do something for the pc, not to him. Now you can be doing something (A), and the pc is doing (B), and you go on doing (A), while the pc is doing (B) then somewhere on down the line you wind up in a hell of a mess and you wonder what happened. Well the pc never did what you said so you didn't do anything for the pc. There was in actual fact no barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been a tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on. That you could ask (A), while the pc answered (B), in itself showed the auditor obser-vation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasn't in communication with the pc. So again the communication factor was out and once more we weren't doing anything for the pc. It requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line. He has got to stay in communication with his pc. Those cycles have got to be perfect. He can't be distract-ing the pc's attention onto the TA, e.g. \"I'm not getting any TA action now.\" That's not staying in communication with the pc – has nothing to do with it. You're distracting the pc from his own zones and areas. Don't put the pc's attention out of session. Keep him going and keep that communica-tion line in.

Beautiful, sunshiny day here; cherish it. Go out and make a facsimile of it. This is what? Audience: 25 July. 25 July. What do you know about that? A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The auditing cycle. Once upon a time there was an auditor and he knew he could au-dit; he knew he could audit. But PCs, they just wouldn't PC worth a nickel. And the auditor said, \"Well, I'll have to get out of Scientology because PCs are no good.\" You'd be surprised how often this line of logic – ha – gets in the road. Most auditors, early on, have a definite idea that there's tremendous variation in PCs, and that some PCs can be audited and some PCs can't be audited, and that there are good PCs and bad PCs, and all different kinds of PCs. Well, there are worrisome PCs, but just to the degree that you can't get them to get tone arm action. And some PCs are closer to aquiver on the subject of a communication breakdown than others; they're more nervy. Those things are true. But practically no PC can stand up against a good auditing cycle, you know, and say, \"Well, I'm going on being aber-rated for the rest of my days because that makes everybody wrong and makes me right.\" The difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle and his own impatience. His disabilities in this particular line are last detected by himself. In other words, he's really the last to find this out. If an auditor wants to polish up his auditing, I recommend putting a piece of session on a tape, at least a piece of a session, and then listening to that tape back, and not listening to the ramifications or the flubs. Anybody is liable to make a duplicative-type flub, you know. Like, you've had to change your auditing command – you heard me make one the other day on that tape. I had to change the command, because I was getting so much bang out of \"mainly\" that I had to put \"mostly.\" And then I was grooved into saying \"mainly,\" and my concentration, of course, was for the PC, and I was slipping up and I was occasionally saying \"mainly\" again when I was trying to say \"mostly.\" Well, you're liable to pick on that kind of thing as being a very important error. Actu-ally, it isn't very important. What's important is: Did you complete your auditing cycle? See, it really isn't how gracefully you completed it, but did you complete it? There are two communication cycles that make up the auditing cycles, and those are: cause-distance-effect with the auditor at cause and the PC at effect; and cause-distance-effect"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 2 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 68 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST with the PC at cause and the auditor at effect. Those are completely distinct, one from the other. Now, the only place they impinge on each other at all – and this is the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle – is the fact that the auditor, on his cycle, has cal-culatingly restimulated something in the PC, which is then discharged by the pc's auditing cycle. So you see, you've kind of got a V lying on its side. You see, you've got the upper V here with the auditor at the top of the wing, you see, and he's cause, distance, effect; and here at the point of the V, you customarily think of that as just one turn. Actually, there's a compli-cation right there: It's what the auditor has said has caused a restimulation at that point, and then the PC is honor bound to start an auditing cycle to get rid of the restimulation. Can you see that? And that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle, and that's the entirety of the game. There's nothing else esoteric about it at all. Don't think otherwise than that the auditor is restimulating the PC. Now, some audit-ing – some auditing – breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the PC. Now, you'll see this on a gross level when somebody said, \"I had to stop auditing him because the somatics were so great.\" You see? I've actually heard somebody say that – seriously. And I think to myself, \"The poor PC, man.\" At that point of the V where those two come together and where effect turns into cause, where the PC is there, at that point, you have a restimulation and then the necessity of answering the question to get rid of the restimula-tion. Now, if the PC doesn't answer the question, the PC does not get rid of the restimula-tion. If he alter-ises at that point, then every restimulation is going to become an alter-is. And all PCs who are having any trouble alter-is at that point of the V. Here, I'll draw you a picture.1 Here is your V. And this is cause and this is distance and this is effect. Now, here's your auditor, see? And here's the PC. Now, at this point here is where you get your restimulation factor. And this point is again, now, cause-distance-effect, see? So we get cause-distance-effect, see? And that's what an auditing cycle in actual fact looks like. Now, there are some little inner cycles – there are some little inner cycles that throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle. And these little inner cycles are when you get cause-distance-effect, and he has answered the question, the auditor then says, \"Thank you.\" Well, actually, that's a shadow. And this now starts the shadow back, you see? You understand? See, there's a little extra communication cycle on here; it's an extra cycle, see? And you have this as the acknowledgment – the acknowledgment cycle. So you have here an ack, and of course that goes this way, you understand, and is received over here; and that's all there is to it. That's a little fade-out, don't you see?   1 Editor's note: See Lecture Graphs published as HCOB 14 Aug 63, Red Vol. V, page 339"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 3 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 69 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Well, I very often berate you for being not perceptive, and not auditing the PC and not seeing what's happening to the PC, or what's going on there, don't you see? So I get this kind of an action here: There is another one of these little shadow cycles. The PC has received the auditing command. And that is such a tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out what's going on with the PC are missing that one. You say, \"Do birds fly?\" and then you fail to perceive that the PC received the audit-ing command. Now, that's because he doesn't say anything. See, here's your main cycle: cause-distance-effect; \"Do birds fly?\" See? And the PC says, \"No.\" Well, actually, there's another cause in here; there's another little tiny one, and it's right here and it's a little c, see? And you're missing that one where you're not perceiving the PC. Does he receive it? You say, \"Do birds fly?\" And he says... That's all the cause that is emanated at this point, by the PC. See, he just... See, that would be exaggerating it. But you can tell by looking at him that he didn't understand what you'd said, or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving, you see? Doing something peculiar with this command. Well, it's actually whatever that message is that is in response here, whatever message that is, does ride on this line. And an auditor who isn't watching the PC at all then never no-tices a PC who isn't receiving or understanding the auditing command; and all of a sudden, somewhere along the line, there's an ARC break, and then we do assessments and then we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong. Well, they actually needn't ever have gone wrong in the first place. What is the PC doing, completely aside from answering? Well, that what he is doing is this other little sub-cause-distance-effect line. So a complete auditing cycle consists of no less than six communication cycles, if you really want to get it down to the last ramifications. But the important ones are four. You've got four communication cycles. Well, where are the other two? Where's the other two? They're so tiny that you would-n't really notice them, but they are there. Cause-distance-effect of \"Is the PC ready to receive an auditing command?\" See, is he ready to receive an auditing command? He's going, \"Oh, rum-rum-rum-rum-rum.\" Well, that action is actually PC causing, isn't it? And it has to ride up the line across distance and [be] received at the auditor; and the auditor perceives that the PC is doing something else. You say, \"That's not very important,\" you see? But it is; it is. You'll find auditors goof that one very often. And the PC is going... And the auditor says – he's nulling, let us say – and he says, \"catfish,\" \"cat fur,\" and so forth. And the PC is going like this, you see? See, he's not noticed this first one. That causes this kind of trouble: You've got the item \"fur\" on a list that you're nulling, and you hit the item \"fur\" and it goes through, actually, a complete auditing cycle, one way or"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 4 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 70 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST the other, because you very often say thank you after you've done so. It's a very jammed-up auditing cycle, but it's there, you see? And then you go on to \"catfish\" on the next one, without performing this top cycle: Is the PC ready to have \"catfish\" read to him? No, he's hung up on \"fur,\" and the only time you ever get into real catastrophe is when the PC is really hung up on \"fur.\" God, when you said \"fur,\" the PC went, \"Ew-w-w-w.\" Dong! and there he is, see? \"What's happened? Where is it? Ho! What's happened?\" See? You ever have that hap-pen to you? Somebody goes over a line – bong! it goes. And the next thing you know, in the far-off distance you hear \"catfish, cat whiskers... \" And you say, \"What's that? Where's this? Who's what?\" This one becomes terribly im-portant when you run into a situation like that. You don't really pay too much attention to it. But it exists. Got it? It exists. And there's another one down here. There's another little one down here: Pc received the acknowledgment. And sometimes you violate that sixth one. You say, \"Thank you!\" and the PC goes like this. Or that you say, \"Thank you,\" and the PC... If you were to do old-time Model Session end-of-session mid ruds at that point, you'd find out the PC asked you why you never acknowledged him. See? You have been acknowledging him, but you've never seen that he didn't receive the acknowledgment, don't you see? That perception has another little tiny one in it, is: Has the PC said everything? But that actually comes on this line here: Has the PC answered everything, see? And it becomes... the auditor is watching the PC, see? And the auditor sees that the PC has not said all he was going to say. Sometimes get in trouble with PCs that way. Pc says, \"Oh, yeah, it was sometime in the later days of the Roman Empire...\" You know he's going to say something else, see? Well, this one isn't complete. So everything at cause hasn't moved down the line here to you, effect. And you haven't perceived all of the effect. So you go into the acknowledgment one before this line has completed itself, don't you see? \"Well, it was in the early days of the Roman Empire. Um...\" \"Thank you! Now, we will...\" Duh-uh-uh-uh. You've seen that happen. That's chop-ping a pc's comm, see? They didn't let this line here, which is the fourth communication cycle, flow to its complete end. And then this one, the acknowledgment, takes place. And of course it can't go through because this, the fifth communication cycle, is sitting up here on the fourth communi-cation cycle. So you say, \"Thank you,\" and of course you're right back against... and it's an inflow-ing line and they jam right there. So there are six – if you really want to break it all down – there are six communication cycles that make up one auditing cycle. Six – not more than six, unless you start running into trouble. And when you violate that – one of those six, when you violate one of those six – you of course are going to get into trouble, then, which causes a mishmash of one kind or another."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 5 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 71 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, I'll go over these again. I think you would care to have me do that, wouldn't you? Audience: Yes. All right. Up here we have number one: the PC. His emanation at that point is simply his appearance and presence. That's number one. Is he ready to have an auditing command given to him? See, are we all set here for the auditing command? That's number one. That's a communication cycle consistence of cause, distance, effect. Your next communication cycle on the thing – we had better go into number three – is your auditor's communication straight down to the PC. That is the auditing command and that you normally consider the communication cycle. Got it? That's what you normally say: \"Do birds fly?\" That's cause-distance-effect received at the pc's – here. Now he has to take care of and handle the charge at this point (and I'll cover this in a minute), he'll have to handle the charge at this point which has been restimulated by the audi-tor. And now he originates (although we use another designation; I've used origination other-wise, and so forth): He has his answer, which is what you normally call it. His answer, how-ever, is a cause. And that's a cause, a distance and an effect. You understand? Now, your next one is an acknowledgment by the auditor which goes over cause, dis-tance, effect, is received by the PC; and this is the perception of whether or not the PC re-ceives the acknowledgment. Got that? But you go over this, work this thing out, you'll find out that it's a very complicated ar-rangement. And you can count on anybody studying this, promptly and immediately after-wards not being able to audit at all. It's something like taking a golf pro and say, \"How do you handle your club?\" But this is your main show. Now, what you've considered ordinarily the auditing cycle has been this first V which I drew, which is cause-distance-effect – with the PC at effect, the auditor at cause. And then, at that V, the restimulation takes place and you get cause-distance-effect. Now, I'm not going to go into the rest of the auditing cycle till I show you the center of this thing, okay? There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle – another communica-tion cycle. And that is at the point of the V. [starts to draw the second graph] Here's your PC and here's your auditor, and here was your cause, your distance, effect; here is your cause, your distance, effect and here was a C and here was an E. Don't you see? Cause-distance-effect at the PC. That's the auditing command. And then you've got cause-distance-effect which is the auditing response. Well, we've opened up the point of the V. And here is your little additional one, and that's between the PC and himself. Here – see what this is. Now, this actually can be multiple, and it depends upon the complications of the mind. But because there has been an effect there, that causes a cause. See? Because you have an effect at this point of impact, you get a res-timulation. Now, that stimulation brings about charge, which then causes the PC to emanate"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 6 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 72 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST to get rid of that charge. So you have an internal one, here, of cause-distance-effect inside the pc's skull. Well, that gives us seven communication cycles. Now, I said this could be multiple. This is him talking to him, see? And you say, \"Do birds fly?\" and this causes a picture of birds. He receives the effect of the picture of birds, and he causes a query of the picture. \"Are they flying?\" And as a result, the answer comes back of the flapping of the wings and he says, \"Yes, they're flying.\" And so with his thought he transmits, then, the causative action to the auditor – now directed at the auditor – \"Yes.\" You see how that can be multiple? Now, you're listening to the inside of his skull when you're examining that V down there. Now, if you think that the inside of the skull is more important than the rest of the cy-cles, you're going to be very, very disabused. This happens to be the least important of all of the actions, except when it isn't being done. And of course it's the hardest to detect when it isn't being done. It's the hardest to detect. Pc says, \"Yes.\" Well now, what has the PC said yes to? And you sometimes are insuf-ficiently incurious. You've said, \"Do birds fly?\" and the PC receives this, and he gets a picture of a dinosaur who is eating, and perceives that dinosaurs eat and says, \"Yes.\" And carrying out the remaining part of the sentence, it would be, \"Yes, dinosaurs eat.\" So this is actually what it sounds like to the auditor: \"Do birds fly?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thank you.\" See, that's what it sounds like to the auditor – that's the big V. Actually, this is what happened: \"Do birds fly?\" And the point of the V is haywire; we get a dub-in, see? Picture of a dinosaur flies up, because that's safer to look at than birds, for some reason, or more interesting or different. It's an alter-is of some kind or another – happens on an automaticity. The PC thinks he understands the question now on the basis of \"Do dinosaurs eat?\" and says, \"Yes.\" And the auditor says, \"Thank you.\" Hey, wait a minute. What's going to happen to this PC? What's going to happen to the PC? And that, in essence, is this internal perception of line, which I showed you on the other side. This cause-distance-effect backflash here, and so forth, happens to include \"Is the PC answering the command I gave him?\" Question. Now, all of this is very complicated, isn't it? And it's sufficiently complicated that any auditor ought to sit down with a piece of paper and work it all out – and not expect me to tell them. I think there are very few auditors ever really inspected that to the degree that it's a multiple cycle. There are seven or more communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 7 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 73 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, it's actually weighty enough that standing up here giving you a lecture on the subject, off the cuff, see, it's very easy to get mixed up on which cycle is which, because it requires a little bit of concentration. You have to actually mock up a complete session, see – complete auditing cycle – and pick out every communication cycle in the auditing cycle. Now, a communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication. That's all – that's a communication cycle. How many of these are there in one auditing cycle? And that would include every nuance of the auditing session. So you have to answer with how many principal ones are there? Because some auditing cycles could contain a couple of more. The PC says, \"Huh?\" You see, that's a cause. That goes over distance, effect. And the auditor says, \"Do birds fly?\" He says, \"I will repeat the auditing question. Do birds fly?\" And that goes cause-distance-effect. But you immediately have added two more cycles and so you've got nine – because there was a flub, see? You got that? So anything unusual that happens in the session adds to the number of communication cycles to the auditing cycle, but they're still all part of the auditing cycle. Now, we've got repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, and that's doing this same cycle over and over and over. Now, I'll give you some homework here; this is for your own good. You draw out all these communication cycles on a scrap of paper for yourself. Just take a look at all these things and mock up a session, like you do this and the PC does that, and so forth. And all of a sudden it'll come very straight in your skull how many of these things there are, and you won't have a couple of them jammed up. Because actually, what's mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is you have confused a couple of communication cycles to such a degree that you don't differentiate that they exist. That's why you sometimes chop a PC who is trying to answer the question, see? You know whether he has answered the question or not. Well, how did you know if he has answered the question or not? By esoterics? New subject matter: esoterics. If you're very skilled at esoterics, you could probably manage it. But there are no esoterics involved. Even if it's telepathy, it's cause, distance, effect. Doesn't mat-ter how that communication took place; you know whether he's answered the auditing com-mand by a communication cycle. I don't care if the distance was zero. It was permeation from same location in space; you were in the pc's head. I don't care how you sense this or if you know that ordinarily this PC is green when he answers an auditing command, and he turns pale white this particular time. You realize he's not answered the auditing command. Well, how did you know that? Well, obviously, it's a communication cycle inside the auditing cycle. So, I'll give you a little assignment there. You work that thing out. How many of these things are there? And then expect to drop the mashie and the niblick and hook one into the woods for a day or two. So that's perfectly all right to do that, see? I myself occasionally take apart a piece of auditing and find myself gaping briefly in a session, because I've been trying to put together a very flexible R2H, because R2H is a very –"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 8 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 74 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST the way it was originally released – is a very skilled activity. It's too much for me. That's right! It's just too confoundedly skilled. I know you can't do it. Impossible! It's too prone to error. Good training: Man, if you can do that, you can do anything! I mean it. If you can do that, you can do anything. But, boy, by the time you get some PC who's got an insignificant ARC break that doesn't have the punch of an engram or anything like that behind it, and you're trying to date that confounded thing on a meter – it's just smooth as glass, and so forth – you practically have to ARC break the PC again to get the meter to read! [laughs] Terrific training. But inherent in that process – inherent in that process – there are a great many proc-esses which go pretty well south and which will, actually, practically go one shot to OT, see? It's masked, however, in the exact mechanics that you're handling. I found out that you have to use ten – a minimum of ten – steps to get the terrific therapeutic result of which it's capable. At least ten steps. In fact, I got one version of it on the drawing table right now, which I've been working with: I don't know, I think it must have about eighteen separate steps. I'm just trying to milk this thing down for maximum tone arm action, minimal error and maximal ease of auditing. You're doing a training version now. It won't be changed. Go right ahead with it. But this is really putting that process up to make it get its most results, see? And, by the way, there are only nine levels of assessment in this newest version I'm working out – just nine lines, takes care of the lot. But that's all progress. But I'm running all this on a PC. You get the idea? It's all brand-new, and it's impossi-ble to audit the original version of it anyway. And I'm handling something that has fifteen steps in it, all of which are strange and different, and the PC has done something incredible in the session that I haven't yet suspected. And boy! You talk about the mashie and the niblick, man! You know? That golf ball goes straight through the trees, hits a tree trunk, caroms off a rock, goes straight up into the sky and vanishes forever. [laughs, laughter] All right. Well, if you're nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing, if that's giving you trouble and if you can get yourself into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it, then it should be broken down and analyzed at the time you're auditing something nice and simple. That's the time it should be broken down – not until you have three woods in your right hand and four irons in your left hand and you're going to putt with the heel of your golf shoe, see? I mean, this is not the time to practice this auditing cycle. So you go ahead and break it down. I've given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle. Maybe in working it over you can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they're all there, and if you made somebody go through each one painstakingly and painfully, you would find out where his auditing cycle was jammed up. And it isn't necessar-ily jammed up on his ability to say \"Thank you!\" It may very well be jammed up in another quarter. Got that? Now, there's a completely different auditing cycle inside the same pattern. Just wanted to make you comfortable and make you feel relaxed. [starts to draw the third graph]"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 9 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 75 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Let's work this one out. Here's the PC. This PC, he gonna originate. This has got noth-ing to do with the auditing cycle. Scrub that other one! This now has nothing to do with it. The only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles. That they have in common. But this is brand-new. This is the bolt from Mars. It comes out of the blue, and an auditor who is already concentrating... he's auditing, you know... There are people, they used to read – they'd move their lips while they read, you know? And everybody would make a lot of fun of them, you know, for... You know? Well, an auditor who's handling his communication cycles and his main auditing cycle on a lip-moving level, see – he's brand-new at this sort of thing: the PC says something, see, that is not germane to what the auditor is saying or doing. And there is just – well, just trucks go over the cliff, jet ships crash, see? All goes to hell, man! So you actually have to be alert for this thing happening at any time. And the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen any time; and just go into the drill that han-dles it, and don't get it confused with the drill which you have as an auditing cycle; and con-sider it as its own drill. It's its own drill. You shift gears into this drill when the PC does something unexpected. And by the way, this handles such a thing as the PC originates by throwing down the cans. That's still an origin, see? That had nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The auditing cycle went to pieces, maybe, and this cycle came in. Well, the other auditing cycle can't com-plete because this cycle is now here. Well, that doesn't mean that this cycle has precedence or dominance, but this cycle can start and take place and have to be finished off before the other one can resume. So this is an interruptive cycle. And it is cause and distance and effect. And here's your auditor. The PC causes something. Now your auditor has to originate, and your V is in-verted. Now let's investigate here. Let's investigate that point. Let's expand the point, just as we did in the auditing cycle. [laughter] What's this going to be, a mad spate of question marks [laughter] or rockets flying off at oblique angles, or what's going to happen at this point? Well, frankly, you can't put a machine at that point. You can't put a machine action at that point, because this thing has to be understood – has to be understood. So, to the degree that it is hard to understand, you have cause-distance-effect, cause-distance-effect. You un-derstand? This is the auditor trying to clarify this thing. And every time he asks a question, he's got a new communication cycle. Well, the trick that happens at the open V must not be such as to merely get the origi-nal line, cause-distance-effect, repeating itself. You mustn't have the PC continuing to repeat that line, because the PC is now going to go frantic. Because he can't get off of that line, he's stuck in time, and it really upsets him. So the auditor, when this V is expanded here, has to be able to understand what the devil the PC is talking about. Now, there's really no substitute for simply trying to understand it. The PC all of a sudden says, \"But the Roman Empire didn't have any legs!\""},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 10 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 76 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"Tell me a little more about that, please.\" That's a good response. And the PC immediately goes off into can gesticulations like mad and explains how – how because of North Africa being in its situation, you see, Egypt being in its situation, and that sort of thing, the Roman Empire didn't run on legs. It didn't run on legs at all; it ran on rivers. We're now getting in deeper. \"All right. Good enough; good enough. I hear what you're saying, now. Ah... \" [laugh-ter] \"Give me a little more dope on this so I can get a good grasp of it.\" Oh, and the PC will go on and he'll expostulate and understand it. And he'll understand it better through telling you. And all of a sudden, you'll find out that he's telling you it didn't have any legs, and it didn't have any legs to stand on – that is what he really meant, and so forth. And he's got it all doped out, and all of a sudden you see what the hell he's talking about. And at that point, you can resolve this point at the open V, you see? And \"Oh, that's what the hell he's talking about\" is the name of that expanded little V. \"Oh, that's what the hell he's talking about\" is the name of that cause-distance-effect, see? And then you say (cause-distance-effect), \"Thank you.\" How many more lines can you put in there? Well, you have to have another little line up here, which is another little cause-distance-effect, before that origination takes place so that you don't run into a jam and you don't give the auditing command. He's originated that he's going to say something. He says... see, whatever it is – and that's not the time for you to say \"Do fish swim?\" See? You suddenly notice there's a flicker across the table and the PC is saying... [breathes in] See, that's another little communication cycle. So it's cause-distance-effect. And effect at your point is to shut up. See? And then, you actually can have another little one, here, that's a cause-distance-effect, of \"I'm listening.\" Get the idea? And then, of course, there's your extra ones down here – when you've said \"Thank you,\" then it's your perception of the fact that he has received the thank-you. And there's your origin. Got it? Audience: Yeah. The building brick out of which all of these things are made are communication cy-cles. That's just cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication, see? That's the lot, see? But when you say \"duplication\" – when you say this – you are carrying, then, the communication cycle over into the A and the R, because there must be understanding. Now, this is peculiar: There is a difference between an auditing cycle and a military communication cycle. \"Theirs is not to question why; theirs is but to do and die\" is definitely the military attitude toward the whole thing. And whereas this, too, can get into auditing... and actually is not disallowed and is sometimes used, and not without benefit. The guy is not go-ing to touch that wall. \"Thou shalt touch that wall,\" you see? This kind of an action very often takes place.

Now, the military cycle is simply cause, distance, effect, compliance. And the auditing cycle is cause, distance, effect, understand. So there is an A and an R at the effect point. And therefore, there has to be an A and an R at the cause point, so as to make \"understand\" accept-able at the effect point. There doesn't have to be, but there had better be. You see that? So there's where A and R fit in on the communication cycle where auditing are con-cerned. They are very carefully designed. Now, a very syrupy affinity is very often highly detrimental to auditing. But too snarly or abrupt an affinity is also detrimental to auditing. We haven't completed talking about the auditing cycle by a long ways. The auditing cycle, you would say, then, is TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, the auditing cycle has very little to do with TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, just as such, and only as such. The TRs have to do with the communication cycle. And you have to put one all the way together at about TR 5 or TR 6 to take in all of these communication cycles. You understand? What the lower TRs do is teach you to handle one communication cycle – see, from one side or the other – in varying degrees of complication. Now, of course you've got to have TR 0, because all of these things have to do with confront. All of them have to do with con-front, so you'd say TR 0 is native to all of them. TR 1: Well, that's an emanation. And TR 2 is a receipt. So of course, those just handle what? They just handle nothing but the communica-tion cycle. Do you see that? Now, you can go on and build this up from this point on, but you will find that a com-plete auditing cycle would require a full-dress-parade TR that covered, maybe, at least six. And then you could have another TR that covered it up to nine, ten or twelve. And you could have another TR that handled an origin through all of its cycles – but that's supposed to be, right now, TR 4. See, TR 4 – you've always had trouble with TR 4. Maybe I've shown you why today. Look at TR 4. See, that's a picture of TR 4. The V is the other way around. This thing is all upside down, you see? But that isn't all there is to the A and the R in connection with the communication cy-cle. TR 1: How good is somebody's TR 1? Well, let me tell you that the ability to say \"Do fish swim?\" might serve, but how about being comprehensible? How about being comprehensi-ble? Enunciatively comprehensible: you can understand the syllables. How about that? We can get over that point. But how about giving it an understandable communication? Now, let's look at this in its widest ramifications. The R-factor has to be present there so that it can be duplicatable. You very often, when you leave some auditors loose on making up a command, or asking something, or there's a hole in the routine and it doesn't give them those words, will do a put-together of the statement to be said to the PC which, at the arrival at the PC, is incom-prehensible. And yet an auditor is very often called upon to do this. I've noticed this. I'm not being condemnatory of auditors in general, but I've noticed here and there. When an auditor –"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 12 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 78 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST some auditors are left completely on their own... Well, something like this: \"Well, get me a list. Get me a list of the stuff he's worried about.\" And you expect them to put together a ques-tion something like \"What are you worried about?\" see? And you get some entirely different, incomprehensible version, like \"What are the worst part of your worries sometimes?\" Some-thing like this. Now, that's almost sensible compared to some of them I've seen. They're just absolutely incomprehensible. Absolutely incomprehensible. I don't know how anybody – and I have actually seen somebody run a level fitted into one of these five-to-fifteen command brackets, which didn't make any sense at all, and sud-denly found to my horror that some PC had actually been running on this for hours and hours and hours, and every time they arrive at it, says, \"I don't have a clue what you're talking about at this point.\" And the auditor just says, \"I will repeat the auditing question.\" So there's this factor in this communication cycle, that the TR 1 aspect must be (1) enunciated in such a way as to arrive in an understandable form, but very often, when the auditor is formulating something, has to be formulated so that it can be duplicated. So these two other factors are involved, besides simply being at cause – is the cause going out with any R? In other words, can you understand any part of this thing? Is this an understandable state-ment? \"Do fish someti... I'll repeat the auditing question: Do fish somet...\" Naturally, no au-diting can proceed. You start dropping s's off of everything; or get somebody with a Japanese curve; you get somebody doing something that is a little bit offbeat in pronunciation – somebody from Boston. Let's go worse – somebody from Maine. You ever hear a \"Maine-iac\" talk? [laughter] I was up there finding the Canadian border. The United States government lost it. (They'd lose their heads, you know, if you didn't watch them.) Anyway, they lost the Cana-dian border and went up and found it again. Found a tree had fallen on it and buried the marker. They have little pyramids that look like the Washington Monument that mark the border. It was very necessary, because the prohibition agents didn't know where their author-ity started and ended, see? It caused terrible things. We took the problem off because what we were doing when we were surveying is we would stop the rum runners and tell them we were prohibition agents, relieve them of their cargo, and we always had a lot to drink! Anyway... [laughter] We solved this problem practically. The U.S. government could've taken a lot of leaves from, I think, most of us on practical solutions to these problems. But I spent the most delighted summer trying to learn to speak \"Maineiac.\" Gorgeous. And the French that had been living up along the St. Lawrence didn't speak French and they didn't speak English. They spoke something else. But it was sure interesting. Got so I could speak the thing, you know? I'd talk about \"Baa-haaba\" [Bar Harbor] with the best of them. But it wouldn't go in an auditing session. And very often, some PC gets saddled with an auditor that he can't quite comprehend along some corner or another. Now, you should recognize what's out. The only thing that is"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 13 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 79 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST out is the R-factor in the TR 1. And an auditor should actually take great care to keep that one smoothed out. If he knows he's doing something weird that the PC can't comprehend, it does-n't matter how clumsily he sets it right so long as he sets it right. Supposing you can't tell the difference between the way he pronounces five and the way he pronounces six. You can imagine these two getting jammed. The PC, for some reason or other, always thinks the auditor is saying five when he's saying six, and six when he's say-ing five. What do you think's going to happen in R3R, see?2 So therefore, it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible. That's where the R-factor comes in. Be comprehensible. Not only from standpoint of accent, but sense: the comprehen-sibility. Diction enters into this. I can see some university in the future teaching \"Auditing English, \" you see, or \"Auditing Speech. \" Actually, it'd be a big department, because you'd have to have the translation of all this stuff into German; you have a translation and then its enunciation in German – same factor would apply, don't you see? The same factor in Swed-ish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, all of this stuff. How do you audit these guys, you see? Well, all right. So you're going to have auditors perhaps from that country, but remember, they will have the same frailties of pronunciation. How about translation of line plots, what line plots actually sum up into. Some of these countries don't have good terminology to follow through on a line plot. And yet the line plot will only fire on the right terminology. Don't you see, there's a lot of stuff to be worked out on this particular factor. But there's stuff to be worked out on it right now. An auditor who is not comprehended by the PC isn't doing his TR 1 right. And there-fore the R-factor is very germane to whether the communication cycle can take place at all. And if you say \"Do fish...?\" You can't do that. Do you see that nothing happens and no com-munication cycle takes place at all? So the R-factor can do a complete wipeout. Interesting, isn't it? Then you have the PC who doesn't want to be audited. He doesn't want to be audited at all. Well, how on earth can you start that one going? Because you've got to have a communi-cation cycle before you can even put an R-factor in. See, that's worse end to. He just won't listen to any part of Scientology. This is not a speech defect, but actually requires a lower-level process which gets him to talk about Scientology anyhow. We used to have one, \"Well, tell me why you shouldn't be audited.\" Tricky kind of an approach of this particular character. This is all very feasible. But this comes under the heading of getting a communication cycle started, and the auditor is very often confronted by that. So there is something which actually is prior to the communication cycle, see, and that you are very often happy to see exists. And when it goes out the window, you very often are sitting there with your eyes popped – you don't know quite what to do. Well, the thing is, you can't get the communication cycle going.   2 Editor's note: At that time, part of R3R was dating, what means the auditor had to call out numbers."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 14 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 80 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, very often the R-factor is out – wildly. Or the affinity factor is out. The affinity factor is out because the PC is being very misemotional. Well, oddly enough, you can do an ARC Break Assessment today, and find the bypassed charge and use that to complete the communication cycle which you started and which wouldn't complete, because it is the gener-ated charge. And that was why I showed you, particularly, the expanded point of the V. What has happened there is inadvertently, one way or the other, the point of the V has gone awry. The auditor somehow or another or the PC somehow or another has restimulated a charge which has then not been originated either to the auditor or the PC. See, an overres-timulation has taken place there. It's quite easy to do. It's quite easy, though, to pick up these days. So, these ARC Break Assessments is [are] a pilot of completing the communication cycle and getting the auditing cycle going again. See how that fits in? All right. Now, that's all very well to talk about the auditing cycle and say that's just all there is to the auditing cycle, but there's (I mentioned a moment ago) the repetitive audit-ing cycle. This cycle going over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, is a specialized activity. There's an auditing cycle of one cycle and then there is the auditing cycle of the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle, see? That's a different thing – doing it many times. You get your repetitive process, and this is where that gets you in trou-ble. There is a point where this over-and-over-again gets you in trouble. You must, you absolutely must, complete a communication – all communication cy-cles of an auditing cycle. Therefore, you must complete an auditing cycle. But you must also differentiate the difference between one auditing cycle and the repetitive auditing cycle. And why must you generate this difference? It's because one auditing cycle must be completed, and a repetitive auditing cycles are very often overdone, and don't need to be completed in some cases. There's a difference. Ooohh, where am I leading you now? You will say, \"What's this? What's this? You mean you don't flatten a process?\" Yes, you always flatten a process. But some auditor can get so eager-beaver with his series – which is flatten the process, see – that he forgets why he is flattening the process. And that is your dominant cycle – is ability regained. Why are you auditing the person in the first place? To do an auditing cycle? To do a series of auditing cycles, known as repetitive cycles, so that you can get a flattened process? Now, you say, \"Well, you're doing that to flatten the tone arm action.\" No, that's right there with repetitive auditing cycle; that belongs right there with repetitive auditing cycle, don't you see? There is something that dominates all of this; there's a greater domination. I'll show you what these points are. This will intrigue you; I don't think perhaps many of you have ever looked at this before. [begins to draw the fourth graph] Here's your big cy-cle, which is major cycle. See, that's a major auditing cycle. And its proper name is Ability Regained. Ha. I can see some of you now. You're auditing engrams like mad and you hit this key engram and you hit the thing and you all of a sudden got an OT on your hands, and the fellow gets up and stretches and that sort of thing, and he's getting all ready to square away, and he's wondering what he should do with the body, and – you know? He's all set and you're going"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 15 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 81 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST on: \"All right. What is the duration of this engram?\" Well, that's just too much dedication to this next cycle, see? And this you can call the Process Cycle – Process Auditing Cycle. This, of course, is just your single auditing cycle. Your progress of case is up, like this, see? Now, if you don't have your single cycle down, then of course you can't do a repetitive cycle. Can't do a repeti-tive auditing cycle, you can't flatten the process, in other words, you see? Now, a process is flattened by tone arm action out, no comm lag left, or cognition – I'll draw you a picture of these things – or ability regained. [begins to draw fifth graph] Now, you understand, we're going here from the Process Cycle to this Ability Regained cycle, you un-derstand? We're going just between those two. You understand here, that if you can't do a single cycle, then it's certain that you're not going to be very successful in completing any process auditing cycle – which is the repetitive cycles – and if you can't do this, then you cer-tainly are not going to produce the upper one of ability regained. See? That's obvious. But what is a flat process cycle? You sometimes come a cropper on this and don't real-ize what you're coming up against. Now, three equal commands – this is the lousiest one, see? Three equal commands. That's smelly, but you say the process is flat, see? Safe to leave it. Well, you'd better leave it at the CCHs, otherwise your PC is going to start being unhappy. But remember that they must be confidently done, or something like that. You can't have \"He screamed three times,\" you see? You very often – you'd be surprised – you very often have this question asked of you. You have some HPA student sometime saying, \"Well, but he was angry the same way for three different commands, so therefore the process was flat.\" Now, your next level up here – your next level – is a more interesting level from a standpoint of that, but it's perfectly safe to flatten it on a cognition. Guy gets a cognition: \"Oh, yes!\" see? Even a minor cognition, do you understand? That's not a major cognition; that's, you know, minor cognition – he had a win. \"Hey, well, what do you know! That's why ele-phants fly.\" You know, that's all set. Hasn't too much to do with the process, but you sort of stop the process at that point. The PC is not going to suffer. You understand that these first two levels that I'm talking to you about, of \"How do you flatten a process?\" are just – oh, that's awful shabby sort of a way to look at the thing, but that's just the minimum. That's the minimum security. Now let's get to the real one, which is TA Flat – flat by TA. That's your auditing cy-cles, repetitive auditing cycles, and you no longer have TA action on it here, don't you see? And up above this – and there are two levels of this, to make it better – is a Major Cognition. You'll see that sometimes. You'll see that sometimes. That takes precedence. You haven't got the TA flat, but all of a sudden he cognites all of the level is flat you're running. You'll see him go pow! pow! pow! – off the meter. You've got – \"failure to scream\" was the level you were running, \"about cats.\" And he says, \"Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! We used to mock up these forty-mile-high cats and yeah – oh, well, what the hell! Yeah!\" And you see the meter blow down and bang and everything goes to hell. You try to run this proc-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 16 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0 82 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST ess again. He hasn't got any level there left to run. In fact, continuing the process after one of those things is invalidation of the PC. Now, this is Ability Regained and that takes precedence over all of these. This guy couldn't walk and you're halfway through this and you haven't got the TA flat and so forth and he hasn't had any cognition you're thinking about and your processing cycle's a repetitive cy-cle, and all of a sudden the PC says, \"Hey, what do you know!\" you know? And he throws the electrodes down sideways and he gets up and starts walking, you know? \"Eh! Yeah, I can do it!\" Good, are you going to flatten the process now? [laughter] You may think I'm pointing out something ridiculous, but you do this quite often. You spoil it. You've got to know when to cut and run. See what I mean? What you got coming right up is you're all of a sudden going to make an OT – and continue to flatten the process. Now, let's look at this, then. This single cycle – you got to have that one down cold, and there's no doubt about that! Got to be able to complete that. You got to be able to com-plete it repetitively, time after time again, and that's for flattening out a process. And the thing which takes dominance over that, of course, is you flatten out the process until you run into the ability regained. Now, sometimes you don't run into an ability regained and you go on and flatten the process, and have to do another process before you regain the ability, don't you see? Some-times you have to flatten a lot of these before you get up to that. Sometimes you halfway flat-ten one and you're suddenly up to it. You see, but I'm just talking about auditing cycles – re-petitive auditing cycles – and where they're aiming toward. You're aiming toward always get-ting this one completed, but the only thing that interrupts it, in any single cycle, is a cognition. Similar to repetitive cycles, ability regained – a single auditing cycle that you are doing runs into a cognition. What do you do in a case like that? Well, you don't spoil the cognition by completing the auditing cycle. You can start another auditing cycle, if it is necessary to do so. To that degree, to those modifications, these other things must be pushed through to the bitter end. All right. Well, I've given you the dope on this. I imagine that you find this somewhat intriguing. It's a better look, perhaps, than we have had at it. I've been meaning to get around to it for some time, actually, and I've been breaking it down myself so that it could be talked about better. And you're seeing here a bit of gain; this isn't something which I've known all the time and so forth and so on. But I have been studying this ability regained in relationship to finishing a whole series of auditing cycles, and then I started breaking down the single au-diting cycle in its communication cycles and got it into a more communicable form. And I think you'll find this very useful, both in teaching people and in auditing, yourself. I wish you luck. Just go on and audit. Don't try to make me guilty by suddenly knock-ing the ball into the rough because you've lost the grip. Okay.

The only changes which you get in curriculum and so forth is the change in W, which has been in a state of flux anyway. And the definition of an auditor is being used in W – and I have found some new ways of milking down a tone arm, getting the bestest and mostest out of that tone arm; getting that tone arm to really wiggle and wobble. That's very important. And this piece of technology is hand in glove and it all goes back to very basic simplicities. Every once in a while somebody says... And this lecture does concern this definition of an auditor; I'm not going to talk to you too much about the auditing cycle in this. Well, I am going to talk to you about its particular aspects and how an auditor handles it. Every once in a while somebody says, \"Well, why don't you...\" something or other, something or other, something or other – that's the crux of the situation – \"Why don't you change all administrative actions? Why don't you alter all Central Organizational lines?\" \"Why don't you...\" so forth. \"Why don't we change everything in the course?\" and so on. What they're dealing with is a problem they actually don't see the breadth and depth of. And that problem is this: The character of this planet and the population hereon makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet. Now, I'm not taking off from a failure point. The stress and thought and prevention and cure and this and that which you have to go into on this planet to get anything done and running is absolutely fantastic."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 2 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 88 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, you want to ask why this is? Well, we can go into that in a moment. But those of you who have on the backtrack an experience of you just get some guys together and you do something – you see? Well, that's been a common experience, and you still tend to operate in that zone and sphere of influence. In other words, you said, \"Well, it was very easy. We just whistle up Joe, Bill and Pete, and the four of us will go down there and fix up the signboards, and that'll take care of that,\" see? And you're all set, see? But that was yesteryear and elsewhere. And you apply that basic feeling to this planet and you're in trouble at once. Why? This planet is part of a larger federation – was part of an earlier federation and passed out of its control due to losses in war and other such things. Now, this larger confederacy – this isn't its right name, but we have often called it and re-ferred to it in the past as the Marcab Confederacy. And it has been wrongly or rightly pointed to as one of the tail stars of the Big Dipper, which is the capital planet of which this planet is. Now, all this sounds very space operaish and that sort of thing, and I'm sorry for it, but I am not one to quibble about the truth. This gets in people's hair every now and then, and I don't see any point in lying in order to be acceptable. It just doesn't seem to be a right way to go about things, particularly in the realm of science. I don't think a scientist should tell a bunch of scientific (quote, unquote) lies in order to be an acceptable scientist. It doesn't seem to me to be a sensible proceeding. However, be that as it may, these various planets united into a very vast civilization which has come forward up through the last two hundred thousand years, is formed out of the fragments of earlier civilizations. Now, I can't tell you accurately, exactly what these blokes are up to or where they're from, but this isn't quite germane to this galaxy. That's the first thing you should know about it; it isn't quite native to your track. You find a type of mental implanting and that sort of thing going on here in the last couple of hundred thousand years which are not native to your earlier track. Now, this is all very important; it's very important, because they have a terrible prob-lem. They have the problem of people who are native to this galaxy and aren't used to this kind of thing, and they have the basic problem of \"How do you kill a thetan?\" And that's a terrible problem to men who have very, very guilty consciences and blood on their hands – great problem. Probably the best way to hide your overts is to give somebody amnesia, you see (then they don't know what you've done to them), and then tell them something else has happened. Well, this is a dramatization of a very craven intelligence, and that is what is going on here. Now, the fellow who conforms to that society is in no vast trouble. Perhaps some bloke who has a military record against them, and that sort of thing, might possibly (no matter what he did) find himself unable to satisfactorily conform. But the point is that their ideal is the conformist. Now, these conformists are pretty weird, and the personnel of that particular society is pretty scummy, to say the least. Let's supposing you were in the last shambling wreckages of a red-light district: you'd have high-toned personnel, compared to the personnel which makes up the other planets I'm talking to you about. High-toned personnel, much higher toned than their average run. They practice cannibalism.

All that kind of stuff – that's all out of this zone and area. We're still with that planetary system. So, they specialize in the fellow who will conform. Now, he ordinarily is a \"worker\" who is content to draw wages and not do another single, blessed thing – you know, never really get up, improve his lot, you see, and keep on plugging along somehow, or even slump into indigence. He's still their choice of personnel. So this leaves, this leaves the brilliant art-ist, the brilliant engineer, the manager, the genius, the criminal, the pervert, non persona grata. And they sentence these people – the upper class (that is to say, the brighter gent) be-cause they can't control him and they're afraid of him, and the lower class because it's too vi-cious even for them – and they condemn these people to perpetual amnesia. \"Dead forever,\" they call it – the problem of killing a thetan – and wrap them up in mothballs and ship them down here, and here we are. And that is the population of this planet. All right. Here's a population, then, of minimal workers, maximal managers, artists, geniuses, criminals and perverts. What you going to make out of this lot, huh? Now, those are the blokes you're talking to when you say \"Add up the left-hand col-umn of the ledger.\" Well, of course, the artist says he could add it up much more prettily. The guy who actually, in his own right, was a very skilled manager, he says he could devise a much better system – it's true, too; he probably could. If the bird is a criminal, he's just sitting there trying to figure out how he can add it up so he can short you. And there's your zone of operation; there is your response to 8-C in trying to get an organization running. It's all alter-is, because the basic crime was nonconforming. The basic crime wasn't being a criminal; the basic crime was not conforming. Well, actually, this group has gone ahead and made up, up until recent times, a totally different civilization than the civilization which planted it here. In the last ten thousand years, they have gone on with a sort of a decadent, kicked-in-the-head civilization that contains automobiles, business suits, fedora hats, telephones, spaceships – quite interesting, but a civi-lization which looks an almost exact duplicate, but is worse off than the current US civiliza-tion. Therefore, you find the current US and Western civilization rather restimulative, be-cause it has moved up to look like the Marcabian civilization. It's been moving up here rather rapidly. And now we're at a point, a very high level of restimulation, because the automobile design, the train design, ship design (why, they've got ships in those areas, look just like the Queen Mary, you see?), and the fire engines and the stuff you do with men's clothes particularly – all of these things are the same image. So you're going into a highly restimulative era, because we've not had this before. See? We've been moving up through strata of civilization, but we hadn't matched this one. And remember that this society at the present time looks dangerous; it looks very dangerous. One of the highest crimes you could pull in that Marcabian society, probably even to-day, is income tax; you make one comma wrong and it's \"dead forever.\" Sounds weird, does-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 4 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 90 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST n't it? So, they got everybody paying income tax – awful restimulative. Probably nothing much wrong with income tax if it were administered as a tax, but it isn't; it's administered as a punishment, even on this planet today. Well, it's one of their prime punishments in the Mar-cabian civilization. All of this adds up to what? An era, going on right now, of highly restimulative asso-ciations in the civilization, and therefore a high-felt level of danger. People feel like they are in danger. Scientologists, every once in a while, hearing me talk like this, feel even more in danger. They say, \"Boy, those guys are liable to land here tomorrow,\" you know? Of course, I pull this every once in a while. Diana suddenly appeared on my right side last night while eating dinner (and I didn't even know she was in the room, you see?), and just out of the corner of my eye, I saw a pair of white spots that looked like the spats a spaceman uses, you know? And for a split second I said, \"Well, here they are,\" you know? [laughs, laughter] But anyway, you should realize that the material on the between-lives area has been much more broadly circulated than any of our material is now, because it was laid down the line in all directions, to the most unlikely places (including Russia), and was contained in the book What to Audit and other materials, and that was 1951 and 52. I consider that's interest-ing, because let me point out to you, that's eleven or twelve years ago and there hasn't been a ripple. I just want to point that out to you as an interesting point. No, gents of this character who have a system worked out this way would – the last thing in the world they'd do would be blow their own game, see? All they'd have to do is land one spaceship, and they feel like everybody would go into a convulsion of suddenly remem-bering everything. And they do, do you know? Any rumor of the men from Mars or some-thing like that and this planet goes into a total convulsion. They produced Orson Welles's broadcast down in Quito (I think it was), Ecuador, and – the radio station there, I think a seventeen-story building or large building, or whatever the figures were on it – and mobs tore that building to pieces and killed seventeen people in the process. They practically slaughtered the staff of that radio station. In other words, they went mad. So they know that great riots are attended by this, but a landing in force without any equivocation that it had been a landing of some type, or like this, would be liable to restore everybody's memory. I think that's what they feel. Whether this is true or not, we couldn't worry less. But here you are; that is the point. Here you are; that is this planet. Every once in a while you get mad at government on this planet, when in actual fact you're mad at the Marcabian government. And there's a great deal of confusion. Every once in a while somebody will get awfully furious with an organization, very furious with an organi-zation here on this planet, when they have actually identified the organization with the Mar-cabian civilization. Now, you start hitting people here with restimulative materials of this particular type, and it restimulates a terrific unreality; it restimulates amnesia."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 5 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 91 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I have to ask you this: How hard do you have to hit somebody to bring about amnesia? Let's take Joe out here and let's just see how hard do we have to hit Joe in order to bring about amnesia on his part so he doesn't know who he is, where he is, or anything else. How hard would we have to hit him? Boy, that's pretty hard. It's almost unbelievable force is used to handle a thetan and put him into this kind of condition. I've been hit with some awful heavy force in this universe without losing my mind or forgetting who I am, see? So it's pretty heavy duress. And you restimulate that very easily by telling people things. It gets awful unreal. But you would find, if you gave them the actual dope, that they would be far more in agreement with you than if you gave them just a touch of the dope, do you see? You won't find the citizens of this planet very far in disagreement with what you're doing. So, therefore, you've got some kind of an explosion going. Well, these guys are not going to blow their own show. See? They're not going to do anything peculiar about it. They've probably got us all sized up, if they know anything about us at all. They probably have some dim idea of what we're doing, and saying, \"Oh, yes. Ho-hum.\" And give the devil his due: They might even say, \"Well, hey, what do you know? Those guys might be producing a type of technology which we ourselves desperately need.\" Look at that. See, now, they know the problems exist. They couldn't have had any decent solution, or they wouldn't have taken the route to solution which they have. They are beings, too; re-member that. So when we look at all this: you are (1) organizationally handling people who are revolutionaries. They are nonconformists. Probably the common denominator of this planet is revolution. Probably the one thing you could always start on this planet would be a revolu-tion, because it's a state of perpetual revolution. Trying to hold any organization together of any kind whatsoever becomes almost impossible, because everybody you're dealing with is a nonconformist. All right. So far goes the civilization. There are just those few statements on the thing I thought you might find of interest. We're dealing now with \"What is an auditor?\" You are handling, therefore, the roughest case that you could find in the universe, be-cause the rehabilitation of the individual demands that you rehabilitate his knowingness. If his knowingness does not increase independently, he himself does not get well. You see, electri-cal charge on the case is simply a symptom that measures his knowingness. If he's got too much charge, his knowingness is way down. See, that's an indirect measure of the amount of knowingness of the individual. And as the case moves along up the line, you get an odd factor. You get an odd factor: This case continues progressively to remember more. Now, one of the things the case recov-ers is picture memory, remembering by pictures. \"I have a picture of, so therefore I was.\" See, you can call that a picture memory and that goes from a terrific unreality on it down to a pretty good certainty on it. So a person at that stage of the game – an advanced stage of the game in inspecting his own pictures – can tell the difference between a false picture and an"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 6 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 92 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST actual picture that has something to do, really, with him on his track. And as his knowingness increases, he can tell you where it belongs and what date it has and so on. In other words, he can spot it, bang! That's an increased knowingness. It's knowingness that is increasing all the way along the line. Now, from picture memory, the individual graduates up to simply knowing. Now, right now, you don't have to get a picture of where you are living to know where you live. You see that? You don't have to get a picture of your name to know what your name is. In other words, you know this. Well, so does knowingness increase as the case improves, and that knowingness increases up the line to a point where you know who you have been and where you have been, independent of any created evidence or cross-proof. You simply know. And that factor is a very slow factor to rise; it's not a rapid factor. Under present auditing, yes, it is rapid, but that is all within a framework of hundreds of hours, don't you see? Now, I'll give you an idea – an idea of this. For instance, I know – I know where I was and who I was – I know dimly – pardon me, I know with good certainty, who I was and where I was in the last eighty trillion years. See, I know that; that's not much of an argument with me. But the small details of that are liable to go fritter-fritter here and there. You know, what did I have for breakfast two trillion years ago? No. Nix, man. Nah. Did I even eat, you see? That sort of thing is getting pretty dim. But now, over the top of that, which is an identity knowingness – which comes before a detail knowingness, you see; between your picture knowingness and your total knowingness is this stage of just knowing your identity – why, then, this detail knowingness starts to come up and follow in on this smaller basis. And one of your gains on it: you'll know why you were here. You'll have tangled with it in session and that sort of thing, and you'll have picked data out of pictures. And all at once, it will just get – more and more you know why you were here. You know how you got here. You know what you were doing ten thousand years ago, do you see? You know what was happening 11,025 years ago, don't you see? You – no pictures in-volved; you just know it. And that is the restoration of the beingness of the person, and I have given you (in a very crude way here) a cycle of that restoration of beingness. His beingness returns to him gradually, bit by bit. Perhaps the lowest edge of it is something on the idea of \"Maybe I pos-sibly could know who I was,\" you know? \"Possibly I could know what I am doing here, or I might even be able to know who I am.\" Just some sort of a feeling like one might be able to know. And that crawls up forward to a picture knowingness, and the unreality of those pic-tures at first is fabulous. So that anybody shows you any kind of a picture, man, any kind of a picture, that is – must be yours, and therefore you must have been there. They could show you a picture of an airplane falling apart and you at once say, \"Well, I must have been in that airplane falling apart.\" And later on you suddenly realize, \"Hell, I'm looking at that airplane from two miles away. What am I doing looking at it from two miles away?\" This dawns on you after a while. Your valence problem all of a sudden comes up; it hits you in the face, whether you're coaxed to do it by the auditor or not. \"I'm in that airplane, see, over there, two miles away,\" see? \"So, therefore, I must have had an awful fall.\""},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 7 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 93 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST And it turns out, eventually – you'd begin to see this thing – you say, \"Hey, wait a minute. I couldn't have been in that airplane. It was somebody I shot down; maybe it's some-body I did this with.\" And then you'll finally say, \"Well, shucks. That thing is just a false pic-ture. That isn't my picture at all.\" And then whatever picture of yours is holding it in sus-pense, that picture suddenly peels off the front of it like a badly painted chromo, and pshew! and your own picture is right behind it. And you say, \"Oh, yerp! there I was,\" and you're in valence. That various cycle of recognition takes place in this picture line. But what does it take, then, to bring about such a total amnesia? Let's look at that: What does it take to bring about such a total amnesia? I was riding a spaceship down one day. Side gaskets of the tubes blew out on one side and wiped out the engine-room crew. I went in to drag them out just at the moment when the whole backblast of the rockets moved front-wards through the engine room, and got hit square in the face and managed to crawl out of the place. The ship went into the atmosphere, melted and crashed. And a couple of minutes or, oh, a couple of seconds after it hit, all of its fuel went up and hit me in the face. And I lost my memory; I lost my memory. It took me quite a while, sitting down very quietly, to remember where base was. And I sat there and figured and figured and figured. Actually, I'd sent some people back to come and pick up the wreckage and so forth, and I was pretty foggy. And very shortly, I snapped out of it. You know, \"Of course!\" you know? But just – how much force is force? Well, this is the type of scout craft which has the engines of a battle cruiser all packed into a very tight spot, you see, and all of it red-hot fuel. Cape Canaveral has got nothing like the amount of force one of those things can deliver, don't you see? And to get all of that square in your thetan puss twice, and get confused about where base was. Got the idea? And how much force has it taken to destroy somebody's memory? It's interesting. An interesting point, isn't it? Well, that's how much force you've been subjected to. Otherwise you wouldn't have a case. I'm not trying to make you afraid of force. You get up to a point after a while as a thetan – force-smorce, who cares? I had a funny feeling the other day. I didn't quite feel up to diving into the sun. I just didn't feel up to it; I didn't feel it would be a healthy thing for me to do just now. I felt weak. And I felt the interactive forces of the sun, and I felt sort of drawn a little bit toward the sun, and I said, \"No.\" I sort of did a suppress and looked the other way. I just didn't feel like taking a sun bath today. You get the idea, you know? You feel queasy. Too much force – too much force. Well now, that force, of course, has to be combined with trickery, and the trickery is mostly scrambling somebody's dates and giving them opposite, opposing items that can sus-pend in time, so that the scrambled dates will suspend in time. You get the combinations; you know them in our various technologies. But let's not move away from the point into the trickery of it; it does require the force. Force. How much force does it take to destroy the memory of a being? Well, that's how much force an auditor is getting off a case. And of course you'd much rather get off unknowingness and oddities and oddball things; you'd much rather, because they're easier to confront than raw force. And they're easier for the pc to confront, too."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 8 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 94 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Therefore, you say, \"What have you done?\" And your pc said, \"Well, I had a hostile thought about you the other day. I thought you really should do your hair up in back.\" Oh, good – we've got a big withhold off. You get the gentle pat-a-cake that you will sometimes see in auditing sessions. The proper auditing response, of course, is \"Well, thank you very much,\" and so forth. And O/W is a bit different than other brands of auditing. You say, \"What have you done, done, done?\" And if you work very, very hard, you can get a done in all these thinks. You see, behind all these critical thinks is a done, is an actual action. And you can listen to critical thinks till the cow comes home, and you will never get anybody raised up the line, until you've found an actual action. That is the secret of all Sec Checking, and that is where people fall down in Sec Checking. Now, why do they fall down? Well, it's much easier to confront this random little think than it is the energy contained in a done. Do you see that? Therefore, the mission of an auditor is the restoration of a person's awareness, which includes his memory, his knowingness of himself and so forth. Restoration of awareness. What is holding down that awareness? What is holding down this knowingness? What is sit-ting on this knowingness? Well, you can say trickery and force, but it is force used with trick-ery, so that an individual will get an ARC break with force and then become the effect of force. So you're handling, in actual fact, somebody who has lots of ARC breaks with other beings, matter, energy, space, time and location and form. That is in direct definition: this person is out of comm, out of affinity and out of reality with matter, energy, space, time, loca-tion, other beings and form. Now, that's the pc. So what's an auditor? So what's an auditor? Well, an auditor has to be somebody who can release this tremendously involved force, somebody who can release this force from the pc. Obviously, if it's a deranged force which is bringing about the amnesia of the pc, then the auditor, to get a return of memory of the pc, has to be capable of alleviating and removing that force. I mean, that's simple. Simple. Elementary, my dear Watson. On your E-Meter you have a tone arm. Force is removing itself from the case as long as that tone arm is in motion. And the wiggle-waggle of the tone arm as the pc is being au-dited tells you that force is being relieved from the case. When you start to remove force that is aberrated by some trickery, your tone arm hangs up until the trickery is resolved, you know, wrong date or something like that – and your tone arm action is restored. All of these things are all cared for in the processes and technologies of auditing. But if that TA isn't moving, you will never make an OT. That's just it. Now, you oddly enough do not have to run a process, sometimes, to get the TA mov-ing. Providing the TA is moving – providing the TA is moving and you get good motion out of your tone arm – a person will eventually go Operating Thetan. Providing you can keep the tone arm moving, the person will eventually go Operating Thetan. If the tone arm is not mov-ing, the person will not go Operating Thetan and the case may even deteriorate."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 9 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 95 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Let's just run this case on and on. The case can run an engram, and so you keep run-ning engrams, engrams, engrams, engrams, and the tone arm is stuck right up here at some-where in the vicinity of 5. And there it sticks at 5, and you go on and audit and audit and au-dit; and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5. Uh-hah – you're never going to make an Operating Thetan. Now, if you run the right significances off the case and produce tone arm action, you make an OT much quicker. But you can get tone arm action without running the right signifi-cances. Get this syllogism here? And you can run the right significances without getting tone arm action. Oh, well, you can run R3R on somebody who can't handle R3R, and you can run all the right significances and not get into tone arm action; you're not going to make an OT. Now, let me go over this again now and you'll see where you sit with regard to a tone arm. If you just keep a tone arm moving on the pc long enough, regardless of how and what you're auditing on the case, the case will eventually make OT. But if you run the right signifi-cances – if you run the right significances – and don't get any tone arm action, you're not go-ing to make an OT. You got that now? This is terribly important. Now, it might take thousands and thousands of hours just to randomly keep this tone arm moving on the pc. And lots of pcs can talk forever, you know, without getting any tone arm action. But if you could keep that TA moving, you'd eventually get OT. So you say, then, that a moving tone arm is slightly senior to the right significance. Now, this is right down to bedrock on the subject of auditing. Your job is to keep the TA moving. Now, what's this TA doing? The TA is indicating the blowing off of force. That is a measure of the amount of encysted force which is leaving the case – the amount of encysted force leaving the case. You've got a measure of it right there. It goes up and down, and it measures the amount of force which is going. Now, of course, you don't do this arithmetically or mathematically. I imagine some-day, one of these days, why, we will. We'll set up a project that measures some guy from scratch, right straight through to the end, shows the exact number of motions of the TA on every process or type of process that is run on the person, and these are all added together. And we say there's this many hundred million ergs of energy were released, and at the end of that line we had an OT. But that is in essence what you're doing; you're blowing the force, because the more force is blown off the case the less amnesia the case has. Does it make sense to you now? Audience: Yes. Force created the amnesia and you got to blow it to get rid of the amnesia. Now, there's an interesting one-for-one. Now, the amount of time in processing, the amount of time in processing is enor-mously speeded up if you run the right significances, because you're running the force off early track, and you start to get force release which you don't see on the meter. Now, let's not"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 10 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 96 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST say that if the tone arm isn't moving, it's all okay; the tone arm is also moving when this hap-pens. I was sitting down in session one day, and I could feel – I could feel energy masses disintegrating clear out to Arcturus. It sure wasn't registering on the meter. If it had, there wouldn't have been any more of an E-Meter here; there'd have just been charred wire. You get the idea? It was blowing off all over the place. Every once in a while we'll get a blowdown phenomenon. Well, when you see that blowdown, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew – I'm talking about a repetitive down, see? You can see that needle go pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew; it just keeps doing it, and your tone arm is drifting lower and lower and lower. You're watching a remote force area blow up. Now, if all this force blew up against the pc's face and the pc's body, he wouldn't have any more body than a rabbit. It's pretty hard to do research auditing and keep a body over you. It is, because you make one little mistake here and another mistake there and chew into a GPM someplace else, the next thing you know, there goes this and there goes that, and your right ear looks like a pretzel. Anyhow, the point I'm making here is that your force measured through the E-Meter is only a part of the force which is blowing off the case. But if any force is blowing off the case, you have an additional movement of the tone arm. So if a tone arm is moving you're blowing force, and if a tone arm is not moving you're not blowing force. And that's all you have to know about it. Now, there are several significances that can keep a tone arm from moving, such as wrong time and an ARC break situation where the pc is out of comm and a few things like this. But we're not now discussing the no-motion tone arm; we're discussing a motion tone arm. Therefore it is of great interest to an auditor, then, to make that tone arm move. And to make it move all he can make it move. And your most fundamental method of making a tone arm move is not running a process. It is the basic definition of an auditor: a listener. The basic way to let a tone arm – get a tone arm move is to listen, and that is the fundamental of audit-ing. Now, somebody could probably talk for a thousand years and never say the right things, and you wouldn't get any tone arm motion. But, similarly, how many pcs talk and get tone arm motion from doing so and are shut up or cut off by the auditor? Ha-ha-ho-ho-ho. Now, there is an inhibition of blowing clear. The auditor is not then doing his job; an auditor is setting up a barrier to blowing mass. And you'll find out the pc winds up at the end of the session stupider. At the end of session, he can remember less than he could remember at the beginning of session. Why? Well, you've done something with the force. You have moved it out of the bank and dumped it on the thetan's head. Oh, it'll destimulate; it'll go out of restimulation and all that sort of thing. The basic definition of an auditor is: to listen. He's a listener. His basic job is to listen, not to restimulate."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 11 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 97 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST All right. Now, we stand around and we say, \"Well, the Marcabians are gonna get you tomorrow, man, and the size of the between-lives-area screen is 180 feet by 9 feet,\" and so forth. And people sit there and they go dzzzz. That's doing what? That's charging them up, isn't it? That's charging them up. Well, actually, they talk it over, one with another, and usu-ally blow the charge. It's not a grave matter; it's not a difficult matter at all. Their knowingness increases, and they feel all right about it and so forth. Well, we get away with that. Why? Because we can talk to one another about it, that's why. The only method of blowing reactive charge is by a communication line – there is no other method – by a com-munication line. I think that's very interesting. Here's the auditor, and he's supposed to listen. And the only way the pc can possibly get rid of the charge is blow it by the communication line. Now, this doesn't mean, oddly enough, that he's blowing it at the auditor. He isn't blowing it at the auditor. But that he can communicate it does cause it to dissipate, and it doesn't hit either the auditor or the pc. If the auditor wants to get hit by the charge, he should put up a barrier to prevent it from blowing, and the pc has an ARC break; and the next thing you know, the auditor is hit by the charge. You can set up a situation whereby the auditor is hit by the charge, but only if he stops the charge. How do you get rid of charge? Now, get what I just said. How do you get rid of charge? I didn't say how do you handle charge, restimulate charge or anything like that: just how do you get rid of it? Listen. That's how you get rid of it. Listen. Elementary, my dear Watson. Now, all therapies since time immemorial have consisted of listening – one way or the other. He is a sympathetic person, and people tell their troubles to him and very often feel a lot better. Well, all of that is very well, and you can add that up to a short-circuited look at auditing, but remember, this factor entered in: was the pc, or was the patient, talking with tone arm action? Oh, that's the difference. Or was the pc just nattering or was the pc lying or some-thing? You let a pc sit there and lie, or a patient sit there and lie for a while, and you're going to have one of the stuckest tone arms you ever wanted to see. So that is the essence of the thing. An auditor is somebody who listens with tone arm action. That's the difference. But remember, the fundamental of all mental activities was lis-tening. Prayer is based on \"God will hear me.\" And if there's no OTs around, who is going to hear him? Actually, the lama got so disgusted with this that he put all of his praying on auto-matic; he puts them on a little wheel. He can turn the wheel and it goes brrrrrrp and a thou-sand prayers go up, and he's got that cared for. And I'll bet you his tone arm, it didn't move a bit. [laughter] So an auditor has the job, and auditing consists, of restimulating a charge (that's the auditing command received by the pc) and then letting the pc blow the charge that is restimu-lated on the return communication line. Simple, isn't it? I'll draw you a picture of this thing. You needn't take a very accurate copy of this because this is an HCOB (I think 4 August), and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 12 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 98 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I'm having it squared around. But I'll draw you this thing. Here's cause-distance-effect. That is a communication cycle. And here is the auditor and here is the pc. The auditor utters an audit-ing command, and it goes across this distance and hits something. What's it hit? The pc? No, it hits the reactive bank, that accumulated mass of force which the pc is packing around that is always kicking his head in. And we get what is known as restimulation at this point. There we are; we get a restim. There's the living lightning. Pow! goes the auditing command. We know this guy is very sensitive to snakes, so the auditor says, \"Recall a snake.\" Pow! See? Bang! Well, now, of course if we're in some kind of a weird situation whereby we're fighting the pc, why, we're not restimulating the bank. We're just trying to get the pc to fight us or something like that; we're not – it hasn't anything to do with auditing. Just forget that. The auditor's address actually is to the reactive bank, and he says, \"Recall a snake.\" Bow! Now we get a communication line: bank-distance-effect. And here we have the pc – thetan. And the pc says, \"Hey, what do you know! There is a snake in there.\" And he goes: cause-distance-effect, and that's the end of that. This line must follow in, to take care of the charge restimulated in your first line. Cause-distance-effect: that's the auditing command. Bow! There's the charge. He re-calls the snake. Boom! It starts to hit the thetan and the thetan recognizes it, knows what it is and imparts that information on his cause-distance-effect line, back to the auditor. And there goes auditing. Your cycle then occurs, and the charge is blown. And you see it reacting on the E-Meter as blown. These are not all the communication cycles there are in an auditing cycle, but this doesn't happen to be a lecture on that. I'm showing the principal action of these basic lines. Now, remember that life is always giving him commands that restimulates things – here at E, on the pc. This is our old PTP and other things of that character. If you don't believe that, put in your \"since\" mid ruds on the pc and see how superior your tone arm action is. Usually get marvelous tone arm action on \"since\" mid ruds unless the pc is protesting them and wants to get on with the session. And you get marvelous tone arm action. Well, that's just the restimulated charge that's been slapped at him out of this mucked-up bank that he is gratuitously handed, in full restimulation with much added force, in every between-lives session he's had with the little boys elsewhere. He's trying to blow that charge. So he comes into session, and he sometimes will sit there and talk to you for quite a while; and the tone arm would just move and move and move and move. He's getting rid of the be-tween-sessions charges. Interesting, isn't it? You notice, after he's talked for fifteen, twenty minutes sometime – even somebody who has had a big upset on the thing, you've got in your \"since\" mid ruds (or you haven't got-ten in your \"since\" mid ruds), you notice that your tone arm action dies down. And then sud-denly, mysteriously, the pc is in-session. What's happened? You've emptied this reservoir of restimulation which life has handed him, restimulated in him during the session – between sessions, you see? And you've"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 13 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 99 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST emptied that thing out. Now, you want to know why your pc doesn't go into session some-times. Well, he's just – he's got a lot of restimulated charge that is all ready to fall back. Now, you've got \"Is it kinder to audit somebody one hour a week or twenty-five hours a week?\" Well, of course there is no comparison, because in the one hour you can't even get rid of life's restimulative action in this reservoir here at all, so you spend that one hour indif-ferently getting rid of three days of the week which you're trying to cover, don't you see? And it's a losing proposition. There's a make-break point in auditing where a person has to be au-dited enough to get rid of this charge which is being consistently and continually restimu-lated. Got that? Well now, this line here then – this lower line with the pc at cause answering this question back to the auditor, who in this case is at effect: then that line must have some sen-iority to the upper line. The auditor cause-distance-effect, then, is not quite as important as – they're both terribly important – but is not quite as important as the line, cause-distant-effect, to the pc. In other words, between the seniority of the two lines (both in the same order of magnitude), you'll find that the pc's line to the auditor is slightly more important than the auditor's line to the pc. And in this line of cause-distance-effect to the pc – in that line and an inspection of that line – you will find all auditing failures, providing any process at all that we have has been run. In other words, if a case was loused up by auditing, we don't inspect the process run as the first consideration. We inspect the tone arm as the consideration, because if you got good tone arm motion running that process, then that bottom line – the C-distance-E of the pc – was in. Now, we've had processes for years. It's true, our processes have to be very neat. They have to be very important. And they restimulate the exact amount of charge that then blows the outer bank charge and so forth, and it's all figured out very neatly. And on some pcs it's almost impossible to get tone arm action; and you have to know what stops tone arm action; you have to know all of these various things. But I'm now just talking about the fundamentals of auditing; and we inspect on a failed case the C–E (the C-distance-E) of the pc, not the process run. That's the first thing we'd in-spect: Was the auditor auditing? Now, anybody could sit there and say, \"Recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake.\" And the pc says, \"Well, I...\" \"Well, that's all right. Just don't bother with that. Recall a snake, recall a snake,\" and all of a sudden the pc is da-da, da-da-da, you know? And he's swamped. All right. What happens in a case like that? Well, this is very, very easy. This restimu-lation, when the pc puts it on this line, goes bang! straight back at the pc. Got it? When that line goes out, where else can it go? It's only got one place to go, and that's the pc. So whatever you restimulate in a pc comes home on the pc, unless it is picked up on the reverse communi-cation line."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 14 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 100 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, the penalties of this: the first symptom of the pc's cause-distance-effect line – the first symptom of its disappearance is a dirty needle. You can go down any line of auditors who are busy auditing, right down any line of auditors, and watch their meters. You don't even have to listen to them. You just see a dirty needle, bang! this line's out: the auditor isn't listening. The first definition of auditor is missing. Pc is saying, \"Well, that's a snake. I – snake – well, there was one in a zoo urm-uh-uh-urm. I think it was a zoo – there was one in a zoo...\" The auditor said, \"Okay! Thank you! Good! Good! Thank you! Thank you! Good! Re-call a snake.\" And the pc said, \"Well, um-sfla-sflassle hum. Yes, yes.\" \"Good! Good! Thank you!\" Got this nonsense? He's just backing up all the charge of the process on the pc. Ah, I see some of you have seen this happen. What occurs then? Well, frankly – frankly, in time, the C with the pc at cause-distance-effect line, in terms of time (the one here from the pc over to the auditor) may take upwards to a hundred times as much time in the session as the line C–E from the auditor. Oh! It only took three seconds to ask that question \"Recall a snake.\" And the pc says, \"Mmm\" and \"Mmm.\" He finally says, \"Was it in a zoo? I don't know. Zoo?\" and so on. What you're seeing is identification turning into differentiation. You're see-ing force and charge blow off. The pc is inspecting this thing. And the tone arm moves, and it keeps moving, it keeps moving; and the pc says, well, he doesn't know and so on. Was it a green snake or a blue snake? He's not quite sure if it was a green snake or a blue snake and so on. He can't recall a snake and so forth and so on. \"Snakes – nightmare about a snake – but was that recalling a snake? – if – I'm not quite sure on it. There was one down at the zoo when I was a little – yeah, yeah, I got one. Yeah. Yeah, it was a green snake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was one. Yeah. Houston Zoo. Yeah. Got it. Got one: a green snake at Houston Zoo, when I was eight. Ha-ha.\" And you will see the cycle of the blowing force on your meter (tone arm) accompany returning knowingness on the part of the pc. And the more you get that thing wobbling, the more positive the pc sounds. You just watch that, because that in itself is a little tiny proof of what I'm saying, is as you get the force off, the pc's knowingness comes back. And you can see it in one cycle. One auditing cycle: the pc says, \"Snake? My God. I'd never – oh, a snake, what snake? Where? What? Why? I'll – oh, so-sss – I'm – I guess there was. See, where do they keep – now, I just, why, yeah I was in a zoo at one time. Yeah, there are zoos. Let's see, now... so on and so on. Zoos, and I must have been in a zoo sometime or another. Zoos – when I was a little bo – well, they used to take me to a zoo when I was a little boy. The zoo – the snake house. Oh, yeah. There must have been one in the snake house and so forth. That – yeah, they had a glass, and so forth, see. Yeah. Yeah, I used to be fascinated by some cage in there. Let's"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 15 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 101 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST see, I can – I got – yeah. They – it was a glass-fronted ca – they had a green snake in there. Oh, I remember now. Yeah, I was eight. Yeah.\" Bing, bang! He knows! You've pulled him up all the way through the force that tells him he doesn't know, up to a point where he knows. And you think it winds up with his simply seeing the picture clearly. No, no, he goes all the way through the picture stage which I have just given you. You understand? Audience: Yes. Yeah. Now, these two lines have names, regardless of what they will be called on your – the comm cycles of your auditing cycles; they have numbers on the auditing cycle – but they have nice, colloquial names that you can remember very easily. And this is the whatsit line, and this is the itsa line. Now, the whatsit line is from the auditor to the pc, and the auditor is saying, \"What's it?\" He says, \"Recall a snake,\" you know? \"What's it?\" And the pc says fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble. He's looking for an itsa, see? \"It's a green snake, Houston Zoo.\" That's the itsa. And you'll see the tone arm blow down when he hits it, too. So your tone arm, then, follows this pattern; your tone arm follows this pattern. Here is your tone arm here – two tone arms. And here is (this is already in HCOB August 4) – here's your regular tone arm positions, and here is a nice solid arm, and here is a dotted arm; and here's an arrow showing the motion as up from 3 to 4, and that's a whatsit. You got that? We haven't quite determined the low-tone-arm case, but I think they run in reverse. But that's a whatsit; that's the upward throw of the tone arm. That's whatsit. The pc says, \"Let's see, snake, snake, wha-what-what-whatsa. Recall a snake. It's a – let's see – wha – .\" He's saying whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, see? And you'll see that tone arm go up. And then he'll get a little bit of an itsa, and you will see the tone arm go down. And your tone arm, dotted at 4, falling to solid at 3, and that's itsa. And you, frankly, can monitor a pc's tone arm on one question like mad. He has an ARC break with somebody, and he sees that there's some difference... some similarity, or he thinks maybe he knows somebody who looked like the person he had an ARC break with. This would be a research test. See, he sees – he knows now already that there's some similar incident earlier, that he's got this person associated with somebody he shouldn't have it asso-ciated with – got an identification going. And you say, \"Well, what reminded you\" – well, you don't even know who that earlier person is, see? but \"What reminded you (in the person you had the ARC break with), now, what reminded you of the person in the past?\" See? Whatsa. And you See that pc's tone arm go right up. You say, \"Whatsa?\" Tone arm goes up. The pc says figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure \"Was it his – was it his tie, his shirt? His – it's a – tie, shirt. Yup. Or is it – there some way he held – I think it was the way he must've held his head.\" Then you'll get an itsa. And it'll go right down: \"Yes, just think it was the way he held his head.\" And you say, \"Well, was there anything else?\" Whatsa? And it'll go right up. It goes right into the whatsit."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 16 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 102 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST And the pc says, \"Well, it could've been – it could've been the way – way he – way – the – he'd stand there, the kind of clothes he was wearing – must've been the kind of clothes he was wearing.\" Itsa. And down comes the tone arm. And you actually can sit there as an auditor and control the motion of the tone arm. You can control it. You can say \"Whatsa?\" and every time you give him a whatsa, you'll see it goes up. And make sure he gives you a full itsa. And then feed back in again another fragment of the whatsa, see? And up, up goes the tone arm again. And he gives you the itsa, and down comes the tone arm again. And you can just sit there and call your shots. (That's a research project; you normally wouldn't handle comm like that.) But you'll see it in running almost any process. When you say whatsa, up she goes. And you – he says itsa, and down she comes. So, you say \"What's it?\" to the pc, and you get the up arm. That charge is restimulated and unresolved, and that high tone arm shows you restimulated but unresolved charge. It's sitting there in the bullpen; it's sitting there in the res-ervoir, and it's going to hit somebody or something. And the pc plows through this charge that's been restimulated here, and he puts it over on this line and he says itsa. And if he's per-mitted to give you the itsa line, then the charge channels right – doesn't hit the auditor; it just disintegrates, see? And there it goes. Boom! It's gone. You see that? So auditing is a repetitive... the crudest auditing cycle is the whatsit – itsa; whatsit – itsa; whatsit – itsa. And of course it doesn't take any time to say whatsit, and sometimes takes quite a while to say itsa. So, consequently, this line is much more prone to be out than the upper line – than the whatsa line. Definition of an auditor: to listen. Now, you're handling a case: if you knew Scientology in the Galactic Confederation at this particular moment, man, they'd practically put you on a throne, see? Cases! Well, boo. You take some of the old Route 1, and you say, \"All right. Be three feet back of your doll. All right. Be on planet A, planet B, planet A, planet E, planet A, planet B. Got it? You're getting along fine. Planet A, planet B. Good. OT. Thank you.\" Guy would say, \"Gosh. You know, this is terrific\" – provided you listened. Guy'd say, \"This is terrific. I feel much better now. I don't see why I have to be pinned in that doll's head. I'm going around getting my sergeant's stripes as an OT.\" The situation would be very different from what you're operating with. The character of the pc you're operating with is operating under an enforced and continuously each life rein-forced amnesia. And if the course of the case upward is to knowingness, think of what stands in your road auditing an Earth case. And if you were up around in some other locales, it would be about the same difference as right now auditing an Earth case; you would sort of feel odd as – how the hell do you audit an ant? Do you see? Well, it'd be that same gap be-tween an Earth case and an ant, as a case of more or less a free thetan out there in space (who doesn't have your technology) and an Earth case. Do you see that? So I can feel for you, trying to get wins on the cases you're trying to get wins on, but you should recognize what type of case you're trying to get wins on and should recognize where your line is breaking down.

I myself wasn't making much of this mistake; it didn't call too much to my at-tention what it is, but it must have been there if the original word which identifies you, audi-tor, means listen – must have been there all the time, well understood. Now, what's the course of having that line out? What's the source – course of it? Here's, first, (1) dirty needle; (2) stuck TA; (3) ARC break. One, two, three – as inevitable as nonsense from Washington. One, two, three – just like that. If your pc has a dirty needle, a stuck tone arm is incipient on that case. It's liable to happen any minute. Man, you're already three-quarters of the way over the cliff! In fact, the beginning of the piercing, dwindling scream is about to sound. And your ARC break will follow immediately afterwards: bypassed charge. The most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then, is the itsa line – just it. And that's all – that line. That is the most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then: Restimulate an engram, don't let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don't let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don't let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don't let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don't let the pc tell you about it. If you haven't got an ARC break by that time, the pc must have been dead to begin with! Do you see that simply by filling up this reservoir full of charge and then not putting in the itsa line – not letting the pc tell you all about it – you're bypassing charge? This is ele-mentary. That gives you a change in your auditing training program at Level W. At Level W we're going to teach an auditor to be an auditor. We're going to teach them to listen before they restimulate anything. Life restimulates quite a bit of charge. The auditor should at least be able to handle that. Level I – Scientology I auditing – will consist, then, mainly of listening. You see his TA stop moving, you must have seen earlier a DN and not noticed it. So therefore, if you see a DN, you know that your TA motion soon is going to cease. It may not be the exact next ses-sion; it may take two sessions for it to really stop. Two sessions of the same kind of treatment, see? And you know, that's going to wind up in an ARC break. These people who are ARC breaky pcs are not ARC breaky pcs; there is no such thing. There are only auditors who don't listen. It's very simple. It's very elementary. I don't wish to give you too much stress on this, because you're liable to go completely overboard and just sit there and let your pc do nothing but talk. But the only crime that you can commit on letting the pc talk – the only crime you can commit – is if the pc doesn't move his tone arm by talking. Pc is talking for a while, and you see that the tone arm isn't moving: Well, you go on letting him talk forever, you're foolish, because the case is getting no-place. And this question will come up: The pc is motivatoring, motivatoring, motivatoring, nattering, nattering, nattering. First question that was thrown at me. We had a student here one time that only talked in motivators – didn't talk English, talked motivators. [laughter] And the question – question was asked of me, \"Well, what if we just let that person talk?\" Well, in the first place, she never would have gotten any TA as a result of all this talk. And the other"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 18 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 LEVEL 0 104 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST thing – she was already in an ARC break! Do you follow that? You don't let people talk when they're in an ARC break: you find what the bypassed charge is. Because your itsa line has already gone so far out that it won't put itself back in. So you say \"When shouldn't you let a pc talk?\" No TA action or the pc already in an ARC break. The time to do, then, is act. And the no TA action: Well, let's give them another auditing command or something like that, but that normally isn't what's wrong when you get stuck TA in that particular fash-ion. Normally the pc is – you're doing ARC breaks of some kind or another like \"Recall ARC breaks,\" and the pc has had an ARC break in present time having recalled – with themselves having [re]called an ARC break in the past, that sort of thing can happen, see? Or they've suddenly bypassed and haven't answered fifteen or twenty ARC breaks. They haven't given them to you; they threw them all away, suppressed them. That sort of thing is happening. Something weird has gone on in the session, and you suddenly cease to get tone arm action. Now, the pc could sit there and talk forever, and – wouldn't get him out of it. No, it requires the auditor to locate what bypassed charge, what has happened here? He has two remedies for this: he has the ARC break assessments and he has his big mid ruds. He has ways of getting people out of this mess. But that is your basic problem. We're not talking about the ramifications of it. Let the pc talk and let him talk with tone arm action. And let them talk as long as they want to talk and let them talk as long as you can get tone arm action by their talking. Where did you get so industrious? If I could sit there for two and a half hours with the pc telling me all about early track engrams and it's this way and that way, and I've got a TA that is banging here from 2.5 to 4.25, back and forth and back and forth, I'm afraid I would just sit there. And I know some of you sit and acknowledge. Oh, no. I wouldn't shut that off. I'd just sit there and look intelligent. [laughter] I wouldn't ac-knowledge a thing – no interim acknowledgments. Once in a while they look up and they seem brighter about it, so I look brighter and nod. [laughter] What do you want to work so hard for? You realize that we're talking now about case level II auditing, because that is case level II auditing. But all you'd have to do is let the pc start talking about his backtrack and get tone arm action and never give an auditing command. Start and end sessions; that'd be all there was to the auditing session. See, it'd get that elementary. Well, of course, it can get that elementary all the way down. But the worse off they are, the more their attention has to be directed, the more particularized the process has to be. The way to bypass charge is not let the pc tell you. Now, there's the basic anatomy of what you're doing, and it should make an awful lot of sense. And if you were to teach somebody just to listen (Scientology I, see) – you say, \"Well, you should go listen to people's problems\" they'll have some weird little wins. You're not even teaching them to run an E-Meter, see; just to let somebody talk to you. Then eventu-ally, he'll find out that there's talk and talk. There's the talk that moves E-Meters and the talk that doesn't. By that time they'd be a pro. Learn to listen, and you've got it made.

There are basically two communication cycles between the Auditor and the Pc that make up the auditing cycle. They are cause, distance, effect with the Auditor at cause and the Pc at effect, and cause, distance, effect with the Pc at cause and the Auditor at effect. Cause ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Distance ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Effect Auditor PCEffect ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Distance ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Cause These are completely distinct one from the other. The only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle, is the fact that the Auditor, on his communication cycle, has calculatingly restimulated something in the Pc which is then discharged by the Pc's communi-cation cycle. What the Auditor has said has caused a restimulation and then the Pc needs to answer the question to get rid of the restimulation. If the Pc does not answer the question he doesn't get rid of the restimulation. That is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game. (Some auditing breaks down because the Auditor is unwilling to restimulate the Pc.)"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 2 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0 108 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST There is a little extra communication cycle on here. The Auditor says, \"Thank you\" and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle. C ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Command ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ E Auditor E ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Answer ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ C PC C ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Acknowledgment ¡¡¡¡¡ E Now there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle. There is another little shadow cycle: it is the observation of \"Has the Pc received the auditing command?\" This is such a tiny \"cause\" that nearly all Auditors who are having any trouble finding out what's going on with the Pc are missing this one. \"Does he receive it?\" Actually there is another cause in here and you're missing that one when you're not perceiving the Pc. You can tell by looking at the Pc that he didn't hear or understand what you'd said or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving. Whatever that message is in response, it rides on this line. Did pc receive, e ¡¡¡¡¡¡ understand and ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ c answer command?

Then all of a sudden somewhere along the line there is an ARC Break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong. Well, they actually needn't ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in. What is the Pc doing completely aside from answering? Well, what he is doing is this other little sub-cause, distance, effect line. Another of these tiny lines is the cause, distance, effect line of – \"Is the Pc ready to re-ceive an auditing command?\" This is the Pc causing and it rides up the line across distance, is received at the Auditor and the Auditor perceives that the Pc is doing something else."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 3 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0 109 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST It is an important one and you find that Auditors goof that one very often; the Pc's at-tention is still on a prior action. Now here's another one – \"Has the Pc received the acknowledgement?\" Sometimes you violate this one. You have been acknowledging but you've never seen that he didn't re-ceive the acknowledgement. That perception has another little tiny one in it that actually comes on this line; it is – \"Has the Pc answered everything?\" The Auditor is watching the Pc and the Auditor sees that the Pc has not said all that the Pc is going to say. You sometimes get into trouble with Pcs that way. Everything at \"cause\" hasn't moved on down the line to effect and you haven't perceived all of the \"effect\" and you go into the acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself. That's chopping the Pc's communication. You didn't let the communication cycle flow to its complete end. The acknowledgement takes place and of course it can't go through as it's an inflowing line and it jams right there on the Pc's incomplete outflowing answer line. e ¡¡ Is the pc ready for the command? ¡¡¡¡ c Did pc receive, e ¡¡¡¡¡¡ understand and ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ c answer command?

So if you want to break it all down, there are six communication cycles which make up one auditing cycle. Six, not more than six unless you start running into trouble. If you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes a mish-mash of one kind or another. There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at the point of the Pc. It's a little additional one and it's between the Pc and himself. This is him talking to him. You're listening to the inside of his skull when you're examining it. It actually can be mul-tiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind. This happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isn't being done. And of course it's the hardest to detect when it isn't being done. Pc says: \"Yes. \" Now what has the Pc said yes to? And sometimes you are insufficiently curious. And that in es-sence is this internal perception of line. It includes this cause, distance, effect backflash here – \"Is the Pc answering the command I gave him?\" So with this, there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle. It is a multiple cycle."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 4 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0 110 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention, atten-tion, duplication and understanding. How many of these are there in one auditing cycle? You'd have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain a few more. If a Pc indicates that he didn't get the command (cause, distance, effect), the Auditor would give a repeat of it (cause, distance, effect) and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle, so you've got 9 – because there was a flub. So anything unusual that happens in a session adds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle, but they are still all part of the auditing cycle. Repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, is doing the same cycle over and over again. Now there is a completely different cycle inside the same pattern. The Pc is going to originate and it's got nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The only thing they have in com-mon is that they both use communication cycles. But this is brand new. The Pc says some-thing that is not germane to what the Auditor is saying or doing and you actually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it. Don't get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cycle. Consider it its own drill. You shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected. And, by the way, this handles such a thing as the Pc originates by throwing down the cans. That's still an origin. It has nothing to do with the auditing cycle. Maybe the auditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in. Well, the auditing cycle can't com-plete because this origin cycle is now here. That doesn't mean that this origin has precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cycle can resume. So this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause, distance, effect. The Pc causes some-thing. The Auditor now has to originate as the Auditor has to understand what the Pc is talk-ing about – and then acknowledge. And to the degree that it is hard to understand, you have the cause, distance, effect of the Auditor trying to clarify this thing; and every time he asks a question, he's got a new communication cycle. You can't put a machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood. And this must be done in such a way that the Pc isn't merely repeating his same origination or the Pc will go frantic. He'll go frantic because he can't get off that line – he's stuck in time and it really upsets him. So the Auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the Pc is talking about. And there's really no substitute for simply trying to understand it. There is a little line where the Pc indicates he is going to say something. This is a line (cause, distance, effect) that comes before the origination takes place so you don't run into a jam and you don't give the auditing command. The effect at the Auditor's point is to shut up and let him. There can be another little line (cause, distance, effect) where the Auditor indi-cates he is listening. Then there is the origination, the Auditor's acknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the Pc received the acknowledgement. That's your origination cycle."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 5 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0 111 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST An Auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on a scrap of paper. Just take a look at all these things; mock up a session and all of a sudden it will become very straight how these things are and you won't have a couple of them jammed up. What's mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused a couple of communication cycles to such a degree that you don't differentiate that they exist. That's why you sometimes chop a Pc who is trying to answer the question. You know whether the Pc has answered the question or not. How did you know? Even if it's telepathy it's cause, distance, effect. It doesn't matter how that communication took place, you know whether he's answered the command by a communication cycle. I don't care how you sense this. If you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if that's giv-ing you trouble (and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it) then it should be broken down and analyzed at a time when you're auditing something nice and simple. I've given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle; maybe in working it over you can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they are all there and if you made someone go through each one painstakingly, you would find out where his auditing cy-cle is jammed up. It isn't necessarily jammed up on his ability to say \"Thank you\". It may very well be jammed up in another quarter. L.

We have to add to the simplicity of the communication cycle obnosis (observation of the obvious). Your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training. Thereaf-ter it should be taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc is doing or is not doing. Your handling of a communication cycle ought to be so instinctive and so good that you're never worried about what you do now. The time for you to get all this fixed up is in training. If you know your communica-tion cycle is good you haven't any longer got to be upset about whether you're doing it right or not. You know yours is good, so you don't worry about it any more. In actual auditing, the communication cycle that you watch is the pc's. Your business is the communication cycle and responses of the pc. This is what makes the auditor who can crack any case and when absent you have an auditor who couldn't crack an egg if he stepped on it. This is the difference, it's whether or not this auditor can observe the communication cycle of the pc and repair its various lapses. It's so simple."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 2 BAS-05 – HCOB 23.5.71R V LEVEL 0 114 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST It simply consists of asking a question that the pc can answer, and then observing that the pc answers it, and when the pc has answered it, observing that the pc has completed the answer to it and is through answering it. Then give him the acknowledgement. Then give him something else to do. You can ask the same question or you can ask another question. Asking the pc a question he can answer involves clearing the auditing command. You also ask it of the pc so that the pc can hear it and knows what he's being asked. When the pc answers the question be bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question and not some other question. You have to develop a sensitivity – when did the pc finish answering what you've asked. You can tell when the pc has finished. It's a piece of knowingness. He looks like he's finished and he feels like he's finished. It's part sense; it's part his vocal intonation; but it's an instinct that you develop. You know he's finished. Then knowing he's finished answering you tell him he's finished with an acknowl-edgement, OK, Good, etc. It's like pointing out the by-passed charge to the pc. Like – \"You have now found and located the by-passed charge in answer to the question and you have said it.\" That's the magic of acknowledgement. If you don't have that sensitivity for when the pc is finished answering – he answers, gets nothing from you, you sit there and look at him, his social machinery goes into action, he gets onto self auditing and you get no TA action. The degree of stop you put on your acknowledgement is also your good sense because you can acknowledge a pc so hard that you finish the session right there. It's all very well to do this sort of thing in training and it's forgivable, but not in an au-diting session. Get your own communication cycle sufficiently well repaired that you don't have to worry about it after training. L.

Here they are given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved. (Note 2: These have not been written before because I had not deter-mined the results vital to each Level.) There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom of performing actions. A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how the auditor addresses his task. Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point. Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But an auditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Heal-ing but of any repetitive process. Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can do each one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way to handle the tools of auditing. LEVEL ZERO LISTEN STYLE At Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does is not a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is really listening. Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they did reach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this, evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the HAS student. Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this: Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 116 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Adding on higher skills like \"Is the pc talking interestingly?\" or even \"Is the pc talk-ing?\" is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won't talk or isn't interested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc. It really isn't \"Itsa\" to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, \"It's a this\" or \"It's a that.\" Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won't. It's the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa. The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. One doesn't cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that's at Level Zero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles. LEVEL ONE MUZZLED AUDITING This could also be called rote style auditing. Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and not anything else added. It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated, discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a \"muzzle was put on them\", figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack. Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completely muzzled. This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called \"Muzzled Style\" for the sake of brevity. It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn't make gains with the par-tially trained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment. At Level One we don't expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask the question) with no variation, acknowledge the pc's answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said. Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to \"Two-Way Comm\". Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One ses-sions don't disintegrate to Level Zero. Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out – not pc wanderings. A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditor will do. The pc is even put through a few \"do birds fly?\" cycles until the pc gets the idea. Then the processing works."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 3 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 117 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past \"ther-apy experience\", is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pc never got above Level Zero). It's the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains. To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short or-der, using the processes of this Level. To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles – Totally Permissive and To-tally Controlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It's been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are different enough – Listen Style and Muzzled Style – to set anybody straight. LEVEL TWO GUIDING STYLE AUDITING An old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing. We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing. One first guides the pc by \"two-way comm\" into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands. Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style and Muzzled Style Auditing well. Formerly the student who couldn't confront or duplicate a command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or \"Two-Way Comm\". The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa without chop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands. We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at this Level that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, the two things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can ob-serve the actual situation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.) Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what's what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy. Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To use those, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc's case ac-cordingly. The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 4 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 118 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers the pc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been re-vealed. One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc. One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needle except as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what's to be done by the action of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running what's being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numbered accordingly.) At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but not session ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by a higher classed auditor if they occur). To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must have a pc \"willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties\". That presupposes we have an auditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled. Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One under-stands, when one doesn't, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it. Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc's comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this is easy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimu-late the PTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn't being driven to do something about it) as the finite result. The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pc toward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA. The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style. One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commands with good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc's case. O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn't an overt and so eventually blow it. Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II – the ways of keeping a pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2. Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 5 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 119 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST LEVEL III ABRIDGED STYLE AUDITING By Abridged is meant \"abbreviated\", shorn of extras. Any not actually needful audit-ing command is deleted. For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, \"I will repeat the auditing command\" and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when it isn't necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it. In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. We still use repetitive commands expertly, but we don't use rote that is unnecessary to the situation. Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitive commands. At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc. But at the same time, one doesn't necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown. In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This is done more often by observation than command. Yet it is done. We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe. Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don't mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question. On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed. Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing. Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleaned up on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn't stop the pc from doing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a bigger auditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged. One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pc's relief. And one sees it isn't clean by the continued puzzle on the pc's face. There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesn't tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. And so doesn't check it again. Example: \"Has anything else been suppressed?\" One eye on pc, one on needle, needle didn't quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, \"All right, on \" and goes on to next question, eliminating a pc's possible protest read that can be mistaken for an-other \"suppress\"."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 6 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 120 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it im-pedes case advance. But that doesn't mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thorough with Abridged Style Auditing than in rote. One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected re-sult. By \"Abridged\" is meant getting the exact job done – the shortest way between two points – with no waste questions. By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time. The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions. The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes – CT Healing, Prepchecking, Auditing by List. Again it's the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result. LEVEL IV DIRECT STYLE AUDITING By direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner. We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it is direct. By direct, we don't mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc's attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct. It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear. Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed. At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes. These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at the Reactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner. In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a ses-sion to another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all. Thus we have another implication in the word \"direct\". The pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all. In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc's bank and wants no pc in front of it thinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action. All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It looks easy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 7 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 121 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST The trick is to be direct in what's wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what's to be done, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, at-tentive, completely relaxed. In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks or assessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list. And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch. The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breaking the pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesn't understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARC Breaking the pc. You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a ses-sion of CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on. In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you'd see the auditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, \"Let's see that in Clay.\" Or the pc doesn't really give an ability he wants to improve and you'd hear a quiet persuasive auditor voice, \"Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Just something, some ability you know, you'd like to improve.\" You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after that it's all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruc-tion. When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assess-ment action hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used. This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward – direct. But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed, but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done. (Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.) LEVEL VI ALL STYLE So far, we have dealt with simple actions. Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa's and Cognites and gets PTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and who must be handled, handled, handled all the way. As auditing TA for a 2½ hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster. So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 8 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 0 122 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs. It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding. Use the wrong style on a situation and you've had it. ARC Break! No progress! Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can't continue – or shouldn't. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. The auditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn't really know), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged and bothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress. The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles. Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit. So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can be co-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn't mastered one of the lower level styles. SUMMARY These are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are only variations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing. It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice. As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalize Styles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is. Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs. L.

Fine, thank you. All right. This is what? Audience: Twenty August. Twenty August AD 13. Thank you. Well, this is a lecture on the itsa line. About time. The itsa line. Why is it called the itsa line? The auditor says, \"Whatsit?\" and the pc says, \"Itsa.\" It is the pc's communication line from pc to auditor. And it isn't necessarily pursuant to the auditor's whatsit; it is some-times pursuant to the pc's whatsit – pc very often puts in his own whatsit. Okay. There are numerous communication lines between the auditor and the pc and the aggregate of these make up the – what you call the auditing cycle. The auditing cycle is made up of several communication lines. A communication line is cause-distance-effect. I call your attention to Dianetics 1955! for the full definition of a communication line. What is a communication: intention, attention, duplication at the point of effect, and so forth. All those are quite important and technically accurate, but what you're mainly inter-ested in is cause-distance-effect. Cause-distance-effect is a communication line. A communi-cation line is not cause-distance-effect, cause-distance-effect – that's two communication lines. Now, a communication line can be very faint, and one of those that you'll find out rou-tinely on an auditor is the attention line: line 1 minor; line 1 minor, the attention line. And that is just consistently out. But as I say, there are numbers of these and we're not particularly go-ing into them. That's the first line. That's – get the pc's attention; how do you get the pc's at-tention to cause the pc to put his attention on the auditor? And that line is the one that is put in. Now, that line itself can be complex and become two lines or three lines. Pc sitting there and he's saying, \"Gob-gob, walla-walla,\" something, and the auditor wants to get his attention on him. See, it has to have attention on the auditor. Now, the auditor can't really give an auditing command or do anything with his command unless he gets his attention line in."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 2 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 124 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, that can be done very crudely. You can drop the E-Meter, you can cough loudly in the pc's face, tip over your chair, get angry. There's, in essence, numbers of ways to get this line in very, very wrong. And the line has to be put in, however, and very often you find a pc fogging around at the beginning of session and his attention is not on the auditor, it's really not on his case, it's not on anything you're trying to do, and so forth. Well, how do you get it there? Well, one of the ways of getting it there is, having an attention line already extant, you then convert it to an itsa line. Now, this is the whole trick, because there's another attention line. There is attention on what, see? And this looks like another attention line – it's actually 1 minor. It just isn't put-ting the attention on the auditor, it's putting attention on something else. And this is a little trick I used to do that used to baffle everybody in ACCs. They used to get baffled, and every-body would drop his jaw and look at me dully when I would try to get them to do this – and it's been wholly unsuccessful – but by dividing down the auditing cycle into these various communication lines and component parts, I will bravely take another crack at it. It's slippy. I know if I give this to you, it'll become a repetitive-command process, which it isn't. It's slippy, that's all – is you just very adroitly, without really putting the pc's attention on anything except what his attention should be on, just flick the pc's attention over to what it should be on. I'll give you an idea. Pc is saying, \"Oh, I just – just – just can't stand – can't stand these – these wild parties. Just can't stand them. Had one last night and just can't stand them, and so forth. There's just too much – too much music and everything. And I've got an awful present time problem, be-cause this guy's – this – this – this girl's b-b-boyfriend came over and wanted to pop me in the eye because I was getting too familiar... and it's terrible.\" And present time problem, present time problem, present time problem. And you know you're running the GPM \"to be sexual,\" see? This you know about the case. This is – this I'm giving you, also, is the itsa line. [One can hear thunder in the background] Hey, we're getting a nice storm tape here too, Peter. We'll cut the storm off of it, and so forth, and sell it. They go great in the Middle West. They love storm tapes. It reminds them of home. I had a green tornado one time in Kansas – never been back since. Twenty-five-pound blocks of ice were falling out of a pea-soup-green sky, and the visibility had dropped down to about fifteen feet – bright green. Never quite recovered. Was impossible. Couldn't have hap-pened – but it did. Now, your pc's attention being all over the confounded place, the auditor sits back and says he's going to put in the itsa line. Now, usually by this – unless he is well trained and has this data, and so forth – this means he's going to sit back and leave the pc's attention totally uncontrolled. The itsa line, when you first start giving it to people, is just never doing any-thing but listen. And that's because people think it is simply a communication line, and it isn't. But we will go on to this in a moment. Now, therefore this pc is running on and on and on about this party – and this is slippy auditing. I can sit and do this by the hour.

It requires a certain estimation of effort, you understand? And I actually, years and years ago, despaired of getting anybody to control attention that lightly. This is another effort to do so, see? So, you say – he's going on and on, \"And this guy came over and he almost bopped me, but this was a nice-looking girl, and so forth. And I had a terrible problem because of my wife, you know, and so on, and...\" Here we go, see? Now, the auditor who is not well informed and who is not well skilled just sits back and listens to this whole thing. Now, to do anything about it suddenly is to put line 1 minor in on the auditor. Clank! And boy, the pc will ARC break, see, because it's a sudden shift of at-tention. So the whole thing is the skill by which you can take line 1 minor and flick it over onto what you were doing or want to do in the session – the skill with which you can do this. And, believe me, this is a skill manoeuvre. And when you are really skilled at this, you could almost sit down and run a full auditing session, and even a casual observer would think you were simply listening to the pc, which you weren't at all; you were actually directing the pc's attention very closely. The pc was talking exactly about what you wanted that pc to talk about and nothing else, and the pc never realizes that their attention has been grooved on it. Now, that would be the tremendous difference between psychoanalysis listening and Scientology auditing. You see, these things could look quite alike. The psychoanalyst (1) did not really know what to direct anybody's attention to, see? He didn't know the anatomy of the bank. He thought if he could direct somebody's attention to sexual incidents in early childhood, he had it made. Well, now, a pc – a pc – actually follows in his case, at any given moment, the least-charged line. A pc will always follow the least-charged line. Get this. Get this good, because that's one of those remarks that goes by in the night and you wonder someday – you're sitting there auditing somebody and you don't know what to do, and so forth. And it's one of those things that if you knew that well, you'd know exactly what to do. He always follows the least-charged line with his tone arm action. If you're going to get tone arm action, it is on the least-charged aberrative line – not the least-charged thing he could talk about, but the least-charged aberrative line. The tone arm action exists on the least-charged aberrative line at any given moment in a case progress – always the least-charged aberrative line. Now, give you what I mean by that. Let's take dynamics. You've got eight dynamics you could audit on the pc. The third dynamic is what the pc is always coming up with. Well, if you kept the pc on the third dynamic, you know, you would get tone arm action because this happens with the pc to be the least-charged line. You got it? Now, the other lines do not give tone arm action, and this does not mean they are not charged; it means they are overcharged. There is too much charge on them. Got that? So you're always trying to snake through the minefield on the least-popping firecrackers to get your tone arm action. You got that? You want little ones that'll just tingle his feet; you don't want those that'll blow his legs off. You understand? Well, the mind is so regulated and safety-valved that it will not release charges which the pc considers over his ability to tolerate. Now, an auditor can actually punch these charges"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 4 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 126 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST into view; he's got all the materials in his hand. And therefore he could actually throw the pc into areas which are overcharged areas to be run – the areas are overcharged. The result of an overcharged area is a stuck tone arm. Stuck tone arms have many pe-culiarities and particularities. You can say that if you want to really get tone arms moving you have to get the GPMs on a case run; that's the most likely to give you tone arm action. Be-cause it's the most aberrative in terms of time. You can say a lot of things about tone arm ac-tion. You say tone arm action sticks because of time – these things are all true. But with re-gard to charge, what you really want to know with regard to charge is that in the presence of too much charge, too much charge, the TA ceases to operate. TA action ceases when you have too much charge. That doesn't say that you couldn't bleed it, that you couldn't work your way around it, that there aren't means of getting off the charge anyhow, and all that sort of thing. But when you see a TA ceasing to operate, and ceasing to act, then you have entered an area of too much charge – particularly on an extremely high or an extremely low TA. Do you follow that, now? Too much charge. It's not because there's nothing there to run; it's because there's too cockeyed much there. See that? And if you don't get tone arm action, then the charge that holds the signifi-cances and ideas, postulates, cognitions, and that sort of thing, in place – just the corny elec-trical charge, you understand, no other significance connected with it – this thing packed up and held in facsimiles, masses, all of this sort of thing, won't then let the case advance. And you get no case advance in the absence of tone arm action. That is – that's it! I mean, there aren't any ands, ifs, ors or buts about it. No tone arm action: no case advance! I don't care if you erased a somatic, I don't care if the pc has ceased to have lumbosis, I don't care about any of these things – because you're not auditing a body. As far as this pc is concerned – no tone arm action: no case advance. Now, can you worsen no tone arm action? Yes. You can bring about no needle action on top of no tone arm action. Hu-hu-hu-hu. And if you insist on running a pc without tone arm action, you soon will begin to see it expressed over here in the needle, which will get tighter and tighter and tighter. And after a while everything locks up. And then if you use real desperate measures, why, you can just freeze the pc into something that'll feel to him like solid rock. The longer you run a case without tone arm action, the more you will freeze the case into no tone arm action. And the more the case is frozen into no tone arm action, the less chance you have of getting charge off by any means. You see this? I mean, you're walking away from the point of resolution. The further you go with no tone arm action, the less likely you are to fortuitously produce some. So it's not just \"Well, he's running without tone arm action,\" and brush it off, you see? It's \"Oh, my God! He's running without tone arm action! Whew. Huh. Hey, hey, hey! Bo-bo-bo-bo! No tone arm action! Hey, hey, hey, hey! No tone arm action. Get some tone arm action. Ha-ha.\" You know? It gets that type of emotional re-sponse, you know? Not \"Well, he's running without tone arm action, so he isn't getting any better,\" and so on, see?"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 5 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 127 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Guy being run without tone arm action is somebody you're watching go down the big toboggan. And the longer this goes on, the harder it's going to get to get tone arm action. Now, the most likely way to get tone arm action on any condition, any case or any anything, is getting in the itsa line. This has processes connected with it. These processes are designated Routine 1C (C for communication). Routine 1C: this is the soft-touch process. This is the process that will be given to Scientology One Auditors, and after you've studied it and used it a year or two, you'll find out that there's a lot more to know about it. It is at once the clumsiest use – it's the workhorse, you see? You say, \"Well, you've got two processes to make an OT. You've got 3N, you got R3R.\" No, you've always got three processes. See, if you've got two like that, then you've always got one more, and that'll always be the itsa line, or 1C, see? This is the workhorse. This is the workhorse. And, yeah, somebody in a co-audit; yes, sure, somebody in a... doing a book-auditing job; yeah, somebody, some student in the Academy; yeah, these people, oh, yes, these guys will be able to make progress with this thing. But before he's gone very long in the Academy and before he's done very much auditing, he'll all of a sudden begin to believe – he'll do one of two things: either, \"Well, I just get tired of just sitting there listening to him talk and talk and talk and talk, you know? I just get tired of this. So this itsa line isn't so good.\" See? He didn't even know what it was in the first place, see? Or he will all of a sudden begin to realize that there is a certain deftness required here or one will just continue to sit and listen and lis-ten, and the pc goes on and talks and talks. Well, look, they talked for five years in psychoanalysis without getting anyplace. See, we don't know that they had tone arm action, but we sure know they didn't get anyplace. They did. They did – pardon me, pardon me. That – I'm maligning the boys. I'm maligning them. They got careful. They did get someplace. Well, look-a-here. You learn, then, that an overcharged case can most easily be bled down by the itsa line, and you'll restore tone arm action. So the best way to restore tone arm action to any case that has become overcharged through being run in the wrong departments is getting in the itsa line. Now, that's your base process. You can restore tone arm action, no matter how badly the case has been jammed up, if you are clever in handling the itsa line. Now, when I say \"itsa line,\" and when I say \"clever,\" yes, they're very definitely joined together. Clever. It is not a process; it's a cleverness. And the biggest trouble you have anything with is (as we'll come back to this) line 1 minor. Why put the attention on the auditor when all you've got to do is shift it slightly in the pc? This guy is saying, \"Well, and so forth, and we had this big – big hassle at this party and I – this – my wife bawled me out, and everybody bawled me out and so forth. And I've got this terrible present time problem. I got this awful hangover and I'm having an awful time in this session,\" and so on and so on and so on. Yeah, under a long series of runs you could probably take apart this present time problem, but you were running on the pc the goal \"to be sexual.\" The pc is having trouble with being sexual, that's for sure. Well, that's where the cleverness is, is was there anything that happened – you know, is what the pc's talking about got anything to do with what you were doing, see? So, of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 6 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 128 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST course, the adroit question practically walks up and hits you in the head. The adroit question is – pc takes a long breath and momentarily he isn't going on any further. Just momentarily, see? He actually hasn't run his communication line out terribly, but he's just been floundering, you're getting minimum tone arm action. And you say, \"Did our last session have anything to do with this?\" \"Oh. Let's see, what the hell were we doing in the last session?\" \"Well, I don't know. Just review what we were doing.\" \"Well, let's see, so and so on, so on, then we had an ARC break and we were doing something or other and so on. We were running out some kind of items; there's this backtrack and there's this stairs or something there. Let me see, now. I – I'll – I'm gettin' it now,\" and so forth. \"Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we were running – you see, I – I really can't get anywhere near this, I'm so worried about my present time problem – but we were – we were running some goal, some goal, some goal, some goal, something along this line and so on. Oh, yes, 'to be sex – ' say, what do you know! Yeah, I sure do have a lot of trouble with – with this thing 'to be sexual.' I ha... Yeah, I sure do. Yeah, I – I have a lot of trouble with that.\" \"Well\" you say, \"well, what items did we have there, right toward the last?\" \"Well, I think we arrived at this point on the line plot, and I think it was – I think it was – 'absolutably' no, it was 'nix' – yeah. Well, all right. There we are.\" And you're starting to see your tone arm move and your needle start to twitch. And he never knew what happened. Magic, man, magic! It's gently taking line 1 mi-nor, without actually putting it on the auditor, and putting it back to the subject of the audit-ing. And, you see, there's no process that you could announce that will do this, because the auditing is tremendously variable and the pc's worries and concerns are fantastically agglom-erate. Now, sometimes, the pc has legitimately had a present time problem and something catastrophic has occurred between sessions, something like this – this is just using this factor for just a present time problem – and it's something way off. And the only thing you can do is to keep flicking that attention line. Flick. It's really not a whatsit line; your whatsit's already in, you see? And you just keep moving it around till the pc will ventilate the PTP that he's worrying about. Now, the crudest, but still acceptable example of this is simply \"Tell me about it.\" See, that's crude. See, that's something like we're going to build a house so we pile up some bricks. That's crude. That's about as adroit as the cow doing the twist, see? [laughter] But neverthe-less, it's functional. You do get some motion. I couldn't forbear to milk that gag. [laughs, laughter] Now, so there's the pc, see? And the pc can't get his mind on what you're doing be-cause something else has happened. And this something else is real worried, and maybe it's worried down to the level of grief charge, or something like this, see? Well, all you can do is move the – move this little attention line around onto things that'll give him itsas. And you can cut it down from – well, actually, failing to relieve the situation, that's how bad it can be, see?

See, we're well into the acceptable band, if we've got to be. Or, we handled it in the first two hours of the session, or we handled it in the first hour of the session, or we handled it in the first fifteen minutes of the session. And that difference of time has very little to do with the seri-ousness of the problem; it has everything to do with the cleverness of the auditor – without putting the attention line on himself, without cutting the itsa line – adroitly shifting that little attention line there to this and that. \"Well,\" the person says, \"but this – but I don't see – I don't see why we had to fight half the night after we got home. I told her I just was attracted by blondes, and so forth, and she just wouldn't listen,\" and so forth. And the auditor says, \"What have you found out about arguments like that with your wife?\" \"Well, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa.\" \"Well, that's – that's fine. All right. Now, how do you feel about this problem now?\" \"Well, the problem is all right.\" Well, he's still a little bit fluttery, so, \"Well, let's review now what we were doing on something or other.\" Got the idea? \"Well, we were doing so-and-so and, well, you know what we were doing as well as I do.\" \"Well, all right, yeah, probably. But I may not have full records here of this. There might have been something that came up during the session, or something like this, or be-tween sessions you might have thought of something else.\" \"Oh, yes! I did, as a matter of fact.\" You're away, see? Got the idea? Actually, it's just about as skilled as building a watch, but because there is no apparent skill there, don't you see, it gets slightly into disrepute. People can watch a session in which this is occurring, and they really never even hear the auditor say anything, see? And the pc never really hears the auditor say anything, because the attention line isn't \"All right, now. All right. Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I – I got all that you're talking about. Now, all right. Now we're going to give you – going to give you the next – the next – next auditing com-mand – the next – the next – the – the next auditing command. You got that now? Got that now.

You've actually got something he's already been talking about, and you put it in by the duplication factor. You duplicate what he has been talking about and you just pull his itsa line a little bit further and put it on something, see? I'll give you an idea of doing this. He says, \"Well, auditing, auditing. I get these awful headaches in auditing and that sort of thing.\" \"Well, have you particularly gotten them while we've been running goals?\" Few sessions later – he's forgotten all about these headaches, and so forth – we're hav-ing a hard time getting his itsa line handled: \"How about these headaches? Are they troubling you as much now? When we run these goals and that sort of thing, how are these headaches?\" Sounds merely solicitous. It isn't; it's a itsa line, see? See, you've taken a dead-ended commu-nication line someplace back down the line and you've repeated its subject, so therefore you have made a duplication, so you've created a communication line. It's all very technical. And the person's attention goes back on to this and he has to make a comparison. He has to say his headaches are better or worse or there's no change, and while he's doing this he has to put his attention on GPMs, or whatever you're trying to run on it. And you say, \"Well, with this last one that we were running in the last session – the last one, 'to be nutty,' 'to be crazy in the head',\" so forth, something like that, \"how were the somatics in the head getting along there? Were they turning on and off, and so forth, while we've been running that?\" \"Oh, well, you shouldn't really remark on this, because I had them pretty well off.\" \"Well, what item did they go off on?\" \"Well, they went off on – Well, I really don't know. Someplace in the first part of it. Um – um – um – I had an item in there – is – 'idiota-bly...' I think it was 'idiotably nutty.' Yeah. Yeah, that was the one. Hey, I got that headache again, you know?\" You say, \"Well, give me 'nix idiotably nutty.'\" You're away, see? See? He doesn't know what hit him, see? It's moving that attention line adroitly, adroitly, see? Adroit. With the little pinky – the little finger, you know – raised just right on the teacup, See? Now, you'll see an auditor who really hasn't got much feeling for it, and no tools and so forth, why, he's got this teacup with both paws wrapped around it, you see? And you'll see somebody else has poured the tea into the saucer with both paws wrapped around the saucer and inhaling at a very large number of decibels. See? So, that you'll see this in all of its shades of gray, you see, down to outright black. But before you understand anything much about the itsa line, you have to understand that there is such a thing as an attention line – line 1 minor – and unless you can handle that attention line slightly, adroitly, greatly, smoothly – you'll curse yourself sometimes. Even the best of an auditor will say, \"Well, let's get to running this GPM now,\" or something like that."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 9 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 131 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Cut your throat, you see? You spend the next fifteen minutes getting out of this hole.

You find yourself making these mistakes. Don't knock yourself in the head and say \"Well, I'm terrible at this\" and run a big make-guilty on self because you don't handle this well always. Just, those times you have been clever, pat yourself on the back. That's the one to pay attention to. I'm not kidding you, because... Well, I gave a session last night and I dropped – three times. Once I dropped a handful of anvils on the floor – shook up the session most interestingly – and another time I put off a whole chain of firecrackers in the middle of the auditing table, and another time practically ran the mains voltage through the cans, see? But that was three, see? That was three. But there was two hours' worth, and probably some-thing on the order of 150 that were handled, you know, with such aplomb, man, that nobody ever found out anything about it, and it got the pc out of the woods gorgeously. See? Quanti-tatively, see? 'Course what you put your attention on are those three that had to be patched up, see? \"Oh, oh. Well, your attention wasn't on it. Well, I'm very sorry, and so on. Have I cut your communication?\" You know, \"Sorry,\" and so forth. \"Well, what would you have said if I hadn't have interrupted that?\" See? Good recovery, see, level, and so forth. Nevertheless, if you really were self-critical to a vast degree, you would have been practically kicking your brains out for having pulled any one of these three. Pc is going on and saying, \"Well, I think I have blown that last GPM. I think I have blown that.\" \"Well, all right. All right. Good. Let's check some of its items.\" Oh-oh, cut your throat, man, see? Just put the pc's attention on the wrong thing, the wrong place, it's all going crash, the pc's needle goes dirty. Get the idea? You see, you're split between wanting the pc to think well of you, and getting your job done. And these two things are very often at... they're dipolar phenomena. You try and get your job done sometimes uphill against something and in the final analysis it just merely de-pends on, did you get your job done, see? That's what it really depends on in the final analy-sis. But in the process of getting your job done, you happen to have ARC broke the pc and cut the pc's communication line several times. Well, the difference between a good and a bad auditor is not whether the auditor always audits smoothly with never cutting an itsa line, but whether or not he attains his eventual objective without creating so many ARC breaks that the pc's case has not improved. That's the test! If you go around training people on the basis of \"You must never cut an itsa line; you must never create an ARC break; you must never upset the pc\" – all of these things, you see – it's something like laying in a GPM, you know? Oh, in the first place, it's an impossible at-tainment. Always train them with \"Be as clever and adroit as you can,\" and \"You can be a little more adroit than that.\" He dropped his E-Meter in the pc's lap halfway through the ses-sion.

Now, how many dozen ways are there to shift the pc's attention? I don't know – dozens, thousands. Thousands. I'll give you an idea. You got an alcoholic. You're try-ing to process this alcoholic, see? Alcoholic's drunk most sessions and you know you're not supposed to audit somebody who's drunk. All the alcoholic'd do is sit there and say, \"Well, Alcoholics Anonymous will tell you you can't cure anybody of alcoholism.\" That's all he's going to say, see? He knows you can't help him. He's saying, well, it's impossible, see? And you say, \"Well, the case is unauditable.\" Yes, the case is unauditable to everybody except those who are surpassingly skilled with the attention line and the itsa line, see? The whatsit line is practically missing. \"Now, what have you learned about Alcoholics Anonymous?\" \"Oh, well, that's something else. Well, I met this fella down the street, this fella, and so forth, and he gave me this book, see? And I read this book and I threw it in a garbage pail. Couldn't teach me anything. But I learned better after a while.\" \"When was that?\" \"Oh, in about a few days later I learned better, see? I had this awful hangover, and I just got fired and I was being sued for divorce, and I found out they were your friends. That's what I found out then.\" You're going to see that tone arm starting to move, man. He has just told you that you can't possibly audit him. He has just told you that you can't possibly help him. So you just – hhh-hhh – polish up the fingernails, audit him, help him, and somewhere up the line he finds out about it as a major cognition. But all the way up the line he's improving. Because if you can get tone arm motion and get the guy with the session, see, by flicking that little old attention line right where it lives, parallel what the mind is doing, and it will do everything you want it to. Nothing new – that's the beginning lines, I think, of one of the first-book things. But nevertheless, this gives you the anatomy of how that's done. You just find out about what this guy's mind is on, see? And if you can produce tone arm action by having him locate things about it, then he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it. It's the tone arm motion that takes off the compulsion, not the significance of what he digs up. Given enough tone arm motion on any given subject, and that subject will right itself in the head of the pc. And man, I'm talking from hard-won experience. I'd say, if we've learned anything in the last thirteen years, man, we've learned that. 'Tisn't the significance alone. It's the tone arm motion that can be obtained in relation to the significance that brings about the recovery. Now, that's, the fastest recovery is, of course, the tone arm motion plus the right sig-nificance to be run. Now, that's your fastest recovery. But your recovery takes place some-what and eventually if you just produce tone arm motion. That's all you have to do, is produce tone arm motion on the case, regardless of what's run, and eventually – at some vast dis-tance – why, this pc is going to recover from these various targets and so forth in the case. He's going to recover from them. That's for sure. But if you audit the right significance and get no tone arm action, the pc will never recover.

The high TA and the overcharged area compare. The least-charged aberra-tive area gives tone arm action. You very often will find some alcoholic that gets no tone arm action on the subject of alcoholism, but he's got corns. You can get tone arm action on the subject of corns, you see? In other words, he can't face that highly a charged approach. So that sometimes the absolute direct approach to a compulsion or obsession of some kind or another will get you nowhere at all, because it's such a highly charged area that it's over the pc's head, and you get no tone arm action on that. Well, the answer to that is don't abandon it; just get tone arm action! See? That's the thing to do. Just get tone arm action! Very remarkable. Because the mind is stacked up the way it is, if you continue to get tone arm action, he'll all of a sudden walk up on that thing, do you see? Now, undirectedly – that's just not directing him toward any specific target or goal or aberration or anything else, or any reason he's not able or anything at all, anything – you get tone arm action and he'll eventually collide with something. And he will know processing is helping him! You'll be utterly flabbergasted sometime. You have this surprise in store for you, if you haven't collided it already. Knowing the idea about tone arm action, you sit there and this pc babbles on and on and on, and it doesn't have anything to do with anything you can see, but my God, that tone arm is moving. You're getting up and down motions on that thing – not a quarter division every twenty minutes, man. You're getting – it's got to be a bit healthier than that for a pc to know something about it – but it's certainly getting a whole tone arm di-vision every ten minutes, and that's pretty fair tone arm motion, see? And that's acceptable. I wouldn't buy much less than that myself – tone arm division every ten minutes. And that would say only down, but you realize that it also has to rise in order to go back down again. So if you added the plus and minus, that'd be two tone arm divisions, you see – one up and one down – in ten minutes. Well, that's – that's just barely, marginally acceptable, see, to pro-duce this phenomena. You get that? All right. Pc talking about his grandmother's jam making. Well, cripes, you know? This is about as aberrative, don't you see, as petting the pup. But, my heavens, you're getting tone arm motion on it, man. Well, you can't do anything else much. You've tried something else and gotten a stuck tone arm, so let's let him go on, see? And just completely neglect your attention line. If you were very skilled, you would be unable to totally neglect it. You would punch it around a little bit and increase your tone arm motion, see?

And now you come into your own about the itsa line, because tone arm motion only occurs when the itsa line is in, and tone arm motion does not occur with the itsa line out. Now, a lot of you think the itsa line is a communication line. It's not. That's a surprise, isn't it? Just because it's labeled C-distance-E and because it is a communication line, well, why don't we just call it the preclear's line to auditor? That would make it a communication line. But we don't. We call it the itsa line. Why the itsa? Why? Why?. Well, one of the ways to get this across is to give the student a drill. Just imagine a thetan in various circumstances, you know, like a guy in jail. All right, now how is his itsa line cut? See, it isn't just on the graph. That isn't the only way you can show how the itsa line is cut – in an auditing session. Let's just take it out in life. And we say, \"All right, this guy is in jail. Give me a number of ways this fellow's itsa line is cut.\" And you may get some awful comm lags on the part of the student, but he'll eventually dig it up, see? How's his itsa line cut? Well, let me give you some notions, then, for definition of the itsa line. Well, he can't go anyplace else to see if \"itsa.\" He can't go anyplace else to itsa. He's right there in jail, isn't he? Let's say he was up in London in jail. All right. Well, he couldn't go down and itsa the coast, could he? He couldn't say \"Itsa water, and itsa beach, and itsa resort, and itsa Brighton,\" could he? He can't get there. How the hell can he itsa it? Well, he can itsa it on a via, if somebody'd give him a map or a book or a novel that's about the coast, or something like that. That's itsa on a via – substitute. Itsa by substitutes. So it's a kind of an itsa. Well, itsa by facsimiles is an itsa by substitutes, too. So this is not inef-fective. But his itsa line – direct itsa line – is sure cut. Now, there are other ways his itsa line can be cut by reason of being in jail. I won't go into those particularly. We have a fellow sitting at a table. We put a blindfold on him. How is his itsa line cut? Do you see how his itsa line is cut? He can't itsa! That's what an itsa line is. What's a nightmare? What's a nightmare? A nightmare is the inability to itsa, followed by mocking up something that can be itsa'd that's wrong. A thetan likes to be oriented. He orients himself. How does he orient himself? Itsa. \"Itsa ceiling, itsa floor, itsa wall itsa ... Therefore, I'm a...\" You hide somebody. You hide somebody – The itsa line is cut on himself. Nobody else can say itsa. Nobody can say itsa. Do you see that? Disassociate somebody from his identity. How's his itsa line cut? He can't say \"Itsa me. Itsa me, Joe Jones,\" see? Can't be done. He hasn't got an identity now. Well, we get into a whole tangled web of aberration and we find out that that's the ba-sic aberration: inability to orient or declare or identify or recognize. Not just solve, you un-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 13 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 135 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST derstand. It isn't cure versus cure versus cure. That's also itsas, but that's only part of the pic-ture. How do you know you're here? Well, that's easy. That's easy. You say, \"Itsa chapel, itsa chair, itsa notebook.\" Where you are, \"Itsa body.\" Up here, \"Itsa Ron,\" see? You know where you are. Your itsa line is in. You're oriented, so you feel happy about the whole thing, see? Fine. You know where you are. It isn't necessarily how dangerous the environment is. You could be out in the jungle, and you'd be surprised how happy some hunter looked when he says \"Itsa lion!\" Hasn't really anything to do with safety, security, and – none of these. These are just extra considerations, see? So you just shred all these extra considerations off and itsa. See? \"Itsa jungle, itsa me, itsa gun, itsa lion, itsa bearer up a tree. Well, at least I know I was killed by a lion. My itsa line is in on the subject of that death.\" Well, look, if this is so important to power, and it is; and if this is so important to san-ity, and it is; and if this is so important to memory, and it is; and if this is so important to abil-ity, and it is – then we would expect the major tricks on the track to comprise of cutting itsa lines one way or the other. So, you're standing up there loud and clear on the parapet, gripping dramatically the flag of the lilies of France, being shot at in shot and shell, and all of a sudden there's a snick, and you is disconnected. Well, you at least know how you died. You got some idea that it was a flying object, unfriendily directed. And by God, in the next half an hour or something like that, they're telling you you died some other way. Correct? Spoils your itsa line. And then in the ensuing actions that take place on it, why, they give you a completely false position as far as you're concerned and a false situation and a false here and a false there and they throw your itsa out on time and they give you a little GPM to carry home with you very happily, give you some nice somatics to go along with it. You're an idiot to ever go back, you know? I mean, you move right around the corner of the thing, and itsa where? If it's 70.6 tril-lion-seven years ago, which is right now, that itsa is certainly for the birds, isn't it? You un-derstand, they've misdated a somatic on you, because they say, \"Now we're going to give you your future,\" and somehow or another restimulate your facsimiles of the past and say they're in the future and... What's happening here? Well, enough happened so that everybody on this planet be-lieved they lived only once. And that's how serious the cutting of an itsa line can be. You combine this with plenty of force and you got it made, man! I can see it now, the development of a new psychiatry. A new medical psychiatry can be developed out of this. You can get people so mixed up that they'd report back to the medi-cal doctor every time. They do. Insane patients are always reporting back for their shocks, and so forth, see? Well-known fact. The report-back mechanism is just used and used and used and used and used by these nuts. By the way, I thought of a difference between a Scientologist and the world at large on this particular planet.

We know the sub-stance of their unreality. In other words, we know where their itsa line is out. See, they know what – they're not identifying. See? Their itsas are just for the birds, you know? \"Man is an animal. He is a bio-chemical protoplasm which goes no place. At death there is a cessation of cellular commo-tion.\" That's a good itsa, isn't it? That just immediately makes nothing out of everybody. Ah, so there's a formula. There's a formula involved here. And that is, your itsa line can be out on A, R, C and K, U, C, D, E, I, 0 and F. How many ways can an itsa line be? Well, it's that whole scale I gave you for R2H. Known, unknown, curious, desired, enforced, inhibited, none of it and false – absent and false. This is how many itsa aberrations there can be, see? Well, false, that's the easiest one of all. You hold up somebody – you say, \"Here, have a piece of candy, sonny.\" Give him a piece of chalk, see? He bites it. His itsa line is out, man. Got the idea? You say, \"There is nothing here, boys. There is nothing haunting this planet; there is nobody after you; there is... nothing happens. I mean, you're just here and just natural and there's nobody after you, see?\" That itsa line is for the birds, see? \"You're paranoid! You think people are pursuing you!\" Of course, nobody is pursuing us – they don't have to. They got us, man! [laughs] So they say something isn't, which is. Well, of course you can get the reverse of that. They say something is which isn't, such as the Darwinian theory, which is just an old implant. Inhibited. Inhibited: Give a guy a pair of distorting glasses or make him look at things in a twisted mirror, like a fun-house mirror. His itsa line is inhibited. Tell him he must not examine such-and-so and so-and-so because it is very dangerous, and of course his itsa line is inhibited at once. And of course, enforced itsa: \"You better damn well know about this or you will be shot tomorrow morning without cigarette or blindfold.\" Enforced itsa. Desired itsa – see, that's a \"want to know\" sort of itsa: Somebody is very happy to know that you're all right. You see? That's a desirable itsa. And the itsa of curiosity is not just being curious about what is; it's an itsa which is cu-riosity. It's a curiosity itsa, don't you see? Now, you go up higher than that and you get an unknown itsa. Hey, you know, there is an unknown itsa. I just gave you an example of one. You have a complete reality on the unre-ality of people on this planet. See, the itsa is their unknownness, see? You recognize they don't know! Well, that is an itsa. And it's pretty high-scale stuff for a thetan to be able to rec-ognize that it is an unknown. This thing really boxes him around, because, of course, it mixes in with the actual desire to make something known which can be known. And amongst that, you get the accumulations of unknownnesses that are just unknown and will always be un-known, will never be anything else, because they're tailored to be unknown. And if you don't think that can't be, look at the word unknown. See, there's a perfect example. Yes, there is"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 15 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 137 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST such a thing as an unknown. There's a word, there's the concept that you back it up, u-n-k-n-o-w-n, unknown, and that is a something which is unknown, isn't it? I mean, this is getting idi-otic. There's many a religion, man, which is built 100 percent on a beautiful building which houses a non-existence. And they have created an unknown. That's what they have created! See, it is something that can be created. And a thetan's tolerance, as it rises, eventually gets up to a point where he can actually confront an unknown without doing a thing about it. He can recognize that it is unknown; it's a manufactured unknown. Like x, in algebra. There's another example. Somebody writes x. All right, he can con-front the fact that x is unknown. Of course, if he's nowhere near an algebra teacher he proba-bly won't even be forced to find out a known for that unknown, either. He probably won't even do the equation x + y – z = 0. Of course, you don't even know what the equation applies to and neither does anybody else. A mathematician is somebody who's gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and he has to solve all of these unknownnesses. Now, if you don't think that isn't prevalent – if you don't think that isn't prevalent – there is one of the things that holds up auditors in auditing, is they get so upset about the pc being in an unknown while he's trying to itsa that they eventually grab hold of the meter and they say, \"Oh, well, let's see. Is it twenty years ago? thirty years ago? It's thirty years ago. Yeah, well, we know about that now.\" [breathes sighs of relief] They say they're just helping the pc. It's just they can't confront that \"Well, and so, and so, za-za-za, za-za, za-za-za, I don't know. I just don't know. It couldn't have been so.\" And they think, \"Oh, my God, if this goes on a minute longer,\" you know? And they get the itsa line in for themselves. [laughter] And then, of course, an itsa line can be too known. Every once in a while some mur-der-mystery characters... The thing is out because it is known. Every once in a while, some murder-mystery writer has the postman do it, because nobody ever sees a postman. See? It's too known. I bet there's crime after crime on the books down here that remains unsolvable because it was committed in too known a fashion. See? It's a known itsa. Itsa of knownnesses. Every once in a while you're doing an ARC break on some pc on R2H and can't quite find out what it is, and you eventually will hit \"known communication,\" you know? Known. Well, of course he knows it. He thought it was something else. Why? Because he knew it. So you get how slippy that can be, see? That's this \"everybody knows\" that is talked about in Dianetics: Evolution of a Science, you see? Everybody knows these things – that's known itsas – so you never examine them. That's another way of having a known itsa. But the pc's attention with his itsas rise up and down this whole new version of the CDEI Scale, see? – goes up and down, each one in those various stages. And he picks out this and he picks out that and he picks out something else, and all he's doing is saying \"It is a...\" He is identifying, in other words. He's identifying something. And when he cannot identify something, then he identifies by classification – identification by classification. \"This is a type of...\" Psychiatry does this all the time. They say, \"This is dementia praecox case...\" They've gotten so idiotic with it now that if somebody goes to that Chestnut Lodge, where Graham – that publisher of Newsweek and the Post that was so against Scientology – where he went, and"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 16 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 138 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST went home on vacation and killed himself. He went home for a day; he was supposed to come back. Up there at Chestnut Lodge... I've told you about it before. That's actually the name of the joint; it's up around... And it's very remarkable. But it's very remarkable up there. But if a person is trans-ferred to Chestnut Lodge, regardless of their symptoms before, they now have schizophrenia. And I have asked this several times, trying to get the answer. And I finally did get the answer and understood it was the answer, and after that it didn't plague me. But it's a very interesting example of an interesting variation of itsa, see? And that is, they are a schizophrenic because they were transferred to Chestnut Lodge, because that's all there are at Chestnut Lodge! Well now, that's by classification plus idiocy, see? When you say \"It is a cupboard,\" you have a pleasant sensation of familiarity and knowingness. You seldom stop to think that you have classified something. You know some-thing because you know of a similar something, and so you get your gradients. Your gradients of classification establish familiarity in that particular direction. Every once in a while this familiarity gets betrayed or something like that and you get an ARC break with it. You say, \"It is a cupboard,\" and you open it up and find out that it's a mouse home, or something, see? Somebody's using it to breed white mice for something, or something. Or \"It is an automobile,\" and you get into it and find out it's a stage prop. A little minor ARC break there of false itsa, don't you see? That's quite common in GPMs. Pc goes halfway through the GPM and all of a sudden does the right itsa. \"Ha-ha, ha! These are just railroad carriages with a painted backdrop of a train going off in the distance. They're not trains.\" See? Identified the character of the itsa. This is all, then, on the subject of identification; it's all on the subject of familiarity; it's all on the subject of finding out; it's all on the subject of – of making oneself comfortable with what he is looking at; it's all on the subject of straightening out one's various grades of ARC with the universe. Now, what gives a thetan such a passion for this, this is something else and not the subject of this lecture, nor, actually, the subject of cases at the present mo-ment. But it opens up a very interesting channel of research. What's this passion to itsa? See, that's an interesting question. But, that you do get tone arm action when you itsa and the case does improve, this is well established. And this is germane to all cases. So getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pc's communication in. I say \"nothing to do,\" that's another action. That's more apt to be the attention line – to you, or something of this sort. Don't you see? That's get-ting his communication in. That's not the itsa line. No, getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify, separate, compartment, differentiate, inspect, decide about, things in his bank – or, in an objective process, in the room. You want to see a tone arm fall, you could probably produce it normally by saying \"What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that?\" and have the pc itsa. You say, \"What's that?\" pointing at the fireplace. Pc says, \"It's a fireplace.\""},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 17 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 139 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Actually, you run it for a very little while ... This is not a broad, general thing, because there are other factors involved here. Pc is so introverted that it's painful for him to extrovert his attention, and he can only extrovert his attention on a broad via. And other special condi-tions arise here that doesn't make this a pat process, you understand? It's a pat process, though, as far as his bank is concerned, always – not necessarily objectively. But I'm giving you the objective version here, which is a limited version of it. And you say, \"What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that?\" See? Every time the pc says \"Itsa.\" Normally, if a pc is not having too bad a time and he isn't fouled up and you haven't got him stuck on the track someplace and interested in something else, you'll see your tone arm fall. You can also see a pc getting very interested. All of a sudden, he – \"What is it? Yeah, it's a fireplace, but – but...\" And he'll want to go over and take a closer look at the thing to make sure it's a fireplace built out of a certain kind of brick, see? His itsa's getting sharper. You will see his identification rise. Now, this is so good that a Touch Assist works. Familiarization processes permit peo-ple to get driver's licenses who couldn't, by just touching cars – you know, \"Itsa, itsa, itsa car\" is all he's running, you know? He thought it was a buffalo for a while or something. Well, listen, if he couldn't drive the thing, he must have thought something weird – that I assure you. So itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa – that's familiarization. You want to teach some girl to type. Well, just have her familiarize herself with the tools of the trade. Very funny. She can get up to an itsa, itsa, itsa to a point, and her ability will rise, rise, rise along with it, which is very peculiar. But then this has something to do with charge. The change of case has to do with the release of charge because of the itsa. There's two things happen: The individual who is really itsaing things is also blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusions about them. And that charge is encysted, and that is a force aspect and a mass aspect with regard to this. Here's the phenomenon, see? Here's this encysted little thing here, see? And you said, \"What's in there?\" see? And he says, \"Oh, sfoo-uh-zoo, and zoo-oo, zoo-oo, zoo-oo.\" Tone arm is moving, see? Picking up those fingers one by one off the clasped hands, you see? And \"Well, that's off. Well, that's off also. I don't know. Let's see, see what – what it is, what it is... Oh! Palms!\" [laughs] You didn't think anything was in there, did you? [laughter, laughs] That's just charge. And you see that tone arm start moving; well, that's charge coming off of one of these bundles, and the guy is looking and it's just a method of as-ising. Now, while he's doing this, what drives some auditors around the bend is he puts in a lot of additional itsas. Why, that's of no great harm, see? He says, \"Itsa house. No, itsa car. No, itsa...\" See? \"Itsa fingernail – no, oh, no. No, no. Oh, I know what this is! I – I know what this is. I know what this is. A watermelon!\" And"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 18 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 140 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST then (as an auditor said to me last night) we get all set and we've both got a watermelon and then all of a sudden he says, \"No, it isn't a watermelon, it's a diamond ring.\" And the auditor starts feeling kind of confused, because, you see, his itsa line is being thrown around by the pc. But only, only if the auditor doesn't completely understand what he is doing. He's trying to find something and then be content with it. Well, that isn't auditing, man. An auditor's superior knowledge should be that if the guy says it's a watermelon, he for sure is going to call it a diamond ring shortly. And if it really is a diamond ring, he'll never mention it thereafter, because it's itsa'd. But until it is itsa'd, he's going to call it all sorts of things. It's going to be at a billion years, and it's going to be 5 years into the future, and it's going to be back trillions-five years, and it's going to be 465 years ago, and it's going to be yesterday, and it's going to be now, and it's going to be fifteen minutes ago, and it's going to be trillions-ten ago, and it's going to be 18 trillion years ago, and then all of a sudden it settles down to 125 billion trillion years ago. Period. Bang – that's it. You don't hear about it anymore than that, because he got it, see? It's itsa'd. So, a lot of apparent itsas come off in the process of obtaining an itsa. And you almost could say that all the running of a case, from the first moment of its processing on through to the final cognition of the case, consists of conditional itsas. Conditional itsas. That's the way it is for that circumstance and that certain place, you see? An auditor should never have any thought that he's got to get nothing but permanent itsas. Naturally, you go through a GPM, you tear off the items according to a plot. Well, that's the itsa of it! Reason I don't have any trouble running a GPM is I have no doubt about the itsa of a GPM, see? That's it. It just is what it is. There was nothing there to understand. It was put there to louse you up and immobilize you and cut down your power and ability, you see, and it's a bunch of electronic circuits which go into a couple of boxes, and they have a couple of things that fire on both sides of the thing, and they start you in the top, turn you upside down at the bottom, and that's all there is to it. And you go through and you say, \"Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,\" and that's the end of the GPM. No false itsa, see? Actually, in most cases, not even much of a protest. You know, not saying \"It should be some other way.\" Once in a while a spotted intention with a false idea of the intention will hang it up for a mo-ment. But that's an itsa, see? You don't have the immediate and direct itsa of \"How come I got into a situation where I started getting these things in the first place?\" you see? Well, that's one of these big itsas, see? This finally starts dawning on the pc. \"What the hell was I doing delivering myself up to a comedy like this,\" you see, \"every few trillion years?\" You know? \"What's the matter with me? What'd I do? What happened to me? Well, what's wrong with me 'ead? How come?\" And you'll find most pcs will start chewing on this after a while, and they chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and – they sometimes chew on it for two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight hundred hours, see? How come? There's no reason to blow your brains out about it or stretch your medulla oblongata all out of shape. It all of a sudden will rise up in your midst and there it will be: the itsa of \"It is...\" See? \"Oh, that's why!\" you see?"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 19 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 141 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, the adroitness with which an auditor can use the little attention line to put the pc's attention into areas that can be explored, that are easy enough for the pc to see into, that will produce tone arm action – is a very skilled auditor. And that is what is known as getting in the itsa line. Getting in the itsa line does not consist of sitting back and letting the pc talk for hours about nothing. You understand, we do not frown on that if you can't do anything else. You understand? But there is a much more adroit level by which you put his attention on things that can be identified by him, and which he will therefore unsnarl the thing called a problem or the bank or that aberrated area. And it's the degree that you can obtain tone arm action – that you can do that – that marks the skill of the auditor. That is the most skilled center and zone of auditing. It's almost so skilled that I hesitate to mention it again, because I've had loses along this line. Now, if you can do that, there is its anatomy. If you can do that, you would be known as this fantastic thing called \"the touch,\" \"intuition\" – all these other things would mount up back of this. It's quite awesome. So getting in the itsa line isn't just sitting there. It's actually doing something else. Now, letting the itsa line exist is descriptive of the lowest level of auditing on this, you see – just letting the itsa line exist. We'll get somewhere, see? We'll get somewhere if we just do that. But don't go speaking carelessly of getting the itsa line in unless you're doing just that. You're taking the pc-to-auditor communication line, and you are putting it right into zones and areas where it will find itsas. You're putting the pc's attention in there to where that line will be \"itsa a...\" and a \"itsa a...\" and \"Rur-rurrumdaummmmm. Well, itsa a...\" you see, and \"rrrrr-ra-ra-ra-rm, and so on, and so on, and so on. Well, I guess – I guess it was my complacence in college. That's what got – Yes, that's right. That's what really got me in trou-ble. I was complacent about everything. I was – that's it!\" Bang! You will all of a sudden see your tone arm go right on down, see? You see the charge come off of the case in the bucket-loads. This is actually so skilled that it's the production of cognitions. You can produce cog-nitions if you want to. You can be that skilled. This is something that takes some familiariza-tion with yourself. You should know what the tools are: The tools is the line 1 minor, and that is used to produce a searching attention on the part of the pc; your whatsit line is left there more or less alone, to produce this kind of phenomena. Why? Because the universe is full of whatsit lines. The pc is suffering from too much whatsit and too little itsa. And the net result of this is of course to jam his itsa line. And you, the auditor, by letting it flow, pull him out of the soup. Of course, the direction of significances as powerful as a GPM, as powerful as a su-per-duper engram, as powerful as this sort of thing on the way backtrack, God 'elp us, and so forth – man, that's putting in the itsa line on a significance with magnitude. And that thing actually requires considerable skill. You've got to have line plots and the idea of cross listing, and the doingness of the auditor is considerable. The skill is considerable, his drills are con-siderable, and so forth. Nevertheless, even those fail if you don't let the itsa line exist. You got to leave that itsa line alone and let it rove."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE 20 SHSBC-325 – 20.8.63 LEVEL 0 142 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, it also consists of not cutting it, and there are numerous ways the itsa line can be cut in auditing. It's a good drill to get somebody to come around and show you that August 4 plot. Have him find the number of ways you can cut that pc's itsa line. Then make him pass the drill: How many ways could you aberrate somebody by cutting the itsa line? And then he has to find out what the itsa line is. That's an awfully good drill, and that drives it home with a thud. All right? Audience: Mm-hm. I hope you get a good grip on this one, because it's a slippy one. And of course it's – trouble with it is, it's so known, see? It's an \"everybody knows,\" you know? Itsa line – obvi-ously it's the pc's communication line. Even though we went on saying \"itsa\" and calling it an itsa line – well, why is it called an itsa line, and so forth? And you'll see this one drift on through Scientology and always, forever, in some part of Scientology, this one will be too known. That I know, for sure. But the very skilled auditor and the very well reputed auditor and the auditor who gets terrific results will be the auditor who has this one down cold. He knows an itsa line back-wards and forwards. Pc sits down with a present time problem – it isn't necessarily a speed factor involved – but the pc talks to him for a while and mysteriously this present time prob-lem blows up and the pc is sitting right exactly in the middle of exactly what the auditor wanted him to be in, and the pc is running on exactly what they ought to be running, zippety-bop. And the pc is happy and the auditor is happy and everything is going as smooth as glass. Naturally, there will be some jolts on the line. Every once in a while you'll wish you had never opened your big mouth. And I hope you don't get into as many of those as I have in the last thirteen years. [laughter] Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" LEVEL 0 143 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) A lecture given on 21 August 1963 What's the date? Audience: August 21st. Twenty-first. Twenty-first August AD 13. All right. We could cover an awful lot of stuff here. Be very easy to do. The main things in which you are involved at the present moment probably look far more complicated to you than they are. I'm going to talk to you some more about the tone arm and the itsa line, and forms of sessions. Things look to you a lot more involved than they actually are. Sitting somewhere back of every thetan's bank is some tremendous insecurity in which he believes implicitly that the universe is dangerous, or that he himself is in danger or that he cannot live or survive as a powerful being. And whatever that state is, and however that state is created originally is not particularly germane to this lecture. But the discovery of the itsa line may look to you to be a highly simple little thing, perhaps even a duplication of psychoanalysis. After all, they talked. And if you didn't know anything about the itsa line, you could draw all sorts of wild conclusions, you see? Make the mistake of saying, \"Well, it's a communication line, and therefore any communication line is an itsa line, and therefore if you let anybody talk about anything, why, he will get better.\" We already know if you let a fellow talk on an entheta line very long, he'll run his hav-ingness out the bottom. So the complexities of the itsa line are really quite something. It sits on a tremendous amount of technology, but in itself is very simple to understand. There's nothing much to understanding it. If you understand it you'd see – you'd see actions like this very readily and immediately, and these actions would be something like this: Pc said, \"I-I don't know whether it was – let's see, now, it was – twenty, twenty, twenty – I guess about twenty years ago. And the fellow said uh – I don't know what he said, but I know what I think about it. I-I-I know that I-I know I think it was a big swindle of some kind or another. And – come to think about it, I don't know whether I said that or he said that.\" Auditor: \"It reads that he said it.\" Oh, wait a minute. What happens at this point? What occurred there, exactly? Well, you know at once what occurred, if you know the itsa line. The auditor put in the itsa with the meter, leaving the pc in a zone and area of insecurity."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 2 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 144 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, we say, all right, the line plot. The line plot: that tells the pc what items are in the GPM. See, just like that, see? So obviously we say, well, this to some degree puts in the itsa line for the pc. Well, no, no. That could be said to, but we get across the proposition of the lesser of two evils. If you've ever seen a pc wrapped around a telephone pole with undis-closed charge from running a GPM he knew not what of, or did not know any of the elements of, you will use line plots. If the thing is a known line plot, we will use it. Why? Because that was a predesigned plot in the first place. It was an other-determined design – you understand that somebody else determined the design. What's important about it is the charge that is on it, and what's impor-tant in the auditing is to get off the charge and get the pc to identify, to his own reality, that itsa. See, if the line plot you handed him on a sheet of paper didn't agree with the thing he was running, you will very shortly hear about it. He can get wrapped around a telegraph pole with great speed. But that's a shadow of putting in an itsa line, isn't it? That's a shadow of put-ting in the itsa line with the pc – but a necessary action. Now, I'll give you its similar borderline: Pc says, \"Oh, it's twenty years ago, it was fif-teen – no, it's eighteen – eighteen, four – twenty, twenty-two... It's twenty-two year... I think it was twenty-two year... No, no. It – it must have been twenty-five – thirty. No, twenty-one – I-I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know when it was.\" He quit, see? He quit cold. What you going to do? Sit there with a pc who has quit cold? Or are you going to say, \"All right, I'll give you a hand. Was it more than twenty years ago, less than twenty years ago? Was it twenty years ago? All right, it's more than twenty years ago. Is it more than twenty-five years ago? Less than twenty-five years ago? Less than twenty-five years ago. You got some idea of it now?\" \"Yeah! It was twenty-three years ago.\" Or, \"Was it more than twenty-five? Less than twenty-five? It was less than twenty-five. Twenty-three? Twenty-three? I'm getting a read here on twenty-three.\" \"Yeah. It was twenty-three.\" Get that? So you didn't totally put in the itsa line. See, you could start putting the itsa line in and the pc catches the ball, put it almost totally in and the pc catches it, see, and get right onto the hour and the minute, and the pc never caught it, but at least you don't have something wrong dated. And those are the gradients of putting in the itsa line. And the last one – it's a little bit of a lose to have to put it all the way in for the pc, see? All right, now, look at the length of time you and other fellows around have been stumbling around on this planet. There's a number of thousands of years. And the number of thousands of years you've been in the Marcab Confederacy are quite numerous. They proba-bly run up to two or three hundred thousand years that you've been inside this system. And let me call to your attention, never during that time could you put your foot on the first step of the road which led back to a better life and some happiness and freedom, see? You couldn't get a foot on that road at all."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 3 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 145 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST All right. Right now you have technology. You have a map. The map has got all kinds of blank spots in it, but nevertheless, there's the type of map it is, don't you see? And those are persuasions toward an itsa line. And the only time you totally lose – the only time you totally lose – is when you have to put the whole itsa line in. Give somebody the pattern for a goal: All right, he has to list for the actual goal in that sequence and find it. And he has to list for and get the top oppterm, to make it, in order to fit the pattern, and then he's got to fit the pat-tern together. And this is an awful lot of itsa. See? Well, all right, so you've got the preprinted pattern. Give him this, and he just reads it off. You understand? This is less desirable, but it's still feasible. All right, now let's put it totally in. Let's put it totally in. Let's just hit him with a light-ning bolt so that he can't contact any of the facsimiles in it, and we have medical psychiatry. See, the evil involved in this is putting in an itsa line in such a way as to have no self-determinism, no power of choice left in the pc at all. Total wipe-out of power of choice, don't you see? Now, you can fall short of that in various degrees. Little kid is going around, see? He's real unhappy about the whole thing, he's real unhappy about life and he's walking around in circles and so forth. And you say to him, \"That is your bed.\" Well, you haven't really done very much for him, but you have improved his state of mind or his peace, see? Just to that degree. You understand? You say, \"That is your bed.\" Nevertheless, you have put in the itsa line. He himself has not found out that it is his bed, you see? But look, he's still very happy to have the bed. Now, when we get down into pure, unadulterated evil, we get a denial of the itsa line and we go into aberration, creation of. See, this whole thing inverts, and we get K, U, C, D, E, I, 0, F – that whole scale of means of perverting the itsa line. Now, those means, well, include an inability to ever find anything, an inability to reach anything, and so forth. Well now, medical psychiatry (to amend what I was saying a moment ago) is of the inclination that it is better, you see, for nobody to have anything to do with anything, see? See that? Now, look at that as an inversion. That's an inversion of the fact. Now, the aberration of this line – perversion of this itsa line – has to be very direct in order to be very aberrative. You have to pervert the line, you see – just outrightly put in some-thing false, or put nothing there, you see, or... so on, or inhibit very directly, and you have to work at it. It has to be worked at and so on. Given the slightest chance, why, the pc will start putting in his itsa line. But what does he put his itsa line in on? All right, let's take Freudian analysis: he puts in his itsa line on childhood sexual inci-dents. They're not aberrative! Anybody get anyplace? Old Papa Freud did contribute some-thing. He said there was a possibility. Great, let's applaud him for that. But he was putting the itsa line in in directions that didn't wind up with anything, and then after he got through he put the line in, totally; the practitioner put the line in. See, he said, \"The reason why you are aberrated now is we have finally found out that you had a fet-ish going. You had a fetishism. And actually, your little brother's right shoe has aberrated"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 4 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 146 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST your whole existence, and that is why – that is why you are always talking about the feet on chairs, you see? And now we've got this all explained, and you are better.\" Now, that's all very fine, but he didn't look at the hypnotic character of the statement \"You are better.\" That's putting in the itsa line. All right. We got some guy walking around in circles out here. (Let's take a look at these various gradients of putting in the itsa line for somebody; you'll gradually see what I'm talking about and what I'm driving at here.) Got some guy walking around in circles and, man, he doesn't know which way to turn. He's got lumbosis and he's been aberrated by hearing of a psychiatrist when he was young and he's got all kinds of things, you see. He's having a hard time – having a hard time. And you say something can be done about it. Well, you've put in some variety of itsa line, haven't you? And that's what you call a hope factor. And this guy very often responds to this, and he feels much happier about this, don't you see? You see that – that the hope factor, then, is to that slight degree putting in the itsa line, see? It's not really much of an itsa line. You're not saying... but you're saying, \"It is not – it is not hopeless!\" See? You're sort of putting in a negative line for him a little bit there, and you carry him along. You see, as we look at this problem, we'll see that there are various degrees of putting in the itsa line for somebody. See, there are various degrees of this, and these things vary from the very, very evil – which is to say, hand a guy a pomegranate and say, \"That's a bomb.\" See, that's putting in a false itsa line. They vary from that up to a – well, making it impossible for him to put it in. (That's a lower grade, making it impossible for the person to put in an itsa line.) Varies up to the little necessary actions necessary to begin the flow of the itsa line. See, and these little necessary actions are such as \"Start of session.\" And the basic in-tent is what makes the difference. That's the first fundamental difference, although this, too, can go too far. But the basic intent is what makes the most fundamental difference. Do you intend to improve this person's itsaing ability, or do you intend to knock it into a cocked 'at? Which? So it begins right there with the intention. And that gives you the difference between the cow-boys in the white hats and the cowboys in the black hats, see? And it's right there, man, bang! Intention: decrease this person's ability to itsa – cowboys in the black hats. Intention: by some or any means, to improve this person's ability to itsa – cowboys in the white hats. That's good and evil, defined in terms of the itsa line. That's the difference between freedom and slavery, that's the difference between making freemen and making slaves. You make slaves by the intention to decrease the ability to put in the itsa line. That's how you make a slave. And that gives you the whole textbook of how to make slaves, right there, complete with gold letters and a chain-pattern cover. And the other way is to improve the person's ability to itsa. In other words, to identify, to spot, to find out. And there we have that point from which we can separate the Scientolo-gist from the medico, we can separate the decent civilizations from the lousy ones; we can go right on through there."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 5 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 147 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST This quarter of the universe, by the way, is suffering from an overdose of lousy civili-zation. See? That's what it's suffering from. It apparently has been recently conquered in re-cent times (in the last few hundred thousand years), but those who were conquered had al-ready been – their governmental actions – had already been set up for their own failure, see? They'd been set up to be conquered by using, themselves, mental technology which made slaves. They implanted their own troops. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. \"We're going to plant somebody up to be a loyal soldier, to fight bravely, to never give up his body so long as it is alive, to be true to the empire.\" We're going to plant somebody, are we? Remember, every one of those items we put in, to stick, has to have a negative item! And that doesn't just cut it down 50 percent, that puts it in the betrayal line. It cuts it down enormously, because some empire that would do this to somebody gets their support like giving them the itch, see? \"Yeah, we'll help the general out,\" you know? Help him into the car so that he goes through the other side and falls out the oppo-site door, you know? It's an accident, you know. When the planes take off, half their motors don't run, you know? Just – they're just running up against total sabotage, because they've already got a slave empire. And you may be able to force a group by slavery and so forth into a semblance of a civilization, but it's only ever a semblance; there's never anything to which anybody freely, wholeheartedly contributes. It has no strength, it has no power. Because remember, 50 percent of the implant is \"Don't be a good soldier.\" And then the fact that the implant occurred at all, of course, is enough to knock one's loyalty in a cocked hat. Let's take an earlier and probably still extant organization, the Galactic Confederacy: eighty trillion years, smooth as glass. No implanting. Interesting? I don't know the exact length of the Espinol Confederacy, but it's probably something on the order of a few hundred thousand years. Implants – no empire. The figures read themselves. Rome died at the hands of her slaves. That's for sure. She was never conquered by the barbarians. I know it looked very nice in the history books, but the truth of the matter is, who wanted to fight for Rome? You get through with a war, you come home, you find out the slave civilization has already taken over the farms. There's no need for your production; there's no need for a freeman; there was no pay to be a freeman. That was the reward and the pat on the back for having fought through the wars, you see? And it started going into a civil-war situation. And half of the Roman Empire was al-ways fighting half of the Roman Empire. I don't remember the exact name of the battle; it doesn't occur to me. I read it in Gibbon (and it's probably wrong in Gibbon) and got cluttered up on it – it's either Messana or something like that. But the reason the first barbarians got to Rome was because – she didn't have very large numbers in her armies, but forty thousand of her first-line troops lay dead at Messala in a civil war caused by unrest caused by slavery. And they had no first-line troops. That was"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 6 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 148 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST practically the entire call-up of the empire. And historians today trace back to that battle as the reason the barbarian was able to conquer the thing. Well, you trace back the battle, and you find the battle came because of civil war. And we find out why the civil war came and it came by slavery. The American Civil War, that destroyed one of the better agricultural areas of Amer-ica, and so forth, was again a battle about slavery, one way or the other. Every time you have slavery, you have trouble. See? You don't even have to be sentimental about it. You don't have to be sentimental. You can be terribly statistical. You don't have to say it's good or it's bad or anything else. You don't have to beat the drum for it, or be a person who wants to re-form things or something like that. Just look at the statistics. Slavery never pays off. That's it. That's that. It's dangerous. If anything is dangerous, it's slavery. You don't suppose America would be having very much trouble right now with its race riots and 250 thousand negroes about to converge on Washington, and so forth, if they hadn't kicked off this slavery. And it's very funny, but the most involved people in American slavery were the Bostonians. Used to have what they called the \"triangle trade.\" They'd send ships loaded with rum down to Africa, use the rum to buy blacks (as they referred to them), use the whip and Christianity on them to bring them back over, and they traded in the blacks down around the West Indies, and so forth, for sugar cane, and they brought the sugar cane up to Boston and they made rum, and they shipped the rum to Africa, and they just had that worked out. And practically the first families of Boston are founded directly on slavery. Kennedy missed that. He wasn't there at that – family wasn't in America at that par-ticular time. His family got out from underneath another type of slavery: the landowner, the absentee landlord, the high rates – this type of economic slavery, and so forth. And these things go back to roots. In other words, we have catastrophes in all directions. We have the catastrophe of Boston, the catastrophe of Kennedy. We've got a situation here whereby you trace world trouble, and you trace it straight back to slavery. I'm not trying to beat the drum for anything. Why do you think Russia can't get its feet under itself, and why is everybody having such a hard time with the Russians, and why are the Russians so silly as to evolve a slave economy such as communism, and so forth? What's all this fuss? Well, this fuss goes back to the idea in early Russian history that a man belonged to the land, and when you sold the land you sold the man with it. Well, the European civilization got out from underneath that, two or three centuries before, and Russia has not yet got out from underneath that. She is still carrying the burden of her past chains. And therefore she can't think straight. She's like trying to get a pc to think in the middle of a session, you know? Can't do it. That's a little more touching picture than they actually are painting. Actually, what I think is, is the White Russian prince and that sort of fellow, you see, he went back to the between-lives area and he came back and he picked up a body and be-came a commissar. I don't think they've really changed their faces very much. But the trouble with world affairs today is slavery. The greatest empire Earth ever had went down in the dust with slavery. The British Empire right now is having a rough time and"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 7 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 149 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST is staggering around because of its efforts to colonise, and to do this and to do that and do something about this, and to free man and not to free man, and somehow or another to hold him in economic duress, don't you see, and not let him free but then to let him free, and... you know? You got all this trouble down here in Africa running around in one way or the other. Well, that's the sort of trouble you get when you suddenly start taking the lid off something that has had the lid nailed down on for a very long time, you see? And without anybody around who really knows much about it, why, we get those boys going back into slavery, too. First action of a new African ruler is ordinarily to throw the whole opposition in jail because they are insufficiently enslaved by his regime, you see? This viewpoint. This viewpoint. Now, I'm not discoursing on this just because I have a bee in my bonnet about it, be-cause I frankly couldn't care less, as far as this planet is concerned. It'll never get out of any mess unless we get it out of that mess, and I'm just using the situation just to show you the liabilities of slavery. You always get a lash back – always. Because a thetan never gives up! That's it. He really never gives up. He's lying there. He might look awful quiet, he might look terribly dead, he might look like he doesn't interfere with anything, you see? But, in actual fact, he really never gives up! He's got some trick: You can put him in jail, immobilize him, wrap him all up in adhe-sive tape and electric cord, and so forth, and he gets even with you: he sits there and thinks how he's right. He even goes down to that point, see? He can hold that postulate clear on down through the lowest levels of unconsciousness – that he was right. Well, I think that's very interesting. Because if he ever gets out of it, he'll go on being right, see? If he ever gets out of it, he'll go on being right about what he was being right about before he got put in that state. In other words, the effort to dominate, the effort to dominate and deny power of choice is the road that this universe walked toward the hell it became. Fear – the unlovely specter of fear stands ahead of all of those. Let's trace this out very carefully: To survive. All right, very good. This guy wants to survive. Whatever put him in the state of mind that he had to survive? Because this is your biggest piece of nonsense. A thetan can't possibly do anything but survive. In fact, it's proba-bly the trouble with him. And that's certainly the trouble governments and things have with him. That's the trouble the Marcabians are having with him right now. How to kill a thetan is the biggest problem in this universe. See, it's just not solvable. They thought they had it all solved and we came along. See, they just never really are able to whip this problem. How do you kill a thetan? Well, it's not an elegant problem to whip. Now, how can a being – who actually can't be struck at, who cannot do anything but survive and cannot die, who can pass through various lapses of memory and that sort of thing – how can this being get into a state of mind whereby he's concerned about survival? Well, it takes quite a lot of trickery to do that. Usually it's on the extension of self into a possession, like making a minion. You mock a mock-up up and then you endow it with some life, you see? And then somebody comes along and starts to kick its head off, so you protect it and you identify yourself with it. Or you construct a civilization and identify itself [yourself] with it,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 8 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 150 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST and you're trying to get the civilization to survive, so that eventually you get worried about your own survival. You see the mistake which has to be made there? That mistake actually has to be made directly before a thetan gets worried about his own survival. In other words, he has to extend some type of line onto something that he feels can't survive, and then identify himself with it to such an extent that he feels his own survival can be affected. And this is your first step into aberration. All right. Your next step forward from this is an elementary step: Because one is now worried about survival, one resolves the problem of survival by domination. This is not any kind of a solution at all. It's a lousy solution, but it gets used and is probably... that which is not admired tends to persist. That very definitely applies in this particular line, because domi-nation is probably the least admired thing in this universe, and yet, oddly enough, is continu-ously successful. But it's really not successful. So, domination – domination comes in here. And we have thetan A and thetan B, and the way that thetan B is kept from destroying thetan A's construction or civilization, don't you see, is by thetan A dominating thetan B, you see? That is the formula by which this is arrived at. So thetan A, to protect something he wants to have survive, therefore seeks to dominate thetan B. And then being in a frame of mind where he feels he himself cannot survive, then he just obsessively goes on and dominates thetans B, C, D, E, F and G, see? But he overlooks the fact that if he dominates thetans B, D, E, F and G, sooner or later, thetans B, D, E, F and G in their turn are going to dominate. Do you see? Because we've set up a cause-effect line, and the best thing you know about a cause-effect line – we may not know much about overt-motivator sequences; we know all about the cause-effect line from which the overt-motivator sequence comes. And the best thing about those things is that communication contains cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication. And because of the duplication of the intention, then any communication line will reverse. That's the easi-est thing a communication line does is reverse, because of course it has duplication on both ends. It's very easy for cause to become effect and effect to become cause, because there's a duplication in the communication line. All you have to do is make a slight mistake of which is cause and which is effect, and you have the waiters, which at one time through the last cen-tury served people in black tuxedos – you know, the guests all wore black tuxedos, and so forth – you have the waiters now wearing black tuxedos, you see? And you look at any custom as it comes along in this universe, you are actually study-ing the cause-distance-effect-duplication aspect of a communication line. It's going to reverse. Well, there's lots of ramifications whereby we protest and we do this and we do that. But this fact of any custom you see on this planet at this time – you could absolutely count on its hav-ing been the reverse custom at an earlier date. Now, this makes an awfully broad statement, but if you look into it, you'll see that's the case. You take the clothes today of women, and the clothes today of men, see? Well, you don't have to look back very far to where you see that that one flipped, you see? And you look into – into almost any custom you can follow down and you will find out it slipped. It went the other way to."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 9 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 151 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So the formula of communication, and communication itself, then, is the most impor-tant factor in looking for aberration. It's very elementary why: It's cause, distance, effect with intention, duplication. The duplication factor, then, makes the C very easily look like the E, and the E look like the C. So of course the line can reverse around the other way to. And we get all sorts of superstitions about overt-motivator sequences, and we get all kinds of things. Of course, that's factual, but it's simply based upon the nature of a communication line. We beat somebody's head in and we beat somebody's head in and we beat somebody's head in and we beat somebody's head in. Of course, at cause you have the intention to beat somebody's head in, and at effect we have somebody's head being beaten in. That's pretty elementary. And then one fine day we wake up with a headache. Where did the headache come from? Well, one slipped. One slipped. One made a misidentification of the C and the E on the line, see? It was quite accidental. You're reading a book by Montaigne, or something, and it said, \"And thy servant, he is a man, too,\" see, something like this, you know? Guy just, you know, just blah... (I don't even know if Montaigne said that. But you have to add these erudite points when you don't have your quotation dictionary handy. Besides, I usually find out I can make up better quotations than they said anyhow. [laughs] I figure out their works were culled. I used to work on the basis that if you wrote enough words, you'd say something clever, and that saying things clever was usually solved in the field of philosophy by writing enough words. See, just by law of averages you would eventually be clever. Anyway ... Fifty thou-sand monkeys writing for fifty thousand years apparently by accident would write all the books of the world, and I think they did! [laughs, laughter] Anyway, you see what happens here now? Do you see? There's a switcheroo on these lines, and you get what looks like an overt-motivator sequence. And almost any pc you audit at the level of Homo sapiens, and so on, has got this so switched that you can absolutely count on O/W working. But as I've often told you, it's not a high-level concept. See, it's limited. It only goes up so high because it depends upon this error of identification, you see? But you can always get a case result by saying, \"What have you done?\" \"What have you done?\" because you've freed up now some vicious communication line. And it's certain that he made a misidentification from that point up, see, and so therefore we can free some somatics or something like that. We can practically count on the fact that if some guy has got a sore neck, that if we just find out what sore necks he has caused, we will eventually tear apart a couple of facsimiles of some kind or another, which will straighten it out, and he'll cease to have a sore neck. Because he obviously had given somebody else a sore neck, you see, if he has a sore neck. I mean, it's that elementary. But what is this really based on? It's based on the misidentification of a communica-tion line because of the duplication factor in communication. Can't communicate without some duplication. That duplication, of course, sneaks up. You can't communicate at all with-out duplication. Well, all right, if communication is so dangerous, why is any thetan communicating at all? Well, he communicates because he wants to be oriented. And we're back to why he com-municates. He wants to be oriented. Of course, I don't – then, of course, he takes his best tool,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 10 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 152 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST getting oriented, and proceeds to aberrate it by using it to dominate, to do people in, and to mess up things that he tries to identify with, see? He messes up his own communication line. In other words, he misuses his communication line. Now, the communication line is there because he's lost and feels the need of orienta-tion. Hence his desire for communication. There's an insecurity back on along the line which causes him to use this communication line. As I say, we haven't got the full answer as to why that is. I'm just showing you what this comes from. And that gives us, directly, the itsa line. So don't regard the itsa line as a low-level concept, it's actually Scientology Five. It's not Sci-entology One, but it's used in Scientology One, and I'm sure will be used well for a long pe-riod of time, will also be used very blindly in many quarters. But let's appreciate what we're using. We're using the obsession to identify, which lies back of the communication line. But we're using a principle higher than communication, cou-pled with communication, in order to orient and rehabilitate a thetan. You've made a full statement of processing at that moment, see, except for this one little fact: Is there anything else earlier that gave this guy an insecurity? The original one, in the absence of communica-tion, is somewhat hard to understand – particularly at our states of case, see? A little bit hard to understand. What the devil was it? This guy, you see, isn't communicating, he doesn't feel insecure, he is not protecting anything, he hasn't got any reaching going on, he had no real reason to reach, and so forth. How did anybody get to him? You can figure out a lot of answers to the thing, and they all wind up with a communi-cation line mixed up in them. And of course the moment a communication line is mixed up in them you haven't got the answer. How did he originally feel the need of orientation and familiarization in order to be comfortable? See, how did he do this? How was this done to anybody, and how did he do it to anybody else? And if so, why? So, there is a riddle still sitting there, see? There is a riddle. But we have the walkway back to the answer to that riddle. And what you're walking, on the line of OT, is you're walking to the answer of that riddle. And the funny part of it is, when you put your foot on that which lies on the other side of all of the energy and all of the Confu-sion and all of the overts and all the misidentification and everything else – which you're han-dling right now as cases, and auditors, see – right on the other side of that, just as it took one step to get on the road, it only takes one step at the other end of that roadway to suddenly go OT. OT is a gradient process for a long period of time with a sudden fantastic upsurge. You'll get shadows of that upsurge as you're processing somebody. You haven't made it yet, but he all of a sudden will do something peculiar. He'll do something very OTish – and the next forty-eight hours shake in his boots because, you know, ha-ha. Blu-uh! Guy starts to reach for the telephone and it leaps to his ear, you know? Scares hell out of him. Next session you'll spend processing it having happened. [laughs] But that's proc-essable, too. These are just the lines up. But the realization at the other end, the solution to that riddle and any of its ramifica-tions, determines more or less the state attained. In other words, processing is the cure of hav-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 11 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 153 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST ing to be familiarized with things and having to itsa things, and so forth. The end product of processing is no further need to have to do these things. And as soon as one attains that no further need to have to do one of these things, one would find he would suddenly snap back to all of the power that he possibly could want. At which moment he probably turns around, and he's so mad at everybody because of that time he spent there being right that he rights the various wrongs that he was going to right, and he probably will take a dip at that point and then he'll come back up again. And there will be various curves and toboggans along on this road that will probably look very dizzy, but that's okay. So that's the way it is. Now, we're undoing – we're undoing, then – this obsession to itsa by using it. And be-cause the dependency on it is so great, you'll never get a bank taken apart, as far as I'm con-cerned, until it has been utilized to its full. Now, self-determinism, pan-determinism, personal beingness, personal power, re-stored to the individual, is done on the road of minimal help, maximal recovery of self-determinism – or maximal recover of self-ability to itsa. See? That's up. Now, as the case goes along, its progress is measured directly and immediately by the degree that this is returned into the pc's hands. Therefore, you could get a fantastic number of engrams run – now let me show you how you can mess this up, see – you get a fantastic number of engrams run and a fantastic number of GPMs run, and the pc would be foggy and wouldn't be much alert, and so on. Oh, you haven't really harmed him. You've slowed down the recovery in just this one way, by every time the pc says \"Uh ... let me see, there's a picture here, and I think it's a...\" \"Oh, all right, I'll date it for you. Is it greater than a hundred trillion years ago? Is it less than a hundred trillion years ago? Was it a hundred trillion years ago? It's less than. All right, is it greater than eighty trillion years ago? Less than eighty trillion? It's less than,\" so forth and so forth. \"The date is so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so.\" And the pc says, \"Oh, all right. Hm-hm. Okay.\" See? See the nonsense involved in this thing? And it just goes much more subtly, see, much more subtly: \"You know, I think I must have been one of the Brobdingnagians.\" Little tiny head shake as one looks at the meter and sees that it didn't read on Brob-dingnagians, but did read on Lilliputians, see? And then, \"Oh, well, I didn't mean anything. I – helping you out.\" You actually have the identical problem that a mother has, auditor. And some mamas solve it and some don't. They help little Roscoe to a point where, at twenty-one, little Roscoe can't shovel soup into his gullet, see? [laughter, laughs] Of course, there's an equal extreme the other way. They don't help little Roscoe to a point where little Roscoe, at the age of twenty-one, shoots them! Puts cyanide in the soup! See, all of this is a happy mean, you see? And it isn't constant one pc to the next. That's what the trouble is, because one pc requires more help than another pc, because they're at different levels of independence. And you get a pc who has a very high level of independ-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 12 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 154 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST ence and a very deep level of aberration, and of course you've got trouble! I mean, the guy can't walk, and he keeps putting his feet in the stew and in the mud and everything else. And you watch this guy caroming off into doors, and it practically hurts, you know? \"Oh, I'll do it, I'll do it!\" and at that moment, why, spills the tureen over his head, you see? Well, that's all within the margin of an auditor. That's where his ebb and play comes in, is how much does it take to improve this guy's independence and self-determinism? How much does it take to improve his ability to know? How much help does he need in order to know? And you'll find out that's a varying quantity, see? Here's this poor guy off the street, he doesn't know which end the door is, you know? And he's helped enormously because you actually show him where the door is. It makes him a bit better. You understand, from there on he can find the door, he can itsa the door from there on out. See? So you haven't taken all of his itsas away from him. All right, well, that's the extreme case. But let's handle that extreme case wrong. Let's handle this just dead wrong: We tell him he never can know where the door is. See? And let's build him a special set of rails so that when he walks toward the door he runs into it. And every time he walks around that particular end, why, he'll collide with the door, see? Well, at this point, of course, you have exceeded the degree of. In other words, you haven't helped him at all. You have deteriorated his ability. And what you want to do is take what ability you have, that you find there, don't you see, and gradually uncreate any dependence that is created. And the perfect formula is reduce it. See? Give him all the help he needs to get along and then gradually reduce it. That is al-ways safe. Give him whatever help he needs to get along and then reduce it – which makes something like 3N into about four or five different routines, which is quite remarkable. And eventually, why, he isn't even given a line plot. But that's getting pretty adventurous, don't you see, because he can get himself in more trouble without a line plot. It's almost a dirty trick to turn somebody loose into a wildcat GPM before he's run a few that are line-plotted, you know? You can make a pc fly, but then the pc says, \"I don't think – I don't think, I don't think this sequence follows on through this way. I think it cuts off someplace here. Something cuts off.\" \"Well, follow your line plot! Follow your line plot! The line plot. Give me the next item, the next item. That's what I want, next item.\" \"Yeah, but... \" \"Next item!\" Well, even if it was there, the pc sooner or later is going to be right enough to con-vince you that it isn't – because you never let him find out. Now, combining all of this nice sense of judgment is the extra bonus of your own flubs, because you cannot reduce them to zero. Don't ever try. Don't ever go beating your brains out. Because you get caught in cross-plays of communication where you didn't quite understand what the pc said when you thought you did, don't you see? And so you said, then, at that time – the pc is saying, \"Let's see, what was that series we found? It was – let's see, I think I found early – earlier that such a series we found...\" and so on."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 13 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 155 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Well, you say, \"Well, you've already found it, you see? It's been found for several ses-sions, and it's 25.4 trillion years ago,\" see? And he's trying to find this date, you see? He's trying to re-remember what the date is, and you're just trying to get the series started, see? So you say, \"Well, that was – that – oh, you're talking about the 25.4-trillion-year-ago series.\" He says, \"Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I don... I-I do – get the.... No, you see, that isn't the point. Um...\" And you finally let him stagger through this, because you've, see, flicked his attention and slipped him the mickey with the wrong communication line because you didn't under-stand. That wasn't what he was saying at all. He's trying to find that lock incident that de-fended on the series, and his communication being a little bit blurry, why, he's not really communicating what he thinks he is communicating to you, so you make a mistake on it. And because the pc's communication line is so often fogged up in session, for an auditor, then, to do a perfect job of handling the communication line is impossible, because it depends upon the pc's articulation and communication being perfect. Sometime a pc will say something to you like this: \"Well, I suppressed my gains for this session.\" And what do you do? Well, is he giving you an itsa? Is he announcing a catas-trophe? Is he getting off a suppression? See? Does he want you to do something? What's the intention of his communication? Well, maybe he doesn't even know, either. And almost any-thing you answer to this, you're going to be wrong! See? So don't go around in fear of being wrong, and don't teach people to be afraid that they're going to mishandle one of these lines, because you're teaching them to be afraid of something that's going to be inevitable – inevitable. The pc all of a sudden looks up and he gets a starey-eyed look in his eye and he says, \"Say, I don't think that's true.\" You're running a Helatrobus implant, you see, and \"Say, I don't – I don't think that's true.\" And you say, \"Well, what?\" He says, \"That. You know? I just don't think it is.\" Well, what do you do? Is he talking about the Helatrobus implants? Probability not. He's skipped into something. What's happened here? What's he collided with? We don't know. All right, to ask him for more data than he's got is a fatal auditing error, so we ask him for more data than he's got and we are in trouble. We don't ask him for the data he does have, we are in trouble. Don't you see? Because, these are the troubles of handling an indefinite communication line, and troubles always originate. The communication line at its source is indefinite, so therefore the handling of it becomes a situation. So that just makes you have to get very slippy. And you have to learn various things about the intention line which we're not particularly discussing today. \"Do you want to tell me about it?\" Ha-ha-ha-ha – cut your throat. How do you put the pc's attention on anything? How do you put his attention on a chair? You say \"chair,\" don't you? How do you put his attention on a house? You say \"house,\" don't you? How do you put"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 14 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 156 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST his attention on a date? You say \"date,\" don't you? How do you put the pc's attention on the auditor? You say \"auditor,\" don't you? \"Do you want to tell me about it?\" Clang! Out of ses-sion, ARC break, house falling down, everything going to pieces, gains being wrapped up, everything betrayed – Christ, what happened? Ha-ha! You in vain try to trace back anything you did. Naturally, you tend to blame yourself for it. Well, you, in actual fact, didn't do anything except inadvertently direct the pc's attention in a direction where it wasn't going and give him a sudden attention shift, because of your misunderstanding of what the pc was talking about in the first place. Do you see the liabilities of this kind of thing? So, know how to do it right, and do it right most of the time! See? That's the only thing you can expect and hope for. All right. This pc itsa line is going to get better to the degree that it is permitted to ex-ist. This doesn't mean to the degree that you let the pc talk, necessarily. It means the degree that you keep the pc's attention directed in directions where he can find things to identify: in his bank. And when he's found things in his bank to identify, let him identify them. He says – you say, \"All right. Now, I want you to take a look at that incident there that has the robots in it. Good. All right. That's fine. All right.\" And he says, \"Say,... \" \"Yes, I know. They're robots.\" Well, I'd just say that was too corny for words, see? All right, you keep up that sort of thing with a pc very long, and you tell him what he is looking at always – see, it isn't a 100 percent proposition there, either. You sometimes tell a pc what he's looking at, see? You put his attention on the track to some incident that you know is there, and he doesn't know is there, well, you're certainly giving him something to itsa, aren't you? So you've given him something to itsa, and he'll start itsaing it, happy as a clam, see? But if you prevent his itsaing it after you have given it to him to itsa, you will see a gradual deterioration over a period of intensives – now, not one session, it's a long period – of his ability to identify. You'll see this deteriorating. You're creating a dependence on your metering. You can create a dependence on your recognition, a dependence on his confirmation as to whether or not he's right. He says, \"Well, I don't know if it was the cowboys in the white hats or the black hats, and cow ... You look on the meter,\" he will say. \"Look on the meter.\" One of the ways an auditor gets this started is invalidating a pc's data. He invalidates the pc's data a little bit, and – you know, tends to somewhat, and sounds doubtful, and the pc sounds this – and finally the pc will say \"Look on the meter.\" And the auditor cuts his throat and looks on the meter. See? It's a case of he should say, \"Well, I believe you. I don't have to prove it,\" see? \"If you don't believe me, look at the meter.\" Proper response is, \"Well, I believe you. Go ahead, tell me what it is. \" Don't look on the meter."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 15 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 157 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Eventually you'll get a habit started whereby every time the pc wants to communicate anything to you, he convinces you by showing you that it bangs on the needle. And his itsa line will start deteriorating. See, this can be done in various ways. That's confirming his itsa line, which leaves him with no positiveness. It leaves him with no sensitivity as to what's right and what's wrong. Well, that's an ability that you are trying to improve. And if you look on it as an ability that you're trying to improve and as the chief ability which is there to be improved in a case, you really won't make many mistakes on it. Your mistakes will be cut to a minimum. But if you look on a case as something from which significances have to be removed in any way that they can be removed, regardless of the self-determinism of the pc and regardless of his ability and regardless of his knowingness and his recognition and so forth, oddly enough, you will still make it, but you've multiplied your time factor considerably. Time factor is going way up – ten to one, something like that – because you're deteriorating his ability. Now, just auditing the pc in general, you'll see you will inevitably get an improvement of the ability by the removal of charge. Now, if at the same time you're creating a depend-ency, to the degree that you're increasing – you see? You can increase and decrease, and whereby he's getting more track and more charge in his vicinity, his actual potential of im-provement is being cut back by his dependency on the itsa of the auditor, see? It improves anyhow. But the auditor is cutting it back, and he's just costing himself more auditing time, more auditing time, more auditing time, more auditing time. More difficulty, more ARC breaks, more upsets. There's many a – many a way, many a way by which all this can be handled in various ways. See, you have what you call an ARC breaky type pc. Well now, this pc probably has a high degree of independence and probably has a high degree of itsa ability already, but possi-bly is a bit swamped with charge, see? All right. Now we take this pc and we deteriorate his ability to itsa, you see, by creat-ing a dependency on the auditor. You know, by telling him everything, by telling him every-thing. You know, \"That read. That didn't read,\" and so on. Of course, the funny part of it is – there's one other point of this I should mention in passing – if you don't tell a pc when an item is finally discharged, in the early stages of running GPMs, he'll leave items charged, and the mechanics of the bank will cause him to bounce and ARC break. See? So that again is one of these factors whereby you're putting in the itsa line – \"itsa discharge.\" Now, but sooner or later the pc is going to start telling you when it is discharged. Well, that's damn well when you better stop telling the pc that it's clean. Do you understand? You just better stop telling him at that point. Ah, but you've got an interesting problem here. Maybe you've stopped telling him at the point where he still can't tell. Now you're going to have hell raised, because you're going to have him stuck in incidents. You're going to have RIs live all over the place, you're going to have his postulates live and so forth. I think I'd start working on a campaign on him: \"Well, run it until you're very sure it's flat\" is the kind of a campaign I'd start running, is \"Get that item until you're very sure it's flat.\""},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 16 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 158 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"All right,\" he says, \"that's flat.\" \"Okay, say it again. Good. Fine. You're right, that's flat,\" see? And he all of a sudden, \"See, I can tell you.\" You know? \"All right, good. Good,\" see? \"Fine.\" And wean him. And gradually don't check, see? Don't check. Say, \"All right, I can depend on you.\" Because he can tell you, eventually, when it's flat. He'll also get very bored with an item and leave it half-unflat. You can sometimes make a citizen out of him by letting him do so. Trouble is, he's liable to have bounced and gone into something else. Now, there's various problems involved here. I'm not trying to tell you this is simple. Don't get so involved in the problems, however, that you miss the basic mechanics of the situation. Basic mechanics of the situation: the pc is the one who is living with this bank, and if he can't tell what's in it, and so forth, he can't live with it. Obvious? I mean, that's one of these ne plus ultra things. You're unfortunately, or fortunately, not going to be at his side for the next two hundred trillion billion squillion years. See, you're not going to be there telling him whether it is a GPM, you see? Going to have to find this out for himself. So sooner or later, you're going to have to kick him off with regard to this bank. The time to start is when you start auditing him. You start auditing him, why, start weaning him. Don't increase his dependency. Decrease it. Give him all the help he needs! But isn't that a tricky statement? How much help does he need? Well, you know if he doesn't have line plots and a design on the track and the concepts of life, and that sort of thing – if he does-n't have something like that, he'll never put his foot on the road at all. And we know that if he doesn't have a line plot for a standard GPM that he's got to run, and so forth, we know he'll wrap himself around a telegraph pole, man. He'll practically finish himself off by giving you wrong items and upside-down items and missing items, and so forth. And the next thing you know, why, the penalty is much worse than the cure, here. See? Well, where do we go? Well, how much help do we give him? Well, we give him all the help he needs. How much help does he need? Well, that is something you establish indi-vidually in each pc. You're going to get ahold of some pc sometime or another – you know, he possibly hasn't been down here long, or he got here by accident, or something of the sort. And this pc cognites on the Axioms, knocks out the bank, does Change of Space Processing between your auditing room and the next building for a while, goes around and thanks you very much; you're left with your jaw dropped because you haven't had an opportunity to get your meter on and tested. [laughter] Well, don't feel so betrayed that you didn't get a chance to audit. You audited. So, there are various degrees by which you have to approach this problem, and that's the differ-ence of pc's. Now, these very, very ARC breaky pcs sometimes get a reputation for being ARC breaky and they get very upset this way and so on. It's actually where their concept of their"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINE (CONTINUED) 17 SHSBC-326 – 21.8.63 LEVEL 0 159 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST own independence is being invidiously cut up by people putting itsas in for them. And the charge on the bank is too great, so that they get into this stuff and they'll dramatize at the drop of a hat. And this is upsetting to them. It's more upsetting to them to dramatize, but how did they dramatize? They dramatized only because somebody put in the itsa line they were not able to. So, what do you do with such a pc? Well, a pc who's routinely ARC breaky must ob-viously have something wrong with the itsa line. Well, he wasn't the result of auditing – it was probably something that occurred before auditing, because we are not in the business of aber-rating people. Well, it must have occurred in some aberrative area. Well, you can do such a thing, as give them an eighteen-button Prepcheck on the itsa line. Simple. Now, an eighteen-button Prepcheck is not thrown out by the itsa line because the eighteen buttons are the select choice, very best, grade A, straight-from-the-ocean itsas. You realize that a Prepcheck is almost the perfect series of itsas. Most powerful buttons, so they're most powerful itsas in existence since the beginning of the universe. \"Since your beginning of travail, has anything been suppressed?\" Wonder how long that would run. But that's an itsa, because he must have itsa'd by suppressing. So you're getting off the crisscross, see? If he suppressed it, then he can itsa it. If you get the suppression off, then he can itsa. These are almost perfect itsa lines. The Prepcheck actually comes into its own. But very interesting about a Prepcheck: you can prepcheck the itsa line. See, on that? That takes the cake, man. Now, you take one of these very ARC breaky pcs that has a very great reputation for being ARC breaky, and you put the itsa line into some comprehensible thing. Very often, if you just explain to them what the itsa line is and prepcheck it, you'll be better off than trying to redefine something, because you won't then be prepchecking the itsa line. But this takes some doing. An auditor has always got to be able to interpret the auditing command and clarify the auditing command so that the pc knows what it is. One of the best ways to clarify an auditing command like \"Recall an ARC break\" is explain an ARC break and give it to him, because you use any other word, you'll run into some GPM – almost certain to run into GPMs. \"ARC break\" is contained in no GPM and therefore is a totally nonbackground word. See? Give him a new word, new symbol. All right, so you say, \"Itsa line – well, your – your recognition of things. Your consid-eration of things. What you think life is all about. Your opinions. You know, somebody says, 'What's a cat?' and you say, 'It's a four-legged animal.' I mean, your right to do that.\" You know, go on, go on, explain it any way you want. Prepcheck the itsa line. Or get some other designation for it. But prepcheck it. And you'll be very fascinated that the pc who is the ARC breaky pc is not really ARC breaking because of auditing and bypassed charge. This pc's itsa line is cut right here and now as his most colossal PTP – by something else, nothing to do with auditing. I'll give you a marvelous example of how somebody's itsa line is cut right here and now: He's on this planet, isn't he? If he tries to get off, he hits the between-lives area.

See, there's all kinds of ways of cutting the itsa line, don't you see? No reason to dream them all up for the pc. Put in a Prepcheck on his itsa line. You'll be astonished. He'll make some case progress – sudden case progress, and cease to be ARC breaky. Other ways of attacking this same problem sometimes give us the very, very fascinat-ing and interesting aspect of somebody who has found that the ARC break is a solution to some problem. So he solves the problem by ARC breaking. There's various ramifications, but he normally runs into this when you prepcheck the itsa line. You have a big piece of under-standing here. It's a big, new, whole piece of understanding. It's a new piece of the jigsaw puzzle which has fitted into place and made citizens out of most of the center pieces, and has shown us that there's just this little few out here on the edge, of how come a guy had to iden-tify and familiarize himself in order to feel alive or secure? How come a guy got into an ob-sessed necessity to itsa? That little piece is about the only piece missing right now, and it's up here in the corner.

The first is the Pc's line to his bank. The Itsa Maker line. 2. The second is the Pc's line to the Auditor. The Itsa line. 3. The third is the Auditor's line to the Pc. The What's-it line. Now the definition, \"Willing to talk to the Auditor\", is very easy to interpret as \"Talk-ing to the Auditor\". So the Auditor cuts the line the Pc has to the bank in order to get the Pc to talk, because \"It's the Itsa line that blows the charge,\" he says. So the Auditor cuts the Pc's communication line with his bank in order to bring about an Itsa line – and then he wonders why he gets no TA action and why the Pc ARC Breaks. This cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye. It's hidden because it's from the Pc – a Thetan unseen by the Auditor – to the Pc's bank – unseen by the Auditor. The Auditor is simply there to use the What's-it line in order to get the Pc to confront his bank. The charge blows off it to the degree that it's confronted and this is represented by the Itsa line. The Itsa line is a report on what has been as-ised, that gives it its flow.

Thank you very much. Now, what is the date, here? What's the date? Audience: Sixth of February. February what? Audience: Six. Six – sixth of February. What year? Audience: AD 14. Thank you. Thank you. February 6, AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. I'm go-ing to talk to you about a very arduous subject. The subject is the communication cycle, and I think you might like to know something about the communication cycle as used in auditing. It's a new subject – [laughter] new to many. [laughs] If you look over communication, you'll find out that the magic of communication is about the only thing that makes auditing work. And if you could sit down to a meter – a one-hand electrode – all by yourself and run some process on yourself, it'd make a citizen out of you. And the reason it'd make a citizen out of you, is you'd see a little bit of tone arm action at first, or if you tripped across something like an active, loud, large GPM, why, you might get yourself a quarter or a half a tone arm division, or a couple of needle flashes. Now, you can always get a needle flash. You can always get something of that sort. Now, the amount of tone arm action you would get doing this would make you blink, because it's none. And you could run some hot process on you that had been run by some auditor and which gave him good TA, you see? This process that has been run, give you good TA, when the auditor was auditing it. Then you sit down there with a one-hand electrode while the process is still hot and run the commands on yourself, you're going to get for a mo-ment the residual of the auditing. That is to say, the auditor will have stirred up enough so that you'll see a little bit of charge go off, and then your tone arm is going to go dead – and it's going to stay dead. Now, the reason for this has to do with the thetan in this universe. Now, he has begun to consider himself MEST, and he's begun to consider himself mass. And the being who con-siders himself mass, of course, responds to the laws of electronics and the laws of Newton,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 2 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 166 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST and is actually incapable of generating very much, you see, or – which was what we're inter-ested in – as-ising very much. There's not very much going to disappear there in the way of mass. And this is a very discouraging sort of an activity. Now, I have had to explore this particular field of auditing – self-auditing, because most anybody does it, and so forth. And what was this all about. And I have even gotten am-bitious enough to run an actual GPM, bangity-bangity-bangity-bang, on a one-hand electrode. That makes your hair stand on end. Well, it made my hair stand on end. And my auditor fished me out. It didn't kill me, I was able to breathe afterwards – that is, if I didn't move much. [laughter] But the same GPM, run with the same items and so forth, would produce upwards to 175 TA divisions, down. And the GPM, self-audited, produced 2. Now, what was this all about? What was this all about? It tells us (now, it isn't that ex-periment; other experiments were made in this particular line) – and it tells us that an individ-ual considers himself MESTy, or massy, if you see? And therefore he has to have a second terminal. And a second terminal is required to discharge the energy. Now, a lot of auditors go further than this, and they go downhill to a point where they think they're being the second terminal to the degree that they think they pick up the somatics and illnesses of the person they're auditing. Well, get that. Actually, there is no backflow of any kind hits the auditor. There is no backflow hits the auditor of any kind. But if he is so convinced that he himself is MEST, why, of course, he will turn on somatics and everything else in echo to the pc, because he's simply doing a matched terminal with the pc, don't you see? Actually, nothing hits the auditor. It has to be mocked up or envisioned by him. I think you find that's quite amusing, because there are whole schools of healing, back in the early days of Greece particularly, where they picked up the pain out of somebody's 'ead, or off somebody's arm, and they got the somatic very nicely and took it away and dumped it in the trash bin. Spiritual healing has this in its textbooks, and so forth. Well, that is its genus, is just this two-pole proposition. Now, you don't have to know anything about electricity or electronics in order to go into this very deeply, but it's obvious to you that for a motor to run or for something to occur, like a light go on, that two poles have to be involved. And energy passing between two termi-nals, or two poles, makes an interchange, and it gives you what you call electric light. Now, of course, that is the burning of energy. In this particular case you don't have the burning of energy, you have the as-ising of energy where the auditor and the pc is concerned. Now, the ability to hold a position, or the ability to hold two terminals apart, is a definition of power. Not how much energy can be thrown by a unit, but the base, the strain that is put on the base, the ability to hold these two positions. That's a little bit outside of what we're talking about. But here we have two poles. We have an auditor and a pc, and as long as the auditor audits and the pc replies, we get an exchange – an apparent exchange of energy from the pc's point of view, which doesn't hit the auditor. But because they think of themselves, don't you see, at this low, subvolitional level, as terminals, why, you get these exchanges of energy go-ing on, you see? And nothing hits the auditor, and it as-ises as far as the pc is concerned. But you have set up, in essence, a two-pole system, and that will bring about an as-ising of mass. It isn't burning the mass, it is as-ising the mass. And that's why there is nothing"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 3 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 167 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST hitting the auditor. Now, that is the essence of the situation, and the magic involved in audit-ing is contained in the communication cycle of auditing. You see, now you are handling the smooth interchange between these two poles. Eventually, the individual will get up to a point where he does not consider himself to be matter, and this no longer occurs. When you've got a pc's – half of a pc's actual GPMs run out, you start running into trouble. I'm running into that trouble right now. Unless the pc makes up her mind, or recognizes the truth of the situation, I can't knock any energy off. I can ask the question, and the meter is the deadest-looking meter you ever saw in your life. Yet there's a red-hot GPM sitting under this sort of thing. See, there'll be a red-hot item or a red-hot this or a red-hot that. But I have to ask the pc whether or not that is it. And when the pc looks at it and decides that that is it, or that isn't it, only then do I get an active meter. And this is most amazing. This is most amazing. The GPM can be sitting right there ready to read, and unless the pc has looked at it and has thought it over, why, nothing happens on the meter. Yet this same pc, before those – half of the bank was run out, don't you see? All I had to do was sneeze at the meter and I got rocket reads on anything, and the pc didn't know anything about what was rocket-reading and what wasn't rocket-reading. You get the ad-vance? The advance is upwards toward knowing one is one, see? And you get out of these automatic physical-energy manifestations of the physical universe. And getting out of these things, you then get to a point where you've got intention. Now, what is one of these GPMs, anyway, but a method of limiting the pc's ability to intend? And that is the whole idea behind implanting or anything of that nature. The whole idea is that if he intends positive, he gets negative. If he intends negative, he gets positive. So, therefore, he cannot decide. Now, if you take somebody and every time he says yes you say no, he eventually will get into an indecisional state of mind. He can no longer intend yes, completely, see? So this is how you could wear somebody down, break his spirit, or make him a private in the army. Get the idea? Every time he has a thought, you deny it. You see? There's where you get your original power of choice. The ideas of power of choice – and all such other ideas. The ideas of self-determinism versus other-determinism. All these other various ideas stem out of this alone. It is the ability to intend something. Now, somebody cannot write. He intends to write, and he'll go around talking about writing, but he doesn't write. Well, what is happening there, he is intending to write, but something is intending that he not write. And that is his mind kicking back at him, which is simply a positive-negative proposition there, of two poles. Do you see this? All right. He intends to talk Arabic, but the mind says that he can't talk Arabic. See, there's your positive-negative. He intends not to talk Arabic and finds himself chattering strange phrases, and you get these speakings in foreign tongues that the hysterical religionist very often is found to have, and so forth. In other words, you get the positive and the negative proposition. Well, a person has to be very MESTY indeed before they are subject to these particular phenomena. And the more MESTY that they consider themselves, the more en-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 4 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 168 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST meshed in matter that they consider themselves, and the more energied up they are, why, the more trouble they have with this particular action. And, of course, as you go upscale this phe-nomena drops away as progress is made in this particular direction. Now, what value is the auditor? Well, the auditor, of course, is at his greatest value at the lowest level of the case – is necessary all the way up through to step six, end of actual GPMs, is necessary all the way. But the auditor at very low levels can produce some of the most interesting phenomena. And it was in the Dianetic days that they were able to absolutely break their hearts, because you could say to somebody so-so-so-and-so and so-and-so, and you could handle engrams, you could handle matters associated with the bank, and the pc would lose his or her arthritis, would lose psychosomatic ills of one kind or another, and never find out about it. In other words, the auditor could sit there and as-is bits of the thing, just by the auto-matic mechanical process of a two-way communication with the pc. But the pc was so snarled up and so sunk in, and considered themselves so much a brick or a piece of rock or a wooden slab, that they would never find out about it. And after the auditor had cured up somebody's lumbosis completely, why, the person would say, \"Well, yes, but you haven't done anything about my worries about my wife.\" Well, yes, he was incurable, he was bedridden, he had to go around – the most he could look forward to was a wheelchair. And the auditor would fix him all up and he's walking around now, and he complains because he hasn't had his wife straightened out. In other words, he was actually influenced without his knowledge. Do you understand this, now, from a two-pole arrangement? Wherever an individual, wherever an individual, then, thinks of himself as an animal, as matter, as a bit of mud, as algae which has coagulated into the difficulties of manhood, when you get these various things, what do you eventually see? You see a whole scientific world indulging in the philosophy of \"man is matter.\" So the spiritual values and natures of man are, of course, lost completely. Only auditing can restore these. Nothing else is going to restore them. But when you look over the difficulties of auditing, realize that you are handling sim-ply the difficulties of a communication cycle. And when you, yourself, as the auditor, do not permit a smooth flow between you as a terminal and the pc as a terminal, and the pc as a ter-minal back to you, you get a no as-ising of matter. So you don't get tone arm action. Now, part of the trick of course is what has to be as-ised, and how do you go about it? But that we call technique. And if you remove technique, if you remove technique from the area – let's not worry about the particulars, what button has to be pressed or stepped on. We're not going to wonder about this – what button. We're going to wonder only about the commu-nication cycle. We find, oddly enough, if the auditor is actually capable of making the pc will-ing to talk to him, he wouldn't have to hit a button to get tone arm action. Do you see this? Now, the person who is insisting continuously upon a new technique, a new technique, or a very fancy technique, or that sort of thing, is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing, which is the communication cycle of auditing. He cannot make the pc get tone arm action. Well, he can't make the pc get tone arm action, basically, because the communication cycle doesn't exist. And when the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session, we get"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 5 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 169 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST this horrible compounding of the felony of trying to get a technique, but the technique cannot be administered to the pc because there's no communication cycle to administer it. So basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique. The communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist. And, therefore, any Case Su-pervisor is very, very well advised to merely heal up the various points and portions that are missing as far as that communication cycle is, and hit it as buttons. And in view of the fact that the auditor is trying and the auditor is doing something, to actually neglect whether or not the auditing is good or bad – that's up to an auditing Instructor, isn't it? Just neglect that. But just look at the case from the basis of \"What parts of this communication cycle are awry?\" and \"What isn't here in the form of a response to the auditing question?\" And simply heal those points up. Now, if you had a man lying unconscious in the street, you certainly wouldn't be thinking up what technique to run on him. If you wanted to bring him back to life and living-ness, what you would want to do is get him to talk to you, or breathe, or flutter an eyelid. That would be something. Oddly enough, the communication cycle all by itself will cause him to flutter that eyelid. You can take an unconscious person who has been in a coma for some time, and by picking up their hand and making them touch the pillow, and even touch your arm – you know, picking up the hand (they have no volition here) – picking up the hand, touching the shoulder, picking up the hand, touching the pillow (giving them the command at the same time, talking), and so forth, that person will come back to life. This is the greatest magic that anybody ever saw. It's very startling, but look, you're just trying to get this man into commu-nication with the auditor and communication with his surroundings. And he'll come back to battery. And there's no technique. So, that should demonstrate to you that the fundamental entrance to the case is not on a level of technique, but on a level of the communication cycle. Now, all you have to do is mark out how many branches of this communication cycle can there be. There can be a com-munication cycle between the pc and the auditor, and the pc and the auditing room. And that's about it. Now you can get particular, and you can have parts of the auditing room, or you can have specific portions of the auditor or the auditor's beingness – you can mark down to that. And then you can maybe go afield from this particular zone or area – if the person is already in a communication cycle with the auditor – you can go afield and start to address his present time problems. Now you can address whether or not his wife fixes the tea properly or puts arsenic in the coffee, as he is worried about. Now you can address that sort of thing. But this, of course, because it is distant from where you are sitting, requires a tech-nique. First you have to know what he is worried about out there because it is not present and visible for you to see, or for him to see. So the technique selects out what he is worried about – a little form of assessment, don't you see? And now you're into techniques and proc-essing, having left the field of the communication cycle. If the field of the communication cycle with the auditing room and with the auditor is all solid ground, and if all of that is squared away, you can now worry about technique."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 6 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 170 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, the auditor who comes tearing down to you sometime as – when you're D-of-Ping someplace – and the auditor who comes down and says to you, \"Ho-ha-hai, I – I just can't get anyplace on Mrs. Hepsibah. Can't get anyplace on Mrs. Hepsibah,\" and you say, \"Well, why don't you run so-and-so and so-and-so,\" will inevitably come back (you give him a technique, you see) will inevitably come back a half an hour or so later and say, \"That does-n't work either.\" And you can keep up this silly cycle for a long, long time. Because of course there is no technique being delivered to the pc because there is no communication cycle pre-sent. Now, what needs to be repaired is the communication cycle, and when you've got a communication cycle repaired, then you can audit a technique. It's as elementary as that. Now, there are many parts of this communication cycle that can be addressed, because you have the pc there and you have the auditor there. And, of course, the first part of it that has to be addressed is the fact that the person is having a session and is in a room and is being faced by an auditor. Now, if you take all those and write down the categories – you write down all the categories, all the different little bits that can be written down that are part of this (it's best for you as an auditor to imagine them rather than for me to give you a long catalog on them, you see). And then figure out how you're going to get him into communication on each one of these points, realizing that communication is simply a familiarization process based on reach and withdraw. Even when you speak to a pc, even when you speak to a person, you are reach-ing; when you cease to speak you are withdrawing. When he hears you, he has something withdrawn – and at that moment he's a bit withdrawn, don't you see? But then he reaches to-ward you with the answer. And you'll see him go into a withdraw while he thinks it all over. See, he gets back and, well, he's – \"Which – why did my grandfather have to marry the girl?\" See? And he thinks over this, and you'll see him think this over, and he thinks that cycle through on a withdrawal, don't you see? And then he will reach back to the auditor. Now, he's already reached this reason. Now he will reach the auditor with the reason, and he will say that was it. Now you have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor, and will see it reflect on a meter. Because that exchange, now, is giving an as-ising of energy. In the absence of that communication, you do not get meter action. So the fundamental of auditing – the fundamental of auditing – is the communication cycle! That's the fundamen-tal of auditing! And that is really the great discovery of Dianetics and Scientology. It is such a simple discovery that... and everybody does it. But you realize that nobody knew anything about communication when it came along. The number of – the number of chaps in commu-nication companies and that sort of thing, who fall around our neck saying, \"Really!\" you know? You say, \"Well, communication, it consists of cause, distance, effect,\" you know? \"I – yeah! By golly, it does, you know!\" Well, it's just this sort of thing. It's a fundamental that everybody knew was there. They've been watching apples fall off trees for a very long time and Newton had to come along and see an apple fall off a tree, see? And he said, \"Hey, apples fall off trees, and when they leave the tree they hit the ground!\" [laughter] See? Everybody says, \"Wow!\" you know?"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 7 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 171 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"Terrific!\" you know? And his name has gone singing down through the ages, because he noticed that apples fell off trees. It's always this sort of a – it's always this sort of a thing. It's always this sort of a thing which escapes the attention of people. Because MEST is basically very complex stuff. And being very complex (composed as it is out of electrons and molecules and minerals and gee-whizzes of all kinds or another, wavelengths and all this sort of thing), because of its tremen-dous complexity – so complex that nobody can understand it, they can only... you know? Therefore, people who are very plowed in, you might say, into matter, and who are them-selves thinking as matter, think very complexly. And they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted. And they observe none of these things. Now, you look over this. I call this to your attention. The ease with which you can handle a communication cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing. Now, we have to add to the simplicity of the communication cycle, the obnosis – the observation of the obvious. If the pc hasn't been talking to you, and if the pc hasn't said anything to you for a very long time, it is no time for you to be thinking on the subject of \"What do I say to the pc?\" You say, \"What do I say to the pc?\" Please! I invite your attention that your inspection of what you are doing should have ended with your training, and thereafter is taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc is doing or is not doing. And your handling of a communication cycle ought to be so instinctive, and so good, that you are never worried over here about what you do now. \"Let's see, am I doing it right or am I not doing it right? Let's see. I wonder how my acknowledg-ment was that time. Did I say 'Okay' in an artificial frame of voice or should I say it naturally, like 'Ooo-kaay.' No, that wasn't right.\" No. The time for you to get this all fixed up is in train-ing. And in actual auditing, the communication cycle that you watch is the pc's. That's the communication cycle you watch. You know yours is good. So you don't worry about it any-more. Now, if you know your communication cycle is good, you haven't any longer got to be upset about whether you're doing it right or not. And you ought to be well enough trained that when somebody says \"Catfish\" to you, you look at them and recognize they are no longer saying \"Catfish\" and have finished saying \"Catfish.\" And having finished saying \"Catfish,\" it is time for you to acknowledge. But you only acknowledge because they have finished the communication. And your observation is simply limited to the fact that they have completed their communication, and that is your observation. Your observation is the observation of the communication cycle of the pc. And you get good enough so that you just lay in mothballs your worry about your communication cycle when you're finished training. That's the time it goes into mothballs. You understand? You know how to do it now. Your business is the communication responses and cycles of the pc. Do you see that? This pc: You ask me, \"What technique shall we run on this pc?\" Technique! What are you doing with a technique? Let's look at the pc for a few minutes. \"Oh yes, but,\" we say, \"well, the pc has got to have something to talk about.\" Oh, come, come, come! You've been in Scientology or Dianetics all this time, and you can't dream up something for him to talk about? It's as corny as this: \"You had any problems lately?\" See? Or it's corny as this: \"How"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 8 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 172 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST are you doing?\" Let's get this pc to talk so we can see what the score is. Now this is the true, the true, touch of genius on a case. This is what makes that auditor who can crack any case, and when it's absent, has an auditor who couldn't crack an egg if he stepped on it. [laughter] This is the difference. This is the difference. It's whether or not this auditor can observe the communication cycle of the pc and repair its various lacks. Now, I'm now talking to you – when I talk to you about the auditor's communication cycle – I'm talking to you about something that's so simple. It simply consists of asking a question that the pc can answer, and then the pc – observing that the pc answers it. And when the pc has answered it, observing that the pc has completed the answer to it – that the pc has answered it and has completed his answer to it and is through answering it. And then saying \"Cheerios\" – giving him the acknowledgment – bang! Like that. Say, \"All right, you finished that.\" And then giving him something else to do. That's all. You can ask the same question. Or you can ask another question. It doesn't matter. But the communication cycle is simply asking something that the pc can answer. There's a lot of little trickery involved in this, because that includes clearing the auditing command. See? You don't say to somebody who's got a – you got a five-year-old kid. And you say to him – you say to him, \"Have you had any marital troubles lately?\" and I don't think you're going to get much of an answer. See, it requires that much good sense: Ask a question that can be answered, and then ask it of the pc so the pc can hear it and knows what he's being asked, and then the pc answers the question; and being bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question, not some other question, and then knowing – and this, by the way, is a very interestingly developed instinct – you can tell when the pc is finished. And if you don't develop that instinct, you're very often lost. You'll say, \"Well, did he end, or didn't he end?\" and so on. Well, some auditors try to make it up, making another technique inside a tech-nique, like, \"Have you finished answering that auditing question?\" Of course this is so much balderdash. You should be able to know. It is a piece of knowingness. See, you just know he's finished. He looks like he's finished, he feels like he's finished, your telepathy tells you he's finished, you get the idea? It's that esoteric. He said, \"Well, I – I didn't have a grandfather.\" And you now know that he is not go-ing to say any more. See? It's part sense. It's part his vocal intonation. You see? But it's an instinct that you develop. You know he's finished. So, knowing he's finished, then you tell him he's finished. It's like pointing out the bypassed charge, don't you see? \"You've answered it,\" you say. \"You answered it.\" Actually, if you said \"Okay, good,\" you might as well say \"you've answered it, you have now found and located the bypassed charge in answer to the question, and there it is, and you have said it.\" See? That's the magic of acknowledgment, don't you see? But, naturally, you say, \"Good,\" \"Very good,\" you know, \"All right,\" \"Okay.\" But if you got a long continuing thing, you don't want to stop him too hard. So the de-gree of stop you put on your acknowledgment is also your good sense. Because you can ac-knowledge a pc so hard and if your impingement on pcs is way up in the stars – that you fin-ish the session right there. You just end the session. You waste all that remaining two hours that you had to go."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 9 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 173 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So he's talking on a consecutive line of thought and you acknowledge as though you're not going to ask it anymore, ever. And he won't think of it anymore, ever, either. So frankly, now, when you've acknowledged it, you knew he was finished and you said he was finished by acknowledging it, and then you gave him something else to answer! Now, that-aho-hu-rrrrrrmmm! Second we got into itsa, we got into trouble, man! Because we dropped out giv-ing him something else to answer. And an auditor will sit there without giving the pc anything to do. And you've got to develop a sensitivity. When did that pc finish answering what you asked? At that point you say \"Cheers,\" and give him the next question. But when you don't have that sensitivity, the pc answers it, gets nothing from you, you sit there and look at him; his social machinery goes into response that \"We must not be sitting here quietly doing nothing.\" Some pcs take up humming, I hear – [laughter] because the audi-tor hasn't acknowledged and given him a new question! The auditor just is not there, that's all. Now, it's all very well to do that sort of thing in training, and it's forgivable, but not in an auditing session, really. Now, after all. Pc's finished answering the question, \"Cheers! Thank you. Good. All right.\" Now you know you've acknowledged something. You finished off that cycle, so you better ask him, \"Do fish swim?\", man! \"Are there any other problems you've been worried about?\" See, he's finished that one. \"Anything else upset you between sessions?\" See? But be in there, man! Don't stand there tanglefooted saying, \"What do I do now? Oh!\" Because at this point the pc is going to overrun. He's going to start making a ses-sion out of it, he's going to go on to auto. And what did I just tell you about self-auditing? It gives no tone arm action. So the degree that the pc hasn't any communication cycle with the auditor, he doesn't get tone arm action. So then the degree that the pc is sitting there all by himself, self-auditing, gives you no tone arm action. And that's actually – the absence of tone arm action is the degree of self-audit the pc is indulging in. You understand this cycle? All right, well, that's all there is to that cycle. That's all there is to that cycle. Now, for heaven's sakes, get yours sufficiently well repaired that you don't have to worry about it after training. And after that, spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repair the communica-tion inabilities of the pc, and you'll be a genius, man! You crack 99 percent of the cases that walk in. A screaming genius! People will look at you, \"Wow!\" you know? Well, this fellow is awful worried because his wife's waffling and ran off with a \"waf-waf, and so forth, waf-waf-waf-waf-waf-waf-waf. \" and you say, \"Thank you,\" and he goes \"Waf-waf-waf...\" \"Thank you.\" \"... waf-waf-waf-waf...\" \"Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I heard – I heard about your wife running off with the chauffeur. Tha – thank you. I got that. I – I – I got that! I heard it. Yeah, yeah. Good! Thank you! All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. All right.\" Guy will be looking at you like a snake that has just been faced with a shotgun, see? \"What has entered into my perimeter? Is there something else around here?\" [laughter] \"I could have sworn I heard somebody speak.\" [laughter]"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 10 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 174 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST A lot of you take over a case, and the guy is going, \"Yip-yip-yap-yap-yap.\" And he says, \"Waffle, waffle, waf and so forth and so on, and so on and I really don't have any and so on and all these lollipops, they keep coming out of the wah-blah-blah...\" You say, \"Thank you.\" And he goes, \"Wa-wa-wana-nawa-wa\" You say, \"Thank you.\" And \"Wa-wa. And then the – all the lollipops and the wife ran away with the chauf-feur, and so on. And it's all very terrible...\" And you say, \"Thank you,\" and so forth. \"And it's all very terrible and the wife ran away with the lollipops and, oh, the chauf-feur came out, and...\" Oh, don't be an idiot and sit there and let this go on forever. He isn't talking to any-body. Now, that's what you've got to recognize. Let's get down to some of these problems here. Let's get down. What is this guy doing with his communication cycle? You want to know how to bust cases, that's how you bust them. What's he doing? I'll give – you an idea. Let me give you a very, very high school, way – upstairs analysis of this situation, show you how far this can go – way up in the clouds. Bang! Pc takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question. Now, the auditor, see, in this particular case, he knows Scientology. He knows it backwards, forwards and upside down, see? Guy takes twenty minutes to answer the auditing question, and in that answer of the auditing question, doesn't answer it. Now, the very smart auditor, the very, very, very smart auditor, in repairing this communica-tion cycle from the pc, would look at that, and he'd have three processes just like that. Three processes he'd know he'd have to do on this pc. Pang, pang, pang! This, I told you is very high school, see? It's very up. Very upstairs. (1) Pc cannot have an auditing question. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Didn't answer the question, so he couldn't have gotten it. So your first process would be \"What auditing ques-tion wouldn't you mind being asked?\" or \"What auditing question should you be asked?\" or \"What question could you answer?\" This is getting very elementary, isn't it? \"What question wouldn't you mind answering?\" You say that's running him at effect. No, it isn't, because you're asking him to have the power of choice over what question. You'd be surprised. You could probably run that as a repetitive process for an hour or two, and everything would get much brighter to this person. Person would say, \"Terrific process! Absolutely terrific process. Never heard of such a process before! When did you dream that process up?\" I mean, dream a process up, be damned. You just start processing him on a part of the communication cycle. Now let's get more esoteric. Let's get much more esoteric. If he says he hasn't had any auditing, we obviously would adjudicate that he can't have any auditing. But we'd have to repair something of the communication cycle of \"What question wouldn't he mind answer-ing?\" before we could ask him a question that he would answer. Quite obvious, isn't it? So you'd have to take first things first. And then we would have to find out about this auditing"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 11 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 175 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST thing, and I think you'd find out, as your second process, it'd be necessary for you to get him to get the concept of wasting auditing, and others wasting auditing. Well, if he can't have it, he's wasting it, because it's sitting in front of him. Can't have auditing. Well, if you got him to waste it in concept for a few minutes or a half an hour or a ses-sion or something like this, \"Get the idea of you wasting auditing.\" \"Get the idea of some-one...\" not have him pick up anything on recall, man, because if you're auditing a case like that, you're obviously auditing somebody who doesn't dare go back on the backtrack. So don't say, \"What auditing have you had that you wouldn't mind?\" you see, because you're asking him to go into the past. Well, obviously, that is like going out into the outer perimeter. The past is not in the session. That's going abroad, isn't it? Memory processes, and that sort of thing, are out of the session and out of the communication cycle. That's something you repair after you've got somebody in session. So your next process would be, as I said, waste auditing. \"Get the idea of wasting au-diting.\" \"What could you do here that would waste auditing?\" That's very good, you see? \"What could an auditor do here that would waste auditing?\" Because a person can't have something, they must waste it. If he isn't getting auditing, he must not be able to have it. I mean, let's get elementary. Let's go way back to 1952, get Elementary Have. The ability to do. You could also get him to waste communication or anything else, but I'm just dreaming up three processes in a row here. Your first one is what question could he answer, see, wouldn't he mind answering; your next one is \"Get the idea of wasting auditing\"; and the third one, \"Who would I have to be to audit you?\" Now you've done a subvert, here. You've gone below the session. See, you've brought him up to a point where he could hear the fact that you're going to ask him a very significant question. After I did that, I'd maybe work on his memory. Because those three points would really be healed. You'd see that whole case change. You'd see that whole case change. And yet you're worried because he keeps talking about his lollipops running out with – away with his wife, or something of the sort. And you just get fixated on the fact. You say, \"This guy can't be audited because he talks all the time, all the time, all the time, about lollipops and the chauffeur, and it goes on and on and on and on and on. And, therefore, if we don't – if we don't remedy this button about the lollipops, the chau – \" Why, hell's bells, he doesn't even know what he's talking about. It's whether or not he can receive an acknowledgment, whether or not he can receive an auditing question, whether or not he can have an auditing session, whether or not he can sit in an auditing room, whether or not he can have an acknowledgment, whether or not, you see, he can say something to the auditor, whether or not – so forth. You get all the little processes that go with this, see? Now, the person took twenty minutes to answer an auditing question and didn't answer it for those twenty minutes. Three processes. Based on what? Just your knowledge of Scientology and what the pc is doing in front of you. Simple, huh? All right, we got a pc who's sitting there, and he doesn't say anything. Let's take an-other case, let's just do all this off the cuff. Pc isn't saying anything. \"...Yeah.\""},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 12 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 176 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"All right. Do birds fly?\" (You're running some process, you know?) \"Do birds fly? I'll repeat the question...\" \"...oh, hmm. Oh, hmm. (sigh) Yeah.\" Well, let's dream up a process. We obviously can't have \"What question wouldn't you mind my asking you?\" because he's sitting there silent, man. Probably not a question of being asked a question, it's a question of not being able to respond to a question. Let's take it apart, let's find out what the pc is doing, dream up something accordingly, see? So we say, \"What could you say to me?\" Elementary. Long comm lag, and he finally says something he can say to you. You get this question over somehow to him. What could he say to you? And he finally says, \"I – I could say hello.\" Good, big win, see? All right, let's build this up on a gradient. Next thing you know, you've got him talking to you. But you see, if you don't have the auditing cycle going from the pc to the auditor, if you have tremendous communication disabilities on the part of the pc, you actually don't have any auditing cycle going that will discharge energy, and so you don't have tone arm action. That simple? That's all there is to it, actually. So, as soon as he can talk to the auditor, don't get so overjoyed about this wonderful change in him that you cease, now, to inspect his com-munication cycle. Because if you've cured that, you will now find another piece of it that's missing. In other words, you can go the whole way. Do you see? After he's gotten so that he can say something to you, well now, now you might have to figure out what would he answer, don't you see? And now you might have to figure out if he could have an auditor. Now you might even go so far as to find out what constituted get-ting better. I don't think you have to invent a process as complicated as \"What would be worse than getting better?\" But what the pc isn't doing is where – well, let me put it this way, there's a little formula involved: It's what the pc isn't doing that it might be possible for the auditor to get him to do. See? That's the – that's the formula. It isn't what isn't the pc doing that we're going to get him to do – what is the missing ability? Because obviously he's not OT, so you say, \"All right, be OT.\" Now, you're going to have a lose here. I'm afraid that's going to be a lose. Do you see? So, it's what can you get the pc to do that the pc can regain the ability in doing? See, that's the formula on which you're operating. And, operating on that formula, you can find all sorts of things. You can thresh around in the environment of the pc, one way or the other, and if you're an alert auditor, you'll see these little disabilities showing up here and there, and so forth. A stammerer is about the easi-est diagnosis anybody ever had anything to do with. But how many stammerers have I seen being audited on processes and techniques? Well, it's absolutely foolish to audit a stammerer on a technique. He obviously is having difficulty communicating. What are you doing in an auditing session, doing anything but to improve his ability to communicate to the auditor? Now, you might find something silly like this happen if you were auditing somebody who stammered: that he would talk to the auditor eventually with complete clarity – still stammered to other people. Well, this is quite obvious. This is extremely obvious what you would now do. We now – you don't now instantly extend it to other people, because there are"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 13 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 177 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST other pieces of the communication abilities right there in the session to be straightened up before you go out into the outer perimeter of the society. And usually where the auditor gets his lose is he repairs something, gets a big win, and then there's thirty other things to be re-paired, sitting right in front of his face – right in front of him – and he doesn't. He does some kind of a jump into memory, or engram running, or something. My God, just because the pc is now perfectly willing to talk to you is no reason that the pc – who a few minutes ago could not remember anything – it's no reason he now can remember something. That's another abil-ity. Let's say somebody is trying to improve their memory. Well, you improve somebody's memory after you've got somebody who can receive an auditing question and answer it, and then receive the acknowledgment resulting therefrom, and who can sit there in an auditing session and be a pc and be audited. Now you can go about improving memory, but oddly enough, memory improvement starts with being able to remember something in the auditing room, not something that happened to him eight trillion years ago. It begins just a minute ago. I've seen a pc absolutely ruined, become unauditable, by repetitively being asked ques-tions having to do with memory that the pc couldn't answer. So another rule in observing the communication cycle, and so forth, is don't ask the pc to do things the pc can't do. And if you've inadvertently asked the pc to do something the pc now can't do, well, for heaven's sakes, be enough on the ball, be sharp enough, be really bright on this and recognize that you've asked the pc something the pc can't do, and therefore you've given a lose, and you bet-ter not compound the lose. Don't ask them to do the same thing again that they now can't do. This goes very elementary. You talk about flattening processes. Very often you're ask-ing a pc a process, you see? \"From where could you view catfish?\" See? \"From where could you view catfish?\" \"From where could you view catfish?\" And the pc finally says, \"That's all the answers there are.\" And you know, the process had better be flattened. So you say, \"Well, from where could you view catfish?\" And he says, \"Well, that's all the answers there are.\" And you say, \"From where could you view catfish?\" And now he has to invent an an-swer, and you're running a create process. Your pc, if he doesn't ARC break, snarls up right there. I always respect a pc saying, \"There aren't any more answers.\" I bail out of there in a hurry. And when I ask the pc – when I ask the pc \"From where could you view catfish?\" and – we just took off into the blue here – \"From where could you view catfish? See? That's the question I want you to answer now. Answer the question.\" And the pc says, \"I'm sorry, I – I never viewed any catfish,\" I know right away I have been guilty of giving the pc an auditing question which the pc couldn't answer, and I am guilty of not having cleared the auditing question. I've given the pc a lose. Let's have a pc who is very deathly afraid of touching mantels – mantelpieces. Just an invented nuttiness, see? All right, we'll say, \"All right, walk over there and touch that man-"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 14 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 178 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST telpiece.\" (We already knew he was this way, see? Or we don't know he's this way.) We say, \"Walk over there and touch that mantelpiece.\" And he says, \"Uughh, I – I – I can't do that.\" Soon as you've gotten into that situation, you got yourself a lose. Let's find out if the pc could do these things. Let's discuss this process a little bit with the pc. Like, \"How's about...\" I don't care how grammatical or esoteric or patterned you are about this, you see, because sometimes you have to be very, very communicative. And you say, \"How's about if I ask you to walk around here and touch parts of this room? What would you think about that? What if I ask you to do something like that?\" And the pc says, \"Oh, my God, I couldn't do that! Ho-ho-ho-ho, no, oh-oh! Particu-larly a mantelpi – oh-oh-oh, no! Don't ask me to do anything like that.\" You say, \"All right, I won't.\" See? Swift recovery. Now, you haven't given the pc any lose. In fact, you might have given him a little win. This caused him a spooky feeling. \"You know, I'm really – I don't really want to walk around here and touch the room.\" Ah, he's interested now. \"Well, is there anything around here you – you – you wouldn't be too upset about touching? How's that? How about – how about some question like that?\" \"Oh, I could – I wouldn't be too scared of touching that – that spot on the floor.\" \"What else wouldn't you mind looking around here and...?\" [laughter] Smooth as glass, you see? See? You cleared it, he said he couldn't do it, this intrigued him, now you can hit a gradient that he can do and build it back up, and you've got it made. Every once in a while you see something like this. But if you're not – if you're not ob-serving what the communication cycle of the pc is, why, you're adrift all the time. Pc isn't answering the question. Well, that's obvious. Maybe there's a hundred thousand remedies could be dreamed up for this particular activity, all within the perimeter of the auditing room. Pc is this way, pc is that way, pc – every time they sit down in the chair they dust the chair off very carefully and take some Kleenex and wipe the arms of the chair, and then they sit down very gingerly into the chair. You've observed this a couple of times. Well, there's no point in bringing it sharply to their attention, but you must realize, it must be borne home to you – with that much exaggeration, certainly it'd bring it home – that this pc doesn't want to touch very much around an auditing session. I mean, that would be an elementary observation, don't you see? It might have to do with chairs, it might be a GPM, but you can't run all of that. Let's just chalk this up. Let's chalk this up. Pc gingery on this subject. Obviously, somewhere up the line you're going to run some objective process on this pc – somewhere up the line. But ahead of that there might be some much more attainable, but much less obvious thing, such as the pc never looks at the auditor. That might be touchable. \"If you looked over here, what would you see?\" Doesn't really require him to look over there. He only need guess at it. \"What might you see?\" You could even soften it up to that, don't you see?"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 15 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 179 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST There's all kinds of things here that depend on auditor observation. Where the pc breaks down in his communication cycle with the auditor and where the pc breaks down in his communication cycle with the environment is your entrance point to the case. Those are the entrance points to the case. If you haven't got him squared around so that he can respond to the auditor, he of course can't answer any auditing question, so what's this technique worry?. Why are you worried about a technique? No technique you ever dreamed up is going to arrive. Well, you have some fortuitous feeling that an automaticity will turn on in the pc and answer you. Well, that's how you're going to get the pc getting well and never finding out about it. They ran into that in Dianetics. They could actually run 'em through an engram. The engram was so easy to trigger, and the bank responds to the auditor so beautifully, that practi-cally the whole session could be carried on without the presence or benefit of a pc. PC didn't have to enter into it – and case loses occurred resultingly. But these are the ways you crack cases. And the best way to study it is just walk around it and take a look at all possible ramifications that could be done about it, get some acquaintance with processes from '52, '53, '55, wonder which one of these processes are ap-plicable to what, don't you see? There's all kinds of these processes. First Saint Hill, \"Who would I have to be to audit you?\" see? That's a nice process, see? But there's tons of these processes you can... oh, Lord! Well, they're being cataloged now, lots of them. But they're honeys. They're honeys. Sometimes you find a pc can't, absolutely cannot run some process because one leg of it is wrong. Let's say SCS, and yet the pc can't stand still. And it's required in the process to stand still, and yet you're running Start, Change and Stop on the pc. Well, the pc's disability is the pc can't stand still. The pc can start, the pc can change and the pc can stop, as long as they don't have to stop much. So you say, well, we can flatten stop – this will be all right. Oh, no, there must be a leg underlying this. See, a pc disability – the pc cannot stand still. Well, what would you do about something like this? Well, I'll tell you what not to do about it: neglect it. Don't keep on running SCS, SCS, SCS, and the pc is going on, and they go on. Because what are they doing? They're running with a prior consideration of the process. Therefore, they never really take on any of the auditing commands. They are running each auditing command, (\"When I say 'Start,' you start that body\" and so forth), \"All right, I just – that – that'll give me a chance not to stand still,\" see? The pc always amends it. Always amends the auditing question, always amends the auditing ques-tion. Don't you see? \"I'll stop it, but I'll stop it quick enough and get off of it so at no point during the stop have I stood still.\" See? You get this idea? Well, a little discussion with the pc will show up these various things. Now, you can take a process and you can walk parallel with SCS, and you can repair that point and run SCS afterwards. Well, how would you go about standing still? Well, the crudest way to go about it is just say \"Stand still. All right.\" \"Don't stand still. Thank you.\" \"Stand still. Thank you.\" \"Don't stand still. Thank you.\" That's the crudest thing I know of, see? This is obviously right out of the textbooks and technology of Scientology, you see?"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 16 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 180 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"Stand still. Thank you.\" \"Don't stand still. Thank you.\" \"Stand still. Thank you.\" \"Don't stand...\" Automaticity is going to go away; this must be some kind of an automaticity that's all ready to trigger there. So if we get the person into any familiarity with it – because the person already realizes they can't do it. That recognition tells you that it's within the range of itsa. But if you get somebody walking in on crutches that don't know they're walking on crutches, you wouldn't say \"Throw away your crutches. Now walk.\" See, too high a gradient. And they don't even worry about it. You get somebody walking in and saying, \"I got to get rid of these crutches, man\" worry, worry, worry, present time problem, see? Well, the thing to do is inspect their communication cycle and their communication cycle with the auditor, communication cycle with their mind, the communication cycle with the environment – see. There's many of these little communication cycles. Let's inspect these various things. Let's find out he's all right before we say \"All right. Throw away your crutches. Thank you.\" You got the idea? See? Normally, what the person is worried about is in actual fact not what the person is bugged with. You very often will get somebody running off on a total automaticity of what's wrong with them, and they're not even listening to themself talk. Actually, they will run off a total automaticity of what's wrong with them, and they're not even listening to themselves talk. Sometimes they listen to themselves talk to find out what's wrong with them. [laughter] When you get into that situation, why, it's elementary to repair the existing livingness of the pc, but only after you've repaired their auditingness. An auditing session is a highly artificial action. Highly artificial. It's dreamed up, in-vented from scratch. Nothing like it has really ever existed before. That's why a psychoanalyst would lay an egg a minute – in a minute – if he cracked a textbook on Scientology and took it back to the office to run it on one of his patients. Aughhh! And boy, do they lay eggs! Why? Well, they're running Scientology with a psychoanalytic auditing cycle. And, of course, that's a wild auditing cycle if you've ever inspected it. One psychoanalyst said, \"I don't see how you can stand to listen hour after hour after hour,\" and the other one says, \"Who listens?\" But that's their appreciation of the auditing cy-cle, and it's too bad to produce any great effect, which is probably fortunate – because the theory which goes back of it, and so forth, is highly artificial. They don't produce any im-pingement, the auditing cycle isn't there, and so on. But this artificiality of an auditing session approximates – it's only artificial because it approximates in such harsh, staggering, visible reality, the exact precise points of contact with existence. And what it is, is a hopped-up, gunned-up contact with beings in existence, don't you see? Way up! It's something like putting a Model-T Ford and putting a Lycoming aircraft engine in it, see? And bzzzz-zzzz! Well, all of communication always has consisted of cause, distance, effect. Well, you jam it up into an auditing communication cycle and it's full of bombs, man. See, bang! Things are going to happen, because it's highlighted the exact important points. For instance, you ask somebody on the street out here, \"What's important about communication?\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 17 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 181 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST They say, \"Well, being polite.\" \"Good. What are the parts of communication?\" \"Oh, there's past participles and there's present participles and there's grammar and...\" See, they couldn't tell you any of this, don't you see? All right, you gun in there, with cause, distance, effect, you see? Ask a question, get it answered, acknowledge it, see? Porowww! See? Wrooof! You're handling raw meat. And you rehabilitate any part of this, and so forth, and then something wakes up. Thetan can't help but wake up. The ability to commu-nicate is always terribly visible to a reporter or somebody doing work in this particular field. They get around Scientologists, it knocks them flat. And this photographer that was here to-day from The Saturday Evening Post, and so forth – who has gone now, I imagine – this boy – this boy's first remark to me is \"They're all so uninhibited!\" after he got through taking pictures of you, you see? \"You're all so uninhibited.\" He sees communication happening. He's very impressed with you, you see? You're walking straighter, and you aren't all tightened up, and you're not a bundle of nerves, don't you see, and all this sort of thing. And he can't quite express this thing, but he's already in a state of shock because he's been hit, you see, with too much life, livingness, you know – just hit him in the face. And yet, none of you really probably said anything to him. It's that appar-ent. Well now, you take this up and gun this up into an auditing cycle, and the auditor is saying, \"Do birds fly?\" and the pc is supposed to listen to this, and he is supposed to under-stand this and he is supposed to sort out the answer to this, and he is supposed to deliver it up now. And he's going to get for that, \"Thank you\" straight into his skull. And it isn't the parts of grammar, and it isn't this, and it isn't that and it isn't the other thing, and – if he can stand up to this, he'll start getting the idea that he can communicate. And he goes out of session, and he'll start communicating with the environment. And the only thing really wrong with people is, is they've withdrawn from contact. If you wanted to capsulize the entirety of difficulty with the mind, take somebody who is no longer looking. The last time he looked, there were three saber-toothed tigers ready to bite him. Now he is no longer looking. Of course, he believes that there are three saber-toothed tigers there. He'll sometimes put up screens between himself and the tigers. And then, of course, he never dares take down the screens, so he never finds out if the tigers have gone. And he does this throughout enough trillenia, he's got an awful stack of tigers – all of which have left! But he doesn't know it. He can't be sure they've left. And so he's in a condition of total withdrawal – from his environment, from himself. He's safeguarded himself with an automatic bank; he's safeguarded himself with an automatic beingness; he's got a valence standing where he ought to be, and he knows that he came straight from mud and that he is mud and that he'd better not be anything else, because mud is relatively unpalatable when eaten by saber-toothed tigers. [laughter] And a capsulization of all aberration is just a total withdrawal. I don't care – that's a psychiatric term, of course. They have some condition they say \"total withdrawal.\" The psy-chiatrist is standing there totally withdrawn, telling you about somebody who has gone into a"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 18 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 182 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST withdrawal, which I always considered very interesting. This is not an apt term. It's one point where we're crossing terms. But we're not talking about the psychiatric withdrawal, we're just talking about the fact the guy has retreated, that's all. He no longer dares put out a beam a mile away. First he could put one out a light-year, then he put one out a year, you see, and then he put one out a mile and then he got down to a hundred yards. And each time he got enough \"being bitten,\" don't you see, that he no longer puts out to distance, his remedy is al-ways shorten the reach. And the thetan has, as his standard remedy for safety, shorten the reach. And what does he do when he gets into zero reach? He actually can figure out how to invert a withdrawal into an inverted withdrawal, and you get the cycle of the dynamics coming on down, which is – he comes away from actual reach, don't you see, and he comes down to zero actual reach. Well, he's got to reach some-how, so he figures some other way to reach, don't you see? He reads travel books or some-thing, you know? And he goes into these various cycles. And there's always a zero of what he is doing, which then has a remedy which is lower than that, and he gets down into not just a total withdraw, he gets down to an inversion of the inversion of the inversion of the inversion withdrawal. Of course, the first point this shows up is in an auditing session, and his ability to talk to the auditor – about pertinencies. The sensibility of his communication is also in point here. You've asked him, \"Do you have a car?\" And he has explained to you that General Motors stock has gone down for the last year or so, and drops it at this point. So pertinencies – he didn't answer the question, did he? So you get him into some condition where he can answer the question, he can speak up, where he can hear what you're saying, where he can therefore receive the auditor. Because you've got somebody on total withdrawal, one of your best remedies is to see that he gets reached, don't you see? And you reach him in order to get him to reach, don't you see? And these are the conditions which you're trying to remedy with an auditing cycle. Now, if you want to be an absolute gee-whizzer to end all gee-whizzers on cracking cases, don't you ever go around drooling about this fellow sitting there, and he's saying, \"And my wife lollipopped with the chauffeur, and – and it's just all too tough, so on and so forth, and so on and so on.\" And you're trying to say to him, \"This is – you know, the session has ended.\" And he says, \"and so and so on and came down the chute, and there were eight sides of it, and so forth; they were all hexagonal, you see, and so forth.\" And you said, \"The – the session – the session ended some time ago.\" And he says, \"... and so on and so on. So I've always said to chauffeurs since that par-ticular time – I've said it lollipopped the chauffeurs!\" Don't now go to somebody, or try to crack a textbook to find out what to run – what technique to run on this case. It isn't a case of technique. He hasn't got anybody there to talk to. He isn't talking to anybody. If he is, it's somebody else. He isn't talking about a problem he could have, see? He isn't even talking about a problem he's got! He probably isn't even listen-ing to himself anymore. He has no familiarity with the environment, he is disoriented as to where he is, and so forth. And you want a technique?"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 19 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 183 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST He's got a paw. Well, you could say, \"Now pick up your hand and put it on the side of the chair and feel the side of the chair.\" He might go right on talking for some time without noticing you're doing this. And then eventually say, \"Hey, there's a chair here.\" Big win. But if you're going to deal in pcs at all who have disabilities of any kind whatsoever, you've got to have a session before you can have Class IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X. You get the idea now? You've got to have a session before you can have a technique operating. This is the value of the auditing cycle, this is its use, and this is how to become one of the wildest case crackers anybody ever had anything to do with. You get to be a screaming genius on this subject, and something. Oh, you make errors, you'll get too accusative, you'll all of a sudden find you over-cut – you've overestimated the pc's ability here and there, and so forth, and you have to cut it back. But remember that it always requires adjustment. The only other thing I would teach you, and like to teach you about this, and I really wish I could, is that after you've remedied it, it's been remedied. And don't keep on; because this pc had a lot of tone arm action on what question he could receive from the auditor, and so forth, don't make that a lifetime profession. Because this is just another method of nonobser-vation. Now that he can do this and is doing it, note that he is doing it. See? He feels all right about it and he is doing it. Note that, and now notice – notice, in other words, that he's changed – and then notice what else you can put together. So there's two more things to notice, don't you see? Is when has that condition been remedied? – when has that little ability been regained? – so that you can pull foot out of there. And the other thing is observe now, newly and freshly, for something else to do for the pc. The reason I give you those other two is that sometimes it happens so rapidly that it – you're just rocked back on your heels. Pc has never talked to anybody before in their life, and you all of a sudden have them talking to you pertinently, in a blue streak. Well, let's not go on remedying their ability to talk to the auditor. See, ability regained. So you want to be able to notice that, and that's all part of the observation. And the real hot – the real hot auditor, the real – guy that gets case wins all over the place, is sitting in there observing what is going on in the session, and if things are going all right, doesn't remedy them, and if things are going all wrong, picks up that point that can be remedied and remedies it, until they are all remedied, and then carries on. Those are the magic ways to go about this sort of thing. Well, you take over the technical aspect of some Scientology organization. You're sit-ting in there doing nothing but coaching up cases, doing nothing but coaching up cases. Don't pay any attention to the auditing of the cases – consider that's sincere and it's being done as best it possibly can be. Ignore that aspect. Don't keep picking on the auditors; that's a training job. But just keep watching – watching those communication cycles. Note the communication abilities and so forth, the appearance and that sort of thing, of a pc. Don't depend on large tests having been made every fifteen minutes and fourteen pounds of auditor reports to tell you whether or not the pc's had a change. Let's look at this pc. Let's listen to this pc in session."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNICATION CYCLE IN AUDITING 20 SHSBC-366 – 6.2.64 LEVEL 0 184 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Is this pc talking better, answering more pertinently, and so forth? If so, fine! We're winning, and so forth. Let's not worry about that pc until we get a bog, and there's a no-change condi-tion begins to take place with that pc. And the pc looking brighter and got more spark in the eye than they had: Well, their eye was – remember that this is a gradient – their eye was abso-lutely complete pebble, stone, flat, lightless. And now you can see a trace of color through the fog. That's an improvement. See? Note the improvements. Don't just be cynical about it the whole way, you see? Note the improvements, because they sometimes take place rather slowly. And just keep them – keep them moving up, and only pay attention to – only pay at-tention to – the communication cycle and the ability of the person to handle the environment in his immediate vicinity, particularly an auditing session. And only pay attention to those things. Never pay any attention to the person's problems, never pay any attention to their goals in session, never pay attention to any of these other things – because obviously, any auditor they got would take care of these things if the pc was in session. See? Auditors are good at that. What they're not good at is having somebody there fully in session. Because, of course, that's the hardest trick. That's the roughest trick. But there lie the biggest gains. And it looks so easy, it looks so kindergartenish, that you very often neglect it. So you see that somebody is all straightened out, he can talk to an auditor, an auditor can talk to him, that an auditing cycle can take place, the person can receive an acknowledg-ment, the person can have an auditing room, the person can have an auditing session, all of these things are possible, everything is fine, and so forth. Well, aside from occasionally catch-ing somebody with a tremendous goof on the subject of – they're running the service facsimile on the person, and when it was – got a service facsimile, the auditor in this particular case couldn't find any service facsimile because the person had been raised in a poor family and didn't have any maids. Then the thing to do is to get hold of the D of T and say, \"That auditor needs some training on service facsimiles.\" Not to go into it. But the only trouble you're going to run into from there on, don't you see, is going to be the application of technique. And that is never the trouble in Scientology, and it is not the trouble, it is not the trou-ble with your pc that you're having any trouble with at all. These techniques work like mad, but all of them have the dependency of the pc fully in session. The pc is fully in session, you can run almost anything on them and they'll sail, don't you see? Pc not in session, won't. The big bog is people don't get the pc into session before they start running something. And there-fore they expect a technique will remedy something that's sitting right in front of their faces, which is the pc not at all in session. Do you see? All right. That's actually – that's actually how to undercut cases left, right and center, make a wide swath in all directions. And I think you can do it.

INVALIDATION To say \"You did not speak loud enough _____\" or any other use of \"you\" is an invali-dation. The pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her. The Auditor is responsible for the session. Therefore the auditor has to assume respon-sibility for all comm breakdowns in it. EVALUATION Far more serious than Invalidation above, is the accidental evaluation which may oc-cur when the auditor repeats what the pc said. Never repeat anything a pc says after him, no matter why. Repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel you're a circuit. The highest advance of 19th Century Psychology was a machine to drive people crazy. All it did was repeat after the person everything the person said. Children also do this to annoy. But that isn't the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc. If you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest. The pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there.

That umbrella is the Einstein touch. I don't have to have the Einstein touch, you see, to cope with Scientology research. It's with Melbourne. How are you today? Audience: Fine. What's the date?

This lecture is being given on Earth. All right. I want to say a couple of words about Australia. Australia is only in one difficulty: it has yet to take any instructions or orders concerning its status or activities. I've just gone through three days of the rock crusher just trying to get one simple instruction through to Australia. Just that, see? And I finally landed and got it through and now I'm – was unstabilized the following day. I don't know whether it got through or not. If I feel a little bit abstracted or if I look a little bit that way, you'll know why. I don't know, I think it's been two or three thousand words on the telex have been typed, some of it sent, some of it not sent. You see, everything sent to the Australian office is picked up by the Australian gov-ernment, you see, and used at its – ha! – inquiry. Now, I wanted to gen you in on this inquiry and by the time this information gets around anyplace it will already have happened, so it's perfectly all right to tell you. But when the opposition decides to cut a theta line, they should be advised that when you try to cut a theta line it explodes. Sooner or later it will explode. That you can be abso-lutely confident of with regard to all such villainous and vicious activities."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 2 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 190 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I have seen this happen time and time and time again. You always get an explosion on cutting a theta line. Guy is trying to give some truth, something like that – or it even gets worse than that, don't you see? You're trying to wish somebody a happy birthday or some-thing like that, don't you see, and somebody villainously stops the card, you see? Now, they've done something there, see? And the doingness of that type of thing will all of a sudden catch up with them in some mysterious and fantastic fashion. It's very – it's not really metaphysical. You can see why; because the only power there is, is on a theta line. All other power is derived from cutting theta lines. The secret of power is just that. Power is truth. You can extend untruth in a certain direction and derive power from it for a certain time, but you're only deriving power from the amount of truth in the situation. This is why, in a war, a government can engage in war and talk to its citizens about how they must engage in war against this other power and that sort of thing. But they are at that... and you notice every war is followed by, usually, an overthrow of the government and a disillusion-ment of the people. We want to know why. Well, actually, there weren't that many reasons to go to war and the line they are cutting there is simply the line of friendliness and decency from people to people, see? So somebody jumps across this line, you see, and cuts it up and then when the war is all over everybody sits down and says, \"I'm not mad at the Sloveronians. Why were we fight-ing the Sloveronians?\" You hear this after every war, you see? You also have an overthrow of the existing regime. No regime really ever lasts through a war and they never notice this. It always emerges on the different side of it some other government. It's the most remarkable phenomenon you ever cared to see. It's obscured by the fact that the state is still there or somebody may be still king, but there will be a differ-ent government sitting there – entirely different. What have they done? They have cut the natural ARC of being to being for their own ends and it blew them up. Now, the violence of the war is a temporary action, but this other thing carries it on for a very, very long time. That's the long continuing action. Those are the wounds that have to heal. It's very interesting. Now, there – there it is on just cut ARC from people A to people B and whatever violence occurred – and even though it is very bad and very difficult for a while, it recoils on the people who cut the line. It inevitably recoils. I saw one time as simple an action as this: a manuscript telling how to give a 36-hour intensive was carefully put in a safe and not issued. Well, it was put in the safe because it was valuable material and everybody all over the place was trying to find out how to do a 36-hour intensive. This person was going consistently and continually mad trying to cope with the amount of traffic and activity resulting from randomity from everybody trying to do a 36-hour intensive without realizing that the manuscript had been carefully parked in his safe because it was so valuable. Do you understand? It was just one – two, see? Well, now, that's a very simple – a simple type of thing.

They say the villain will get it in the end. They don't really know how he gets it or why he gets it, but it's this mechanism I'm talking to you about that brings about and fosters that particular belief. You cut ARC: the cutter of the ARC will explode, sooner or later. There is going to be an explosion at that point. Mechanics, electronics and so forth continue on down this line to a quite marked de-gree. You've got to cut a flow or do something with a flow before you get much of an explo-sion as a result of a flow, see? You don't get any commotion with regard to a flow unless you interpose something into the flow. And that's what you as an auditor have a lot of trouble about every once in a while. You're wondering why you're having trouble with the pc and you never look at the amount of theta line which you cut by a chopped acknowledgment – not letting him complete his com-munication. See, the whole auditing cycle is based on. this. And then the auditor wonders why he's getting his head blown off and the pc is mad at him and everybody is chopping him up and everybody is down on him, and so forth. He's the unwitting victim of having accidentally done this through his inexpert timing of his acks and that sort of thing. That's the exact mechanism we're talking about. He has cut the natural cycling ARC with the pc inopportunely. He hadn't let the pc originate or some-thing of this sort, you see? He's busted it up one way or the other and he – in other words, he cut the theta line of the session (let's put it that way) and sooner or later, boom! Well, it oddly enough always explodes on the auditor. You want to know why does it always explode on the auditor? The pc recovers but you'll see the auditor staggering around for a while longer. One of the reasons is he isn't getting any processing. And the other reason is he has unwittingly, himself, in person, cut that line. When he has cut the line and then doesn't recognize that he has cut the line, now he's really in trouble because he has no expla-nation for what's happening to him. Hence, we get this drill of – for heaven's sakes, listen to your taped session and keep turning that tape back till you find the point where you first cut the line. Got a dirty needle? All right, let's take the tape back to where the auditor cut the line. We're not interested in the ramifications of what happened at the point of the explo-sion. It's foolish to look at the point of the explosion to find out what happened at the point of the explosion, because we know what happened at the point of the explosion. The explosion is the result of a cut theta line. See? That's – so why do you keep looking at the result? And you'll find out when you first try to train an auditor to do this, you practically will go around the bend yourself in trying to drive it home to the auditor. \"Look, I want you – we're not interested in what caused the ARC break in terms of 'you did this or that,' or something of the sort, which then resulted in the ARC break.\" And then the auditor goes on at some great length explaining what the ARC break happened and the pc said this and the pc said that. We're not interested in that. We're interested in the first cut of the theta line which then began to mount up to a point where the pc became aware of the fact that it had been cut and it went from there to the explosion.

I mean, the comm lag is so great between these two things that the auditor seldom ever recognizes at first glance that he did it to begin with. He'll turn it back – he'll turn it back five or six inches to where the pc's rather snarly origin was chopped by the auditor and he'll say, \"Well, that's it. I (of course, perfectly justified in doing so) answered the pc rather sharply and abruptly and there we had an ARC break.\" So you'll get in these reports, \"I answered the pc sharply and abruptly and then a min-ute or so later had a dirty needle.\" Well, that's fine. He's now joined kindergarten at this art. He is just in kindergarten at this art. He's gotten the point now where he can actually recognize that it was a snarl back at the pc after the pc snarled at him which caused the meter to snarl at both of them, see? He's gotten up that high. You'll have a little difficulty getting him up that high, but there is an awful lot further to go. How did this get into this situation? Now, you keep reeling that tape back a few inches at a time, a few inches at a time – or feet at a time – and you all of a sudden will find back there a mistake in an acknowledgment. The whole situation is riding on that first little flub. The mistake in acknowledgment made the auditor less secure, made the pc very much less secure and the line has been cut at that point, you see? So therefore, more little mistakes result in that particular cycle and the pc is more difficult to follow and the auditor makes more mis-takes. And then it gets down to this point, finally, where we get the explosion of the cut line. Well, that may not be very violent; it may just be a dirty needle. But as far as the tape is concerned of the session, it's actually – can be as far as one and one-half hours; actual measurement in an auditing session. An auditor can see an ARC break coming – when he is very sensitive – he can see an ARC break coming over a long period of time. Now, the only thing we're trying to make him aware of with the drill – the only thing we're trying to make him aware of – is that it was his flub, not taken care of, which let this thing keep working up. When he does get some awareness that all is not quite well, he then doesn't take it up. He just hopes it will all go away – the black panther mechanism, you see – he just ignores it and it may go away. And he is usually very good at this. He is expert at this. It's marvelous. He has greater capacity for ignoring than is easily measurable. And it's his favorite hope that the black panther will yawn and walk out of the room undetected by anybody. And the black panther never does. He just – he just starts lashing his tail faster and faster and he starts flexing his claws and then he starts snarling and then he starts getting a little bit more hate in the eye and then the next thing you know you can get him rocking back on those haunches, so forth, and the auditor still says, \"Now, if I just pay no attention to it at all, the black panther will still go away,\" you see? The black panther is now – has left the ground and is halfway through the air in the spring and the auditor says, \"Now, if I just ignore this completely and pretend it isn't happen-ing, and so forth, all will be well.\""},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 5 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 193 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST And all of a sudden there he is with a snarling, roaring ARC break on his hands. Pc slams down the cans, gets up, walks out of the room, something or other happens on the thing. Aw, he had – he had a warning from a friend, see? He had telegrams, you see? He had wigwag signals; he had everything you could think of. They were all coming his way and he paid no attention to any of them, see? Something is wrong in the session. Well, the only thing that goes wrong in the session is somewhere the theta line has been cut. Now, that's the only thing that's wrong. You try to trace this down and get its genus and you will run into all other varieties of bypassed charge. Now, you frankly could take somebody that has been processed or has been treated or has merely lived and simply treat this as a front-rank auditing problem. Just treat this as a front-rank auditing problem. \"When has your ARC been cut?\" See? Now, the oddity of it is, is you can't keep running this as the only problem. Now, let me call to your attention that there are some unworkable processes – real unworkable proc-esses – and they'll catch up with the auditor sooner or later, too. One of these processes is, \"Look around here and find something you can go out of ARC with.\" This is what we call the psychiatric process – because it's only run on psychia-trists. Sounds marvelous, doesn't it? Sounds absolutely marvelous. Doesn't sound like there is a thing wrong with that process. It's the wildest sneaker you ever had anything to do with in your life. You might even get some tone arm action with it. And your pc will start going down, down, down, down, down, down, because you are cutting his theta line right in the room. This is really the only sure, absolutely guaranteed, silver-plated, Madison-Avenue-advertised method of knocking a pc to smithereens. \"Look around here and find something you could go out of ARC with.\" I don't care how else you phrase it. You understand that could be phrased as \"What one of your friends wouldn't you have to talk to?\" Sounds like a process, doesn't it? \"What wouldn't you have to touch to know what it was?\" You get quite inventive with this type of process. \"What doesn't necessarily have to be real to you?\" See how innocent it sounds? It sounds very cultured. It sounds as though you really have arrived there with some, some greater reality than real, see? And it's completely guaranteed that the pc would be very interested in running it, would continue to answer the auditing question and would go right on out the bottom. And they get paler and paler and more strained and more strained and more upset and more upset and they will finally explode. Because you are saying, \"Sit in that auditing chair and cut your ARC. Thank you.\" \"Sit in that auditing chair and cut your ARC. Thank you.\" And that is really what the process con-sists of. Now, I'll give you another version of it off into havingness, and you can put this down in your book. These, by the way, are GAEs – gross auditing errors – they're high crimes. High crimes.

Now, here it fits into the havingness cycle. \"What don't you have to have?\" Isn't that a marvelous clearing process? Obviously it educates the person into not having things. And after a while it gets him conditioned to a point where he doesn't have to have a bank and he would simply go free from the bank. Isn't that a nice rationale? Perfect rationale. That's a psychologist process. Medical doctors, we run \"What part of the body could you get along without? Thank you.\" [laughter] That's just known as an ARC reverse process, but you understand it's expressed in a havingness phrase. \"Look around here and find something you don't have to have. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, hey. Thank you. Hey. \" [whistles] \"Hey. Answer the auditing question. Look around here and find something you don't have to – hey, hey, hey. Hey! Oh, he's conked out.\" \"Well, wake him up. Wake him up.\" \"All right. All right. Now here is the auditing question. Look around here and find something you don't have to have. Thank you. Look around here and find something you don't have to have. Hey, he's conked out again. \"Hey, wake him up. Give me a hand, Joe. Wake him up.\" \"Hell, he's dead.\" What's absolutely fantastic in this particular frame of reference is that the pc will run any of those processes, industriously and marvelously. In fact, I knew of somebody – was diagnosed as being in compulsive ARC with everybody. And somebody, to cure him of this, ran that process on him of \"What could you go out of ARC with?\" And I don't know what happened to the poor bloke, but you know, I haven't seen him since! And I've actually put out some little lines at one time or another, trying to get in touch with him, trying to find out what happened in this. Everybody is covering it up like the Rue Morgue murders, see? I don't know what happened. I mean, I know he's not in Scientology anymore but I don't know anything more than that. I just caught it too late, don't you see, to do something drastic about it, you know? It – oh, nothing physically happened to him. He just sort of drifted off one way or the other, I suppose. I suppose he's still around, but who knows? You see how peculiar this is? Now, he would never in God's green earth have attrib-uted any difficulty he was having to having been run on that process – to which he consented with the greatest of glee. He was simply told that he was in compulsive ARC with people and this would have to be cured so that he could audit better. The only difference between this process and Russian roulette is Russian roulette has five empty chambers and this doesn't have any. Now, this is all on the basis of cutting ARC and this is quite, quite a – quite a big ra-tionale. It's a big package, all by itself. Affinity, reality and communication: cut thereof.

And he is quite visible. Now, the way the psychologist, particularly the child psychologist – who has a lot to recommend him since he has to get in there and pitch in numerous ways, and so forth. They have them in schools trying to advise people, and so forth – the way he gets into trouble left, right and center, is he doesn't know this datum. And not knowing this datum, therefore, he cannot predict child future behavior. There's another datum he doesn't know: A thetan never gives up. He doesn't know that datum. That's a very terrible datum to know. It cures many impulses toward tyranny. If jokers like Caligula knew the data – knew that datum – before they started to Caligulize things, I think they wouldn't have the temerity to go on Caligulizing, see, because a thetan really never gives up. This also – this also is – is some bloke like the Cardinal of Spewjaw, or something, see? He's all of a sudden decided to cure everybody of sex. See, he is going to cure everybody in his diocese of sex. Small project. [laughter] No. He may go down in history, but I can guarantee you he will certainly – he will cer-tainly get buried somewhere. The thetan never gives up – on an ARC line or in any other di-rection. We got a bunch of wild-eyed revolutionaries – bunch of wild-eyed revolutionaries. Let me give you a – let me give you a right and a wrong on handling a wild-eyed revolutionary. Reform him by giving him a good talking to. Hm-mm-mm, do-oo-oh. Shoot several of his companions. Ho-oh. No, sooner or later you're going to have a revolution. Sooner or later, you know? He just never really gives up. Now, that's the wrong way to handle a revolutionary, is to de-revolutionize him. That would also apply to a conquered people. A conquered people really never gives up. That im-pulse may go on and on, it may sail along for ages; they really never give up as long as there is any there at all. It gets more and more subconscious or more and more unconscious or whatever else you want to phrase it as, but it's still there. Now here is the other way: Take a revolutionary – take a revolutionary and the very least, or the very most, you can do is to simply directionalize, to some slight veering, his revo-lution. You maybe can slightly alter the direction of his revolutionary tendency. See, you could maybe persuade him not to revolt against the king but to revolt against the prime minis-ter, see? Change his vector a little bit, see? You could say, \"Well, don't revolt against the – why revolt against the state because you can't win; they've all got machine guns. A very much better activity at the present mo-ment is revolt against its educational system and eventually overthrow it thereby.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" he'd say. \"Yeah, all right. All right.\" That's okay, see? He'd go on in that particular direction. But understand he really has never given up revolting against the state."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 8 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 196 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST In other words, you could veer to some slight degree the direction of purpose of an in-dividual, but he really never gives up. And what fools everybody is – he says he gives up! He goes through all kinds of mumbo jumbo and prestidigitation to prove conclusively he's given it all up, see? You just never saw so much window dressing. Sometimes you see in a conquered na-tion, and so forth, flags lining the street in all directions, you know, and everybody's standing out there saying \"Viva Castro\" or something like that, see? And then they don't turn out any more Bacardi rum, see, and then somehow or another the fires in the cane fields – they just don't seem to abate; they seem to get more frequent. And production doesn't turn over and machinery keeps getting jammed somewhere, and there's no... and Castro's going absolutely stark staring batty. \"Why can't this economy work? Why are all the trucks in Cuba broken down suddenly and simultaneously? I'll solve this by buying hundreds of new trucks from England.\" Why, they are going to run just long enough to let somebody turn out – to pull off the distributor cap. Because, you see, the Cuban didn't revolt to be a communist. See, he revolted against Batista. And Castro tried to change his vector of revolt too far, too fast, and that was the end of that. They became a subjugated people suddenly after their revolution, don't you see? So now he's wondering why he's having trouble! We'll rename him \"Rocks-in-the-head-Castro,\" see? He can't have anything else but trouble now. He'll go on having trouble to the end of his days. He would have to take every person in Cuba – every single person in Cuba – and ship them complete to Venezuela and repeople Cuba a hundred percent with something else to win his revolution, because he didn't have a revolution. There was a revolution of the Cuban people and then Castro gave them another revo-lution. You remember, it wasn't for months that they found out they had been a communist revolution. And everything just quit and that was the end of that. No production. Now, everybody comes along and he says, \"What is the political sig-nificance of this? Let's see. What is the political significance of this?\" I can see Toynbee now. The great masterpiece of shallow thought that he would turn out on this would be marvelous. \"Let's see what – what could possibly be the significance of this? Is it true that com-munism turns out less production than capitalism?\" \"Are – are the comparative factors be-tween this and the Spartan regime, which didn't exist on the left-hand side of the bistro...\" you see? Figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure. And the Cuban people have no willingness to go in the direction they are now going, so they will go in that direction not. And the way they don't go in that direction is take everything down in front of them and don't produce. You see a nation which can't produce, you know that it is unwilling to do what it is do-ing. That's the first thing you know about it. It's unwilling to support what it's having to sup-port. The ARC will be very poor. Now, it doesn't matter how much communication is put into them – and Castro, as an example, puts in plenty. I understand his television broadcast lasts several hours – per day."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 9 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 197 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST This is all very, very fascinating, but the communication may be there. But of course, reality isn't there at all and affinity doesn't exist – this is from his particular side – because no man could have much affinity for people if he gives them another revolution after they've won a different one. No, the ARC is all missing from the other side. And remember that ARC has two sides: There is the ARC from B to A and there's the ARC from A to B. So you could put in a tremendous amount of C without very much A and practically no R and if you did manage to generate anything on the other side, it would be some pale shadow of the same thing. The other side would also probably develop a lot of C or a lot of no-C or something like this. But they certainly wouldn't develop any R and they certainly wouldn't develop any A. Now, if anybody stood up there in Castro's boots who really was putting A, R and C to those people, then he would have an opportunity of seeing these people express A, R and C to some degree or another. But he'd have to stand up there without any past connotations, don't you see? He wouldn't have to be dug in, in his own past and background in order to do this. Actually, it doesn't mean that a fellow could have no past in order to do this. The fel-low – anybody, I suppose – if he just suddenly went honest, you know, just that, just come down with an outbreak of honesty, you know, break out all over with it. If it were real hon-esty – would probably get a response from the other particular side because the target which is presenting A, R and C to that degree would have diminished, see? Although they'd never given up against this other target, they don't have anything against this target they now have, you see? So there is ARC possible with that target. Honesty. Honesty. Frankly, you can make a tremendous number of mistakes, but never be dishonest about your mistakes. That is the big thing to know. Don't be dishonest about your mistakes. You become unreal to the degree that you're dishonest about them. And don't go over into the field of self-immolation, either. There's ways to commit suicide with this sort of thing, you see? But that's also a distortion of A, R and C because you are cutting out your own life in order to glorify your own mistakes. I don't know if you ever read any Russian literature. It's really not worth reading. But Dostoevski – The Brothers Karamazov, and so forth – each one of Dostoevski's works has some character who is busy selling himself down the river with great violence, you know? He's explaining to everybody what a dog he is, you see, and so on. He goes on and on. He really is a dog, too. Anybody trying to rule Russia would have my sympathy. But – not knowing much about the country, I'm a great expert on it; almost as great an expert on Russia as Boston is on slavery. They've never had to cope with it, so therefore they know everything there is to know about it. There is nothing like complete inexperience to bring about enormous bravery. Now the North, which was very authoritative on its various racial problems – not having had any experience with them – is getting them all in the teeth. And it's the people of the North have all of a sudden – have started voting madly for these mad dog anti-ra... you know, these rac-ist-conscious candidates, and so forth. Everybody is scared stiff because some place, I think like Wisconsin, turned out a third of its vote the other day as representing preference for ra-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 10 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 198 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST cially prejudiced candidates. This is just a recoil, see? No R, so their A, R and C was very lousy. They had no R on the situation, so they had a very distorted ARC. And it all blew up in flinders the second they started to get some experience. So they go to the other side of the thing, see? Now they cut any potential ARC they might have with the whole situation and from \"Give them all cake,\" they immediately jump over – \"Shoot them all down like dogs,\" you see? Neither one of these things were real; there was no reality in either one of them. See, there wasn't any particular reason to give them all cake and there's certainly no reason now to shoot them all down like dogs. You see, here's the two sides of the coin. Nei-ther one of them had anything to do with theta. What were they talking about? Well, they did-n't know then; they don't know now. Now, there is nothing like complete, complete and utter inexperience to bring about a great deal of bravery. Also brings about many wonderful opinions. Marvelous opinions. There's many a professor who has spent his life in beautiful seclusion who is the most wonderful expert on things he knows nothing about and has never met. It's like the Scholas-tics. They believed in this. Their whole method of education was based upon the principles here: You never inspected anything. You just lectured about it, see? You never go out and look at a sturgeon to find out what sturgeons look like. You just go ahead and give lectures on sturgeons which are based on, I think in their particular case, Aristotle's opinion of a sturgeon, which I think was out of a different ocean and was inaccurate to begin with. And if anybody had tried to bring in a real sturgeon to show them what it was, the person would have been instantly and immediately flunked – hands down. That would have been the end of that. That was the system called Scholasticism – an actual system on which we get \"scho-lastic average\" and other things. But the Scholastics lasted for about 1500 years and they were the total dominant philosophy of education. And they lasted all the way across the Dark Ages, and when they finally packed up and people began to look again, we ceased to have dark ages. I don't care if somebody like Toynbee attributes the Dark Ages to the left-hand square root of the ruddy rod or why the virgins were no longer in church and that ended the Dark Ages – that has nothing to do with it. It's the fact their system of education absolutely de-barred, and their religious beliefs absolutely debarred, the inspection of anything that they were supposed to know about. It was a system of education based entirely upon noninspec-tion. It wasn't that they neglected noninspection. It was that they insisted upon it. And we had the Dark Ages. Well, we had no educated people. I imagine if you had nobody educated you'd have a dark age. It's quite elementary. If you kept every child in school so that he couldn't learn any-thing about the universe around him for the period that he was curious, and then you turned him loose thereafter to run the affairs of man, I imagine it would be very dark indeed. And the Scholastic was a champion at this. He became expert at this. In other words, he was cutting the ARC of knowledge. \"You are all supposed to know about rocks. Don't go look at any rocks.\" This was how he cut the ARC line."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 11 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 199 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If I were educating you as auditors: \"All right. Now, this is the way you behave as auditors! This is what you do as auditors! And don't let me ever, under any circumstances, ever let me hear you talking to a preclear.\" That would sound pretty wild, wouldn't it? That would sound pretty unreal. You immediately – up to your mind comes this question: \"Well, if we're never supposed to talk to a pc, if we're never supposed to hear a pc, if we're never sup-posed to have any touch with a pc, we're never supposed to audit a pc, then how the hell would we ever learn to become auditors?\" See, that immediately enters up. But remember, you are already talking in a zone of informed wisdom. Supposing you didn't know enough to ask that question. You'd have a picture of a dark age, wouldn't you? See, a dark age would be composed of people who didn't know enough to ask the question of \"Why is our ARC being cut?\" They wouldn't know their ARC is being cut. So part of the very, very intellectual individual, part of the very wise person, is a recognition of this princi-ple of when and where is his ARC cut? And he is wise to the degree that he can perceive this in existing situations. And this would be not necessarily his wisdom, but his ability to exercise wisdom. I'll give you an example. You're an auditor – Class V Auditor – you know your busi-ness. You go into a factory, they're having a lot of trouble, they want you to audit staff, some-thing like this, you know? You want – patch up somebody. You say, \"What's the matter? What brings you to the conclusion that your staff or your managers or anybody else needs auditing? What brings you to that conclusion?\" See, if you were a very, very smart auditor. You'd want to look over, \"What's the condition of the pc? What's expected here?\" Ob-viously you're not being asked to audit any pcs at their own volition. You're being asked to audit some pcs at management volition. Well, you'd either have to talk the pcs into being audited of their own volition, which is quite possible, very easy to do, as long as you are good and factual about it and don't use any of the management arguments which are not factual. They inevitably would not be fac-tual, you see, because they're not auditors. And you're talking to these people about auditing. Your ability to estimate the existing situation wouldn't necessarily measure how suc-cessful you were, but would certainly measure how wise you were. And how would you – how would you exercise this as a wisdom? How would you be wise in relationship to one of this? Well, you just look at the number of ARC busts there were on both sides of what fences existed. Now, you may have preconceived the idea of thinking there was management and labor and immediately believed that you had a problem in man-agement and labor because you read it in some textbook. See? And you might not have a problem of management and labor at all. You might have a problem of management and man-agement. I know of a hotel in the immediate vicinity which suffers from four problems of management versus management versus management versus management. See, that's their problem. They don't have any trouble with their help. They really don't. It's a marvel that any-body works for them at all. Their help goes on and works, but every once in a while its upper strata of management gets interfered with. The head of this department or that department gets shifted, moved or sacked, see? So it's only a problem of management within manage-ment."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 12 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 200 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Well, your recognition of the thing must be – just based on looking it over carefully – of what A, what R and what C is being cut between what terminals. That'd be the whole for-mula on which you could have to adjudicate that situation in that factory: what A, what R, what C? Not just what ARC is being cut – that's too careless, see? What A, what R and what C is being cut amongst what terminals? You might find out the ARC was being cut between the shop stewards and the me-chanics. Now, to locate that, all you'd have to locate is maximal confusion and minimal pro-duction. Just look over all the records and find where was the maximal number of dispatches, maximal confusion and the minimal production from expected production. This department has two-thirds of the plant employees and turns out one-sixth of what they're expected to. I'd think about that time you would decide that there was something wrong with it. Now all you have to find out is where is the cut A, R and the cut C in that vicinity. Now, there must be two terminals there, otherwise there is no flow of A, R and C to cut. So one must be trying to flow ARC and the other must be trying to cut it; or this one is trying to flow ARC and the other one is trying to cut it; or to some degree, they are both trying to flow A, R and C and they are both thoroughly cutting it. So one of those conditions will exist. And if you are being very wise, you would sim-ply look that over as the condition of affairs and you would say these people are unhappy with those people. And you don't even have to do it on a formula. I tell you, that's the only thing there. You don't have to look for something else there, but you just look for that thing and you find it and then you say, \"All right, I'm going to group process the shop stewards in the pres-ence of the foremen. And then we will process foremen against shop stewards and we will get this thing...\" In other words, all you do is start unblocking the ARC. You wouldn't even have to handle a case. Just take the existing situation of the real universe. Just accept the fact they're all nuts anyway. Don't bother about it in any other particular direction. This is it. Now, if you know this other thing: do you know that all PT problems are suspended in nondelivered communications? I suppose a guy is trapped where he is today because one day he started to talk to God and it didn't get there, you know, or something of this sort – some-thing wild of this nature occurred. Now, let me warn you that if you tried to run this as a process, look where you'd get. \"What communication has been undelivered? Thank you.\" \"What communication has been undelivered? Thank you.\" The thing is selfdiscrediting because it won't run as the process. In other words, the way he came down the line, it doesn't go back out the same way. These are simply the problems the guy has had along the line. How he has solved those problems is the clue. See, even though the genus of the problem was an undelivered communication, he then made it real rough by solving it in some way. See, he didn't give up. We're now talking about R1C, R1CM, see? We're talking about very elementary proc-esses. This fellow comes in, \"Oh, my God, I have this terrible problem! I – I don't know whether I'm coming or going. I'm – lovv-lovv – awful problem.\" And he's holding his head in his hands, you know, and rolling from side to side.

Has fantastic numbers of ramifications. Obviously, his whole case is sitting behind the thing and charging it up. Obviously, you're dealing with a tremendous instability to begin with. Obviously. Obviously this, obviously that. You got factors, factors, factors, fac-tors, factors, factors here. You could add them up on IBM comptometers. But you know one thing for sure about that condition – that it exists here and now. See? This guy is in this condi-tion here and now. This you know. Yeah, that's rather obvious, because there he is rolling around and screaming and yowling, so he's obviously in that condition now. Let's start with certainties. Let's get our own ARC in with it, see? So what's the reality of the situation? It exists. What's the C of the situa-tion? Well, that you can talk at him but he doesn't hear you. And what's the A of the situation? Why, you'd like to give the guy a hand. Complicated, isn't it? That's your ARC with relationship to him. If your ARC includes \"I've got to solve this fellow's problems for him; I've got to give him solutions to all of his problems,\" of course you're not establishing ARC with him or getting his ARC disentangled. See, you're winding him up in the soup. Therefore, this thing called marital counseling will always wind up in the scrap bucket. You could just about counsel two characters on the marital front into amity as you could tie two cats over a clothesline by their tails and expect to kiss each other. They just won't – wont do it. You could just stand there and keep saying, \"Now, now Puss, you should kiss Tom there and make up and...\" There's obviously something hurting them. Even a fool would stand back after a while and say, \"There's apparently something here I have not quite embraced in my analysis of the situation.\" There's all of the factors that are right there. Now, let's look at the fellow now. Now, what's his A, R and C with his environment, see? Well, C: he isn't talking to anybody. If you ever notice a fellow in that condition, he is not talking to anybody; he's talking at everything. He really doesn't expect that anybody is even listening to him. He's just going on, you know? And his R: you'll find out he contradicts himself every three minutes. You don't quite know what he is talking about, because the target of his conversation is so consistently shift-ing – the subject of his conversation is so shifting, so consistently and his words are \"I don't know\" and \"I can't find out\" and \"I haven't,\" you know, \"been this.\" It's all full of doubt, you see? There isn't any solidity there anyplace. So his R, his R is obviously shot, see? He just hasn't any reality on anything. He hasn't any grip on anything. And his A: well, he doesn't know whether he hates everybody or they hate him. It's kind of a tossup. He's worried because everybody might or somebody might hate him and he's worried that he might unjustly hate somebody else, you see? He's in a confusion. He wouldn't know what his affinity was. His A, R and C are right down there running on the bottom. Is there any particular button out of a theta line that you could trip that would cause this odd jam to unravel? Is there anything you could trip? Remember, it'd be a terribly unlim-ited process – pardon me, a terribly limited process, no unlimited process in connection with this. This is real limited. But there is something you could say to him – just the one-shot situa-tion – \"What communication haven't you been able to deliver?\" Let him tell you all about it and he, to that degree, is somewhat delivering it and you will see his whole condition alter."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 14 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 202 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Interesting, isn't it? If you could get the insane to answer as much of a question as that, they'd probably unravel, same way. It's not – it's not, you understand, a repetitive process. And it has nothing that refers to the past. It's the right-now communication you haven't been able to deliver. Because maybe this was a past question and all that sort of thing, but it's still the communication he hasn't been able to deliver right now, and he's trying so hard right now to deliver this communica-tion that he's got himself completely snarled up on the R and the A. I imagine people used to get that way in prayers. As a matter of fact, that's why I think certain organizations – there's no point in going on discussioning their depravities, but I'd think there would be some organization or another that was – I'd think they'd sit down calcu-latingly to spin people in by giving them something they couldn't pray to. I'd say that in some villainous, past, uninformed period – some barbarous age – that people would even invent something like, \"Well, there's a being that's everywhere, all the time, and you're supposed to say your prayers.\" They'd call – you know, invent some word like prayer and say, \"You're supposed to talk to this being all the time and give him the hot dope.\" I'd say in some dark age – not on this planet – but someplace, they'd dream up some mechanism – just spin people in. Because sooner or later somebody out of that lineup is going to say, \"I am not being listened to. My communication has not been delivered.\" For instance, I'm always hauling sideways the same operation as applied to Santa Claus. Santa Claus is a mythical being invented by Madison Avenue of yesteryear in order to sell merchandise. And this bird gets written to and, oddly enough, mainly gets replied – you know, replies come from him one way or the other. That's why you have department stores: to reply, see? But I always make sure that the communication always goes through reliable channels like HCO, see, and acknowledgment comes back down the line, solid, see? And I find out that this brings a great deal of cheerfulness about it all. But, I also find out, by inspection, that the ragamuffin doll that was scribbled \"ver-vuh-um-umdmn\" on the list and that nobody could read and that didn't get delivered is all that gets talked about Christmas Day. [laughter] So you see, this thing has many sides. But it's all on the subject of just A, R and C in its interchange and delivery and cutting the theta line and that's all there is to it. That is what it is. And you now start to walk away on thin ice from this very secure little footbridge and you're liable to go through. Now let me give you an idea, see? Let me give you an idea. I know this will come as a shock to some of you, that you shouldn't do this – but your pc, your pc is talking to you about bananas, see? The pc is talking to you about bananas and we're get-ting along just fine with the pc talking about bananas. But the pc accidentally, in passing, mentions watermelons – and we instantly ask him to talk about watermelons. He mentioned them; we ask him to talk about them. And then, when he is busy talking about watermelons, he happens to mention greengrocers. And the moment he mentions greengrocers, we then ask him to talk about greengrocers. Now, I know nobody present would do anything like that. We call it Q and A. You may have heard of it. Well, what exactly are you doing in relationship to A, R and C?"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 15 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 203 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST There's a much easier explanation of what Q and A is. Q and A is just not completing a cycle of action. That's all. You can Q and A on a pc over 500 hours of processing. You just don't complete the cycle of action laid out to be completed in the 500 hours of processing. You have Q'ed and A'ed. You don't even have to be the pc's auditor to Q and A on a pc. You can be the auditing director and mark the folder some other way, \"shift off of this process which you started on last month, and this program\" (not even process, see), but \"shift off of this program which you started the pc on last month, now, and go on some other program, even though he's still getting tone arm action on the program\" – not process, but program – \"which we laid out last month, because there's something more recent.\" Q and A. That's all. That's just an interrupted auditing cycle. An interrupted process cycle or an interrupted program cycle – any one of those things is just an incomplete cycle of action. And if you don't complete a cycle of action in any category – you know, the little auditing comm cycle or on up the line to the session, on up the line to the process, on up the line to the program – you fail to complete any of those, you've just Qed-and-Aed. But what's wrong with it? Why? Why is this so important? When this fellow was talk-ing to you about bananas – you see, trouble is, once in a blue moon you get away with it. He just accidentally was finished talking about bananas when you asked him about watermelons, so you thought that was all right because it was all right that time. But, let me tell you, that it's only one – about one chance in a hundred of it being all right. You sometimes get away with it, you see, which rather tends to trip you up. So he was finished talking about bananas. But supposing he hadn't really told you what he wanted to tell you about bananas. You cut the theta line right there in the session. Now, supposing he was just getting good on the subject of watermelons – he was just getting good on this particular subject – and he really realized that he had something to communicate on that subject, and you Qed-and-Aed and transferred him off to greengrocers. Oh, you'd have by this time two, not – let's put it banally and techni-cally – we'd have two unfinished communication cycles, which doesn't sound like very much. No, but back of that you've got something far worse. You had an undelivered, complete com-munication. You have an undelivered series of communications. In other words, you've cut this fellow's theta line. From that point on it's inevitable that you, sooner or later, will blow up as his auditor. It's just – it's just fate. Fate has intervened at this point. Kismet. You just got out your knife and started working on the tightrope you were walking, right in the middle of the chasm. Now, you wonder why you have trouble with pcs. You wonder why a pc's needle roughs up. You wonder why some auditors rough up pcs' needles. You wonder why you see some pcs ARC break. You wonder this and you wonder that. You wouldn't wonder very long if you got ahold of a tape of that session. You wouldn't wonder very long. You'd – cut it into the first third of the session, something like that, and you'd say, \"Well, we'll pick up something here.\" And you hear this little note of asperity, you see, in the pc's voice. He's – he sounds a little strained. He's still enthusiastic, but it's sort of an enthusi-astic strain. There's a note there that you don't quite like. Let's go back just a little bit further than this and we find the auditor is, \"Okay! Yes!\" you know, \"I got that,\" you know, and letting the pc go on and on, and then making very sure"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 16 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 204 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST that the communication was acknowl...

And under that heading I always assume that he knows perfectly how to do it, but that something is just disturbing him. Something has gone awry. I assume that he knows all his drills, see? There's something haywire here that we are looking at, that is making him go adrift. I don't immediately then go into the subject of dressing him up on the subject of drills. I start looking for something that is gone adrift in his auditing. I'd simply... see, so you'd have to have two frames of reference. One is the frame of reference of a critique of his ability to handle preclears and the other is a critique of his ability to handle drills. See, there would be two different points of view. And you can't mix up these two points of view and train an audi-tor or you're sunk. Otherwise, every time the auditor mishandles a pc, you put the auditor back on doing a drill. You should be teaching him about pcs, and you are teaching him about the drill. Hell, he knows how to do the drill! Well, why isn't he doing it? See, that's this other frame of reference. Well, he isn't doing it; like he's mucked-up somewhere or another here. On what? Handling a pc. That's where he's fouled up. He isn't fouled up on being able to say, \"Good,\" \"Thank you\" and \"Okay.\" See? That isn't where he's monkeyed up. He's monkeyed up on handling that thing sitting in the chair across from him that he knows not what of, somehow. And you hear him: \"Good! Than... thank you! Thank – thank you. I – I got, I – I got the communica... I – I heard you. I – I – I heard, heard you – what you said. Now, do you – do you know that I've acknowledged you?\" And you say, \"What the hell is going on here?\" Well, it isn't that this fellow's drills are out. It's his pc handling is out here, somehow or another. He doesn't understand something that is going on here. All right. So you roll back the tape a few more feet, see? Let's find this thing, see? How come he's – how come he's doing such a lousy job of auditing, is what we are asking, see? How come it's all getting so difficult? How come it's an unaudited, -auditable pc in an unauditing situation, see? So we get this tape back here, and we all of a sudden we hear it. We hear it. \"Well, yes, I know. We heard all about your mother in the last session, and so forth, and we are not going to take that up now. What we're going to go on into now is your family in general, and so forth.\" My God, it lay right in the R-factor. What a corny R-factor. The auditor took off from this point of view with an incomplete cycle of action on the subject that he was addressing in the last session. The pc's been thinking about it all night. Instantly and immediately the pc starts the session with a present time problem because of the R-factor, see? – an incomplete cycle of action, an incomplete communication. Definition of present time problem: an unde-livered communication. See? If you really want to handle present time problems, don't ever define them any other way."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 17 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 205 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I don't care how gross or how crude or how stupid all this sounds on the subject, or how it doesn't quite seem to apply. You just keep looking at it and you will find, stupid as it is – well, for instance, we find out this fellow feels very batty, and we trace back to where he feels very batty. And he didn't shoot a sniper in World War II, see? Undelivered communica-tion. Well, what the hell do you – you'll say, \"That's a funny communication: a bullet?\" Ah, but it follows the communication formula. It goes from here as cause across a distance and arrives at an effect. Do you see? Now, if we want to understand what an overt act is, we go around to the other side of the coin and we find out it was a communication he didn't want to deliver, he delivered. See? And that's what an overt act is. And what saves your bacon in auditing is the fact that the overt act is worse than the undelivered communication in terms of aberrative value because you have now perverted the ARC theta line, you see; you've perverted the theta line by caus-ing it to carry harm. Now, that really mucks up a theta line. Just not delivering at all is infinitely better than delivering harmfully. I don't care what GPMs say or anything else, see? You're too prone, perhaps, on occasion, to say, \"Well, we are all aberrated because of certain basic deep-seated woof-woofs, and so forth.\" It's quite interesting that the deeper and further research has gone – it isn't that I have found we are less and less governed by these predetermined impulses. I have gone through phases of blaming parts of Scientology on various parts of the mind. I inevitably will come up on the other side of the stream, dripping wet but with considerable relief, looking at it and recognizing that we were still above, in our basic understandings, the aberrative influences by which the mind has previously been understood. So we are really above, in our technology, what life has been up to in digging itself in, don't you see? Our understanding is superior to the aberrative impulses. Let me give you the idea – a very short, faster idea. For instance, Freud continuously stressed sex, see? And later on, his apologists said that if he had just talked about social im-plications as well as sexual implications, his work would have been more successful. No, Freud's work ceased to work when he got – they got off the subject of sex. The big libido the-ory of 1894 was his top, top climb. That was his summit; and anything else went down from there. That was as close as he got to the moon. And when he started walking away from that, or his apologists started walking away from that, he got into trouble and he ceased to cure people. Why? He was as close as he could get to the GPM create series. See? He just walked in close on that perimeter, had a big cognition, laid it down as what he called his libido theory and then any time he tried to minimize this or walk away from it he was denying and invali-dating GPMs. And so, therefore, it wasn't true that Freud should have mentioned social impli-cations. No, hell, Freud should have kept right on pounding down the line of sex, you see, with a capital Freud. See? He should have hit it all the way, see, because he was right in there, see? He really did have his paws on something."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 18 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 206 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST All right. Now, he was below – he was below the point of mental dramatization, in other words, he was interpreting the mind through a dramatization of a mind. In other words, he was dramatizing a bit when he was doing this, see? All right. To that degree we have not been guilty of this particular line, and our mate-rials, the further we go on this, start to stand clear and pure as a total command of understand-ing of livingness, life, and so forth, than before. Do you see? I mean, they separate out rather easily. I go through some bad periods once in a while on this. I think \"Oo-oh,\" you know? \"Oh, no,\" you know? Not too long ago I looked with sudden horror – oh, actually about a year ago – I looked with sudden horror at the idea that the whole Tone Scale was simply based on something out of a series of implants, see? Uhhgh! And I thought, \"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.\" And then it turned out they weren't there. And – so more recently I said, \"Well, obviously the Tone Scale all came out of GPMs, obviously. Obviously. Heh! It's not there.\" And my pc read a great deal of significance into GPMs to a point where we developed a full process one time to run GPMs. It had nothing but in – Scientology injected into the GPMs. We had to turn around and un-inject it. In other words, we knew more about the mind than was in the mind, don't you see? So we could... it was R1C. R1C. For a while I thought we couldn't run R1C because I thought it was my solution. No, we understood more about life, do you see, than was understood by the thetan himself. Because he was not down the line on solution or anything like that, see? We understood that solution was an aberrative factor. Solution is a real aberrative factor. The GPM only brings about; it doesn't solve. You get what I mean? So once in a while you can get real hot. And one of the difficulties we have is we un-derstand the situation we're looking at too well. We understand it with such great pervasive thoroughness that we inject an awful lot of data into it that isn't there. In other words, it's just total screwball – the situation. It's like this. Now, we could go on and on and say the present time problem is a present time problem because it's postulate versus postulate, and so forth. Oh, yes, that's basically true of problems. That's the anatomy of problem. Oh, yes, that's why GPMs hang up. Oh, yes, all these things are very, very true. But let's draw back to the level of ARC. Now, that's not a mild understanding. For in-stance, I'm talking to you today at ARC at the level of IV. I'm not talking to you about ARC at the level of 1C. Now, I tell you, all these things are true – completely true about postulate versus pos-tulate and it's mass versus mass and it takes an impulse versus an impulse to make a problem and because it's this and it's because it's that and because there are disagreements involved and all of this and that and so forth. All these things are true, you understand? But let's go right on upstairs in a complete purity of understanding. Philosophically, what is this thing: a problem? This thing is a problem because it's an undelivered communication. Now, you have to be a pretty smart cookie to take a case apart knowing that, and knowing at the same thing that it's an unrunnable process. It's an undelivered communication. That's made it a problem. An overt act is not a problem. An overt act is a withdrawal from"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 19 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 207 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST putting out an ARC line because you know you will abuse it. It's a self-discipline. It's an abuse of ARC, so one doesn't ARC because one possibly might abuse ARC, so then one doesn't ARC. You see? Self-discipline, here, is involved. An individual is putting an awful check and brace on himself. And this is the basic withhold. \"Don't shoot anybody, see? Don't cause harm. Don't harm.\" I don't care what kind of GPMs are developed by the thetan coming down the line. They probably louse him up no end. You could probably get an awful lot of mileage out of doing these things sideways. But when the chips are all down and you've got them all proc-essed out, you'll find the answer is still there the same way. You understand, this is – this is the way the critter operates. See, he doesn't want to undertake this particular communication because it is harmful, so therefore he withholds that particular communication. All right. There's that source, then, of not communicating – there's that reason for not communicating – which is – looks a little more involved than the other reason because it in-cludes the overt-withhold sequence. But there is this other simple one, which, of course, you understand now, is the same statement as the other one. The other was a more complex state-ment – it's an undelivered communication. Even O/W is an undelivered communication. He's delivered one far too well. Pow! Oh, well. He better not deliver any more com-munications along this line. And he better not have delivered that one. So he'll develop a whole section of his bank out of communications he had better not deliver, so he is not deliv-ering the communications he did deliver. \"What communication did you deliver that you had-n't ought to have?\" would be guaranteed to set off an automaticity. So you look at somebody who's having a hard time with life, and he's got a lot of pre-sent time problems. And he comes in and he says, \"I got this present time problem ta-wowowow–I–tawowow. Oh, what am I going to do?\" and so forth and so on. You know one thing: that he's having an awful time. And the other thing you know, is for whatever reason – because he's breaking himself, because he might communicate, don't you see, and therefore is withholding because it will – these are all just rationales. You know two things. One, he's in that state and you know he's in that state because he hasn't delivered a communication. So you know those two things about this individual at once. Bang, bang. Simple as that. Take off from there – remembering at the same time that there is no repetitive process: \"What haven't you communicated to?\" There is no process: \"What don't you have to have?\" There is no process: \"What could you get rid of?\" These are all \"What could you go out of ARC with?\" you see? Brutal processes that go right straight downhill. There is only a process along the line of \"What have you communicated with?\" see, and so forth. Now, you get your ARC break process – that mainly depends on regretted com-munication. See, you're running in some other factors. And out of this understanding you could tailor-make a lot of processes that would go into a lot of various lines. Just look at it at – offhand. \"What had you ought to have communi-cated that you didn't have?\" See? All right. \"Now what had you ought to communicated that you didn't have?\" All right. That is, \"What did you go out of communication with?\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"WISDOM AS AN AUDITOR 20 SHSBC-380 – 28.4.64 LEVEL 0 208 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST All right. You are going to run that process. You say it's absolutely necessary to get rid of this. Well, how are you going to get away with running that process? That process is un-runnable. Oh-ho-ho. You will have to answer it up immediately with \"What did you go into communication with?\" Now you've got a half-cursed, half-blessed process. You can probably get away with it. You could say, \"Look around here and find something you don't have to have.\" \"Now look around here and find something you have.\" See? Now you've half-cursed it and half-blessed it, so you – you understand this isn't ideal. But this is – run a sufficiently workable process so that you can run an unworkable process, so that you can simply get rid of the points he is hung up on in order to run a better process. Do you understand that? So, you could go as far as that down into the shades of hell for the pc, and you would – after a little while, by the way, you shouldn't be too puzzled why this process doesn't run marvelously, why it doesn't run endlessly, why the pc occasionally has headaches. These things should be quite understood by you. You're simply getting some problems out of the road that – so that you can run the case. So you wouldn't go on very long along this direction before you shifted over into, \"Well, what communication did you deliver?\" You could run that kind of a process: \"What communication did you deliver?\" Well now, he doesn't understand that. Communication, to him, appears to be a rather high order of thing, and that he delivered it means that he was all right, and so forth. So you say, \"What overt act did you commit?\" And you run the same one. \"What communication did you communicate that you didn't think you what – ought to have commu-nicated?\" In other words, \"What communication – what delivered communication is regret-ted? What are you trying now at this moment not to have delivered that you did?\" Do you see these ramifications? Work these things out and you've got it made. The only difficulties that are going to happen anyplace in this universe, the only difficulties that have happened in this universe and the only difficulties that would occur even if it weren't here are simply based on this same information I am giving you. Whether or not there are GPMs, whether or not there are not GPMs, whether there is a universe, whether there is no universe; you still have this same potential of difficulty. You see somebody in difficulty – it would be this same reason, see? \"What communication aren't you delivering because you have delivered so many lousy communications?\" Do you see? Unrunnable process, but a complete understanding of the situation. Now, what have you got to do? Well, you've got to do what you've got to do in order to get him to communicate where he should be communicating. And that may be have to be approached through the R and that may be have to be approached through the A as well as – and you may have to work it around in some way, but you're trying to multiply his ability to communicate and get the barriers of noncommunication out of the way. And if you did that, why, you'd have it made and everything would be all right and okay. What I have been talking to you about is wisdom as an auditor.

He feels bad and doesn't cognite and may ARC Break. Try it out. Have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he has completely told you all. That's why pcs Itsa on and on and on and on with no gain. The auditor prematurely acknowledged. That's why pcs get cross \"for no reason\". The auditor has prematurely and unwittingly acknowledged. That's why one feels dull when talking to certain people. They prematurely acknowledge. That's why one thinks another is stupid – that person prematurely acknowledges. The quickest way to become a social pariah (dog) is to prematurely acknowledge. One can do it in many ways. The quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greater length.

This is the 26th of July, AD 16.3 Auditing means to listen and compute. It also means to get a result on a pc. And it's done in a subject called Scientology. And one sits down, usually, except in one series of proc-esses, known as the CCHs, and he has a preclear. That is somebody who isn't Clear. Now, in view of the fact that this person isn't Clear, he has to be handled rather gently because he has aberrations and difficulties. And it requires auditing done in a technical and professional manner which has not departed from standard procedure. You see, they have al-ways had offbeat processing of one kind or another. It has existed since the earliest days of wogdom. There is no reason to perpetuate it. The psycho-anal-yst – [laughter] I beg your pardon; it's rather obvious pronunciation – he sits down and does something with a person, too. But there is no similarity between what he's doing and what a Scientologist is doing. Now, a Scientologist is trying to make the person better and that is a new idea in the whole field of the human mind. It is so new and novel they think we are terrible because we do not electric shock and execute people. Our situation does not compare with earlier activities, laughingly called psychotherapy or pure duress, medieval torture, police action and other things which have passed for mental therapy down through the ages. We're not even in the field of mental therapy. We're trying to make somebody Clear. Clear of what? Clear of his reactive bank. Now, Freud said that man had an unconscious or a reconscious or something of the sort which was subconscious under the underconscious. He thought there was something there and it was inhabited by a beast known as the censor, who kept the fellows from pulling a so-cial faux pas. And when the censor was asleep or nulled or something of the sort by drugs, why, the fellow would do antisocial acts, and that was the whole explanation of the human mind, except it was all caused by sex. I hope you're following me closely.   3 Editor's note: From the German transscript it is obvious that in this edition of the tape some part was deleted where LRH makes a humorous remark. Re-translated from German it must have been something like: \"...and I am not late – the schedule of Saint Hill is wrong. I think the real reason for this lecture beginning late is that people already know what I am going to tell. It has to do with auditing.\""},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 2 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 216 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST But anyhow, we are – we are actually indebted to Papa Freud, because he did say out loud that there was some kind of a mind that was kicking back on somebody. He didn't really discover the reactive mind; we did. Now, clearing somebody is erasing his reactive mind. All that is horrible, bestial and antisocial about a person is actually contained in his reactive mind. But we are also not inter-ested, in a man, whether he's horrible, antisocial or bestial. This again has nothing to do with auditing. Auditing is not a social criticism. If you'll notice, nearly all psychotherapies are in-volved in social criticism. The psychiatrist exists for the (quote) good of the society (unquote) and to hell with the patient. That is the way he operates. Now, therefore, we're into a new field. And we know the answers to the way a preclear behaves – not human beings behave; we know the answers to those, too, but who cares. The difference between a good-behaving wog and a bad-behaving wog is so slight as to be unde-tectable. [laughter] I've seen dear old ladies ruining their families and driving them straight to suicide and so forth, and being patted on the back on Mother's Day. I've seen some of the wildest social mishmashes. It's all by definition: if you kill a man, why, that isn't bad or good; it's by defini-tion, bad or good. You kill him in war, or you kill him because he deserves it, or you kill him because he's a criminal or – and you're a judge – or something like that – why that, that's good, see? But if you kill him one inch of type outside the statute, and so forth, that's bad, see? So there are good things and bad things, but they both are the same thing. So if you want to get into this morass of social behavior, by all means do so, but don't mix it up with Scientology. Now, you can tell why a person conducts himself as he does – why a person conducts himself as he does. Good, I'm glad we can. But we don't care, because there is a certain road out. Scientology is a way. It is the road out – away from reactivity, away from aberration, away from identification of A=A=A. And it increases a person's ability and it increases his general performance in existence to a very marked and fantastic degree. And that road out has certain little milestones that you have to pass to get out and we call these, for want of a better definition, we call these Grades. But there are things called levels. And now, if we look at the Classification, Gradation and Awareness Chart of Levels and Certificates, first one issued, and the modern one which is about to be issued – since the interim issue of early 1966 dropped several points off this chart that were vital to it and made it relatively unworkable, and which won't be dropped again. I came back home in time. Now, the point here is that there are certain points on this that a per-son goes up toward Clear. And those points have certain definite abilities regained. But these Grades are not really composed of single points – something that you might not have noticed, even you working with Grades – they are not composed of single points. Now, this is the rough, public rendition – public rendition – and this is not likely to change. This is the public rendition, is Level 0, Communications; Level I – or I should say Grade – Grade 0, Communications; Grade I, Problems; Grade II, Overts and Withholds; Grade III, ARC Breaks; Grade IV, Service Facsimiles. Grade V is in actual fact a whole track Grade, but it is the more innocent end of it. It gets a fellow up to where he can confront whole track. And then we've got Grade VI, which is unburdening the reactive mind, which really is"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 3 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 217 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST whole track – except you don't have to address it at either point, which is quite interesting and mysterious about it all. It sort of drops between V and VI and gets ignored these days but every once in a while a piece of whole track bangs somebody right in the snoot and he doesn't quite know what hit him. And he says, \"What was that? I seem to be sitting here in a space car and we seem to be shooting up toward some planet of some kind or another, and we seem to be deliv-ering an atom bomb or something. I'm not sure what. And, ooh, oh yeah. Well, I get it now. It exploded. Yeah. Wonder what that's all about? I guess I've been reading too much science fiction.\" [laughter] And people should ask, \"Why does science fiction have the command on its audience that it does?\" They never looked at that side of it. And then we get Level VII, which contains the materials necessary to totally erase the reactive mind. Now, I want to point out to you that it is really not possible – people will try this, and as we go up the line, the only wreckage we will find is people who have tried to enter this whole problem up in the upper grades, ignoring the lower grades. And that, you'll find, is the main part of the catastrophes. The other part of the catastrophe is simply not following standard technology. What is standard technology? Standard technology is contained in HCOBs. It actually isn't contained in any of the books of Dianetics and Scientology. Did you ever realize that? Modern technology is not contained in any of the hardcover books, or any of the other books. It's contained in HCOBs, Hubbard Communications Office Bulletins, and there they just run off one after the other. And one of these fine days I suppose we will roll up our sleeves and publish them all in consecutive order, all corrected so that nothing ever corrects anything in the bulletins and make it very, very easy. But we will have to put them probably in about seven or eight or ten different volumes, because there are quite a few of them. But that's stan-dard technology. They're on white paper printed with red ink. If I haven't signed it, it isn't true. And that's standard technology. Now, because we developed something later, we didn't lose the standard technology of something earlier. The main bugbear of the person studying Scientology was that he – the bugbear was his, not mine – was that he conceived, every time he read something new, that that wiped out all the old. And this concept was brought about on just this one point: that he didn't understand the old that he had read, so he didn't realize that it integrated with the new which had just been issued. And at no time, really, in HCOBs, has the new wiped out the old. There are very, very few corrections. I remember trying to correct a whole series of processes one time called the R2s – R2-12 (there was R2-10, R2-12). And I corrected all these because they seemed to be just produc-ing havoc. They seemed to be terribly ruinous, and there was only one thing wrong with them: is they made a Release at their grade so fast that the auditor never noticed. He'd start his list, practically and he had a Release sitting in front of him. But of course, he wanted to earn his pay – and that was before we knew about overruns – so he would go on and run it and run it and run it. And for quite a while it'd produce quite phenomenal results, even being overrun. But suddenly, clank! The person would go straight into the bank with it and that was very up-setting."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 4 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 218 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So the idea of overrun, and how flat is a flat process, and so forth, does require correc-tion in HCOBs. But there is nothing in an HCOB – nothing in any HCOB – that tells you you mustn't audit the pc. You look there in vain and you won't find anyplace in there...4 I've got the Saint Hill Course on running engrams as a practice action and I think you must be having a ball. I think possibly, much to your consternation, you've made a grade of release here or there that you didn't know existed in the lower bands, and that's probably very upsetting. And that was probably what upset Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health auditors. They were probably making lower levels of release which they would overrun. But I assure you that you can have a release per chain, so don't go dashing off side-ways and trying to get out of facing the engram by going release. He is a \"secondary about Mamas\" release; that's the grade of release it is, or the level of release. This fellow is a \"light engram\" release on the subject of cutting his finger. He's re-leased on cutting a finger. I speak quite seriously. It's just by chains. Now, I, in the first place, would be the last one to plow anybody in – unless he's a stu-dent. [laughter] Now, pcs are people and they're entitled to a break, and they're entitled to rapid gains, and they're entitled to soar and go right straight on up to Clear, and all that. This we know. But that doesn't apply to a student. You know, in opera they always say that the individual, the opera singer, really never has tonal quality or feeling in her voice until she has suffered. And after some great suffering in life, why, she becomes a great artist. Have you ever heard that? Well, after you've had it a few times, you'll become a great auditor. [laughter] I wouldn't give anything for an auditor who hadn't occasionally been wrapped around a telegraph pole – but good! Like a pretzel. I wouldn't give anything for an auditor who hadn't had an ARC break while being audited for the next ten or fifteen hours, and going into a sad effect. Then he'd know what it was, you know? I know this is brutal and even sadistic, but it isn't. It isn't, in actual fact. It's a complete fact. The fellow who's never been overrun on anything – he certainly is never going to be shy of being overrun; it's out of sight of his zone of experience. \"Well, I don't know what the pc's all upset about. Of course, I missed a free needle, but what's the pc upset about? Should ap-preciate it; I gave him an additional fifteen hours of auditing.\" [laughter] An auditor isn't worth much unless sometime or another he's audited over the top of a PTP. You actually owe it to yourself professionally, and to wogs and what it's all about, to sit down someday as the pc and just don't announce the fact that you're worried as Punch about a PTP. And of course, you'll get no gains, you'll feel terrible, and so forth, being audited on that. Now, I'm not advocating bad auditing for the sake of experience. But I am saying that if you do very much auditing, you can't help but get some bad auditing now and then, and it's not necessarily disastrous.   4 Editor's note: Another deletion. The missing part, retranslated, is: \"It is really good that I came home again. You know, there was a big thing which had to be handled.\""},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 5 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 219 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I have had some of the lousiest auditing anybody ever heard of. I've been audited by Dianetic auditors who were trained in an Academy which taught only the bubble theory. I used to get away with it by saying, well, I just would do exactly what the auditor said, and this got me through many, many years. But in 1958, I found an auditor who gave me four auditing commands simultaneously, didn't let me answer any one of them, and so forth, and then wouldn't tell me which one I was supposed to answer. It's quite a dogfight. So even that stable datum vanished on me. I've had some very good auditing and I have had some championship bad auditing. And I'm moving right on up; be checked out here, in a few days, Clear. Now, what's all this about? It is a command of the thing called the mind. Now, maybe after you're Clear and maybe after you go OT, and so forth, you won't then really care to un-derstand anything about man and just regard him as a sort of an oddity that sometimes gets under your feet. But in actual fact, that's a rather dangerous attitude. You should rather savvy what this character is all about. There isn't anything – now, believe me – there isn't anything going to help him. Educa-tion, psychotherapy with electrodes, brainectomies – that's the new psychiatric operation: they take out the whole brain. [laughter] There isn't anything going to help an aberrated being, I assure you. There is nothing going to help an aberrated being but processing. They can sweat it out educationally, and so forth. Now, I'm talking about his state of case, his behavior, and so forth. Really, you're not going to get anyplace, short of processing. So you better know that processing is a very narrow, little track – a very, very narrow, little track – bounded on both sides and above and below by a complete mass of improper things that can be done. It would be impossible to list the number of wrong things that could be done in auditing. It would be an infinite list. Every time I'd think I had it all straightened out and nobody could possibly make any additional errors of any kind whatsoever, one would. So this track called standard technology is a very, very narrow path and it's very easy to stray off of its edges. And one of the ways of straying off of its edges is to forget to handle pcs while auditing them. And I see what has happened here and why we have fallen into not handling pcs anymore. Because obviously, all the ways you handle pcs are contained in the grades of release, aren't they? \"So, of course you can't handle a pc's overts if you're running a communication process. Naturally! It'd be beyond his grade. And of course you can't handle an ARC break while auditing a communication process, because ARC breaks, and so forth, are up here at III and IV.\" And I think that's how you've gotten into it, but you sure have got-ten into it. You can always run an advanced process on a pc, as a rudiment, as something to straighten the case out in a hurry. He isn't about to go release on it. But the day you sit down to audit a Grade 0 – to make and attain a Grade 0 – the day you sit down to audit that person and do not detect or note that he has a present time problem is a day you will have a lose, as a case! That guy isn't going anyplace! You're auditing over the top of a heavy PTP. That present time problem has got him parked right there – bang, bang! You say, \"Is there anything you'd be willing to talk to me about?\""},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 6 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 220 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"Well, I have some problems.\" \"Well, I'm sorry. Can't talk to you about the problems because problems are up here – the problems are up here at-at-at-at Grade I and you're only at Grade 0. So, you have to shut up about that!\" [laughter] Finally, you're running problems and you're grinding on and on and on about prob-lems. And the pc is getting sadder and sadder and sadder and sadder, and he says, \"But you're not answering my communications, and you're not acknowledging me, and – umpff – I've been feeling terrible for the last thirty-eight days.\" And you say, \"Well, yes, but we can't do anything about that because, you see, that's... Grade III and IV is where we handle ARC breaks, and so you'll just have to ha... keep your ARC break until we get up to the grade that it's supposed to be handled at.\" And of course, the answer to that silliness is the guy is not about to ever get up in grades. Now, let me tell you something about this chart that maybe didn't come home too completely: is how'd I find this chart? There's one for you. How'd I find this chart? Why is this chart so dead on? This Gradation Chart, so forth – it's quite a trick. It's made up only of those things which you can't audit in the face of. And that is the genus of the chart, and that is the real reason I found the Grades, and why I found the Grades. And I isolated them just as crudely as that. I said, \"All right. There are certain things that, if you don't pay attention to them, prevent all progress in auditing. So therefore, they must be the keys to aberration.\" And that's where we got the Gradation Chart. Clever of me, wasn't it? Audience: Yes! People think it's a Gradation Chart so people will take it by a gradient. Well, they're ar-ranged crudely by gradient, but you'd be surprised how long I argued: Was O/W an upper grade from problems or a lower grade? And I finally found out that it must be an upper grade, because a fellow could confront having problems when he couldn't confront having overts, so therefore, that was an upper grade. This was the way the thing had to be rationalized. But there it was. In all those years of experience – and believe me, there have been a lot of years of experience on this subject; a lot of them – in all these years, only these factors have presented themselves, factors that each one separately, much less in combination, can totally prevent case gain unless given attention, by definition. This is the superbarrier. These are the superbarriers to the track. These are the girders across the bridge that have fallen down sideways. And what are these things? Well, it's elementary: the things that a person cannot possi-bly audit up against. If these things are out, the auditor has had it. He can't go any further. And these things are communication, problems, overts, ARC break and service facsimiles. When you've moved the fellow up that far, he can confront something of his own life and back-ground, and so starts moving out onto whole track and moving into the reactive bank itself. But the things that you cannot audit in the presence of, without handling, are the Grades on that Gradation Chart. Do you see this?"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 7 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 221 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST So, of course, if they are the things which absolutely stop any pc's progress, then they must be, themselves, things which desperately require releasing. And when then addressed, I didn't even have – when I finally figured this out and worked this down and split the process. And I knew already about overrun. We found overrun in doing Power Processes. But when those things were audited on a big basis with the pc – such a thing as his overts – when they were audited on a grand scale, I knew you'd get a Release. So I knew you could have a Communications Release and I knew you could have a Problems Release and I knew you could have an Overt Release and I knew you could have an ARC Break Release, see? Dead easy. Nothing to it. Naturally. The thing had to be that way, because these things were the powerful points in the human mind that debarred all further progress on the part of a case. Well, all a fellow had to do was be worried about his wife. All he had to do was be worried about his wife not meeting him that afternoon, which gave him a problem of \"What is my wife doing afternoons?\" He comes into session, his tone arm fails to produce action – nothing is as-ising; he isn't coming out of anything – and even starts climb-ing a bit. He can't answer the auditing commands. He can concentrate on nothing. That's what a problem will do. Now, this fellow who is in overts: Of course, the fellow can't talk to you – he can't talk. I wonder if you ever realized, though, that talk goes down to the fact that a patient in a hospi-tal gives you trouble as an auditor if the patient is unconscious. An unconscious patient is out of communication; it's just a communication trouble. But also, I'd like to call to your attention that dogs and horses are out of communication. And I don't know how you're going to solve that, but that's your problem today. I'm not worried about it anymore. But this fellow has committed an overt against the auditor, or against Scientology or the organization. Or he's trying to get away with something – he's got a withhold. You going to make progress with him? Nu-uh. Mm-mm, mm-mm. He's just going to get natterier and natterier, and choppier and choppier, and nastier and nastier, and meaner and meaner. He's not going to make any progress, not one scrap! I'll tell you a joke. You might not think it's a joke. But do you know that one of the dif-ferences of technical accomplishment between Saint Hill and a Central Organization is that a Central Organization very often gets a pc who doesn't intend to completely pay for his ser-vice? That much withhold parks the case right there – just stops it! Now, you take an ARC break – this is the most deadly thing that anybody ever had anything to do with. What essentially is it? It's affinity, reality and communication, break in. What is \"break?\" Bust. Snapped. People get to thinking it's because they weren't acknowledged. Please. You see, there is no term in the English language or in Latin to describe this adequately. So the individual's affinity has been cut. And that's Desire – Enforce – Inhibit (the old CDEI Scale: Curiosity, Desire, Enforce, Inhibit) couldn't be on A, and any one of those actions couldn't cause an ARC break. And – only it would be called an A break. And R – it would be over- and under-reality. Somebody's busted his reality: \"Where did you put the staircase, pal?\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 8 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 222 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST \"I haven't any staircase. I never saw the staircase.\" \"Oh, yes you did, pal. I saw you build it with your own little hatchet.\" A reality break, again CDEI – Curiousity, Desire, Enforce, Inhibit – on reality. En-forced reality, and so forth. What is laughingly called modern education is mostly enforced reality. Hoo-hoo-hoo. Because boy, that reality can be in quotes, too. Boy, can it be in quotes. So if you want to really ARC break somebody with one of the natural sciences, turn him loose in a physics laboratory as a student with the equipment which is commonly fur-nished, and try to get him to get an experiment to come out. You know they seldom come out. You normally take the best student (who is the best student because he has an answer book) and then the rest of the students sort of copy it off and fudge it one way or the other, so the amount of paper burned, and the amount of – the weight of the paper equals the weight of the ash plus the weight of the smoke, you see, showing that nothing is ever destroyed, and so on. You get into corny equipment, and so forth, and you get a reality break. Education quite customarily and routinely breaks somebody's reality and it breaks their reality sufficiently as to make them bad students, or they don't want to study, or something like that. And then we get into communication break, and of course, that's the most visible. Guy talked too much or didn't talk at all. The guy would not answer the communication at all or the guy answered the communication perpetually so that it couldn't be communicated. Any of those things will cause an ARC break. All right? Look at that: your first Level, 0, is communication. Level III is ARC breaks. How many pcs are you going to handle at Level 0 without ever colliding with an error at Level III? If C is one of the commonest sources of ARC breaks, you mean to tell me that you're going to handle the subject of communication without ever bringing about or finding an ARC break in the student that has to be handled, huh? Well, like cat, you're not. You never will in God's green earth, really. There's always got to be somebody around in Review, or some senior student or some-thing like that, to be alert on Level 0 students. Of course, I know it goes like hot butter, and it – you don't run into trouble very much. But it's that very little trouble that you must also be interested in because it'll barrier your re-sults. Now, I know you could go on the basis, \"Well, after all, there are getting to be three billion human beings, and that's an awful lot of human beings; that's an awful lot of wogs, and there's no reason why we shouldn't expend a few, you see, in the process of salvaging them.\" Well now, I'm a conservationist. Well now, as far as service facsimile is concerned, this fellow is – all this fellow is thinking about, at the problems level, is his lumbosis. Boy, this lumbosis; you can't ever get... Every time you turn around, he's got lumbosis on the brain. His lumbosis is causing him trou-ble, man. He is just getting lots of trouble from his lumbosis. And then we finally find at Level IV it's a service facsimile. It's what explains all of his failures. He keeps telling you he"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 9 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 223 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST wants to get rid of his lumbosis, but really he never said it in that many words; he merely complains about having lumbosis. Now we begin to understand why we had such a hard time getting a Problems Release on this bird. We managed to achieve it, finally, and we did get a free needle, and so forth, but we were never very happy about it. Well, at Grade IV we find out that he has a service facsim-ile. Well, I don't say there is any short method of finding anybody's service facsimile that could be used in general, because we're getting too high in the grades. But fortunately, we're passing above the levels of reality which are real to somebody at the lower grades. And it normally turns up in due course. This merely turns out to be a pc we have always had trouble with. His rudiments were always out, or something like this. And then we finally get him up to Level IV and handle the service facsimile, and there we go. Now, at Level V, we're straightening him out on the subjects of reality and several other subjects which are taken up in a package, but what we're really doing is sort of getting the track straightened out. And we're looking for the points on the track where he is terribly stuck, where he's really mired in. And it takes very fancy processing to do that. Now we're getting into very artistic processing. But I assure you that if this processing, again, neglects these various barriers that can lie across the track of the individual, the guy will be stymied. You say, \"Well, yes, he's up to Grade IV – he's a complete Grade IV Release – so therefore, he should never again have any service facsimiles, ARC breaks, overts, withholds, problems or communication trouble.\" Oh, you – man, you got the wrong definition of Release. I wouldn't be a bit surprised – I just wouldn't be a bit surprised but what you couldn't find a whole new series of banks to unrelease a person into. You're dealing with a gross prod-uct here called a Release. This is just a gross product, and this is a hopeful product. This is the sort of a product that – solid gold is awfully nice, but all we've got is this gilt. And this gilt very often turns green. And sometimes we have good gilt and it lasts for weeks or months or even years – got some beryllium in it, you know; it's really goodshape gilt – and sometimes it turns green an hour later. And it's not gold at all. It gets verdigris. And I don't know how long a Release will stay stable becau... and I would never say how long a Release would stay sta-ble at any line because I have had rel... I've had Releases before this. You see, the one thing that booby-trap the whole of research in the field of the mind is that one could produce a temporary state of Clear. Temporary! Just like nearly all of life is composed of lower-scale mockeries. Yeah, yeah, you look around at somebody's exaggerated abilities – exaggerated and fixated, and become just one thing that he can do, don't you see? He's insane. But actually, the thing he is doing is an ability. Who was this old bird? Jung, I think it was. Jung. Now, thetans can move objects or bust up objects, I mean, when they're way upscale, see? All he had to do was sit down near one and it broke up. I think that was Jung. And this worried him so – this worried the guy so, that it was really what he wanted out of his studies and researches was not to have bookcases"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 10 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 224 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST fall down, plaster crack wide open, armchairs go out splat, every time he came near them. And he never achieved that. Well, actually, that would be a thetan ability gone mad. Poltergeist, or some such thing. So you get these upper-scale abilities that any thetan would have. They're out of con-trol and unexplained to the individual, and when they occur, why, he thinks he's crazy. So these lower-scale harmonics include the fact that one can make something that looks just like something but ain't. And that's the big booby trap. Now listen, it wasn't just a booby trap in 1950 – it was also a booby trap in 523 B.C., on this same subject, in this same line of research. A thetan exterior produced all the symp-toms of total sanity – great, whee, marvelous, and so forth. It'd last two minutes, two hours, two days, two years. But the one thing that was certain about it: it wouldn't go on. And the Buddhists called it a bodhi, and a bodhi has the same stability as any thetan exterior would have that you made today. You can walk up to somebody, pop him out of his head with the magic words and he will be stable for two seconds, two minutes, two hours, two days – your guess is as good as anybody else's. But one thing is certain about it: He will key in again. Now, release, the way we're doing it now – and you mustn't just downgrade the idea of release and say it's all that unstable, because it has this benefit: accompanied with it has been the experience of overcoming it. And that experience stands one in good stead because it has improved his ability to confront. Now, that goes further than that: a bit of erasure occurs. Modern auditing is suffi-ciently good that a bit of erasure occurs along with it and the condition is desensitized. So he is more apt to be stable as a Release on this grade than he was stable, to make a (quote) Clear (unquote) 1950, book style. Do you see? Now – I now know the difference between me and people that were being taught to audit in 1950. My auditing differed; it differed considerably. And the difference was that when the pc looked like he was finished, why, I quit. I wasn't trying to prove something. I was willing to give the pc a win (let me state it that way, although that's critical). I was so willing to give the pc a win that when the pc would say, \"Whee, gee!\" you know, and light up like Roman candles and so forth, I would say, \"That's it. Good. Fine. Thanks. Goodbye.\" And they had a tendency to remain stable for some time. Some of those people from back in the late 40s were stable three years afterwards, I know of. Now, what's interesting here is that we're approaching release on a gradient here and we know what grade of release we're making. And when we were (quote) \"clearing\" them in the 50s, we never knew what grade of release we were making a Clear at. Do you see? But this is the thing which booby-trapped the line, was the – the facts of stability. Sta-bility – how long would it last? Well, being a very thorough fellow and being a very, very thorough research man, and having been at it for a very, very long time now, I got the idea finally that it must be a totality. If we were going to have something that was a near absolute in the way of Clear, then we"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 11 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 225 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST were going to have to do a near totality of erasure. And for three years I worked very, very hard to find out what you totally erased and so today we get a Clear. Now, we've known for a long time that a thetan made up his own bank, but telling him so didn't get him over it. And we've just found out again that telling him so didn't get him over it, too. Even when he's almost Clear. We say, \"Hey, you're mocking it up,\" and he'd say, \"Hey, am I mocking it up? Yeah, I am mocking it up.\" And he'll go Clear – pshew! – and he goes off that bottom step that isn't there, you know? And he's got to go back on and finish it up the way he should. It's got to be his cognition. So once more the making of a Release and so on is very, very worthwhile – man, man, man – because it's on a plotted line, and the fellow has raised his confront, he's released – be-ing released in a proper sequence, he's getting accustomed to things that have been ruining his life, and would ruin anybody's life. Because let me assure you – once more I repeat – anything that will stop auditing would ruin somebody's life, because auditing is pretty hard to stop. Our process drills and that sort of thing are themselves intensely valuable therapeutically. I know some people, every time they felt bad, they'd go out and do their TRs. But this achievement was bringing it up to the top of a totality of erasure. And being a very thorough sort of chap, why, I said, \"All right. Then the answer to it is a total erasure.\" And of course, you can make a total erasure of the reactive bank, only nobody had ever done it before, from the beginning of the universe on. So there are a few little tricks involved in it. It takes a little while. But that's a head-on collision with the thing. That isn't just backing out of a desensi-tized area and being free of that desensitized area. Man, you could plunge into a nonexistent bank all you wanted to and you wouldn't find anything there to get stuck in. So that is a Clear. So a Clear is a stable state. But Clears – Clears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds concerning the rules of life, and when they do that, of course, they're OTs. Probably very, very advanced to tell you a thing like this but I've been, of course, researching OT proc-esses. And I find out, oddly enough, that the OT processes are the har... upper harmonics of just those processes – except they're not processes. That's another story. Now, wherever an auditor is auditing, there are only certain things that are going to prevent his achievement of success. There aren't 8,965 of them. There's only this little hand-ful – this very, very small handful. And you better not go multiplying the number of things that can get in your road, because then you're putting you in your road. And you know the hardest thing in the world for a thetan to get around is himself. Now, the things that you cannot neglect or ignore in auditing, regardless of the grade of the individual, are communication factors, problems (particularly PTPs, notably), overts, ARC breaks, the fact the guy is getting paid, some fashion or another, for his aberration or service facsimiles. And those things will always get in your road. And he might have gone somewhere else on the track than where he is supposed to be at. And the upper harmonic of that in OT is the guy is no longer in the room; he's gotten bored."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 12 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 226 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST But here are elementary things, and of those, the first four are the most vital. That is, communication, problems, overts and ARC breaks. Now, you're going to neglect those? You're not going to audit. What are the symptoms that a person with these things displays? Well, I'm not going to stand here and give you some long, authoritative list, because they are numerous. The indica-tors of these things are numerous. It's something like my explaining to you – and they're obvi-ous – something like my explaining to you that that sign up there that is one mile long and a half-mile high, painted a glaring white and lit with the totality of atomic fission and power from half the world's searchlights, with the red letters on it c-a-t, spells cat. That's the way I feel after a while. You know, I feel like I'm just beating a dead horse, you know? It's wild. If I say, \"Look, you cannot process somebody unless you're in communication with him.\" An auditor, half an hour later, realizes the pc hasn't answered any of the auditing ques-tions and goes and sees somebody, a Case Supervisor or somebody, and says, \"I don't think the process is working.\" Process be damned! The auditor isn't. The carrier wave of all processing is communication. So if your pc doesn't feel like talking to you, you're not going to get anyplace. I mean, how elementary can you get? Now, let's say we're doing a service facsimile at Grade IV, and the pc isn't talking. Well, we say, \"He can't possibly be not talking, because he is a Grade 0 Release.\" Well, let's just say he wasn't released on you. It just so happens he isn't talking that day, and until you get him talking, you're not going to get any auditing done. Now, you see what I mean about the mile-long sign a half a mile high, with – painted white with the letters cat on it in red. I mean, that's so obvious. How could I possibly ever have to tell anybody that? And yet, time and time again, I go through and I see a bunch of sessions happening, and I see this pc isn't talking and that pc isn't, and that one and that one. And I find about a third of the pcs in the room aren't talking to their auditor. It's not my hypersensitive, supertrained brain at work. My brain doesn't work, as a mat-ter of fact; that's probably why we got someplace. You'll see the pc, and the pc – he should be sitting here, you see, talking to the auditor, you see? And you see the pc like this: ... [silence] And you hear the cheery voice of the auditor, you see, saying, \"All right. Ah, let me have the next item.\" And the pc: \"...Cats.\" He don't hear this auditor say a thing, you know? You never hear the auditor say, \"What's up?\" You know, \"What's cookin', mate?\" Of course, the auditor would probably ask me, \"What are the proper words to use in a state like that,\" see? [laughter] My answer, I'm afraid, would be \"effective words.\" [laughter, applause] And similarly, we're trying to list something – find the – S&D or something like that – and the fellow says, \"Well, I – I'll – I'll give you a few more items but I've got to meet Mazie, you know, and so forth. We're having a bit of domestic problems, you know? We've got to go up and see the lawyer and so forth. I'll give you a few more items for this S&D, and so forth, but really you've got to warn me when it gets to be whumph-thirty.\""},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 13 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 227 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST And the auditor say, \"All right,\" and take the next few items on it. Whaw! The pc has got a PTP of such magnitude that his attention isn't in on the bank. So of course, if his atten-tion isn't in on the bank, how can his attention do anything, because it's the pc's attention, not the auditor, that does things through the bank. [laughs] And this pc is saying, \"Well, I don't want to be critical but I have had better auditors.\" [laughter] What the auditor doesn't realize is that pcs don't object to auditors unless they have overts on them – no matter how – how lousy their auditing is. Do you know that? And if you sit and look at a critical or nattery pc and so forth, and don't find the overt, you've just got rocks in your head, that's all! Why sit there and beat yourself up? You're beating yourself up! It had nothing to do with the state of his mind. It's the state of your technology. Critical pcs have overts. And the longer you audit them without pulling the overt, why, the more you're going to get chopped up; so why chop yourself up? That's the way you commit suicide! You just keep this up, the pc eventually will shoot you or something. And as far as ARC breaks are concerned, those ARC breaks that are not handled, worsen. You cannot audit in the presence of an ARC break. You notice it's fairly well up the grades there and it's pretty rugged. Auditing somebody over the top of an ARC break: at first he'll protest, and then he's liable to scream, and then he raises a fuss, and then he does this, and he finally finds out that isn't getting him anyplace. And he – he gets sort of tired, and he begins to feel a little bit sad, and then he gets sadder and sadder and sadder. And you'll see him walking around after a session and he looks like Ophelia, or whatever his name was, in that comic section that was written up the Avon, some years ago. You know, she looked very sad – although she was singing. I will say this, that these things have not been pointed out since the Gradation Chart came out but they are what they are and they can occur. And a person who is released at one of these grades is normally much less apt to have this happen. But get that – it's much less apt to have this happen. You could key him back in so it'll happen. You can throw somebody out of communication. Kick him in the teeth a few times and he won't talk to you. I guarantee it. I don't care what grade of release he is. I'd hate to do it to a Clear and OT. Probably something horrible would happen to you. But the point is that these things occur – until somebody changes his agreements on life, clear up at the level of OT. Now, I hope I've taught you something about a Gradation Chart. And I hope I've taught you something about the road out. You are very rich in having processes which on a broad, general basis handle these various conditions and make Grade Releases with some thorough-ness. You're very rich in this. But that doesn't mean that you won't get ARC broke with your-self as the auditor doing Grade VII. It's interesting that the bulk of, if not all, the Clears to date are good auditors. Aren't they all Saint Hill Course? There isn't one single fast-route Clear yet. Which is very interest-ing. So if you want a good auditor at Grade VI and VII, why, become one. An interesting commentary on this."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 14 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 228 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST But you are dealing with the primary things which barred living. And when I found out that if they were barring auditing, they were also barring living and therefore were the route for auditing, and then when plotted out did make rapid Releases, you've got the genus of this – this Gradation Chart. Possibly you hadn't realized that before. Quite a remarkable piece of stuff. There frankly isn't anything else that can happen to anybody that would bar the road out. You say, \"Well, he could get killed.\" Well, not necessarily; that wouldn't bar the road out, because he'd pick up another body and you'd get him sooner or later. But as far as audit-ing is concerned, those are the things that happen to people, and so therefore, they are the grades of release. Now, there are interim release points on this chart that you probably are neglecting. And you're saying, because a person goes free needle at Grade 0, he has then gone a Grade 0 Release, see? Now we're getting into dicey and dangerous stuff – but he's run some Commu-nication Processes at Grade 0 and has gone floppy needle and you say straight-away, \"We're all finished. And now he's a Grade 0 and we don't have to do anything else with Grade 0.\" I want to call to your attention that there's a thing over here called Valence Processes. What the hell were they? Well, they're covered in HCOBs – very legitimate address. That'd make a very thorough Grade 0 Release. Right now you're skipping it. These were the elementary Communication Processes. Well, there were some more complex Communication Processes for Grade I – much more complex Communication Proc-esses, all of which have been noted down – followed by Locational Processes, to make a grade of release. Here was the original plot. Now, when we did a II, we had the CCHs. How the devil? You could overrun the CCHs so easily that people are – tend to just pull off that one and just drop it right out of the lineup and not have any more to do with it, thank you! Because, of course, a person is off a meter while doing the CCHs, so therefore, you cannot tell when he goes free needle. But here also were ARC Processes. And there were lots of those. And then there was case remedies fitted in there; that whole Book of Case Remedies fitted in there. You could go release on a lot of those, too. Now, here was Auditing By List and Overt-Justifications, and so forth, at III. Here were solutions on physical problems and here was dating on a meter. That just dropped out of the lineup complete. I know it has.5 And then we had Cause and Effect Processes, which are quite remarkable, and R4H and Effort Processing and Rising Scale Processes. Now, here was where whole track engrams and secondaries and so forth fit, but those were the Power Processes – are the best and fastest way to get into that sort of a lineup. And then we had the R6 Processes Solo and we had the Power – this is \"processes used\" – the Power Processes belong here. And then we had above that, Clear. And above that, the OT Processes, which I am now developing.   5 Editor's note: Another deletion. The missing part, retranslated, is: \"And I also know what some of you might think right now. No, it has not dropped out of the grade chart. I have seen it during the last few days. Since a few days I am back home.\""},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE CLASSIFICATION CHART AND AUDITING 15 SHSBC-434 – 26.7.66 LEVEL 0 229 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now, that gave a whole list. Now, the processes which you are doing, and the last HCOBs which you have, these are perfectly all right for you to use. And a Clear is somebody at Grade 0 who has gone free needle on Communication Processes, and who at Grade I has gone free needle on Problems Processes, and at Grade II has gone free needle on overts and withholds, and at Level III has gone free needle on ARC breaks of one kind or another, and at Level IV has gone free needle while finding a service facsimile. And Level V and VA, of course, are going free needle, or the proper end phenomena, on the Power Processes. And Grade VI is the unburdening of the reactive mind by the processes prescribed at that level to a free needle – very easily overrun; a fellow is doing it himself. And they usually overrun and have to be brought back. And then at Grade VII is the total erasure of the reactive bank, and also the unreactive bank, and also any bank that had anything to do with it. And if you do those things, I will grant the fact that a person is released at all those grades. I want to point out there is a whole bunch of other things that can be done at those grades to release people. Now, I don't say you have to do those but I am saying this in this lecture: If you think you're going to run one pc for as much as two or three days of auditing without having to use technology from another grade than that from which – on which you're auditing him, either done by a senior or done by yourself; you are very much mistaken. It'd be very hard to audit some pc without, sooner or later, running into a communication breakdown, problems, without running into an overt, without running into an ARC break. Be almost im-possible! The smoothest auditor in the world could not fail but to run into one or more of those phenomena in the process of auditing. And if you're going to neglect them, you're just going to booby-trap the whole road as far as the pc is concerned. He's not going to make it on up the line, that's all. He will drop out. And I dare say any failures you're having with cases is because you are ignoring the grade definitions used as rudiments – the definitions and names of those grades. For instance, prob-lems, ARC breaks, and so forth. These are used. Now, how long do you sit and run ARC breaks on a Level 0 pc – a Grade 0 pc? How long do you run ARC breaks? You run it until you have handled the ARC break which was barring your road to auditing. You don't now try to make him a – an ARC Break Release. Do you get the idea? You understand more about this Gradation Chart? Audience: Yes. Mm-hm. Well, I do hope, in spite of the catastrophic method in which this lecture began... I ha-ven't mentioned any names. I haven't even looked pointedly at anybody. [laughter] And I haven't set up any examples that are actual examples – and this is true – I haven't set up any actual examples of anybody having goofed on this recently. I only discovered it on the basis of – just noticed that one auditor, in handling a case, neglected all of the points. And as he was an old-time auditor, I realized that he thought that was all yesterday's auditing and we didn't handle ARC breaks anymore, we just plowed through somehow. But auditing is done in a highly standard way. It is a very narrow, narrow track. It is not a wide track on both sides of the road. It is highly beneficial.

Not to find something that will get future TA. But just to get TA now. Many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in the session. Though this is important too (mainly at Level IV), it is secondary to Tone Arm Action. l. Get good Tone Arm Action. 2. Get things done in the session to increase Tone Arm Action. ____________________ NEW DATA ON THE E-METER The most elementary error in trying to get Tone Arm action is, of course, found under the fundamentals of auditing – reading an E-Meter. This point is so easily skipped over and seems so obvious that auditors routinely miss it. Until they understand this one point, an auditor will continue to get minimal TA and be content with 15 Divisions down per session – which in my book isn't TA but a meter stuck most of the session. There is something to know about meter reading and getting TA. Until this is known nothing else can be known. TONE ARM ASSESSMENT The Tone Arm provides assessment actions. Like the needle reacts on list items, so does the Tone Arm react on things that will give TA. You don't usually needle assess in doing Levels I, II and III. You Tone Arm Assess. The Rule is: That which moves the Tone Arm down will give Tone Arm Action."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 2 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 232 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Conversely, another rule: That which moves only the needle seldom gives good TA. So for Levels I, II and III (and not Level IV) you can actually paste a paper over the needle dial, leaving only the bottom of the needle shaft visible so the TA can be set by it and do all assessments needed with the Tone Arm. If the TA moves on a subject then that subject will produce TA if the pc is permitted to talk about it (Itsa it). Almost all auditors, when the Itsa Line first came out, tried only to find future TA ac-tion and never took any present TA action. The result was continuous listing of problems and needle nulling in an endless search to find something that \"would produce TA action\". They looked frantically all around to find some subject that would produce TA action and never looked at the Tone Arm of their meter or tried to find what was moving it now. This seems almost a foolish thing to stress – that what is producing TA will produce TA. But it is the first lesson to learn. And it takes a lot of learning. Auditors also went frantic trying to understand what an Itsa Line was. They thought it was a Comm Line. Or part of the CCHs or almost anything but what it is. It is too simple. There are two things of great importance in an auditing cycle. One is the Whatsit, the other is the Itsa. Confuse them and you get no TA. If the auditor puts in the Itsa and the preclear the Whatsit, the result is no TA. The auditor puts in the Whatsit and the pc the Itsa, always. It is so easy to reverse the role in audit-ing that most auditors do it at first. The preclear is very willing to talk about his difficulties, problems and confusions. The auditor is so willing to Itsa (discover) what is troubling the preclear that an auditor, green in this, will then work, work, work to try to Itsa something \"that will give the pc TA\", that he causes the pc to \"Whatsit Whatsit Whatsit that's wrong with me\". Listing is not really good Itsa-ing; it's Whatsit-ing as the pc is in the mood \"Is it this? Is it that?\" even when \"solutions\" are being listed for assessment. The result is poor TA. TA comes from the pc saying, \"It is\" not \"Is it?\" Examples of Whatsit and Itsa: Auditor: \"What's here?\" (Whatsit) Pc: \"An auditor, a preclear, a meter.\" (Itsa) Itsa really isn't even a Comm Line. It's what travels on a Comm Line from the pc to the auditor, if that which travels is saying with certainty \"It is\". I can sit down with a pc and meter, put in about three minutes \"assessing\" by Tone Arm Action and using only R1C get 35 Divisions of TA in 2½ hours with no more work than writing down TA reads and my auditor's report. Why? Because the pc is not being stopped from Itsa-ing and because I don't lead the pc into Whatsit-ing. And also because I don't think auditing is complicated. Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented if it didn't occur. Example: An auditor, noting a Whatsit moved the TA, every time, promptly changed the Whatsit to a different Whatsit. Actually happened. Yet in being asked what he was doing in session said: \"I ask the pc for a problem he has had and every time he comes up with one I ask for solutions to it.\" He didn't add that he frantically changed the Whatsit each time the TA started to move. Result – 9 Divisions of TA in 2½ hours, pc laden with by-passed charge. If he had only done what he said he had he would have had TA."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 3 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 233 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If it didn't occur, Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented! It doesn't just \"not oc-cur\". In confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the Itsa Line themselves and not let the pc is the fad of using the meter as a Ouija Board. The auditor asks it questions con-tinually and never asks the pc. Up the spout go Divisions of TA. \"Is this Item a terminal?\" the auditor asks the meter. Why not ask the pc? If you ask the pc, you get an Itsa, \"No, I think it's an oppterm because............\" and the TA moves. ____________________ Now to give you some idea of how crazy simple it is to get in an Itsa Line on the pc, try this: Start the session and just sit back and look at the pc. Don't say anything. Just sit there looking at the pc. The pc will of course start talking. And if you just nod now and then and keep your auditor's report going unobtrusively so as not to cut the Itsa, you'll have a talking pc and most of the time good TA. At the end of 2½ hours, end the session. Add up the TA you've gotten and you will usually find that it was far more than in previous sessions. TA action, if absent, had to be prevented! It doesn't just fail to occur. But this is not just a stunt. It is a vital and valuable rule in getting TA. Rule: A silent auditor invites itsa. This is not all good, however. In doing R4 work or R3R or R4N the silent auditor lets the pc Itsa all over the whole track and causes Over-Restimulation which locks up the TA. But in lower levels of auditing, inviting an Itsa with silence is an ordinary action. In Scientology Levels I, II and III the auditor is usually silent much longer, propor-tionally, in the session, than he or she is talking – about 100 of silence to 1 of talking. As soon as you get into Level IV auditing however, on the pc's actual GPMs, the auditor has to be crisp and busy to get TA and a silent, idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little TA. This is all under \"controlling the pc's attention\". Each level of auditing controls the pc's atten-tion a little more than the last and the leap from Level III to IV is huge. Level I hardly controls at all. The rule above about the silent auditor is employed to the full. Level II takes the pc's life and livingness goals (or session goals) for the pc to Itsa and lets the pc roll, the auditor intruding only to keep the pc giving solutions, attempts, dones, decisions about his life and livingness or session goals rather than difficulties, problems and natter about them. Level III adds the rapid search (by TA assessment) for the service facsimile (maybe 20 minutes out of 2½ hours) and then guides the preclear into it with R3SC processes. The rule here is that if the thing found that moved the TA wouldn't make others wrong but would make the pc wrong, then it is an oppterm lock and one Prepchecks it. (The two top RIs of the pc's PT GPM is the service facsimile. One is a terminal, the pc's, and the other is an oppterm. They each have thousands of lock RIs. Any pair of lock RIs counts as a service facsimile,"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 4 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 234 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST giving TA.) A good slow Prepcheck but still a Prepcheck. Whether running Right-Wrong-Dominate-Survive, (R3SC) or Prepchecking (the only 2 processes used) one lets the pc really answer before acking. One question may get 50 answers! Which is One Whatsit from the auditor gets 50 Itsas from the pc. Level IV auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc Itsa RIs and lists but the auditor going at it like a small steam engine finding RIs, RIs, RIs, Goals, RIs, RIs, RIs. For the total TA in an R4 session only is proportional to the number of RIs found without goofs, wrong goals or other errors which rob TA action. So the higher the level the more control of the pc's attention. But in the lower levels, as you go back down, the processes used require less and less control, less auditor action to get TA. The Level is designed to give TA at that level of control. And if the auditor actions get busier than called for in the lower levels the TA is cut down per session. ____________________ OVER-RESTIMULATION As will be found in another HCO Bulletin and in the lectures of summer and autumn of 1963, the thing that seizes a TA up is Over-Restimulation. The rule is: The less active the TA the more over-restimulation is present. (Though restimulation can also be absent.) Therefore an auditor auditing a pc whose TA action is low (below 20 TA Divisions down for a 2½ hour session) must be careful not to over-restimulate the pc (or to gently res-timulate the pc). This is true of all levels. At Level IV this becomes: don't find that next goal, bleed the GPM you're working of all possible charge. And at Level III this becomes: don't find too many new Service Facs before you've bled the TA out of what you already have. And at Level II this becomes: don't fool about with a new illness until the pc feels the Lumbosis you started on is handled utterly. And at Level I this becomes: \"Let the pc do the talking\". Over-Restimulation is the auditor's most serious problem. Under-Restimulation is just an auditor not putting the pc's attention on anything. The sources of Restimulation are: 1. Life and Livingness Environment. This is the workaday world of the pc. The auditor handles this with Itsa or \"Since Big Mid Ruds' and even by regulating or changing some of the pc's life by just telling the pc to not do this or that during an intensive or even making the pc change residence for a while if that's a source. This is subdivided into Past and Present. 2. The Session and its Environment. This is handled by Itsa-ing the subject of session environments and other ways. This is subdivided into Past and Present. 3. The Subject Matter of Scientology. This is done by assessing (by TA motion) the old Scientology List One and then Itsa-ing or Prepchecking what's found. 4. The Auditor. This is handled by What would you be willing to tell me, Who would you be willing to talk to. And other such things for the pc to Itsa. This is subdivided into Past and Present."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 5 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 235 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 5. This Lifetime. This is handled by slow assessments and lots of Itsa on what's found whenever it is found to be moving the TA during slow assessment. (You don't null a list or claw through ten hours of listing and nulling to find something to Itsa at Levels I to III. You see what moves the TA and bleed it of Itsa right now.) 6. Pc's Case. In Levels I to III this is only indirectly attacked as above. And in addition to the actions above, you can handle each one of these or what's found with a slow Prepcheck. LIST FOR ASSESSMENT Assess for TA motion the following list:  The surroundings in which you live.  The surroundings you used to live in.  Our surroundings here.  Past surroundings for auditing or treatment.  Things connected with Scientology (Scientology List One).  Myself as your auditor.  Past auditors or practitioners.  Your personal history in this lifetime.  Goals you have set for yourself.  Your case. ____________________ At Level II one gets the pc to simply set Life and Livingness goals and goals for the session, or takes up these on old report forms and gets the decisions, actions, considerations, etc., on them as the Itsa, cleaning each one fairly well of TA. One usually takes the goal the pc seems most interested in (or has gone into apathy about) as it will be found to produce the most TA. ____________________ Whatever you assess by Tone Arm, once you have it, get the TA out of it before you drop it. And don't cut the Itsa. MEASURE OF AUDITORS The skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of TA he or she can get. Pcs are not more difficult one than another. Any pc can be made to produce TA. But some audi-tors cut TA more than others."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 6 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 236 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Also, in passing, an auditor can't falsify TA. It's written all over the pc after a session. Lots of TA = Bright pc. Small TA = Dull pc. And Body Motion doesn't count. Extreme Body Motion on some pcs can produce a division of TA! Some pcs try to squirm their way to clear! A good way to cure a TA con-scious body-moving pc is to say, \"I can't record TA caused while you're moving.\" ____________________ As you may suspect, the pc's case doesn't do a great deal until run on R4 processes. But destimulation of the case can produce some astonishing changes in beingness. Key-out is the principal function of Levels I to III. But charge off a case is charge off. Unless destimu-lated a case can't get a rocket read or present the auditor with a valid goal. Levels I to III pro-duce a Book One clear. Level R4 produces an O.T. But case conditioning (clearing) is neces-sary before R4 can be run. And an auditor who can't handle Levels I to III surely won't be able to handle the one-man band processes at Level IV. So get good on Levels I to III before you even study IV. THE FIRST THING TO LEARN By slow assessment is meant letting the pc Itsa while assessing. This consists of rapid auditor action, very crisp, to get something that moves the TA and then immediate shift into letting the pc Itsa during which be quiet! The slowness is overall action. It takes hours and hours to do an old preclear assessment form this way but the TA flies. The actual auditing in Level III looks like this – auditor going like mad over a list or form with an eye cocked on the TA. The first movement of the TA (not caused by body mo-tion) the auditor goes a tiny bit further if that and then sits back and just looks at the pc. The pc comes out of it, sees the auditor waiting and starts talking. The auditor unobtrusively re-cords the TA, sometimes nods. TA action dies down in a couple minutes or an hour. As soon as the TA looks like it hasn't got much more action in it the auditor sits up, lets the pc finish what he or she was saying and then gets busy busy again. But no action taken by the auditor cuts into the TA action. In Levels I to III no assessment list is continued beyond seeing a TA move until that TA motion is handled. In doing a Scientology List One assessment one goes down the list until the TA moves (not because of body motion). Then, because a TA is not very pinpointed, the auditor covers the one or two above where he first saw TA and, watching the pc for interest and the TA, cir-cles around that area until he is sure he has what made the TA move and then bleeds that for TA. by Itsa or Prepcheck. Yes, you say, but doesn't the auditor do TRs on the pc? One question – one answer ra-tio? NO! Let the pc finish what the pc was saying. And let the pc be satisfied the pc has said it without a lot of chatter about it. TA not moving signals auditor to act."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 7 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 237 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST TA moving signals auditor not to act. Only the auditor can kill the TA motion. So when the TA starts to move, stop acting and start listening. When the TA stops moving or seems about to, stop listening and start act-ing again. Only act when the TA is relatively motionless. And then act just enough to start it again. Now if you can learn just this, as given here, to act when there's no TA and not act when there is TA, you can make your own start on getting good TA on your preclear. With this you buy leisure to look over what's happening. With half a hundred rules and your own confusion to worry about also, you'll never get a beginning. So, to begin to get TA on your pc, first learn the trick of silent invitation. Just start the session and sit there expec-tantly. You'll get some TA. When you've mastered this (and what a fight it is not to act, act, act and talk ten times as hard as the pc) then move to the next step. Cover the primary sources of over-restimulation listed above by asking for solutions to them. Learn to spot TA action when it occurs and note what the pc was saying just then. Co-ordinate these two facts – pc talking about something and TA moving. That's Assessment Levels I to III. Just that. You see the TA move and relate it to what the pc is saying just that moment. Now you know that if the pc talks about \"Bugs\" he gets TA action. Note that down on your report. But don't otherwise call it to pc's attention as pc is already getting TA on an-other subject. This pc also gets TA on Bugs. Store up 5 or ten of these odd bits, without doing anything to the pc but letting him talk about things. Now a few sessions later, the pc will have told all concerning the prime source of over-restimulation I hope you were covering with him or her by only getting the pc started when he or she ran down. But you will now have a list of several other things that get TA. The hottest TA producer on this list will get a pc's goal as it is his Service Fac. You can now get TA on this pc at will. All you have to do is get an Itsa going on one of these things. Any TA is the sole target of Levels I to III. It doesn't matter a continental what gener-ates it. Only Level IV (R4 processes) are vital on what you get TA on (for if you're not accu-rate you will get no TA at Level IV). From Levels I to III the pc's happiness or recovery depends only on that waving TA Arm. How much does it wave? That's how much the case advances. Only at Level IV do you care what it waves on. You're as good an auditor in Levels I to III as you can get TA on the pc and that's all.

You say, \"What's troubling you?\" The child says, \"I'm worried about Mummy and I can't get Daddy to talk to me and.........\" No TA. This child is not saying anything is it. This child is saying, \"Confusion, chaos, worry.\" No TA. The child is speaking in Oppterms. Small child comes in room. You say, \"What's in this room?\" Child says, \"You and couch and rug.......\" That's Itsa. That's TA. Only in R4 where you're dead on the pc's GPMs and the pc is allowed to say it is or is-n't can you get TA good action out of listing and nulling. And even then a failure to let the pc say it is it can cut the TA down enormously. Auditor says, \"You've been getting TA movement whenever you mention houses. In this lifetime what solutions have you had about houses?\" And there's the next two sessions all laid out with plenty of TA and nothing to do but record it and nod now and then. THE THEORY OF TONE ARM ACTION TA motion is caused by the energy contained in confusions blowing off the case. The confusion is held in place by aberrated stable data. The aberrated (non-factual) stable datum is there to hold back a confusion but in actual fact the confusion gathered there only because of an aberrated consideration or postulate in the first place. So when you get the pc to as-is these aberrated stable data, the confusion blows off and you get TA. So long as the aberrated stable datum is in place the confusion (and its energy) won't flow. Ask for confusions (worries, problems, difficulties) and you just over-restimulate the pc because his attention is on the mass of energy, not the aberrated stable datum holding it in place. Ask for the aberrated stable datum (considerations, postulates, even attempts or ac-tions or any button) and the pc as-ises it, the confusion starts flowing off as energy (not as confusion), and you get TA. Just restimulate old confusions without touching the actual stable data holding them back and the pc gets the mass but no release of it and so no TA. The pc has to say, \"It's a \" (some consideration or postulate) to release the pent-up en-ergy held back by it. Thus an auditor's worst fault that prevents TA is permitting the dwelling on confusions without getting the pc to give up with certainty the considerations and postulates that hold the confusions in place."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION 9 HCOB 1.10.63 LEVEL 0 239 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST And that's \"Itsa\".

If the pc can't seem to be audited in that environment, get old environments Itsa'ed. If the pc has lots of PTPs at session start, get the pc's solutions to similar problems in the past.

C/S Series 1 AUDITOR'S RIGHTS AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/SES An auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/S) of what to audit on a pc is not discharged of his responsibility as an auditor. The auditor has a series of responsibilities that are part of every C/S he gets to audit. ACCEPTING THE PC No auditor is required to accept a specific pc just because the pc is assigned to him. If an auditor does not believe he can help that particular pc or if he dislikes auditing that particular pc the auditor has a right to refuse to audit that pc. The auditor must state why. The Case Supervisor, Director of Processing or Director of Review, nor any of their seniors, may not discipline the auditor for refusing to audit a particular pc. An auditor who refuses to audit his quota of hours or sessions is of course subject to action."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 2 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 LEVEL 0 242 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Thus refusing to audit a particular pc, so long as one is not refusing to audit other pcs, is not actionable. \"I do not wish to audit this pc because ______. I am willing to audit other pcs,\" is the legal auditor statement in the matter. Some pcs get a bad name with some auditors, some don't appreciate the auditing, some conflict with a particular auditor's own personality. There are such instances. It does not mean certain pcs cannot be helped by others. It is also true that an auditor who dislikes a pc may not do a good job so the rule also has a practical side to it. One auditor disliked young men and did a bad job on them. Another disliked old la-dies and chopped them up in session. One pc had messed up several Scientologists and could-n't find anyone to audit him at all. We are not auditing people to make amends to the world. Thus an auditor has a right to reject or accept the pcs he is given. ACCEPTING A C/S When the auditor gets a C/S to do on a case and if he thinks it is not the correct thing to do he has the right to reject the C/S for that pc and require another one he can agree to. The auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the ses-sion except as noted below. The auditor may not C/S in the auditing chair while auditing the pc. If he has no Case Supervisor at all the auditor still audits from a C/S. He writes the C/S before session and ad-heres to it in session. To do something else and not follow the C/S is called \"C/Sing in the chair\" and is very poor form as it leads to Q and A. STALE DATED C/S A C/S that is a week or two old or a Repair (Progress) Pgm that is a month or two old is dynamite. This is called a \"Stale Dated Pgm\" or a \"Stale Dated C/S\" meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss. It is dangerous to accept a Repair (Progress) Pgm if it is old. The auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justified in demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 3 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 LEVEL 0 243 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST A program written in January may be completely out of date in June. Who knows what may have happened in between. Use fresh C/Ses and fresh Pgms. Stale Dates only occur in poorly run backlogged Divisions anyway. The real remedy is reorganize and hire more and better auditors. ENDING THE SESSION When the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/S. Ending the session is totally up to the auditor. If the auditor just doesn't complete an action that was producing TA and could be completed it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic engram the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and simi-lar actions would be an auditor error. The judgement here is whether or not the auditor's action is justified in ending the ses-sion. Even though he may have made an error, the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc on something else whose ruds are out is a Major Auditing Error. Even if the C/S omits \"Fly a rud\" or \"Fly ruds\" this does not justify the auditor auditing the pc over out ruds. The auditor can do one of two things: He can Fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. The Dianetic Auditor is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in an HGC must be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for a new C/S. Better still he should learn to Fly ruds. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS If an auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is justified in start-ing a Green Form. The auditor solution to no F/N on ruds is to do a GF whether the C/S said to or not. This is an expected action.

Otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds. This can develop mental mass. Optimum session scheduling is a series of sessions or a whole program done in a block of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc's ruds out be-tween sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life's annoyances and keeps the pc there. UNREADING ITEMS When an item the auditor has been told to run doesn't read on the meter, even when the auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the auditor must not do anything with the item no matter what the C/S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn't read he will be expected not to run it. LISTS When an auditor whose C/S told him to list \"Who or what ______\" or any list question finds that the list question does not read, the auditor must not list it. When doing a list ordered by the C/S it is assumed that the auditor will test it for read before listing and that he will not list an unreading question. (A read is an actual fall, not a tick or a stop.) LIST TROUBLE When an auditor has trouble doing a list and getting an item it is expected he will use a Prepared List like L4B to locate the trouble and handle it. As it is very hard on a pc to mess up a list it is expected the auditor will handle the situation then and there with no further C/S directions. HIGH TA When the auditor sees the TA is high at session start yet the C/S says to \"Fly a rud\" or run a chain, the auditor must not try to fly a rud and he must not start on a chain."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 5 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 LEVEL 0 245 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Trying to bring a TA down with ARC Brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren't the reason TAs go up. Seeing a high TA at start the Dianetic auditor or SCN auditor up to Class II does not start the session but sends the folder back to the C/S and for a higher class auditor to do. Seeing a high TA at start the Scientology auditor (Class III or above) (a) checks for exteriorization in a recent session and if so the session is ended and the C/S is asked for an \"Interiorization Rundown\"; (b) if the pc has had an Interiorization Rundown the auditor asks the C/S for permission to do a \"C/S Series 53\" or a Hi-Lo TA assessment or whatever the C/S indicates. The Int RD may have been (usually is) overrun and needs rehab or correction and it is usual to check it – it is included in a \"C/S 53\" and a Hi-Lo TA. These actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the C/S. GOING ON HOPING When a case is running badly session to session the last thing you do is go on hop-ing, either in auditing or C/Sing. \"Let's try _____\", \"Then this\", \"Then this\", is not going to solve the case.

You can have the D of P interview and get answers. You can even ask his mother. You look for case errors. You study the folder back to where the pc ran well and then come forward and you'll find the error every time. Do not just go on session after failed session hoping. That's pure idiocy. You get data! from prepared lists, from life, from the pc, from the folder. Find the bug! Ah, good Lord, he is a Pinkerton Agent sworn to secrecy! He does yoga exercises af-ter every session.

The auditor has no business trying to do the C/S given when it collides with and isn't designed to handle any of the above. If the previous session disclosed such an error and this session C/S was designed to handle and doesn't, the auditor should end off and the next C/S should be \"2-way comm for data\". CASE NOT HANDLED When the auditor or the Examiner collides with a pc who is asserting his case has not been handled, there should not be a new set of actions based on little data but the auditor should end off and the C/S should order a \"way comm on what hasn't been handled\". The auditor should not at once take this up as part of any other C/S. In other words an auditor doesn't change the C/S to a 2-way comm on something not called for by C/S. MAJOR ACTIONS An auditor should never begin a major action on a case that is not \"set up\" for it."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 8 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 LEVEL 0 248 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST As this can occur during a session it is vital to understand the rule and follow it. Oth-erwise a case can be bogged right down and will be hard to salvage as now a new action to repair has been added to an unrepaired action. Now, if the auditor starts a major action on a case not \"set up\" we get two things to repair where we only had one as the major action won't work either. Repair = patching up past auditing or recent life errors. This is done by prepared lists or completing the chain or correcting lists or even 2-way comm or prepchecks on auditors, sessions, etc. Rudiments = setting the case up for the session action. This includes ARC Brks, PTPs, W/Hs, GF or O/R listing or any prepared list (such as L1C, etc.). Set up = getting an F/N showing and VGIs before starting any major action. It means just that – an F/N and VGIs before starting any major action. Such may require a repair action and rudiments as well. Major Action = any – but any – action designed to change a case or general considera-tions or handle continual illness or improve ability. This means a Process or even a series of processes like 3 flows. It doesn't mean a grade. It is any process the case hasn't had. Grade = a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. Program = any series of actions designed by a C/S to bring about definite results in a pc. A program usually includes several sessions. The vast bulk of auditing errors come about because C/Ses and auditors seek to use a Major Action to repair a case. It is a responsibility of an auditor to reject a C/S which seeks to use one or more major actions to repair a case that isn't running well. The auditor must understand this completely. He can be made to accept a wrong C/S for the pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error and mess up the case. Example: Pc has not been running well (no real TA or had a grumpy Exam report). Auditor sees C/S has ordered a major action, not a repair by prepared lists, ruds, etc. The auditor must reject the C/S as he will be made to fail in session by it. Example: Auditor gets a C/S, \"(1) Fly a rud; (2) Assess LX3; (3) Run 3-way recall, 3-way secondaries, 3-way engrams on all / / X items\". The auditor can't get a rud to fly. Does the LX3. In other words he flunks by failing to set up the case. It could also go this way. Auditor can't get a rud to fly, does a GF, gets no F/N. He must not begin a major action but must end off right there. It is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if the case is not F/N VGIs. The pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not F/N VGIs must be set up by repair actions!

The pc will sooner or later begin to fly. Now at session start you put in a rud, get F/N VGIs and can start major actions. So the auditor has a responsibility not to be led up a garden path by a C/S which or-ders a major action on a pc who isn't repaired or by not being able in session to get an F/N VGIs by repair. The only exceptions are a touch assist or life ruds or the Dianetic assist all on a tempo-rarily sick pc. But that's repair isn't it? PROGRAM VIOLATIONS When an auditor receives a C/S and sees that it violates the pc's program he should re-ject it. The pc, let us say, is supposed to finish his Dianetic Triples but is suddenly being given a Group Engram Intensive. That violates the program and also the grade. If the pc is running badly, a repair should be ordered. If not, the program should be completed. Example: An effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack. This is a program con-taining several major actions which probably consists of several sessions. Before this program is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack, the C/S orders \"(1) Fly a rud, (2) 3 S & Ds\". The auditor should recognize in 3 S & Ds a major action being run into the middle of a program and reject it. The correct action is of course the next backtrack process. GRADE VIOLATIONS A pc who is on a grade and hasn't attained it yet must not be given major actions not part of that grade. Example: Pc is on Grade I. C/S orders a list having to do with drinking. It is not a process on that grade. It could be done after Grade I is attained and before Grade II is begun. The C/S is incorrect and should not be accepted. ABILITY ATTAINED Now and then before the full major action is complete or before all the grade processes are run, the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of the action. This is particularly true of valence shifters or Interiorization Rundowns and can hap-pen in grades. The auditor should recognize it and, with the F/N VGIs always present at such mo-ments, end off."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 10 C/S-SERIES 1 – HCOB 23.8.71 LEVEL 0 250 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I know of one case who had a huge cog about Interiorization on Flow 1 Engrams and was pushed by both C/S and auditor to do Flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badly that it took a long while – weeks – to straighten the case out. The ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on. On the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse. \"I think he cogged to him-self so we ended off.\" It must be a real \"What do you know!\" sort of out-loud cog with a big F/N and VVGIs and directly on the subject to end off a major action or a program or a grade before its actions are all audited. REVIEWING REVIEWS An auditor who gets a C/S or an order to repair a case that is running well should re-ject doing the action. I have seen a case ordered to repair who had Ext Full Perception Doing Great. The re-pair bogged the case. The case then got running well again but a second C/S ordered a new repair which of course bogged it. Then major actions were done. The case was again repaired and rehabbed and became OK. Three times the auditor should have said no. FALSE REPORTS The vilest trick that can be played on a pc is for an auditor to falsify an auditing report. It may be thought to be \"good Public Relations\" (good PR) for the auditor with the C/S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. Integrity is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc. OVERTS ON PCS When an auditor finds himself being nattery or critical of his pcs he should get his withholds on pcs pulled and overts on them off. An auditor who goes sad is auditing pcs over his own ARC Break. An auditor worried about his pc is working over a Problem.

Then get yourself handled. \"WHAT HE DID WRONG\" An auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCO B have been violated. But an auditor's TRs can go out or his listing and nulling is in error. After a session that went wrong somebody else (not the auditor) should ask the pc what the auditor did. This sometimes spots a false auditing report. But it also sometimes is a false report by the pc. In any event, the auditor has a right to know. Then he can either correct his auditing or his know-how or he can advise the C/S the pc's report is untrue and better repair can be done on the pc. Savage action against an auditor is almost never called for. He was trying to help. Some people are hard to help. Not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCO B, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCO B or tape. Don't be party to a \"hidden data line\" that doesn't exist. \"You ruined the pc!\" is not a valid statement. \"You violated HCO B page ____\" is the charge. No auditor may be disciplined for asking, \"May I please have the tape or HCO B that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming. \" If it isn't on a tape, a book or an HCOB it is not true and no auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. \"If it isn't written it isn't true\" is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. ____________________ These are the rights of the auditor with relation to a C/S.

This is because they have not understood what it is. Nearly all their auditing failures stem not from using wrong processes but from Q and A. Accordingly I have looked the matter over and re-defined Q and A. The origin of the term comes from \"changing when the pc changes\". The basic answer to a question is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formula completely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A later definition was \"Questioning the pc's Answer\". Another effort to overcome it and explain Q & A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home. The new definition is this: Q and A is a failure to complete a Cycle of Action on a preclear. A cycle of action is redefined as Start – Continue – Complete. Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking a question the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging that answer. A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Arm action into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it. A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action and completing it. Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle before it is complete is \"Q and A-ing\". This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing any part of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask the different idea, thus abandoning the original question. An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pc cog-nition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing. A programme such as \"Prepcheck this pc's family\" is begun, and for any reason left incomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A.

In Scientologese it is often used to mean \"undecisive\", not making up one's mind. Q stands for \"Question\". A stands for \"Answer\". In \"perfect duplication\" the answer to a Question would be the Question. The real definition as it applies to TRs is \"The Question proceeding from the last An-swer.\" Example: Question: How are you? Answer: I'm fine. Question: How fine? Answer: My stomach hurts. Question: When did your stomach begin hurting? Answer: About four. Question: Where were you at four? etc. etc. The above example is a grievous auditing fault.

When a Tone Arm has to be moved rapidly down, the needle appears to float to some but it is just falling. To see if a needle is floating the TA must have stopped moving down. A Blowdown is a period of relief and cognition to a pc while it is occurring and for a moment after it stops. Therefore it is a serious goof for an auditor to speak or move during the blowdown or for a moment afterwards. This was noted years ago and is given in early materials on goals. An auditor must not speak or move during a blowdown. When the auditor has to move the TA from right to left to keep the needle on the dial and the movement is .1 divisions or more then a blowdown is occurring. The needle of course is falling to the right. That is a period of charge blowing off the bank. It is accompanied by realizations for the pc. Sometimes the pc does not voice them aloud. They nevertheless happen. If the auditor speaks or moves beyond adjusting the TA quietly with his thumb the pc may suppress the cognitions and stop the blowdown. To see if a needle floats the TA must be halted for the moment between 2 and 3 on a calibrated meter. A floating needle cannot be observed during a blowdown. For an auditor to sit up suddenly and look surprised or pleased, or for an auditor to say the next command or \"That's It\" during a blowdown, can jolly well wreck a pc's case. So it's a real goof to do so. To get auditing results one must audit with a good comm cycle, accept the pc's an-swers, handle the pc's originations, be unobtrusive with his auditing actions, not hold the pc up while he writes, not develop tricks like waiting for the pc to look at him before giving the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"AUDITING GOOFS BLOWDOWN 2 HCOB 3.08.65 INTERRUPTION LEVEL 0 258 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST next command, not prematurely ack and so start compulsive Itsa, and be very quiet during and just after a blowdown.

I have seen auditors let a pc talk and talk and talk and talk and run down and talk and run down and talk again until one wondered where if anywhere that auditor had been trained. In the first place such an auditor could not know the meaning of the word ITSA. The word means \"It is a ........\" Now how an auditor letting a pc talk believes he is getting a pc to spot what it is is quite beyond me. This pc has been talking all his life. He isn't well. Analysts had people talk for five years and they seldom got well. So how is it supposed to happen today that a pc, let talk enough, will get well. It won't. The auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills. That's all. These are the TRs. An auditor who can't do his TRs can't audit. Period. Instead he says he is \"letting the pc Itsa\". If by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches, then this isn't auditing. In auditing an auditor guides. He gives the pc something to answer. When the pc an-swers the pc has said \"IT IS A .. \" and that's Itsa. If the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into an anxiety – he has been chopped. So he talks more than he wanted."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"“LETTING THE PC ITSA” 2 HCOB 5.2.66 II THE PROPERLY TRAINED AUDITOR LEVEL 0 260 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge, then the pc talks on and on, hoping for an acknowledgement that doesn't come, \"runs dry\", tries again, etc. So premature or late-or-never acks result in the same thing – the pc running on and on and on. And they call it \"letting the pc Itsa\". Bah! If a pc talks too much in session he either is getting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasn't got an auditor at all. It isn't \"Itsa\". It's lousy TRs. (The one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to get better with proper TRs used on him.) The proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes: 1. The auditor asks the questions. 2. The pc says what is the answer, \"It's a ........\" 3. The auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pc's satisfaction and 4. The auditor acks when the pc has finished saying \"It's a .......\" And that's Itsa. Scientology auditing is a precision skill, not a gag blop goo slup guck blah. 1. The auditor wants to know ........ 2. The pc says it is ........ 1. 2. 1. 2. 1. 2. etc. TECH SAVVY Now an auditor who doesn't know his technology about the mind and his processes of course never knows what to ask. So he or she simply sits like a lump of sacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better. A sure sign that an auditor doesn't know an engram from a cow about processes is see-ing a pc \"Itsa\" on and on and on. In Scientology we do know what the mind is, what a being is, what goes wrong in the mind and how to correct it. We aren't psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or Harley Street witch doctors. We do know. The data about beings and life is there in Scientology to be learned. It isn't \"our idea\" of how things are, or \"our opinion of\" .... Scientology is a precision subject. It has axioms. Like geometry. Two equilateral tri-angles aren't similar because Euclid said so. They're similar because they are. If you don't believe it, look at them. There isn't a single datum in Scientology that can't be proven as precisely as teacups are teacups and not saucepans."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"“LETTING THE PC ITSA” 3 HCOB 5.2.66 II THE PROPERLY TRAINED AUDITOR LEVEL 0 261 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Now if we get a person fresh out of the study of \"the mystical metaphysics of Cuff-bah\" he's going to have trouble. His pcs are going to \"Itsa\" their heads off and never get well or better or anything. Because that person doesn't know Scientology but thinks it's all impre-cise opinion. The news about Scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exact sciences. If one doesn't know that, one's pcs \"Itsa\" by the hour for one doesn't know what he is handling that he is calling \"a pc\". By my definition, an auditor is a real auditor when his or her pcs don't overtalk or un-dertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate. So how to tell an auditor, how to determine if you have trained one at last, is do his pcs answer up or do they talk on and on. If I had an auditor in an HGC whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yapped while the auditor just sat there like a Chinese pilot frozen on the controls, I would do the fol-lowing to that \"auditor\": 1. Remedy A, Book of Case Remedies. 2. Remedy B, Book of Case Remedies. 3. Disagreements with Scientology, technology and orgs and Scientology personalities all found and traced to basic and blown. 4. A grind study assignment of the Scientology Axioms until the \"auditor\" could do them in clay. 5. A memorization of the Logics, Qs (Prelogics) and Axioms of Dianetics and Scientol-ogy. 6. TRs 0 to 4 until they ran out of his or her ears. 7. TRs 5 to 9. 8. Op Pro by Dup until flat. 9. A hard long study of the Meter. 10. The ARC triangle and other scales. 11. The Processes of Level 0. 12. Some wins. And I'd have an auditor. I'd have one that could make a Grade Zero Release every time. And it's lack of the above that causes an \"auditor\" to say \"I let the pc Itsa\" with the pc talking on and on and on. Scientology is the breakthrough that made the indefinite subject of Philosophy into a precision tool.

Two gross goofs I have noticed since case supervising folders on the RSM is that Auditors have not been turning in Ethics cases to the MAA. In one instance, a Pc was audited by 2 auditors in 2 different sessions, got a R/S on crimes against Scientologists and M/W/Hs and neither auditor turned the Pc in to Ethics. This is not the only instance. The second thing is that Auditors are very evaluative of the Pc's case as indicated by their comments on the Summary Report. This is incorrect; this report is used simply as an exact record of what hap-pened during the session. It is not up to the auditor to evaluate the Pc's Case, this is the Case Supervisor's job. The auditor may suggest what is to be run, at which time the Case Supervi-sor will review the session, what was run, how the Pc went in relation to what was being run and then give his directions. ____________________"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF HOW TO WRITE AN AUDITOR’S REPORT, 3    HCOB    7.5.69    WORKSHEETS AND SUMMARY REPORT, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LEVEL 0 265 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Auditor Report Forms or W/sheets are never recopied.

For example, the repetitive process: Recall a change Recall a no-change Recall a failed change is run as a bracket (the pc is given the first command, then the second and then the third and then the first and then the second, etc.).

E-METER ESSENTIALS The following essential points concerning the Electrometer must be known to an audi-tor. 2. There is no known way to clear anyone without using a meter. 3. There is no guarantee that a scrap or non-standard meter will behave properly. 4. The only way known to learn to use an E-Meter is use one, handle one, practice with one. Skill in meter use depends upon familiarizing oneself with the actual meter. 5. Get familiar with the meter by holding it, watching it, turning it on and off. Touch it. Reach and withdraw from it. Play catch with it. Don't just read books about it. 6. Put various persons on the meter. Check them out on Security Checks, rudiments checks, and release checks. Check out dates of incidents. 7. Do Dynamic Assessments. Do goals assessments. 8. The person who says the meter is not a precision instrument is either unfamiliar with one or has something to hide. The auditor's questions can be off. The meter never is."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 4 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 286 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST B. THEORY 1. The meter tells you what the preclear's mind is doing when the preclear is made to think of something. 2. The meter registers before the preclear becomes conscious of the datum. It is therefore a pre-conscious meter. The meter passes a tiny current through the preclear's body. 3. This current is influenced by the mental masses, pictures, circuits and machinery. When the unclear PC thinks of something, these mental items shift and this registers on the meter. 4. Some preclears are in denser masses than others. Therefore the Tone Arm reads very low (most dense), very high, or normal. 5. A low-toned preclear may not be able to influence his mind or body at all and reads the same as a dead body around two or three without action. A low-toned person may read at two or three on the Tone Arm with a sticky needle. 6. A middle-toned preclear reads actively on the meter both Tone Arm and Needle, with low sensitivity setting. 7. A very high-toned person (clear) reads at two or three on the Tone Arm with a free needle. 8. The key difference between a low-toned preclear and a high-toned one is seen in nee-dle response, the low toned having a sluggish needle or a sticky one, the high-toned person having a free needle. 9. The low-toned person cannot answer questions about help intelligently. 10. Thus we see that the E-Meter basically registers the body at two (female) or three (male) on the Tone Arm. If a thetan is 'dead' he doesn't add to or subtract from the reading. If a thetan is 'partially alive' he adds or subtracts from the reading. If a thetan is 'fully alive' he is not necessarily inside the body he controls and so does not add to or subtract from the reading. "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 5 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 287 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST C. PRACTICE The Tone Arm 1. The three general states have many way stops. There is always a lower-toned mockery of higher tones. A low-tone case, to the relatively unskilled, can be at clear read, unre-active on a sticky sort of needle. He cannot however do things in Life. He or she can-not answer questions intelligently about Help or Control. 2. The first advance of a very low-toned case may be to drop into the minus two area on the Tone Arm Dial. 3. Because of the construction of an E-Meter, the Tone Arm cannot pass through the bot-tom of the dial. As a low-toned case gains responsibility, the Tone Arm goes from three or two to 1.5 to 1 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 (for a male) and then to 2 (for a female). This occurs over a long term of processing, of course, and takes many, many hours of proc-essing and the Tone Arm ebbs and flows back and forth. 4. Very few cases are in a 'dead' state. Most cases will be found on the Tone Arm around 4 or five. 5. The Tone Arm registers Density of Mass (ridges, pictures, machines, circuits) in the mind of the preclear. This is actual mass, not imaginary, and can be weighed, meas-ured by resistance, etc. 6. Therefore the Tone Arm registers State of Case at any given time in processing. 7. The Tone Arm also registers advance of case during processing by moving. An un-moving case has an unmoving Tone Arm. A moving case has a moving Tone Arm. 8. If a case is not moving, no matter what the preclear says, the Tone Arm is not moving. 9. If a case is moving, no matter what the preclear says, the Tone Arm is moving during processing. 10. If the Tone Arm shows motion, continue the process, until the EP of that process is reached. 11. If the Tone Arm shows no motion, you can change the process. 12. To change a process while the Tone Arm shows good motion will leave the pc with By-Passed Charge. The process should be continued to the EP of that process. 13. When a level of the Pre-Havingness Scale is flat for terminal, the Tone Arm is show-ing very little motion. One must reassess for a new level for the same terminal on the Scale, whereupon the Tone Arm will again show motion. 14. When all levels that needle-register on the Pre-Havingness Scale are flat, the Tone Arm will no longer show motion, but neither will it stick in a frozen way."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 6 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 288 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 15. It is a nice judgment when to leave a process. The judgment is done by the Tone Arm action. 16. When the Tone Arm slows down and isn't moving more than a quarter of an inch up or down, it is time to reassess. To go longer would stick the Tone Arm and make needle action too stuck for a reassessment to be possible. You will always find any unflat level in future reassessments on the Pre-Havingness Scale so it is not dangerous to so leave one. It is dangerous to leave a level of the Pre-Havingness Scale when the Tone Arm shows motions of one inch up or down the Tone Arm Dial, as the preclear will get confused. 17. Take hold of the Tone Arm of your E-Meter. Set it at 4.5 on its dial. Move it to 3. Move it to 5. Now pretend a period of twenty minutes. Move the Tone Arm from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 4.5, then from 4.5 to 3.5, then from 3.5 to 4.8, then from 4.8 to 4. If all that happened in twenty minutes of processing, that is terrific Tone Arm motion. The case would be changing very, very well. You would not change a process. You would go on running the same process. 18. Take the Tone Arm in hand again. Set it at 3.5. Pretend a period of twenty minutes. Move it from 3.5 to 3.3. Move it from 3.3 to 3.6. Move it from 3.6 to 3.4. If that's all that happened in twenty minutes of processing, be alert, for you'd better reassess for a new level for the termination the Pre-Havingness Scale. The Tone Arm may be getting ready to stick. 19. But don't be surprised if the Tone Arm motion suddenly picks up again. If it does, carry on with the same process. 20. The above give you two extremes of Tone Arm motion. The first example is excellent motion. The second example is poor motion. Between these two examples you have a variety of types of motion. 21. In using the meter you are trying to (a) assess for a process that will produce Tone Arm motion and (b) run the motion out of the Tone Arm. 22. When the Tone Arm does not move under processing one of two things is true: (a) you didn't get the right process to run, or (b) you have run it flat. The remedy for (a) is to do better assessment and run another process. The remedy for (b) is to do another as-sessment. 23. That the Tone Arm moves under processing denotes a change in the preclear's mind. That the Tone Arm doesn't move under processing denotes no change of mass, pic-tures, machinery or circuits in the preclear. 24. When a preclear is clear he may occasionally get some Tone Arm motion due to purely body electronics but in the main reads at male or female on the arm (3 or 2) ac-cording to his or her sex. 25. As a preclear nears clear, an assessment plus a few commands will 'blow' the con-nected masses and thus flatten the terminal chosen. As a preclear gets even nearer, as-sessment alone blows the remaining masses. Therefore, when the state is approached,"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 7 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 289 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST the Tone Arm motion gets less and less, no matter what you do. But the condition is self-evident when observed, the preclear gaining more and more effect on his bank with less and less time necessary to remedy a condition. "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 8 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 290 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST D. MECHANICS 1. The Tone Arm stops moving and sticks because the assessment and process have dragged in a picture, chain, or mass upon the preclear that the command as-ises only part of. When the process is no longer as-ising the picture or mass, yet is still restimu-lating it, the Tone Arm registers that the picture, chain or mass is there but not chang-ing. Another process from the Pre-Havingness Scale for the same terminal is now needed to as-is another portion of the picture, chain or mass. Thus the Tone Arm starts moving again. 2. When you overrun a process level of the Pre-Havingness Scale, particularly early in processing, you can pull this picture, chain or mass in so strongly (running a stuck Tone Arm) that reassessment becomes very difficult as nothing moves the meter. 3. Stop running a level while you can still read the meter. 4. If you do overrun too far, still try to read the meter for a new level of assessment. If you can't, run the change process to get back action and then reassess the same termi-nal. You will now be able to read the meter. To have to do this, however, is pretty dull. 5. Processes move in or activate pictures, chains, masses, machinery, circuits, and nullify them, thus clearing people. Life is doing this to them all the time without running them out. 6. The mechanics of the mind in clearing are only those mentioned in this section. To try it without a meter, or without knowing a meter well, is of course beyond the observa-tional ability of Homo Sapiens. 7. Only a meter registers these mechanics. Only processes blow these barriers to living. "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 9 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 291 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST E. THE SENSITIVITY KNOB 1. The sensitivity knob increases the swing of the needle. 2. To run with too high a sensitivity makes the auditor's work unreliable. 3. To run with too low a sensitivity makes the needle unable. 4. The sensitivity knob is adjusted at the start of the rudiments, any assessment, or any process or when the auditor wants to know. 5. The exact setting of the sensitivity knob is done as follows: Have the preclear hold the electrodes (cans) in his hands with the cans in contact with the cups of his palms and all his fingers and both thumbs in a comfortable grip. Set the sensitivity at 5 and adjust the position of the needle to set. Have the preclear squeeze the cans with an even gradual pressure, not a sudden hard squeeze. Watch the distance the needle drops. If the distance the needle fell is less than one-third of a dial drop, raise the sensitivity some and get another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you've got the sensi-tivity setting that gives you one third dial drop on the can squeeze. If the can squeeze gave you more than one-third dial drop at Sens. 5, lower the sensitivity setting a bit, test another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you get one-third of a dial drop. In other words, keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than one-third of a dial drop, until you get the correct sensitiv-ity setting. 6. On older meters, as the preclear gets to release, you can't get just one-third of a dial - you get more even with the knob on the lowest sensitivity. Set it as low as you can and use it anyway. 7. In short, adjust the sensitivity knob to get a third of a dial drop on the can squeeze, or as close to that as you can. 8. If at any time the needle doesn't react and you want a comparative reaction between two or more questions, increase the knob, read the question responses, and then set it back again for running. 9. If you change the sensitivity knob during an assessment, you have to do the whole assessment again on the new setting as the amount of needle fall will be changed. 10. In running rudiments, when suspicious, set the sensitivity knob higher. 11. In looking for suspected withholds in particular, read with a high knob. 12. By holding a constant sensitivity knob during an assessment or during a process, you find out how the preclear is reacting on the needle relative to the start of the assess-ment or process. "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 10 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 292 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST F. THE NEEDLE 1. A needle is monitored by the sensitivity knob, the Tone Arm and the momentary or changing reactions of the preclear. 2. There are ten main needle actions: (1) Stuck (2) No reaction (nul) (3) Fall (4) Change of characteristic (5) Rise (6) Theta bop (7) Rock slam (8) Free needle (9) Body reactions (10) Stage Four 3. In a totally stuck needle (1) the preclear would not even register being pinched. It looks stiff. In a nul needle (2) the question does not change the needle behaviour. In the presence of an ARC break with the auditor, the needle is liable not to register any reaction at all, and to look like a nul needle; therefore, before writing off any as-sessment item, prep-check, or security check question as nul, be sure to check for - and repair - any ARC break. 4. A falling needle (3) makes a dip to the right as you face the meter. A fall may consist of half a division (about one-eighth of an inch) or may consist of fifteen dials (the whole meter face dropped fifteen times). It is still a fall. A fall always happens at the exact end of the question asked. It is also called a drop, a dip and a register. It denotes that a disagreement with life on which the preclear has greater or lesser reality has met the question asked. 5. A fall is the most used and observed needle action. It means to the auditor, 'I've found it', or 'I've gotten a response in the bank'. It is the click of the light switch illuminating where we are going. 6. Falls are measured relative to falls. That's why we leave the sensitivity alone when we are looking for something question by question. 7. Given two falls, the longer fall is the right one. For instance, a question about 'Joe' gets three-eighths of an inch of fall. A question about 'Mabel' right after gets five-eighths of an inch of fall. The right answer is Mabel."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 11 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 293 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 8. Any fall denotes there is something there. Any fall at any sensitivity level on rudiments questions denotes the presence of a bad reaction to the room, an ARC break, a with-hold, or a present time problem and must be cleared no matter what the preclear says. 9. A fall follows at once at the end of the last word of the question asked. 10. A fall is the diagnostic meter action. Set for falls a still needle as given under Sensitiv-ity above. 11. In starting out the first thing you want to know is, 'Is the preclear reading on this me-ter?' You get the preclear to squeeze the cans. You get a fall as he does. Oh. He or she is reading on the meter. The meter is not broken or turned off or disconnected. It is the fall that tells us. 12. The next thing we want to know is rudiments. It is the fall that tells us what we must handle. 13. The next thing is the assessment. It is degree of fall that tells us what is right, for we always take the greatest fall we can obtain, the sensitivity being kept constant. 14. The next thing is the running. We ignore the fall now and watch the Tone Arm instead. The needle, of course, has to move if the Tone Arm is going to move, but, until we want more rudiments type answers or until we want a new assessment, we ignore the needle and watch only the Tone Arm. 15. Change of characteristic (4). Sometimes, as in old Dynamic Assessment, we cannot get clean falls on what we are looking for. Another guide is 'change of characteristic' of the needle. 16. The needle is doing a pattern of small rises and falls. We ask a question, it stops mov-ing. We ask another question, it resumes idly rising and falling as before. That stop is a change of characteristic. Or the needle is stopped while we ask a long series of ques-tions but suddenly does a small dance. That is a change of characteristic. 17. Change of characteristic occurs when we hit on something in the preclear's bank. It occurs only when and each time that we ask that exact question. As the question or item alone changes the needle pattern, it can be further explored with the suppress and invalidate buttons to see if it develops into a SF, F, LF or BD, which then can be used.6 18. A question that stops a rising needle is a change of characteristic question and like a fall means we have struck something. Further exploration may develop it into a fall. 19. By using 'change of characteristic' we can sometimes get our foot in the door and get into a channel that brings about falls. 20. A whole assessment can be done by change of characteristic as well as by falls but it is not usual and, in fact, will develop falls anyway if you are on to something hot.   6 Editor's note: In the original version before Revision by HCO PL 21 Feb 79, this sentence read: \"As the question or item alone changes the needle pattern, we must assume that that is it and we use it.\""},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 12 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 294 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 21. It is not much used but must be known as it may have to be used sooner or later when we can't get falls. The only needle reactions in which you should be interested are those which occur in-stantly, i.e. an instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the precise end of any major thought voiced by the auditor. 22. Rises (5). A rising needle means 'no confront'. 23. Of course a needle must rise at times or the Tone Arm would never move. But it still means that the preclear has struck an area or something he isn't confronting. One never calls his attention to this. But one knows what it is. 24. The only use a rising needle has at this time is to stop going up the Pre-Havingness ladder with a terminal assessment when the needle begins a marked rise. You have ex-ceeded the preclear's reality and he isn't confronting, so you'd better turn around and go down the ladder again before you get things too unreal for him by asking if the terminal can do things the preclear can't imagine it could do. 25. The right circuit, valence, machinery, called off, will stop a rising needle. This was once used but is not necessarily employed at this time. 26. The rising needle is, therefore, not much employed, but one should recognize one. It is a steady, constant movement of the needle, rather slow, from right to left. 27. A needle returning to position after a fall is not a rising needle. 28. A Theta Bop (6) is a small or wide steady dance of the needle. Over a spread of one-eighth of an inch, say (depending on sensitivity setting - it can be half an inch), the needle goes up and down perhaps five or ten times a second. It goes up, sticks, falls, sticks, goes up, sticks, etc., always the same distance, like a slow tuning fork. It is a constant distance and a constant speed. 29. A theta bop means 'death', 'leaving', 'don't want to be here'. It is caused by a yo-yo of the preclear as a thetan vibrating out and into the body or a position in the body. It's as if the needle is jumping between two peaks across a narrow valley. 30. Mention death to anyone (or make them think about it) while they're on a meter and you'll see a theta bop. 31. Its use is to detect whether a preclear is being left stuck in death, or to locate death or departures. 32. If a preclear wants badly to get out of session he or she may start theta bopping with-out being stuck in a death. But few theta bops mean the preclear wants to leave ses-sion. It's most often turned on for 'desire to leave session' during as security check. 33. If you get a 'bop' turned on during an assessment (or a security check) it takes it quite a while, sometimes, to turn off. The next several questions after a 'bop' turns on are therefore seldom validly readable. Just keep on with an assessment but be careful to go over the ground again and again if you're getting a 'bop'. Theta bops turn on fast and turn off slowly."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 13 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 295 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 34. They are not very important in diagnosis. They're more interesting than vital. 35. Rock slam (7). In assessing or running you occasionally get a Rock slam. A Rock slam means a hidden Evil Intention on the subject or question under discussion or auditing. 36. A Rock slam is a crazy, irregular, left-right slashing motion of the needle. It repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely, faster than the eye easily follows. The needle is frantic. The width of a Rock slam (R/S) depends largely on sensitivity set-ting. It goes from one-fourth inch to whole dial. But it slams back and forth. It means hot item in an assessment and takes precedence over a fall or it means that you have left rings on the pc's hands or have a loose connection in the leads or meter. If the lat-ter two items verify as not present you are looking at a Rock slam in the pc. 37. It differs from a theta bop, which has no precedence over a fall, in that a theta bop is even and gentlemanly and a Rock slam is as crazy as a Commie agitator. 38. If found in an assessment, use it, but make sure of what turned it on before you buy. It means the item is hot. 39. If found in running a process, just carry on. It means the going is hot, so for Heaven's sakes don't stop the session. 40. Free needle (8). This is probably the least understood term and needle action in all of E-Metering. 41. It means the same as a Floating Needle, which is a rhythmic sweep of the dial at a slow, even pace of the needle, back and forth, back and forth, without change in the width of the swing except perhaps to widen as the pc gets off the last small bits of charge. Note that it can get so wide that you have to shift the Tone Arm back and forth, back and forth, to keep the needle on the dial in which case you have a floating tone arm. 42. Man, it's really free. 43. You'll know one when you see one. They're really pretty startling. The needle just idles around and yawns at your questions on the subject. 44. It can occur after a cognition, blowdown of the Tone Arm, at a release point, or on the erasure of a Dianetic chain. 45. Use nul as a word, not Free, if you're in doubt about it. A nul just doesn't fall on a question. It might fall on a similar question. A Free Needle wouldn't fall if the psy-chiatrists surrendered in a body or the Empire State Building fell down. 46. A Free Needle or Floating Needle is one of the parts of the End Phenomena for any process or action. 47. Tight needles (stuck) are far from free. A stuck needle can be made to fall by advanc-ing the sensitivity way up. Thus even a 'stuck needle' can be 'nul'. But a Free Needle is not stuck or nul. It just floats around. 48. Body reactions (9). The deep breathing of a preclear, a sigh, a yawn, a sneeze, a stom-ach growl can any one of them make a needle react."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 14 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 296 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 49. Get a person on the cans. Turn the sensitivity high. Make him do the following one at a time: sigh, yawn, breathe deeply, cough, laugh, knock the cans together, lift a finger off the electrode (can), convulsively grip the cans, scratch his head while holding the cans, scratch his leg, rub a can against his or her shirt or skirt, rub his fingers together without letting the cans touch, and stretch. Note the needle reactions. Now have the person do all these things again as you read them off. Now turn down the sensitivity knob so that the needle drops one-third of a dial (about one and a half inches). Now with that setting, read off the list to him and watch the needle. 50. Do you see now why you don't run with high sensitivity? 51. These are body reactions. 52. The meter will also read Basal Metabolism, interesting because it tells you if the pre-clear really is eating, or has eaten breakfast. Have the preclear on the cans take a very deep breath. If a moment later the needle falls half a dial (two inches or more) the pre-clear has a good high Basal Metabolism. If he hasn't eaten breakfast, it won't fall like that. On the second or third deep breath let out, the Basal Metabolism stops register-ing, so the first time is the test, not subsequent tries. 53. You can also make a high sensitivity set needle jump by 'imagining' the preclear's hands being better connected to the cans and 'seeing' a whitish glow between cans and finger tips. That is, if you're in good shape. You can also do it by 'seeing' this glow in the area of a preclear's old injury. That's the extent of your influencing the preclear and the meter reading outside of auditing. 54. You can also (after you've been talking to, not processing, a preclear) set the meter on yourself, then give the cans to the preclear and he or she will read the same adjust-ments for a few moments. 55. These are all more or less Body Reactions. They get in your road as to movement and sneezes and they don't affect your processing as to 'cross currents' between auditor and preclear So bear up under them and skip them. They're not important once you know what they are. 56. Stage Four (10). This is the sole survivor of an old system (20th ACC) that used four stages of meter reaction as a test of state of case. 57. A Stage Four Needle is still important to identify when met as it means this preclear is from Noplace as a case. 58. A Stage Four is below a merely stuck needle. The preclear's thoughts and few of your questions have any bearing on the preclear's case. This is most promising as CCH stuff. But not only a Stage Four takes CCH. (See Director Processing Check Type One for case reactions that take CCH.) 59. Possibly the change process or attention process may bite here. 60. A Stage Four needle goes up about an inch or two (always the same distance) and sticks and then falls, goes up, sticks, falls, about once a second or so. It is very regular,"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 15 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 297 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST always the same distance, always the same pattern, over and over, on and on, and nothing you say or the preclear says changes it (except Body Reactions). 61. Break through this meter action by pulling withholds or unkind thoughts or the Jo'burg Security Check or the CCHs or processes, and you have busted the lowest level of the case. 62. But it's a disheartening phenomenon. The E-Meter just doesn't react to anything except a kick in the head. Up, stick, fall, up, stick, fall. On and on like a metronome set for the Dead March of Saul. Know it when you see it. Until you break it, there's no case change. "},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 16 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 298 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST G. FINDING HAVINGNESS & CONFRONT PROCESSES 1. The Thirty-six Havingness and Confront Processes are tested for on the E-Meter in an exact way. 2. The Havingness Process is located on the needle by the preclear squeezing the cans before the command is tested and after it has been run five to eight commands. 3. If the second squeeze shows the needle looser (wider swing) than the first squeeze did, you've got it. The command you are testing is the Havingness Command for the pre-clear and may thereafter be used at intervals to set up the room in Rudiments, gain havingness before or after processes and at session end, using only ten or twelve commands at a time. 4. The Confront Process from the Thirty-six Presessions is located on the Tone Arm. If eight or ten commands of one of these moves the Tone Arm, that's the Confront Proc-ess to be used after other processes and before the Havingness Process. 5. Havingness is tested on the Needle with can squeezes. 6. Confront is tested on the Tone Arm by its motion. 7. If the process tested for Havingness tightens the needle during the test, get rid of it. Don't bridge off. Just get off now. 8. If the process being tested for Confront fails to move the Tone Arm during test after eight or ten commands, get off it, don't bridge off. (No more commands of it.) 9. The Havingness Process selected, even if the right one, if run too much (more than ten or twenty commands), will start running the bank. It doesn't harm the preclear, but that isn't its use. The Tone Arm may 'blow down' toward clear if you run fifteen minutes or half an hour of the Havingness Process. Again, it might not. The purpose of a having-ness process is to get the preclear stabilize in is environment. It will also do other things if overrun, none bad, but other processes do them better. 10. The Confront Process gets the preclear to present time from areas on the track where his attention was fixed by an earlier process. 11. Use of the Havingness Process of the preclear (ten to twelve commands at a time) plus the Confront Process of the preclear (run ten or fifteen minutes, ended with preclear in or near present time) followed by the Havingness Process, followed by the Confront, etc., etc., just as above, often can bring the preclear down to his clear reading if carried on. This is known as stabilizing a case. It should be done before a person is a release. It is never done now to start a case, despite the name of the Thirty-six Havingness and Confront Processes (Presessions).

In using the meter for Security Checking you establish needle response to common (non-meaningful) questions. Seeing this, you do not mistake a real fall when it comes. 2. On meaningful questions you look for falls. A fall means 'Oh, oh! He's got me.' You don't leave a question that is getting a fall response until you are sure you have been told all and the needle no longer falls when you ask that question. 3. If the needle still falls on the question, you have one of two things: (a) the preclear hasn't told all; or (b) there's an earlier similar overt or withhold. 4. In the case of (a) you keep asking in various ways until it's cleared (no fall even with a high sensitivity knob - and you do turn up the knob on a question that didn't respond well at first and then turn it back before you go on to the next). 5. In the case of (b) when there's an earlier similar overt or withhold, you must ask for it and get it. 6. A person being security checked is subject to mental dispersal. You may get only one fall and then no fall at all for one or two repeats and then a fall. You haven't asked quite the right question. The preclear is trying to ignore it. The rule is, if you get a trace of a fall or reaction on a question, beat at by varying your wording of the ques-tion or slightly shift the type of question. In any event, be sure not to leave a trace of a reaction or a single reaction until you are certain it won't develop. 7. If the preclear tells you a withhold, you get all the data and handle it earlier similar withhold as necessary to an F/N. 8. The fall comes out if the preclear tells all. The fall stays or gets worse if the preclear is hedging. 9. On a security check, follow up every change of characteristic, if it is instant, before you go on. Change of characteristic, if it amounts to anything, will develop into a fall. 10. If the preclear hasn't told all or there's an earlier similar overt or withhold, the meter won't clear. 11. Don't be fooled by excuses. Don't discredit the meter (the preclear's first attempt when he's in a really tight spot). 12. The meter is right. 13. If a question won't clear it's (a) or (b) above and that's the total of it. 14. Grim experience of a decade has taught me that it's (a) or (b) and never 'I moved the needle myself' or 'I feel nervous just generally'. The E-Meter is right even when it seems to make the preclear wrong, except when it's a false read which can be checked for."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 19 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 301 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 15. The mark of a good Security Checker is thorough, swinish suspicion and no belief in mankind or the devil - only the meter. 16. People's cases will not move until they are clear on all withholds, so a thorough check is really a kindness after all."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 20 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 302 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST I. METER ODDITIES 1. There are few exceptions to the rule with E-Meters. They are a study composed of facts which have right or wrong answers and the answers to E-Meter questions are all in black and white. 2. These are the known exceptions: 3. Some people (a very few in very bad shape) get a rise when they are asked to squeeze the cans. This is a reverse action. It means nothing except they need to be started in low levels. 4. Some preclears, in very bad shape, rock slam when security checked and one can't find what is rock slamming. As nothing clears the slam, they have to be flunked, audited, and tried again. 5. In South Africa a Bantu's withholds read not on the needle alone but on the Tone Arm as well. The Tone Arm goes up as much as two divisions (3 to 5) just before you get off a bad withhold on one. 6. High Tone Arms on anyone (or very low) mean lots of holds - but they might not be conscious of them all at once. They come off session by session as we run along. 7. Holding the two cans in the right hand with a paper between so they don't short is the way to free a preclear's hands for pointing out things. If you change hands and he holds them in the left, the meter will read differently. This only means he is electroni-cally imbalanced (old Epi-Centres) and has no other use. 8. Preclears claim sometimes they are pushing the meter about, 'that's why it reads'. You could also ask, \"Then why didn't you prevent it from reading?' - but don't really ask them that. 9. The meter 'knows' more about the preclear than the preclear. It is reading created masses he is withholding himself from. The preclear won't confront all he is creating. Hence the omniscience of the meter. 10. Dating things on a meter is not as important as it was, I but a skilled auditor should be able to do it. It isn't covered here because few can do it well and it looks so compli-cated you might miss the important things and they are all in this book. Dating is well covered in ELECTROPSYCHOMETRIC AUDITING, the first book on the meter, and the later book, THE HUBBARD ELECTROMETER. 11. Another E-Meter oddity occurs when asking a preclear to do a lie reaction test. Some will get a fall only on the truth. Some will get a fall every time they are asked to an-swer only in the negative, or will get a fall only with the positive replies. This is not very important. The important thing about a lie reaction test is whether or not the per-son is reading on the E-Meter and the characteristic needle response to vital questions remains unchanged. The lie reaction test is given to study needle pattern for the pre-clear, not to establish his lies."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 21 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 303 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST J. METER FRAILTIES 1. E-Meter faults occur in new meters or after long use. They are few. 2. If the meter doesn't register the squeeze the preclear gives the cans, it isn't turned on or connected up or it isn't working. See the mechanical direction sheet for setting up a particular meter and follow it before you decide a meter is out of order. 3. If a meter registers the can squeeze, it is usually in good working order. 4. The batteries rarely run down in a British Hubbard Electrometer, the drain being 'the shelf life' of the battery even if you left it on for weeks day and night. This is not true of the American Hubbard Electrometer (steel case). Its batteries can run down if it's left on for days. 5. If the meter is not in working order when you get it, send it to the manufacturer or the Director of Materiel in a Central Organization or HCO for repairs. Don't try to fix it yourself. 6. If it is responding to a can squeeze when turned on according to directions, it is un-doubtedly faithfully all right throughout. The Hubbard Electrometers don't go slightly Wrong. They either work or they don't. 7. One exception: The British and American Hubbard Electrometer early models includ-ing the Mark V until February 1979 had a 'carbon pot' which is to say the Tone Arm was in 'pure carbon bearings', if you could call it that. A speck of dust can get in the 'pot' and cause the needle to rock slam whether connected to the preclear or not. Pull the lead wire jack (disconnecting cans) and if the slam continues, it's the 'pot' that's wrong. Work the Tone Arm vigorously for a while. If that doesn't stop it, turn it in to be repaired. Later models of the British and American Hubbard Electrometer have 'wire wound pots' and this doesn't happen. 8. If the batteries go down after a year or two, the 'test' won't register in its needle dial area. Be sure the meter is set up for use before you use Test as in the British meter Test can be thrown off by the zero setting knob ('Trim') and you'll think the batteries are down when they're not. If they're down get some new ones. They're available any-where there's an electric shop. Anybody can install them. It's cheaper than shipping, but HCO will do it if you like. 9. The ancient tube (valve) meters that connected to the Mains still work on all the above rules. But they pass an uncomfortably strong current through the preclear and some-times shock him. Also, after the 1950 models, they became too fancy in design with too many dials and knobs for intelligent use - too many variables could be run in on them. 10. Squirrel meters or home-built meters maybe right or wrong but they are noted for in-accurate needle behaviour. Some don't show bops because the Potentiometer used was too cheap. Some register a half a second or a second late on questions. Some are so"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 22 1961, REV. 21.2.79 LEVEL 0 304 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST lightly needled that they register everything they can.

The new British (now ready) and American (when built) Hubbard Electrometer Mark IV are the best meters we have ever had and will be the standard meter for a long time to come. They are built by one of the best instrument people in England and their parts are specially made by a very old firm.

The Tone Arm shows How it is Running. 4. When searching, watch the Needle. 5. When running a process, watch the Tone Arm. 6. The Needle's most looked for reaction is the fall. 7. The Tone Arm's most looked for reactions are: (a) change of position, and (b) ceasing to change position. 8.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says, \"Your needle is float-ing.\" This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the sub-ject of \"Floating Needles\". A lot of by-passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called end phenomena. End phenomena is defined as \"those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended\". It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended. 1. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 2 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 0 330 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST But that's if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating nee-dle. If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know – so that's . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,\" he can upset the pc's bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won't ap-pear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor's pre-mature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc's end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition. C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N van-ished and TA rising, requiring \"rehab\") can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a begin-ning F/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating\" can be a chop. Also it's a false report if it isn't widely floating and will keep floating."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 0 331 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor's Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changed to read \"A real wide F/N\". Here it's a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problem is not difficult. I follow this rule – I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don't ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it's his case we are han-dling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc's cognition. If it isn't there, I give the next command due. If it still isn't there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure or Release, depending on whether it's Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, \"Your needle is floating.\" DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn't been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn't grinding. It's waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon. The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an era-sure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in.

This fact tells you at once why you cannot do three major actions in a row in the same ten minutes. This was the bug behind \"Quickie Grades\" (0 to IV in one session. This also occurred in Power when it was run all in one day). The auditor would attain a bona fide full dial F/N. The pc was still cogniting, still in a big win. The auditor would \"clear the next process com-mand\", he would see an F/N. He would \"clear the next process command\", and see an F/N. But it was the same F/N! Result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case. This is really what is meant by \"Quickie Grades\". In 1958 we got real Releases. You could not kill the F/N for days, weeks. Several processes had this effect. Today's real Clear also goes this way. You couldn't kill the F/N with an axe. By running a lot of Level Zero processes, for instance, you can get a real swinging unkillable F/N. It not only gets to the Examiner, it comes in at the start of the next day's session! Now if in one session you ran all of Level Zero and went on up to Level One, you would just be auditing a persistent F/N. The pc would get no benefit at all from Level One. He's still going \"Wow\" on Level Zero. If you ran Level Zero with one process that got a big wide floating F/N and then \"ran\" Level I, II, III and IV, you would have just a Level Zero Release. The pc's bank was nowhere to be found. So next week he has problems (Level I) or a Service Fac (Level IV) and he is only a Grade Zero yet it says right there in Certs and Awards log he's a Grade IV.

When you get one of these dial-wide F/Ns, Cog, VGIs wow you may as well pack it up for the day. GRADUAL WIDENING In running a Dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in one session a half dial on Flow 1, ¾ of a dial on Flow 2, a full dial on Flow 3. Or you may have 4 subjects to two-way comm or prepcheck in one session. First ac-tion ⅓ dial F/N. Then no F/N, TA up. Second action ½ dial F/N. Then no F/N. Third action ¾ dial F/N. Fourth action full dial-wide floating swinging idling F/N. You will also notice in the same session-long time for 1st action, shorter, shorter, shorter for the next three actions. Now you have an F/N that anything you try to clear and run will just F/N without af-fecting the case at all. If you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes. You have hit an \"unkillable F/N\", properly called a persistent F/N. It's persistent at least for that day. Do any more and it's wasted. If an auditor has never seen this he had better get his TR0 bullbait flat for 2 hours at one unflunked go and his other TRs in and drill out his flubs. For that's what's supposed to happen. F/Ns on pcs audited up to (for that session) a persistent F/N always get to the Exam-iner. If you only have a \"small F/N\" it won't get to the Examiner. However, on some pcs maybe that's good enough. May take him several sessions, each one getting a final session F/N a bit wider. Then he gets an F/N that gets to the Examiner. After that, well audited on a continuing basis, the F/N lasts longer and longer. One day the pc comes into session with a dial-wide floating swinging F/N and any-thing you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that F/N. It's a real Release man. It may last weeks, months, years. Tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remain-ing hours (if sold by the hour) as undelivered.

Auditors have also called F/Ns which were ARC break needles, thus falsely indicating to the pc. These two actions – disregarding actual F/Ns because the TA was not between 2.0 and 3.0 and calling \"F/Ns\" that were actually ARC break needles – have upset many preclears. The outnesses here are: A. not considering pc indicators as senior and B. not noting pc indicators when calling an F/N and C. ignoring and giving junior importance to the technol-ogy covered in false TAs. (See list of references at end of this HCOB or the Subject Index of the HCOB Volumes.)

The E-Meter does not read on hand moisture alone as was long believed by people in electronics. But TA depends upon resistance to electrical current in the palms, leads, and meter as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them. To simply tell some interne \"Always disregard an F/N not in correct range\" is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes. The correct information is that an F/N which isn't in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an F/N or not. And indicates you better get the false TA handled fast as soon as it won't interrupt the current cy-cle. And you always note where it F/Ned so the C/S can C/S for false TA handling. Where an ARC break needle (which looks like an F/N) is observed, whether it is in range or out of range (2.0 to 3.0 or below 2.0 or above 3.0) you look at the pc and establish the pc's indicators before falsely calling an F/N. A pc who is about to cry is not an F/Ning pc and if you indicate an F/N to that pc you will further the ARC break and suppress the emo-tional charge that is about to come off. REPAIR Where the above matters have not been fully understood and errors have occurred on pcs, it must be assumed that: 1. Auditors have falsified their worksheets as to TA position and thus built up withholds and made themselves blowy. 2. That every pc who has ever had high or low TA trouble has had F/Ns disregarded and ARC break F/Ns falsely indicated. 3. That a briefing and drilling of all Internes and auditors must occur on this HCOB. 4. That a brief program of clean-up of disregarded F/Ns and falsely called ARC break F/Ns be done on every pc. 5.

An auditor running R3RA is not looking for F/Ns. He is looking for total, complete era-sure of the basic of a chain. In running R3RA one has to consult the pc! This is part of R3RA commands. An F/N can occurs five or more engrams before basic is reached! You just go on with R3RA. Only when the pc says the engram has totally erased, when he has cognited, is VGIs and the postulate in the basic has come off do you consider the chain complete. The E-Meter will have been F/Ning for some time. When the full end phenomena of a Dianetics chain is obtained, the needle will of course be F/Ning. The F/N simply broadens. The auditor does not call F/Ns when running Dianetics until the full EP of the chain is reached. 1. When it appears that you have reached the basic incident of a chain and that it is erasing, after each pass through the auditor asks, \"Has it erased?\" 2. The meter will have been F/Ning for some time. 3. When the pc has stated that it has erased the auditor should also expect a cognition volunteered by the pc. 4. The auditor should expect to see very good indicators (VGIs). 5. If no postulate made during the time of the incident has come off and been volun-teered by the pc the auditor should ask, \"Did you make a postulate at the time of the incident? Note that the postulate may have come off in the form of a cognition and on the other hand may not have even though a cognition was given.

As a number of teams directly under an auditing supervisor and 2. As an individual auditor. Correct training procedure at Level 0 is to have the auditor do co-audit style until confident and then train him to do the same thing individually. LISTEN STYLE CO-AUDIT The Co-audit version is merely to get the student to do auditing without having to as-sume too much responsibility. In this version it is really the instructor who is doing the auditing. He starts the session and tells the auditor to give the commands and acknowledge the answers. If this relationship is understood it makes the supervision of a Level 0 group of teams much easier. The procedure for running a Listen Style Co-audit is as follows: 1. Instructor gets the auditors to seat their pcs in their chairs and then sit down. 2. He writes up on a board the exact wording of the process to be used. 3. He asks students if the room is alright for them to be audited in. 4. He tells them what is going to be run in the session (R Factor) and cleans up any questions on the part of pcs (obviously, stress is on getting them able to talk to anyone). 5. He tells auditors and pcs that all the auditor is permitted to do is to give the com-mand and acknowledge the answers. If pc says anything that cannot be handled with an ac-knowledgement the auditor will put out his hand behind him and wait for an instructor. 6. He tells the auditors to keep their auditor's reports. 7. Instructor then says \"Start of Session\". And tells the auditors to give the command. No goals or rudiments are set or done. Notes: Students should be taught that before they give an acknowledgement they should understand pc's answer. They are permitted therefore to ask pc to amplify an answer or to explain a word so that they (the auditors) understand the answer."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 2 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 344 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If a student puts out his hand the instructor goes to session and without ending it han-dles what needs handling and then lets session go on. The instructor is careful not to become the pc's auditor completely as transference will set in and pcs will invent trouble to get more attention. Instructor should have a meter handy so that in the case of an ARC Break he can quickly do an assessment. In doing the ARC Break Assessment he is of course careful not to audit the pc, only to locate and indicate the by-passed charge. At end of period, Instructor says \"Commence ending your sessions.\" He waits a bit and then says: \"Tell your auditor any gains you've made in the session. Auditors write them down.\" Waits again and then says \"Alright, I'm going to end the session now. End of Ses-sion.\" Instructor then gives whatever instruction is necessary either to end the period or to get the room ready for the next period or gives a break, etc. LISTEN STYLE, INDIVIDUAL This is done exactly the same as the Co-audit version but in this case of course the auditor handles the session. It goes like this: 1. The auditor seats the pc in his or her chair and then sits down across from the pc, knees a few inches from the pc's. A table is used, or just two chairs, the auditor's report being kept on a clip board. There is, of course, no meter. 2. The auditor takes the exact auditing command to be used from his text book, bulletin or notes. 3. He asks the pc if it is all right to audit the pc in the room and if not, makes things right by adjusting the room or location of auditing. 4. He tells the pc the purpose of such sessions (Reality Factor) \"I want to get you used to talking to another.\" \"I want to improve your reach,\" etc. It's the auditor's goal at this level, not the pc's. Pcs don't get a chance to have goals in Listen Style as they would set goals they can't attain at this level and wouldn't have enough reality on auditing anyway to be sensible about it. So, only an R Factor is used – no goals. The auditor also tells the pc exactly how long the session will be. 5. The auditor tells the pc that all he is going to do is to listen and try to understand the pc, and that all he wants the pc to do is talk on the selected subject the auditor will give him and that if he veers off, the auditor will call it to his attention. 6. The auditor then quickly starts his auditor's report. 7. The auditor says \"Start of Session\". 8. The auditor gives the command from his text, bulletin or notes. The command must have something to do with telling people things or communicating, and may also spec-ify a subject to talk about. 9. Further commands are given only when the pc loses track of the subject and wants to know what it was (see Routines for Level 0 for exact handling of commands)."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 3 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 345 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 10. When the pc says something and obviously expects a response, the auditor signifies he has heard, using any normal means. 11. When the pc says something the auditor doesn't grasp, the auditor asks the pc to repeat it or amplify it so that the auditor does hear it in the fullest sense of the word. (See \"The Prompters\" below. Only 4 are allowed.) 12. When the pc stops talking, the auditor must adjudicate whether the pc is simply no longer interested in the subject, or has become unwilling to talk about some bit of it. If the auditor believes the pc has stopped because of embarrassment or some similar rea-son, the auditor has The Prompters, the only things he is allowed to use. Prompter (a) \"Have you found something you think would make me think less of you?\" Prompter (b) \"Is there something you thought of that you think I wouldn't understand?\" Prompter (c) \"Have you said something you felt I didn't understand. If so, tell me again.\" Prompter (d) \"Have you found something you haven't understood? If so, tell me about it.\" (The student must know these prompters by heart.) He uses as many as needed, in the sequence given, to start the pc talking again. The auditor must not start a new subject or process just because the pc can't bring him-self to go on talking. The whole essence of Level 0 is to get the pc up to being willing to talk about anything to anyone. Thus any coaxing is also allowed. Threats are for-bidden. (a) (b) (c) or (d) usually handle. These are the commonest reasons people cease talking. Mere forgetting is handled just by reminding the pc of the subject. 13. New Processes (or new subjects in a Routine which are in essence new processes) are started only when the pc has brightened up and become quite able by reason of getting comfortable about the last one. Realizing that the whole target of Level 0 is to get people willing to talk about anything to others, a regained ability on a subject governs when to start a new process. If the auditor can answer to himself this question in the affirmative, then he can go to a new process, \"Is this pc able to talk freely to or about (subject of last process)?\" If so, it's all right to select a new question from the same routine or a new Routine (more rarely) and ask it now. But it is never all right to pre-vent a pc from talking by butting in with a new question. One never asks amplifying questions at Level 0. Commentary type questions are also out. The auditor listens to the question's answers and only interrupts when he truly hasn't heard or didn't grasp some point. No over and over repetitive use of commands is made, of course, as that's Level One. The Commands are given rarely, same commands, but only to get the pc going again. Staccato repetitive commands and brief pc answers are not for Level 0. 14. Toward the end of the auditing period, the auditor warns, \"The session time is about over. We'll have to be ending shortly.\" 15. When the pc has given an extra comment or two, the auditor says, \"We're closing the session now. Time is up. Have you made any gains in this session?\" 16. The pc's answers are quickly noted."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 4 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 346 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 17. The auditor says, \"End of Session.\" Note: Pcs of course often keep on talking and make it hard to end a session. End it anyway. If this seems to shock the pc, point out the time the session ended as originally set and say also, \"You'll be getting more auditing and we'll take that up in the next session.\" You'll always have trouble ending a session if you fail to put in its time in the R Factor (Real-ity Factor) in 4 above. As the auditor notes the time in his report (see 4 above) he must say, \"This session will go until________(hours and minutes) precisely.\" Thus he has an out for ending it. An auditor must never run beyond that time set, and must, of course, audit until it is reached. This, by the way, does not just hold good for Level 0. It is very good practice for all levels in regular sessions. The only exception is the assist where one is auditing toward a definite gain. In general auditing one seeks to obtain general gains not sudden momentary spurts. ____________________ The auditor, whether in co-audit or individual session at this and the next level, will soon become impressed with this fact: the more he himself says during the session, the less gain the pc gets. Therefore, aside from the above, the auditor does very little in the session and is paid handsomely for it in pc gains. L.

It is called Material Clearing. Those the person cannot define must be looked up. This method may be done without a meter. It can also be done with a meter. The reason the Method is needed is because the person often does not know that he does not know. Therefore Method 4 has its limitations as the meter does not always read. The actions are very precise. The word clearer asks \"What is the definition of _____?\" The person gives it. If there is any doubt whatever of it, or if the person is the least bit hesitant, the word is looked up in a proper dictionary.

CLEARING COMMANDS (Ref: HCOB 14 Nov 65, CLEARING COMMANDS HCOB 9 Nov 68, CLEARING COMMANDS, ALL LEVELS HCO PL 4 Apr 72R ETHICS AND STUDY TECH) Always when running a process newly or whenever the preclear is confused about the meaning of commands, clear each word of each command with the preclear. using the dic-tionary if necessary. This has long been standard procedure. You want a pc set up to run smoothly, knowing what is expected of him and under-standing exactly the question being asked or the command being given. A misunderstood word or auditing command can waste hours of auditing time and keep a whole case from moving. Thus this preliminary step to running a process or procedure for the first time is vital. The rules of clearing commands are: 1. Under no circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the pc and tell him what the word or command means. 2. Always have the necessary (and good) dictionaries in the auditing room with you. This would include the Tech Dictionary, the Admin Dictionary, a good English dic-tionary, and a good non-dinky dictionary in the pc's native language. For a foreign language case (where the pc's native language is not English) you will also need a dual dictionary for that language and English. (Example: English word \"apple\" is looked up in English/French dictionary and \"pomme\" is found. Now look in the French dictionary to define \"pomme.\") So for the foreign language case two dictionaries are needed: (1) English to foreign language (2) foreign language itself. 3. Have the pc on the cans throughout the clearing of the words and commands."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"CLEARING COMMANDS 2 HCOB 9.8.78 II LEVEL 0 358 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 4. Clear the command (or question or list item) backwards by first clearing in turn each word in the command in backwards sequence. (Example: To clear the command \"Do fish swim?\" clear \"swim\" first, then \"fish,\" then \"do.\") This prevents the pc starting to run the process by himself while you are still clearing the words. 4a. Note: F/Ns obtained on clearing the words does not mean the process has been run. 5. Next, clear the command itself. Auditor asks the pc, \"What does this command mean to you?\" If it is evident from the pc's answer that he has misunderstood a word as it is used in the context of the com-mand: (a) Re-clear the obvious word (or words) using the dictionary. (b) Have him use each word in a sentence until he has it. (The worst fault is the pc using a new set of words in place of the actual word and answering the al-ter-ised word, not the word itself. See HCOB 10 MAR 65, WORDS, MIS-UNDERSTOOD GOOFS.) (c) Re-clear the command. (d) If necessary, repeat Steps a, b and c above to make sure he understands the command. 5a. Note: that a word reads when clearing a command, an assessment question or listing question does not mean the command or question itself has read necessar-ily. Mis-understood words read on the meter. 6. When clearing the command, watch the meter and note any read on the com-mand. (REF: HCOB 28 FEB 71, C/S SERIES 24, IMPORTANT METERING READING ITEMS.) 7. Don't clear the commands of all ruds and run them, or of all processes and run them. you'll miss F/Ns. the commands of one process are cleared just before that process is run. 8. ARC breaks and lists should be word cleared before a pc gets into them and should be tagged in the pc's folder on a yellow sheet as cleared. (REF: BTB 5 NOV 72R II, REV. 24.7.74, AUDITOR ADMIN SERIES 6R, THE YELLOW SHEET.) As it is difficult to clear all the words of a correction list on a pc over heavy by-passed charge, it is standard to clear the words of an L1C and ruds very early in auditing and to clear an L4BRA before commencing listing processes or an L3RE before running"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"CLEARING COMMANDS 3 HCOB 9.8.78 II LEVEL 0 359 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST R3RA. Then, when the need for these correction lists arises one does not need to clear all the words as it has already been done. Thus, such correction lists can be used with-out delay. It is also standard to clear the words of the Word Clearing Correction List early in au-diting and before other correction lists are cleared. This way, if the pc bogs on subse-quent Word Clearing, you have your Word Clearing Correction List ready to use. 9. If, however, your pc is sitting in the middle of an ARC break (or other heavy charge) and the words of the L1C (or other correction list) have not been cleared yet, don't clear first. Go ahead and assess the list to handle the charge. Otherwise it's auditing over an ARC break. In this case you just verify by asking afterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list. All the words of the L1C (or other correction list) would then be cleared thoroughly at the first opportunity – per your C/S's instructions. 10. Do not re-clear all the words of assessment lists each time the list is used on the same pc. Do it once, fully and properly the first time and note clearly in the folder, on the yellow sheet for future reference, which of the- standard assessment lists have been cleared. 11. These rules apply to all processes, listing questions and assessments . 12. The words of the platens of advanced course materials are not so cleared. ____________________ Any violation of full and correct clearing of commands or assessment questions, whether done in a formal session or not, is an ethics offense per HCO PL 4 Apr 72R (Rev. 21.6.75) ETHICS AND STUDY TECH, Section 4, which states: \"Any auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned before a court of ethics. \"The charge is Out Tech.\" L.

Use these in conjunction with the Basic Scientology Picture Book. If further refer-ences are needed when clearing these terms and concepts, ensure source materials are used. For any non-Scientology terms use a good non-dinky dictionary. SCIENTOLOGY: An applied religious philosophy developed by L. Ron Hubbard dealing with the study of knowledge, which through the application of its technology can bring about desirable changes in the conditions of life. (Taken from the Latin word scio, knowing in the fullest sense of the word, and the Greek word logos, to study.) A body of knowledge which, when properly used, gives freedom and truth to the individual. AUDITING: Processing, the application of Scientology (or Dianetic) processes and procedures to someone by a trained auditor. The exact definition of auditing is: the action of asking a preclear a ques-tion (which he can understand and answer), getting an answer to that question and acknowl-edging him for that answer. AUDITING SESSION: A period in which an auditor and preclear are in a quiet place where they will not be dis-turbed. The auditor gives the preclear certain and exact commands which the preclear can follow. AUDITOR: A person trained and qualified in applying Scientology and/or Dianetic processes and proce-dures to individuals for their betterment; called an auditor because auditor means \"one who listens.\" An auditor is a minister of the Church of Scientology. * CLEAR: A thetan who can be at cause knowingly and at will over mental matter, energy, space and time as regards the first dynamic (survival for self). The state of Clear is above the release   * [An additional reference on Clear is: HCOB 24 September 1978.

PRECLEAR: From pre-Clear, a person not yet Clear; generally a person being audited, who is thus on the road to Clear; a person who, through Scientology and Dianetic processing, is finding out more about himself and life. THETAN: From THETA (life static), a word taken from the Greek symbol or letter: theta, traditional symbol for thought or spirit. The thetan is the individual himself - not the body or the mind. The thetan is the \"I\"; one doesn't have or own a thetan; one is a thetan. MIND: A control system between the thetan and the physical universe. It is not the brain. The mind is the accumulated recordings of thoughts, conclusions, decisions, observations and perceptions of a thetan throughout his entire existence. The thetan can and does use the mind in handling life and the physical universe. BODY: The organized physical composition or substance of an animal or man whether living or dead. PICTURE: An exact likeness; image. A mental image. MENTAL IMAGE PICTURE: Mental pictures; facsimiles and mock-ups; a copy of one's perceptions of the physical uni-verse sometime in the past. REACTIVE MIND: Reactive bank. The portion of the mind which works on a stimulus-response basis (given a certain stimulus it will automatically give a certain response) which is not under a person's volitional control and which exerts force and power over a person's awareness, purposes, thoughts, body and actions. The reactive mind never stops operating. Pictures of the environment, of a very low order, are taken by this mind even in some states of unconsciousness.

A communication cycle consists of just: cause, distance, effect, with intention, attention, duplication and under-standing. AUDITING COMM CYCLE: (HCOB 30 Apr 71) This is the auditing comm cycle that is always in use: (1) is the pc ready to receive the command? (appearance, presence) (2) auditor gives command/question to pc (cause, distance, effect) (3) pc looks to bank for answer . . . (4) pc receives answer from bank (5) pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect) (6) auditor acknowledges pc (7) auditor sees that pc received acknowledgement (attention) (8) new cycle beginning with (1). CHARGE: The stored quantities of energy in the time track; stored energy or stored or recreatable poten-tials of energy. The electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. Harmful energy or force accumulated and generated in the reactive mind, resulting from the conflicts and un-pleasant experiences that a person has had. MENTAL MASS: Mocking up matter, energy, space and time. Its proportionate weight would be terribly slight compared to the real object which the person is mocking up a picture of. KEY-IN: The action of recording a lock on a secondary or engram; the moment an earlier upset or ear-lier incident has been restimulated. KEY-OUT: An action of an engram or secondary dropping away without being erased. Released or sepa-rate from one's reactive mind or some portion of it.

They are, from the lowest to the highest: Grade 0 Communications Release, Grade I Problems Release, Grade II Relief Release, Grade III Freedom Release, Grade IV Ability Release, Grade V Power Release, Grade VA Power Plus Release, Grade VI Whole Track Release. Each is a distinct and definite step toward greater levels of awareness and ability. POSTULATE: A conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past. . . . We mean, by postulate, a self-created truth. A postulate is, of course, that thing which is directed desire or order, or inhibition, or enforcement, on the part of the individual in the form of an idea. . . . Postulate means to cause a thinkingness or consideration. COGNITION: A pc origination indicating he has \"come to realize.\" It's a \"What do you know? I . . .\" state-ment. A new realization of life. It results in a higher degree of awareness and consequently a greater ability to succeed with one's endeavors in life. FLOATING NEEDLE: A floating needle is a rhythmic sweep of the dial at a slow, even pace of the needle. It is always accompanied by very good indicators in the pc.

Affinity is one of the components of understanding, the other components being reality and communication. REALITY: The agreed upon apparency of existence. A reality is any data that agrees with the person's perceptions, computations and education. Reality is one of the compon-ents of understanding. Reality is what is.

Communication is one of the component parts of understanding. ARC BREAK: A sudden drop or cutting of one's affinity, reality or communication with someone or some-thing. It is pronounced by its letters A-R-C break. PROBLEM: Anything which has opposing sides of equal force; especially postulate-counter-postulate, intention-counter-intention or idea-counter-idea; an intention-counter-intention that worries the preclear.

Any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited. OVERT: An overt act is an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least num-ber of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics. . . . An aggressive or destructive act by the individual against one or more of the eight dynam-ics (self, family, group, mankind, animals or plants, mest, life or the infinite).

There is a vast amount of material on havingness and the remedy of havingness in early pub-lications and other HCOBs to be found in the Technical Volumes – data the student will ac-quire as he continues to train up the levels and on the SHSBC. This issue is to give the beginning auditor a working knowledge of the subject of hav-ingness. \"HAVINGNESS: 1) that which permits the experience of mass and pressure. 2) the feeling that one owns or possesses. 3) can be simply defined as ARC with the environment... 6) the ability to duplicate that which one perceives, or to be willing to create a duplication of it... 8) havingness is the concept of being able to reach or not being prevented from reach-ing... 4) that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pc's attention.\" (From the Technical Dictionary.) The above are all valid, but the final definition of havingness can be simply stated as: Havingness is the concept of being able to reach. No Havingness is the concept of not being able to reach. Inherent in the ability to reach is the willingness and ability to duplicate. That which makes communication work in processes is the duplication part of the communication formula (Axiom 28 Amended). The position of a being on the Tone Scale is determined by his ability to reach (and thus his willingness and ability to duplicate, to communicate and experience). The lower the tone of the being the less willing he is to reach, communicate with and experience his present time environment, and the less willing he is to reach and duplicate events of the past or permit them to happen again."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"HAVINGNESS   2   HCOB   7.8.78   FINDING AND RUNNING THE PC’S HAVINGNESS PROCESS LEVEL 0 374 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST This is remedied by Objective Havingness Processes. These are processes that deal with observing and touching objects in the auditing room or in the environment. They are \"look around\" or physical contact processes, used to remedy a low or \"no havingness\" condi-tion. Thus we find the pc's Havingness Process early on in auditing and use it to gain or remedy havingness before or after processes or at session end. FINDING AND RUNNING THE PC'S HAVINGNESS PROCESS The preclear's Havingness Process is tested for on the meter in an exact way. You test it on the needle with can squeezes from the pc. Use HCOB 6 October 1960R, Revised 8 May 74, \"Thirty-Six New Presessions.\" 1. Set the sensitivity for 1/3 of a dial drop when the pc squeezes the cans. (See E-Meter Drill 5, The Book of E-Meter Drills. ) 2. Run 5 to 8 commands of the first Havingness Process on the above bulletin, with the pc on the meter. 3. Then have the pc squeeze the cans, noting the size of the needle read now. If this sec-ond can squeeze shows the needle looser (wider swing) than the first can squeeze did, you've got it. The Havingness Process you've tested is the Having-ness Process for the preclear and may be used to remedy his havingness as necessary. 4. If the process tightens the needle during the test, don't use it. Don't bridge off. Just get off the process now and test the next process, or the next, continuing until you find a Havingness Process that does loosen the needle and gives a wider swing. One will be found among the list of Havingness Processes on HCOB 6 Oct 60R. 5. The correct Havingness Process selected is then run 10 to 12 commands at a time, usually just before ending off a session. A pc's Havingness Process can change as the pc changes with auditing. If at some point in the auditing the Havingness Process which has been being used fails to get the de-sired result, simply re-test for a new Havingness Process, find one that works and use it. Even the right Havingness Process, if run too much at one time (more than 10 or 20 commands) will start running the bank. It doesn't harm the preclear but that isn't its use, as there are other processes that run the bank better. The purpose of a Havingness Process is to get the preclear stabilized in his environ-ment.

Cognition's are the milestones of case gain. Rough TRs, rough metering, Out Code and a distractive auditor then make no case gain. When an auditor has smooth, usual TRs, does his metering expertly and without at-tracting the pc's attention, when he follows the Auditor's Code (particularly regarding Evalua-tion and Invalidation) and when he is interested, not interesting as an auditor, the pc cognites and makes case gains. Further, according to the axioms, a bank straightens out by as-ising its content. If the pc's attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so As-Ising cannot occur. The definition of In Session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor. When this definition describes the session in progress, then of course the pc will be able to as-is and will cognite. By THE ORIGINAL THESIS, the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pc's bank. When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can't be heard, doesn't ack, doesn't give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has out-TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over-acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc's attention onto himself. So the pc's attention, not being on his bank, doesn't as-is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by-passes F/Ns or calls F/Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc \"That reads\" \"That blew down\" etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of In-Session.

(Present Time Prob-lem); (2) The Overt Act (with its withholds of all varieties); and (3) The ARC Break (a sud-den drop in Affinity, Reality and Communication). The following facts are some of the best substantiated facts in the whole of our technology: The Present Time Problem (1) The presence of a Present Time Problem in a session, unless handled, will prevent all gain. If a \"PTP\" exists in the pc and you try to audit something else and ignore the PTP, the pc's personality graph will show no change, the TA (Tone Arm of the Meter) will not move well, the pc will not make his or her session goals and auditing may eventually cease. The Overt Act (2) In the presence of an Overt Act undisclosed to the auditor and withheld from him, no matter how openly it may once have been done, the auditing cycle of communication be-tween auditor and pc (as in TR's 0 to 4) cannot occur, as the pc is withholding. Therefore, nothing can vanish in the pc's reactive mind and auditing becomes painful. The graph will not change, nor will the TA move well. The ARC Break (3) In the presence of an ARC Break, the pc's attention is so distracted by the reactive charge that has been bypassed (restimulated, but overlooked by both pc and auditor) that the strain of splitting attention between the charge in the bank and the auditor will operate to worsen the pc's case, reduce the pc's graph and freeze the tone arm of the meter. Therefore, one must not pursue an auditing cycle during an ARC break, but may only locate and indicate the bypassed charge. The Main Point If an auditor doesn't handle these three things competently, the pc will eventually cease to be audited.

Alternatives for bringing ruds in exist, but they need a much higher qualified auditor – such as Class III for 2WC – or do not cover the most frequent out ruds – such as Big Mid Ruds. Thus the Qual Board recommends that lower classed auditors – Class 0, Class I, HSDC, HRD – are trained on the following form of rudiments and use these in session until they are higher classed. Where the auditor is higher classed but the pc is a beginner on his first grades, life repair or Dianetics, the C/S can use this form of ruds at his discretion.

As a number of teams directly under an auditing supervisor and 2. As an individual auditor. Correct training procedure at Level 0 is to have the auditor do co-audit style until confident and then train him to do the same thing individually. LISTEN STYLE CO-AUDIT The Co-audit version is merely to get the student to do auditing without having to as-sume too much responsibility. In this version it is really the instructor who is doing the auditing. He starts the session and tells the auditor to give the commands and acknowledge the answers. If this relationship is understood it makes the supervision of a Level 0 group of teams much easier. The procedure for running a Listen Style Co-audit is as follows: 1. Instructor gets the auditors to seat their pcs in their chairs and then sit down. 2. He writes up on a board the exact wording of the process to be used. 3. He asks students if the room is alright for them to be audited in. 4. He tells them what is going to be run in the session (R Factor) and cleans up any questions on the part of pcs (obviously, stress is on getting them able to talk to anyone). 5. He tells auditors and pcs that all the auditor is permitted to do is to give the com-mand and acknowledge the answers. If pc says anything that cannot be handled with an ac-knowledgement the auditor will put out his hand behind him and wait for an instructor. 6. He tells the auditors to keep their auditor's reports. 7. Instructor then says \"Start of Session\". And tells the auditors to give the command. No goals or rudiments are set or done. Notes: Students should be taught that before they give an acknowledgement they should understand pc's answer. They are permitted therefore to ask pc to amplify an answer or to explain a word so that they (the auditors) understand the answer."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 2 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 392 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST If a student puts out his hand the instructor goes to session and without ending it han-dles what needs handling and then lets session go on. The instructor is careful not to become the pc's auditor completely as transference will set in and pcs will invent trouble to get more attention. Instructor should have a meter handy so that in the case of an ARC Break he can quickly do an assessment. In doing the ARC Break Assessment he is of course careful not to audit the pc, only to locate and indicate the by-passed charge. At end of period, Instructor says \"Commence ending your sessions.\" He waits a bit and then says: \"Tell your auditor any gains you've made in the session. Auditors write them down.\" Waits again and then says \"Alright, I'm going to end the session now. End of Ses-sion.\" Instructor then gives whatever instruction is necessary either to end the period or to get the room ready for the next period or gives a break, etc. LISTEN STYLE, INDIVIDUAL This is done exactly the same as the Co-audit version but in this case of course the auditor handles the session. It goes like this: 1. The auditor seats the pc in his or her chair and then sits down across from the pc, knees a few inches from the pc's. A table is used, or just two chairs, the auditor's report being kept on a clip board. There is, of course, no meter. 2. The auditor takes the exact auditing command to be used from his text book, bulletin or notes. 3. He asks the pc if it is all right to audit the pc in the room and if not, makes things right by adjusting the room or location of auditing. 4. He tells the pc the purpose of such sessions (Reality Factor) \"I want to get you used to talking to another.\" \"I want to improve your reach,\" etc. It's the auditor's goal at this level, not the pc's. Pcs don't get a chance to have goals in Listen Style as they would set goals they can't attain at this level and wouldn't have enough reality on auditing anyway to be sensible about it. So, only an R Factor is used – no goals. The auditor also tells the pc exactly how long the session will be. 5. The auditor tells the pc that all he is going to do is to listen and try to understand the pc, and that all he wants the pc to do is talk on the selected subject the auditor will give him and that if he veers off, the auditor will call it to his attention. 6. The auditor then quickly starts his auditor's report. 7. The auditor says \"Start of Session\". 8. The auditor gives the command from his text, bulletin or notes. The command must have something to do with telling people things or communicating, and may also spec-ify a subject to talk about. 9. Further commands are given only when the pc loses track of the subject and wants to know what it was (see Routines for Level 0 for exact handling of commands)."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 3 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 393 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 10. When the pc says something and obviously expects a response, the auditor signifies he has heard, using any normal means. 11. When the pc says something the auditor doesn't grasp, the auditor asks the pc to repeat it or amplify it so that the auditor does hear it in the fullest sense of the word. (See \"The Prompters\" below. Only 4 are allowed.) 12. When the pc stops talking, the auditor must adjudicate whether the pc is simply no longer interested in the subject, or has become unwilling to talk about some bit of it. If the auditor believes the pc has stopped because of embarrassment or some similar rea-son, the auditor has The Prompters, the only things he is allowed to use. Prompter (a) \"Have you found something you think would make me think less of you?\" Prompter (b) \"Is there something you thought of that you think I wouldn't understand?\" Prompter (c) \"Have you said something you felt I didn't understand. If so, tell me again.\" Prompter (d) \"Have you found something you haven't understood? If so, tell me about it.\" (The student must know these prompters by heart.) He uses as many as needed, in the sequence given, to start the pc talking again. The auditor must not start a new subject or process just because the pc can't bring him-self to go on talking. The whole essence of Level 0 is to get the pc up to being willing to talk about anything to anyone. Thus any coaxing is also allowed. Threats are for-bidden. (a) (b) (c) or (d) usually handle. These are the commonest reasons people cease talking. Mere forgetting is handled just by reminding the pc of the subject. 13. New Processes (or new subjects in a Routine which are in essence new processes) are started only when the pc has brightened up and become quite able by reason of getting comfortable about the last one. Realizing that the whole target of Level 0 is to get people willing to talk about anything to others, a regained ability on a subject governs when to start a new process. If the auditor can answer to himself this question in the affirmative, then he can go to a new process, \"Is this pc able to talk freely to or about (subject of last process)?\" If so, it's all right to select a new question from the same routine or a new Routine (more rarely) and ask it now. But it is never all right to pre-vent a pc from talking by butting in with a new question. One never asks amplifying questions at Level 0. Commentary type questions are also out. The auditor listens to the question's answers and only interrupts when he truly hasn't heard or didn't grasp some point. No over and over repetitive use of commands is made, of course, as that's Level One. The Commands are given rarely, same commands, but only to get the pc going again. Staccato repetitive commands and brief pc answers are not for Level 0. 14. Toward the end of the auditing period, the auditor warns, \"The session time is about over. We'll have to be ending shortly.\" 15. When the pc has given an extra comment or two, the auditor says, \"We're closing the session now. Time is up. Have you made any gains in this session?\" 16. The pc's answers are quickly noted."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE AUDITING 4 HCOB 10.12.64 LEVEL 0 394 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST 17. The auditor says, \"End of Session.\" Note: Pcs of course often keep on talking and make it hard to end a session. End it anyway. If this seems to shock the pc, point out the time the session ended as originally set and say also, \"You'll be getting more auditing and we'll take that up in the next session.\" You'll always have trouble ending a session if you fail to put in its time in the R Factor (Real-ity Factor) in 4 above. As the auditor notes the time in his report (see 4 above) he must say, \"This session will go until________(hours and minutes) precisely.\" Thus he has an out for ending it. An auditor must never run beyond that time set, and must, of course, audit until it is reached. This, by the way, does not just hold good for Level 0. It is very good practice for all levels in regular sessions. The only exception is the assist where one is auditing toward a definite gain. In general auditing one seeks to obtain general gains not sudden momentary spurts. ____________________ The auditor, whether in co-audit or individual session at this and the next level, will soon become impressed with this fact: the more he himself says during the session, the less gain the pc gets. Therefore, aside from the above, the auditor does very little in the session and is paid handsomely for it in pc gains. L.

On listing (L&N) questions such as on the main Grade III and IV Listing Proc-esses. The Grade Chart was released as a result of thorough and painstaking research carried out over a number of years. The program it lays out is the basic program for any and every case, The fact that a routine grades process question may not read when first given to a pc does not mean there is no charge on the question. Nine times out of ten it means only that it will take a bit of time for the pc to get into the process and contact the charge that is there. It could mean that the question has not been properly cleared and thus is not fully understood by the pc. The initial action is, of course, to ensure that the pc does understand the question or command. But the auditor does not check a routine grades process command or question for read before running it, other than as noted in the exceptions listed above. To summarize: 1. When you are selecting something to run on the pc that is handling his individual case manifestations you always check it for read and it must read well before you run it. Not all pcs have \"a sharp pain in the left elbow\" or are upset by false teeth or have a prepcheck-able item called \"reviews\" or have an item for \"Who or what has sup-pressed you?\". 2. When you are running something that is common to all thetans – i.e., that all thetans have – then the charge is there, though it could take a little while to run the meter ac-tion into the process. Probably with the rudiments well in most of the standard proc-esses would read anyhow, if you happened to be looking at the meter. Thus, later in the pc's auditing you can check a previously run grade process for read as an indica-tion of whether or not it is flat. An example of how all of this data applies on, say, Grade 0, would be: To run the Process 0-B, you would check the item for read before using it in the blank in the command. But you wouldn't check \"communication\", find no read and then skip Grade Zero on the pc! The Grade Chart is the basic program for any case. To omit whole segments of it because the data in this issue is not fully understood is to deny the pc the awarenesses and regained abilities that are vital to his progress up the Bridge and the attainment of OT. All the processes of a grade are run on the pc until the pc has honestly achieved the end phenomena for that grade. That is how we get a pc up the Bridge to OT. L.

At Level 0 we do not expect or lead people to expect any sudden miracle of physical or mental recovery. Rather, we emphasize that we are getting their feet on the ladder and as they progress up through levels they will achieve all they ever hoped for and more. Jumping to higher levels leaves the lower level disabilities untouched and while trying to audit somebody at, say, Level III, we will find ourselves struggling with things that should have been handled at Level 0. Further, this target is the one that beginning pcs make the most gains on in my experi-ence. I recall one near miracle on a girl who couldn't bring herself to talk to her parents and all I did was get her to tell me what she'd say to them if she could talk to them. Recalling is too steep for a starting pc. They can't recall well really until about Level IV when they can be cleaned up on their ARC Breaks with Life. Here we have the whole design of Level 0: \"Recover the pc's ability to talk to others freely.\" If you realize that a pc can't be in session unless he is willing to talk to his auditor, you will also realize that he can't be in life until he is able to communicate freely with others. Thus any process that does not forward this end is not for Level 0, no matter how fran-tic the case may be to become clear yesterday. The more hysterical a pc is about getting advanced processes or a case gain, the less strenuous the process administered must be. The psychiatrist erred on this one point and it wiped him out as a social benefactor. The more desperate the case, the more desperate were his measures. He was just echoing his patients. It is very important for an auditor to realize this one datum for it is the second guiding rule of Level 0. It is a very senior datum. One must not become desperate and use desperate measures just because the pc is desperate or the fam-ily or society is desperate about the pc. The worse off the pc, the lighter the approach to that pc must be."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   2   HCOB   11.12.64   LEVEL 0 398 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST Psychotics (real, gibbering ones) are below auditing treatment in sessions. The meas-ure used for them should be just rest and isolation from their former environments. And the first process used should be just getting the person to realize you are safe and safe to talk to. So, although a few cases are psychotic, this still holds good. The auditor must get the pc to realize he is safe – won't punish, scold, reprimand or betray confidences – and that the auditor will listen. It doesn't give the auditor a withhold to not speak of another's withholds. One can only withhold what one oneself has done. What the pc did or said isn't even subject for a session on the auditor for withholding it had no aberrative value. Even when we're Class IV, we still start all our pcs at the pc's level, which is, for a be-ginning pc, Level 0. So what we are trying to do with our pcs at Level 0 is the following: 1. Recover the pc's ability to talk to others freely; 2. Teach the pc by example the auditor is safe to talk to and won't scold, reprimand, pun-ish or betray, and 3. Refuse to engage in desperate measures just because the pc is desperate; and therefore get a real, lasting gain for the pc. ROUTINES A routine is a standard process, designed for the best steady gain of the pc at that level. The remedy is different. It is an auditing process which is designed to handle a non-routine situation. The only real remedy at Level 0 is patching up having failed to hear or understand the pc. The rest is all done by routine. The Case Remedies are at Level II and while we all realize that every Level 0 case needs a lot of Level II remedies, we also know that no remedy will work well until the pc is able to talk to others. When you run into trouble at Level 0, there are only 3 reasons possible: 1. The pc was not run in a direction or on a process to improve his or her ability to com-municate to others; 2. The auditor failed to understand the pc's statements, either words or meanings; or 3. The auditor engaged in desperate measures, changed processes, or scolded or did something to lower the pc's feeling of security in the session. That's all. As you go on up through the levels, you will find many other ways a pc can get upset. But at Level 0, the pc is not close enough to reality on his own case to even be touched by these at first. The pc is a long way off when he first starts getting audited. He can only approach his own case by degrees. So a pc, no matter how wildly he or she dramatizes at Level 0, is really only capable of a reality of the smallest kind about self. And such a pc must be able to talk before anything else can happen.

Psychiatrists, failing to grasp it, murdered several million people – so it's no light matter. It's an important one. A pc at Level 0 usually can't even conceive of an overt (a harmful act) done by him-self. When they can, they go religiously guilty and seek to atone or some such thing. Become a monk. Or commit suicide. The reason 331/3 percent of all psycho-analytic patients are said to have committed suicide in their first three months of treatment is not that they \"came too late\" but that a lot of wild data was thrown at them to get at their \"source of guilt\" and they went head on into the reactive bank, sought to demonstrate their \"guilt\" by making others guilty and killing them-selves. You don't want anything out of the pc but an increased ability to talk relaxedly to oth-ers without fear, embarrassment, suspicion or guilt. So all processes at Level 0 are arranged accordingly. WORDINGS To give all possible wordings of routines that will accomplish the above is completely beyond need. Once you have the idea of it straight, you can invent them by the dozens. One doesn't even have to think of a particular pc. All Level 0 processes are good only when they apply to all pcs. ROUTINE 0-0 (ZERO-ZERO) The starting routine is the most basic of all auditing routines. It is simply \"What are you willing to talk to me about?\" Pc answers. \"What would you like to tell me about that?\" At Level II, the first question alone becomes a remedy. Here the two questions make a routine – and a very effective one it is! ROUTINE 0-A This is how the auditor puts together Routine 0-A: 1. Make a list of people or things one can't generally talk to easily! That includes parents, policemen, govemments and God. But it's a far longer list. The auditor must do this. It must never be published as a \"canned\" list. 2. Using any one of the listed items: \"If you could talk to____(listed item) what would you say?\" All right, that's all there is to finding the commands for Routine 0-A."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   4   HCOB   11.12.64   LEVEL 0 400 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST One doesn't get the pc to do the list. The list isn't done in session. The auditor does it himself on his own time. And each auditor must do his own list for his pcs and add to it from time to time as he thinks of new ones. The pc isn't necessarily given any choice of items. The auditor picks one he thinks may fit. That's easy to do after one session. The pc keeps complaining about parents. OK. Run 0-A on parents. And flatten it! By flatten is meant to use that one subject until the pc is darned sure he or she could now talk to the item chosen. If the pc still wants to abuse the item, it isn't flat. If the pc still wants to do something about the item, it is not flat. When the pc is cheerful about the item or no longer fascinated with it, it's flat. Remember, there's no need to find out what the pc can't talk to. In fact, most cases you're better off just to take an item of your own for 0-A and use it. May seem strange, but you'll have a smoother time of it with the pc. Further you'll not restimulate (churn up) the pc's bank so hard. ROUTINE 0-B The second routine consists of things to talk about. One puts the routine together this way: 1. The auditor makes a list (not from the pc but himself) of everything he can think of that is banned for any reason from conversation or is not generally considered accept-able for social communication. This includes non-social subjects like sexual experi-ences, W.C. details, embarrassing experiences, thefts one has done, etc. Things no-body would calmly discuss in mixed company. 2. An item from the list is included in the auditing command, \"What would you be will-ing to tell me about ?\" Add the item you choose. 3. When they have \"run down\" (as in clocks) ask them, \"Who else could you say those things to?\" 4. Rechoose a subject on the list. 5. Repeat 3. 6. Continue to repeat 4. and 5. Above all, don't be critical of the pc. And very calmly hear and seek to understand what the pc said. (You never, by the way, seek to find out why the pc reacted or responded in some way. A real blunder at Level 0 is \"Why did you feel that way?\" Or \"Why do you think you can't say that?\" You're not after the causes of things at Level 0. You will find out why at Level VI!) At Level 0, just keep them talking while you listen. And you use only the subject chosen to keep them talking."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"PROCESSES   5   HCOB   11.12.64   LEVEL 0 401 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST ROUTINE 0-C Routine 0-C is, of course, old R-1-C renamed. It is done without a meter and it has any subject under the sun included in its command. It is elsewhere covered. In all the above routines it is vital not to alter the commands given above. ____________________ There are many more possible routines. But to be a Level Zero Routine it must have as its goal only freeing up the ability of the pc to talk freely to others. This is not a level to be regarded with a brush-off. It takes a lot of skill to restore a pc's ability to communicate freely. When an auditor has that skill he will succeed at all higher levels. When a pc has that skill regained, his world will look to him to be a far, far better place. So it is very important to get over this first hurdle. And very important not to dodge it and try to climb the hill anyway. It will become an awfully steep hill. L.

It is therefore rewrit-ten as follows: The auditor makes a list of things people generally can't talk to easily. That includes parents, policemen, governments and God. But it's a far longer list. The auditor must compile this list himself or herself out of session. It may be added to by the auditor from time to time. It must never be published as a \"canned list\". Scientology Instructors and Scientology Per-sonnel should not be listed on it as it leads to upset in sessions. STEP 1. The auditor chooses one of the subjects off the list and uses it in Steps 2 and 3 below until the pc is comfortable about it. Subjects from the list can be chosen in sequence or at random. A chosen subject is not left until the pc is comfortable about it. By this is meant, the pc would not feel disturbed talking to the subject chosen. The auditor does not ask the pc which subject or if it is all right to choose that subject as the pc at the moment of selection is not likely to feel comfortable about any of the listed subjects and so will just reject. No, the auditor just chooses one and starts on it. STEP 2. The auditor asks, \"If you could talk to______ (chosen subject), what would you talk about?\" Pc answers one or more things at greater or shorter length. STEP 3. When the pc seems satisfied the question has been answered, the auditor then says, \"All right, if you were talking to______ (chosen subject in 1) about that what would you say, exactly?\" The pc is expected to speak as though talking to the subject chosen in l. STEP 4. The auditor notes whether pc is comfortable about the subject chosen in Step 1, yet without asking pc. This is done by noting the voice tone or text of what the pc would"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 0-A (EXPANDED) 2 HCOB 26.12.64 LEVEL 0 404 HUBBARD RECOGNIZED SCIENTOLOGIST say. If it is shy, diffident, or if it is belligerent or annoyed, the same subject is retained for a new go with Steps 2 and 3. If the pc seems bright and cheerful, a new subject is chosen from the list for a working over with Steps 2 and 3. If the subject in 1 is retained, the auditor again does Steps 2 and 3 above over and over until the pc is cheerful. A subject chosen in 1 is not left until the pc really can respond cheerfully. When this is accomplished, a new subject is chosen as Step 1 and the process is continued with Steps 2 and 3 using the new subject. The whole of Routine 0-A is flat when the pc feels far more comfortable about talking to specific items and isn't shying off from items on the list. It is flat, therefore, when an ability is regained on specific items on the list and the list items aren't producing big new changes in the pc's communication ability. LISTEN STYLE CO-AUDIT It is expected that by the time an auditor is permitted to do the Zero Routines, Individ-ual Listen Style will have been entered upon. Until the class seems able to run individual sessions, old \"R-1-C\" can be used by the auditing supervisor on a group basis using Listen Style Co-audit until the group has the idea of sessions. Routines work best on Individual Listen Style. The pc is always wondering, in Listen Style Co-audit, if the auditing supervisor is listening to him personally. The auditor is not the receipt point of the pc's comm in many instances. Old R-1-C is the best training mechanism to get auditors to run sessions. In this proc-ess the auditing supervisor just chooses something for all the pcs to talk to the auditors about, like a dynamic or a common social problem. L.
