1961 (Reissued on 21 June 1967) Remimeo All Staff Tech Hats Qual Hats A message to the Executive Secretaries and all Org Staff QUALITY COUNTS Clearing is now in the reach of every Scientologist. Excellent Auditor training is now in the reach of every Academy. And these are the only things in the long run that will count. When I see an Organization staff panting after newspaper publicity or going mad on the subject of dissemination, and at the same time turning in to me bad results and poor stu-dent quality, I know somebody has their targets mixed up. Quality is the only thing that counts. If quality in training and processing is not given first rank and constant priority by Secretaries or Executive Secretaries, then all the admini-stration in the world will not make the grade for any Central Org. Deliver the goods. That's a crude way to put it. But if you want a new and better civili-zation you won't get it by advertising or worrying what people think of you. You will get it only by releasing and clearing people and sending them out into the society to get the show on the road in all branches of human activity, including Scientology. I know we have been a long time without clearing people. But we're clearing them now. What does it take to clear people? It takes highly skilled and tightly supervised auditing. It takes good technology. It takes good technical application. If you'll forget about how easy it is to mob students all up in a class and actually con-front each student as an individual, make sure he knows every essential step he has to know, make sure all his questions get answered, you'll have auditors that can audit. Will you please put attention on raising technical skill in the HGC, releasing people, clearing people, and on the quality of training in the Academy to the end of getting every stu-dent capable of all the steps necessary to release people. I have made the grade technically in the field of research. Now it's time to drop all the booboo's and nonsense. All you have to do in an Org is release and clear people and turn out auditors who can release people and keep in contact with the public and treat them well and you're over the top."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"QUALITY COUNTS 2 HCO PL 26.5.61 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 2 17.11.12 This morning I received a cable from an Org.

That Org is doing the lousiest job possible in Technical and is all worked up to get publicity. What's this? Do they think a society in this shape will approve Scientology into power? Hell no! And to hell with this society. We're making a new one. So let's skip the approval button from a lot of wogs and settle down to work to make new people and better people. Then maybe you'll have a society. Right here and right now this policy is laid down in concrete with an atomic branding iron: The first and primary goal of an organization is delivering the foremost technical quality that can be delivered in its area. All right. I've made my technical target bang in the bull's eye. You can release and clear. You can train auditors well. Well, Christ! Let's do it, do it, do it! L.

If the pc is being audited in an auditing environment that is unsafe or prone to inter-ruption his or her confront is greatly lowered and the result is a reduced ability to run locks, secondaries and engrams and to erase them. If the auditor's TRs are rough and his manner uncertain or challenging, evaluative or invalidative, the pc's confront is reduced to zero or worse. This comes from a very early set of laws (Original Thesis):  Auditor plus pc is greater than the bank,  Auditor plus bank is greater than the pc,  Pc minus auditor is less than the bank. (By \"bank\" is meant the mental image picture collection of the pc. It comes from com-puter technology where all data is in a \"bank\".) The difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks. The difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherence to procedure, better TRs, more confident manner, and closer observance of the Auditor's Code. No \"bedside manner\" is required or sympathetic expression. It's just that an auditor who knows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence. The pc doesn't have to put his attention on or cope with the auditor and feels safer and so can confront his bank better. L.

Audience: It's the sixteenth August AD 16. So everything is moving up. You know, I think they told me there were about 240 stu-dents on the Clearing Course? There are 240 Clears moving right straight on up the line. And I'm – I have a bit of a problem. I have a bit of a problem with my own clearing. [laughter] I had 24 Clears who were screaming for their OT course and I had to put together the first part of the OT course and I slipped. And at the middle of a session and so forth, why, my TA went to 3 and the needle went loose and then of course I started moving up to check up the bank to find out if anything was there so that I could get started on the OT course and what you did with the bank and there it went. But I will try and get this condition remedied so that I can go out to Qual and go backwards and get checked out. [laughter, laughs – applause] Thank you. I lead a terrible life, actually. [laughter, laughs] I was an umpteenth stage Release with a completely floating needle one night, two or three years ago – about a Grade VI or some-thing like that, and I had time – just time to drink a Coca-Cola before Mary Sue came back and started the overrun. [laughs, laughter] I was a VI Stage Release for one Coca-Cola. [laughs, laughter] What a terrible life. [laughs] But people get to walking on your heels, you know, and you push along. Well anyway, I'm going to give you a lecture today about Releases and Clears. Be-cause the probability is, is maybe nobody's heard it yet. You see? Because we found out that there were some people in the HGC that didn't know that. So if there were some people in the HGC that didn't know it, Lord forbid, why I imagine there's a person or two on the Saint Hill course that doesn't know it. I think that has a probability. And in view of the fact that this data is highly modern data, very, very modernized as data, it probably is to some slight degree new data. We have a very bad problem, as you know, with the subject of releasing. And it is a problem of overrun. And it has gone on for many, many, many years. It's gone on for so long that it practically obliterated all the results of Dianetics and Scientology. And is the direct course of people walking around and saying Dianetics and Scientology doesn't work. Do you follow? It's that serious an error. So it just held us up endlessly. And there were certain phe-nomena which existed that one was not totally familiar with. Now I wasn't totally familiar with it because I wasn't familiar with the entire extent of the bank, how much this bank was,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 2 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 8 17.11.12 how big this bank is, and so forth. And I know that the Queen's Counselor down in Mel-bourne, where they've just had a bad fire – don't imagine that will be their last bad fire – the Queen's Counselor down there said he couldn't accept the idea of past lives because it meant he wouldn't go to heaven. I got news for anything – any man that dishonest, just thinking about heaven is making a mistake. [laughs, laughter] So you run into such phenomena – we knew about those – but how far back did it go? What was the total extent of it? In the early days we knew nothing about things like implanta-tion. There was tremendous quantities of data that was unknown and it was very easy to make this mistake. Now we're not in bad company in making this mistake because about 2500 years ago exactly on this same line of research, the identical mistake was made. The identical mistake was made by Gautama Siddhartha Buddha, no less. And he did not appreciate the existence of a bank at all. And that work does not take into account that there is such a thing as the mind or the bank. That's what's missing out of that larry of work. Now there was another blunder made 10,000 years ago along the line of philosophic research. And there was a chap called Dharma and he was a monk, legendary and so forth. And oddly enough his name today means \"fate.\" In the more esoteric Eastern philosophies and so on, they speak of somebody's dharma. And it gets perverted into karma and so forth. But he is so legendary that his name now means something else. But I think you can still find it recorded. And the mistake there was believing that you had to – you want to know how I know so much about this, well, I'll tell you some day. The mistake there was believing that you didn't have to do anything but become wise. All you had to do was become wise and you would instantly become nine feet tall. Do you see? Now it's from Dharma that you get the tradition which most philosophers follow which is that, if you became wise you would become free. Now, there's almost – anybody there is around is grooved in to that basic philosophy. That is part of the woof and warp (rug terms, that's how you fix up a rug, don't want to give you any misunderstood words) – the – it's in the woof and warp of the entire culture, that you become wise, you become free. And that's been going on for 10,000 years on this planet. Started by Dharma. Now that work has been totally assimilated. Now that one can exteriorize and that ex-teriorization brings about freedom, is the premise of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha and that's only 2500 years ago. They've got 7500 years yet to go before they assimilate that into the cul-ture the way the philosophy of Dharma was. Which means, you poor bloke, that you've got about 10,000 less sixteen years to go before Scientology is totally assimilated as the basic thing called philosophy or culture, see. So don't feel that you're going to catch up to this very rapidly if it took Dharma 10,000 years to get the point across that if you become wise you became free. And if people still don't know about exteriorization 2500 years after the most popular and most numerous religion on the planet, Buddhism. You've got 7500 years to go, so sit it out, you know? [laughter, laughs] We're slightly ahead of our time. In other zones of the universe the existence of the mind was known. And in the – I hate to have to bring these data out because lawyers, when they listen to these tapes, in order"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 3 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 9 17.11.12 to condemn us you see, say, of course this is terrible to say things like this, but I just hate to be on a withhold all the time. Anyway, in other parts of the universe in the Galactic Confederation they have a psy-chotherapy which consists of a recognition of the fact that at a moment of fatal accident to a thetan a picture was made. They know that that is, but they don't really think it is a picture. They think it is a location. And they take a picture of the location where he was injured and communicate to him in his unconscious state by snapping together a thing that looks like a movie clapboard. You see, they take this picture of the location and then they slap this movie clapboard in front of it, and the thetan is supposed to do something to – by shock or some-thing – to his concept of that location as an injurious location, and so, in some way, blow the consequences of his injury. That is a – that is a therapy, by the way, that is administered to the releases in that so-ciety which go as OTs, OT releases. And now that is their psychotherapy. And that comes as close to anything we're doing as anything else I know of in the universe. Of course there are many things could go on in the universe that I don't know anything about. There's lots of things that could happen that one wouldn't have any trace of; naturally. But knowledge has a tendency to get around and you'll find out that if one being in one quarter of the universe is advancing along some certain premise, why, you will find out that it tends to advance in other parts of the universe. I don't know – but I don't think Scientology will be contained very long on this planet. I don't think it will be contained on this planet even this decade, see? It'll be that – that swift. So anyway, these were new thoughts particularly for this very backward and barbaric planet. They – if you don't think things were barbarous you should have had something to do (and maybe you did) with India of 10,000 years ago. There was no slightest vestige of civili-zation. It was really wild and howling amongst the wogs as they leaped up and down, you know. And to get a point across that if you became wise you somehow became a bit supe-rior – that was a hard one to do. So that was a terrific advance. It's almost like trying to teach animals or something, you know? You can't even talk their language. So that was a big jump. And eventually, practically everybody on the planet agrees with that. We have now some fantastic percentage of the taxation of this planet (well, that's what's left over from military appropriations) is devoted to education. The scarcity of univer-sities here in England now is represented by the fact that one university which can accept 850 students this next term has 10,000 applications. And it is a college of which I have never heard. So you can imagine what some of the more popular ones have in terms of numbers. Well, there's this terrific demand for education or self-improvement. Now that – you might not look at it first, you see, because it seems so banal, so commonplace to you. But the fact that man at this time is actually willing to invest time, effort and money in the subject of making people wiser so as to make them freer is a great testimony to this fellow Dharma. Took him 10,000 years to get one point across. All right. That was almost the totality of it. There were other ramifications such as one could get free enough to ascend to a very superior station, you know, like heaven or some-thing, you know? There was connotation with regard to that, but that wasn't directly attribut-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 4 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 10 17.11.12 able to Dharma but by fellows who interpreted him afterwards. He knew – you knew that you could become a free individual. In other words, there was a freedom, which was attainable. But no technology at all. Now 7500 years after that Gautama Siddhartha Buddha discovered exteriorization, and of course the term \"Buddha\" comes from the bodhi tree since it was under a bodhi tree that he first exteriorized. Now he thought you exteriorized by becoming wise, following in the pat-tern of Dharma. Now that religion has gone now into the majority of the areas of Asia and did itself really civilize three-quarters of Asia. That wasn't much information but he introduced several ideas along with it. And one was, that you should be civilized. A shocker, nobody ever heard of that before, you see, just be polite and so forth, you know? Very novel ideas. Well, man has not yet accepted the idea that he should be polite, but he's getting there. In some areas of the world they have overdone it a bit. So as they cut each other's livers out they say, \"I withhold my foul breath from your face,\" you see? [laughs] So, this action of exteriorization was not in actual fact doable to any great degree. The lama – the lamaists came along afterwards and tried to develop some sort of a technology and an explanation for all of this and so forth, and you get squirrel Buddhism which is Lamaism. That's right, that's all it is. And what Buddha didn't cook up they thought they could. And of course they were moving into a zone where there was plenty to be found out. But the big strike had been made by Buddha, which is that somebody can exteriorize. Now of course we are then gainers to the degree that there is some longevity to the idea of the soul, that there is such a thing as a soul. This has some longevity, a lot of people accept this. Where it goes, what it does, what it consists of, they haven't a clue. But that there is something called a soul which goes someplace has actually dominated Greek, Roman thought for a very long period of time now, it's about 2000 years or something like that. It also dominates various portions of Africa and the Middle East under another prophet's name and so on. But it is the same – the same channel of thought that there is such a thing called a soul. Socrates is the primary originator of this in this – he's the primary forwarder of the idea in our present philosophic history. He said there was such a thing as a demon, and so forth. You see, if you're not in Greece you'd never know the story of Socrates. You only get told the story of Socrates in Greece, you don't read it out of philosophic textbooks. Quite in-teresting because there's a sort of a verbal tradition, vocal tradition, in Greece concerning Soc-rates which never gets into the philosophic textbooks. So of course the thing which I have added is that a philosopher should know something about life. That's so novel that it has prac-tically never been done before. Now, Socrates was holding forth for the existence of a personal being, or as we would say, thetan. And the religious ah, bigots, ah, bums, ah, tramp – ah, the religious hierarchy, excuse me, I was looking for that word! Having an awful time there – they disagreed with this. And they disagreed with this so thoroughly that they slipped him the hemlock. And he was so henpecked at home that they couldn't even get him to escape from jail. He went ahead"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 5 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 11 17.11.12 and drank the hemlock just to make them good and guilty. And he made them guilty, man, they still preserve his jail. But then some time later, sometime later the Nicene Creed was developed which we now have in the form of the Dead Sea Scrolls and which was then put forward about a hun-dred years after its original development by Jesus of Nazareth. Now he – this church is having an awful embarrassing time with that. But I don't see why they should have an embarrassing time of it. So the guy was a powerhouse and he had a philosophy which had already [been] kicking around and so forth, that was pretty good. But they have to acknowledge the existence of the Dead Sea Scrolls, don't you see? And they date one hundred years before Christ and they contain the New Testament. You did-n't know about that? There are some pocketbooks out on it and you should read them, it's very funny. And the Arabs get ahold of these things, there are lots of them, they find them all over the place now if they know where to look. And the Arabs get hold of them because they can get something like five pounds for a little centimeter square scrap of one of these scrolls. They tear 'em all up! [laughter] And then some high muckymuck, some super-sultan potentate-God-help-us, he fig-ured out he was going to make a real – real grab out of it, so he, by force and other means, managed to collect a tremendous collection of these bits. And he unfortunately let them be copied photographically and so he was never able to sell his collection. He's still got it. But these Dead Sea Scrolls are a terrific embarrassment to the Christian church at this particular time. I don't see why they should be. But they are. And all of this is simply the ad-vance of Buddhism as an idea into Western culture. And it's easily traceable. There's even the tradition of Christ having studied in the East, you know. Where did he disappear to for thirty years or whatever it was? You know, there's a lot of these traditions. And this doesn't make less out of some fellow who went through all that, you know? But it was pushing wisdom into the West. And the West has been very, very hard to push wisdom into. The early monks of Christianity tried to push wisdom into these areas up here. And over there in Scandahoovia – Scandinavia – I didn't mean to use it as a verb – and into Ire-land, into these chilly northern climes. And they uniformly were spitted on stakes and chewed up and so forth. The monks would come in and they would say that they were going to cure them up with some relics and so forth. They were healers basically – and they moved in and they were going to help the community and so forth. And the answer was to skin them alive or something – or other delicate process. So, trying to push – well, the way paganism fought against the basic ideas of Christi-anity and so forth is a very gory chapter. And the way the Christians then fought against the non-Christians during the days of the Spanish Inquisition is also gory. But by that time they'd lost most of the philosophy. Man had a soul, it was over there, and it belonged to God and he was nothing. And they had things pretty well scrambled up. By the time Buddhism had been transported, in other words, from India through the Middle East to Greece, to Spain, to Scan-dinavia, to Ireland or the North Pole or something, it was almost an unrecognizable idea. Now, just giving you the scouted background history of this thing. Now the most that was ever achieved by any of these was a type of Release. And since the beginning of the uni-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 6 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 12 17.11.12 verse, so far as we know; there has never been anything but a Release. There has never been a Clear. There has never been a cleared anything. So that these are all forms of release. Dharma is release by wisdom. Buddhism: that was release by exteriorization. Christi-anity: release by repentance and being good. And you have in actual fact then, the total back-ground history – if you want to read about these chaps and know more about these chaps, in fact it might make good fun. But it's those things which are there to understand in the light of what we're doing today. There are no more complexions or complexities than that to understand about these. I would be accused by any scholar of these works of considerable oversimplification but I could answer from the very interesting height of saying, yes, it took twenty years to make a bodhi but we can make one in about twenty seconds. And we can, at a far higher percentage. It is so easy to do, it is totally neglected. We don't even do it. There's a point on this gradation scale somewhere which should contain thetan exterior or bodhi. He could be almost anyplace. But we, in actual sober fact, let it happen. If it's going to happen we let it happen. And it could happen at 0 , I, II, III, IV, V, VI – it could happen in any of these areas. And that it almost immediately unhappens – does not then qualify it as a stable release. It isn't a good lasting state. As a matter of fact, after you've done it to somebody two or three times he becomes very anxious, he thinks you're going to cost him his body or something of the sort. You can pop him out of his head and after you've done it two or three times he begins to tell you that he isn't. And he wants nothing more really to do with this because he thinks you're going to foul him up. And he becomes anxious about holding on to the body. People have a bad ex-perience – after you've made somebody a Theta Release. You've just banged somebody out of their head. They're no longer in their body, that's all. The psychiatrist looks on this with the greatest of askance because he occasionally in institutions finds as an inverse, or an inverted exteriorization: a fellow who cannot get into his body and is going frantic. And therefore he thinks anything in connection with exteriorization is insanity, but then of course he's branding three-quarters of Asia insane. But then naturally he is insufficiently cultured to know anything about Asia, so – that would be it. Now, this state of thetan exterior occurs. And it just occurs, and it can occur almost any time and anybody processing anybody sooner or later is going to get a thetan exterior on his hands. And what you do about it is shut up. You say: \"Well, that's it\" and you knock it off. It's the same as a floating needle. It's a visual manifestation which is different than what oc-curs with a floating needle. They're not the same thing at all. But it's something you do not go beyond. You don't go beyond a floating needle on a pc on the meter, and you do not go be-yond an exterior state. Don't say one more command or order of that level on which you are working or whatever you are working on. Shut up! Because if you go on any distance at all you will walk him right straight back into his bank and he will be very cross and justifiably so. Because you've unreleased him. Now after you've made one of these fellows, you will find out that within the hour, three days, a week he will have tangled up with more reality than he is prepared to confront in his somewhat tremulous uncleared state. He's just a Release, you see. And he's been asked to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 7 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 13 17.11.12 walk in this big broad world barefooted and he's still got the anxiety and problem holding on to his body, he doesn't know quite what to do about this. He's afraid he'll forget his body. On the past track it's happened to him before many times. Because you see, it happens to him every time he dies and is associated in his mind with death. And he's had unfortunate experi-ences when he could do it at will somewhere way back on the track, leaving his body in the inn to pop off and do something of the sort and then coming back and find out they'd buried the body. You see, and he's lost his body and his possessions and so forth and he didn't like that. It has very sour connotations with it because he is not competent to cope with the state at all. He's way in advance of himself. He's in actual fact on a harmonic of OT. An OT could care for it. He can't care for it down here when he is a Dianetic Release. And maybe not even that, you know? And, I'll give you an actual, typical experiences and so on. I'm not making nothing out of Buddha, this was a considerable advance, this was something very remarkable indeed. And, it must have been remarkable if Socrates copied it. And then it became traditional there-after, which it did. You'll find, by the way, there are some here and there, there are some primitive races who believe man has a soul. But, scattered pieces of stuff; it's a piece of truth that isn't easily camouflaged. But for it to actually be worked on or admitted or something could be done about it, something like that, in a culture, was quite new. So Buddha, when he exteriorized people and when he brought about exteriorization, he brought it about through wisdom so the fellow had some kind of a philosophy at least to back him up. But as far as we're concerned in Scientology, there is one little string of words that, you take almost any human being out here anyplace and set him down in a chair, get him in some quiet place and say this little string of words to him and it's going to happen. In a large percentage of cases it's going to happen. Sixty, seventy, eighty percent some such per-centage. He's going to exteriorize, man. And a certain number of them are going to exteriorize, be total, total reality, looking around, you know? And a certain number of them are going to be totally real outside the sec-ond they come back inside they say it's unreal and didn't happen. Scared, see? And a certain percentage of them will go out and back in without knowing anything ever happened, except weirdly enough, a total change of personality takes place in front of your face. And you find this amongst the insane. There was so much about the insane the psychiatrist could have known about and could know about today if he'd care to listen. I have – I've had an insane person sitting in front of me – not a psychiatrist, necessarily – I've had an insane person sitting in front of me and I've said the magic words. Had the person go totally sane, backed out there to several feet back of their head; totally sane, able to reason, solve their problem, set it all up, all squared around, very happy to talk to me about it, totally rational. And then back in: insane. But not quite as crazy. This is remarkable. Well, there is one notable Scientologist in New York who said it over the air to several million people one time. I often wondered what really happened when he did that. That pro-gram since then has been very friendly to Scientology, it's an all-night program, \"Long John.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 8 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 14 17.11.12 But, here is a piece of technology which simply forces what is going to happen natu-rally sooner or later. And you don't have to know trick ways to exteriorize somebody, you see. I'll give you the magic words, you might as well put them on tape, put it on record someplace or another. It's \"Try not to be three feet back of your head.\" Man is on such an inversion on the subject that he goes clang! Now, the road of philosophy has been very, very difficult and it has taken a long time for a basic philosophic idea to manifest itself in the society in which it has been expressed. What's particularly notable about Buddhism is that it was such clear-cut truth that he ad-vanced, that it spread like wildfire within his lifetime. And in the few succeeding lifetimes, a very short period of time, he had almost, well he had about three-quarters of Asia right there – bang! For instance, he brought the first civil... his people brought the first civilization to Ja-pan. And those were within living memory of Buddha. And that is an awful long ways for that – modes of travel of that day from Northern India. Japan is quite a far cry. They brought the first shreds of culture to Japan. They brought writing and to this day the Japanese use Chinese writing pronounced with a Japanese vocabulary. And that was brought to them by the first Buddhist monks who came there. But those fellows were very industrious and they got it fast. But they had moved from a state of \"man is meat\" to \"he is a spiritual being\" and they had manifestations of this, and they had a rather powerful leader and there it went. Now this is and can be considered only, a sort of a state of release through wisdom, because they didn't have any command to tell anybody to back out of his head. The fellow would simply become wise and they find out that when he became wise enough he would exteriorize, they hoped. They had a lot of failures along this line. It's very difficult to do this because it's booby-trapped by the bank. Now in one fell swoop with no pause for breath, we have capitalized upon the idea that a man who is improved becomes free. We have brought about a twenty-year effort to ex-teriorize down to a point where it can be done in about twenty seconds. We have found what prevented the efforts of Dharma from being perfect; we have found the totality of what barri-ered Buddhism. Here we are in a society which in actual fact is only bolstered in its culture by Dharma and Buddha, with the problem wrapped up. Now don't be amazed that you're having trouble carrying the word. Don't be amazed at all because the fate of missionaries and so forth carrying the word that there is a – man is a spiritual being and that sort of thing, has been rather grim. But notice that the missionary was many vias departed from the truth. Notice this. Notice that he had some bank connected with his action, very thoroughly. It wasn't very clean truth. It's not a condemnation of Christianity. Anybody Clear knows what I am talking about. They went around – they went around telling people they had to do this and do that and the other thing and they were using bank words. Now these chaps didn't have a sufficiently pure version of it to do more than take over the society. That is about the limitation of it. They have civilized it to a very, very marked extent. They've done a terrific job of it and so on. But to bring a society up that is no more"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 9 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 15 17.11.12 cultured than this one – and as far as man's treatment of man is concerned, this culture is about as high as a cat fight. It is a scientific barbarism, I assure you. Now the reason they didn't get any further than that is they were a little bit too far from the truth. There were too many vias, you see? There was the via of Buddhism to Socra-tes, to Christianity, to organized Christianity, to the various arguments of Christianity to – you see? And they were weak to that degree. Now compare this, compare this with the Bud-dhist spread within living memory, three-quarters of Asia. Very fast. But he was close to home on the subject of Dharma. You see, he was capitalizing on Dharma, that wisdom would make you free. This carries with it some interesting implications. It carries with it the implication that there is a possibility to be free. You see that itself is a terribly hard thing to teach men. But Asia knew it. Asia already had then a spiritualism and a religious background. And he capital-ized on that and three-quarters of it – zoom, bang! Three-quarters of Asia. That's on exterior-ization, which is an incidental, but the final result of, Scientology. Now perhaps the speech in which all this was given was a little more flowery, perhaps there was wisdom, perhaps a lot of things. But the truth of the general situation is that no mat-ter how information is conveyed, if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root. So I don't look for you to go for the next 10,000 years before Scientology bites, you see, I don't look for you to have to wait that long. I would say that the largest scope possible one could imagine for this particular society and so on, basing it on other things and not giv-ing anybody any pats on the back including me, the absolute outside will be something on the order of half a century. You see if Buddhism could go that far in that span of – short span of time, on the lim-ited result producible by Buddhism and the rather barbaric atmosphere in which Buddhism was spread – was actually a little more barbaric than the atmosphere in which we exist today. And I would say that if you take a half a century to get Scientology around, you're really slow, man. You notice I said \"you.\" Now, what are you then attempting and what are you achieving with a being? You're capitalizing, in the first place – as you first address this being – you're capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being. That's important for you to recognize. Because you will very often get a terrible shock that in your inability to communicate any part of Scientology, recognize what you're communicating up against. It was like – it was like a Scientologist we had down in Central Africa. The govern-ment was engaging on some groundnut program or something of the sort – it was another wisdom. But they were teaching soil erosion to the African. A Scientologist went in on the project. They were in despair. They couldn't teach the African to, you know, prevent his soil from eroding. They thought that was – terrible. And a Scientologist went in on it and he found out what they weren't teaching him, they weren't teaching him the basic fact that soil should be preserved. As soon as they started utilizing that as an idea, why then the program made some progress. Well, you're going to walk into people who have not heard the teaching of Dharma."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 10 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 16 17.11.12 Now of course you're going to walk into everybody you meet practically and they never heard of Dharma. But somehow or other, the wisdom of Dharma has not come up through the line. You run into them every once in awhile. \"Well, what do you want to teach the people for?\" There's one zone where there's a horrible revolution going on right at the moment, it's not a battle, it's just an underground cat fight going on in the middle of South America. Where the ricos in that immediate area who have been used to hiring the peasants for nothing and letting them live and die like pigs, you see, that these ricos have been walked in on sideways by the philosophy of Dharma. And it came from someplace and the peasants all of a sudden have got the idea that they ought to become educated so they could become free. And all hell is breaking loose because the ricos are trying to keep them from learning anything now and their economy is all going to pot, and they're going through the entire con-vulsion that old Yea-and-Nay Plantagenet went through in his days and so forth when the monks would get around and make certain people into clerks and this was not really thought well of amongst the feudal barony. God knows what would happen if, and it sure as hell happened and fast, the philoso-phy of Dharma got to them and there sat King John signing his name on the Magna Carta. That is direct – direct dissemination of that information. It's interesting, it's – that one piece of philosophy: You become educated, you'll become free. The church had come in here, they had educated people to read and write. They had introduced manuscripts – you couldn't say they had introduced books – and they'd been chipping around at the edges here for some time. And all of a sudden, why, not only had people become more educated but people became free. We have an example of it, a horrible backfire of this in 1936 in the Spanish Revolu-tion. Now the Spanish Revolution was really begun by the philosophy of Dharma. You say, oh heavens, how can you possibly connect those up? Very easy. The paperback was imported into Spain in the decade previous to that revolution for the first time. And cheap literature and the translations of the works of all the great French and English writers had occurred in Spain. And up to that time there was the ricos and the pobres, the rich and the poor, and there wasn't any other strata of society. And as soon as the poor started assimilating and were able actually to buy books out of their pay, you see before – never before could they do this, before sometime in the twen-ties. And they could actually buy books. And they started reading Balzac and they started reading Spinoza and – and where were these fellows, you know? And they said: \"We know something, we should now become free.\" They instantly: boom! And that was mostly because they had considerable resistance to their freedom. That's the philosophy of Dharma, see? That's a – that's a fact. You notice that it is a fact? Well, that was Dharma's discovery. Now, where you are going to fail is that somebody doesn't know soil should be pre-served. They don't know that wisdom sets anybody free and of course when you're dealing with a somewhat fascistic governmental hierarchy, the last thing in the world they want is a free people or an educated people. And when you see education being skimped and frowned upon and so forth then you know what type of a government you're dealing with. It's a gov-ernment which has not yet reached the state where it has heard of Dharma. Or it's suspicious,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 11 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 17 17.11.12 having maybe heard of it, it's a suspicious that the phenomenon will occur and people will become freer. They don't want anything to do with this. They don't want anything to do with the philosophy and they are suppressive to the philosophy of Dharma, that people should be-come wise and therefore can become free. Now, you're just cutting in too high. Now you're talking, in the main here in the West, to a Christian people who have heard of the soul but unfortunately it is an owned commodity that one should not play with. And when they speak of \"their soul\" they are not speaking of themselves. And therefore there's a bit of counter-philosophy to the situation. But these are the points you have to solve. They are stunned at the idea that somebody could exteriorize, so they are really not up to Buddha. They have gone past Dharma but have not arrived at Bud-dha, and it is to those people that you are teaching Scientology. So you have to be careful not to go in over their heads. Now fortunately, fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of Release. And when you talk to them about exterior-ization, you're actually talking to them about something that doesn't make any sense to them on the subject of OT. Now you mustn't talk to them about OT. Now you can talk to them about Clear. They understand Clear, although they don't know anything about Clear. That's a very peculiar thing. But they understand that a fellow does not have barriers to his thinking. They understand that and they think that would be great. So all you have to do is teach them that man shouldn't have barriers to his freedom in the form of his mind and that technology exists to move him up from that. But do you know there are so many undercuts to that that you could teach him, many undercuts. And the first one actually, it isn't factual that Dianetics is the first undercut, the public will accept Dianetics, but it's a relatively enlightened public that would accept Dianet-ics. Dianetic processing actually belongs below Zero. And the old Dianetic co-auditor type rating and the Hubbard Dianetic Auditor actually belong below the – what we now call a Hubbard Recognized Scientologist. And the degree is by the way, being revived just for that purpose. But you're already talking at a very enlightened level. The levels of Scientology will be more easily assimilated by the public at large if we speak of Grade 0 as a recognition – ah, pardon me – a communication process, a communica-tion, a Communication Release. Just to put that a little more distinct. They can get the idea that it'd be perfectly all right to have somebody communicate better. Now that's easily ex-pressed. And he's released from an inability to communicate. Now they immediately want you to apply that to stammerers and backwards children and people who can't talk and so forth, and this gives you some difficulty because they them-selves are standing there, about as tongue-tied with noncommunication as they can get, telling you that would be fine for backward children and stammerers or something. And you're not quite up to that, don't you see. A man could communicate more freely. Now our next level here, Level I, they could understand that man does better if he doesn't have problems, perhaps they could understand that. And so you could go on up the line and there's a high probability there of the – of making a communication or a connection with the situation. Comprehension, trying to get people to comprehend what you're talking about. But I stress to you again the fact that wisdom brought about freedom is the basic idea"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 12 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 18 17.11.12 on this chain. Now do you see what I am getting at? Now that releases a man from imprison-ment by ignorance. And that is your first form of Release. You teach a person that if he learns something he would be freer. And when he has learned that he is then released from the idea that he can't know. So that is really your earliest stage of release. And I would thoroughly advise your trying to argue with people on the basis of the first premise which is that of Dharma and which is the direct and immediate ancestor of Scientology. You see? There's your fundamental. Now of course you couldn't tell a fellow named Smitty1 that he ought to teach all of his Africans population anything because he would instantly sense something would be very wrong with all this, and he would start to feel very hunted. He would be – feel hunted in the extreme. And so we find in that country there is no free education anywhere – anywhere. It is all very expensive. There is one little school, it has two hundred and some children in it, most of them Africans and it's taught by an American named Howitz down there and they've even had him up before the high court for daring to teach Africans for nothing, you see. So they dimly feel that there might be such an idea that wisdom makes one free. But if that idea exists they're agin [against] it, do you see? They don't want anything to do with that idea, not even the idea of it. So that is your first level of Release that is meaningful to you. Now of course there is a lower level of Release that if you're going to work with animals or something like that, you're going to find out that there's a lower level of Release. It is simply getting the idea it's a sort of a lower harmonic of a Communication Release; it is simply getting the idea that one animal could in actual fact express an idea to another animal. And I dare say you're going to find some races at some time or another someplace who do not yet have that idea. So that would be a lower level of Release. But it isn't common now so I'm neglecting it. Now you have to know you're in something before you can get out of it and that is the main difficulty in communicating levels of Release. That's – it's very interesting, I mean you do, you have to know you're in something before you can get out of it. And people are not aware of the mind. They see another bloke, they don't see any mind. The psychiatrist goes scratching his ribs up to the person and cuts out a big section of his skull and sees a brain. So he says there is no such thing as a mind. He does, he says this – bang! Because all he can see is a brain. Well, the brain is just a neural shock absorber; it has very little to do with thinking. The number of maps I have seen of the various things which are found in various parts of the brain are only amusing by their numerousness, because they're all different. The way the research was done originally was silly. They took wounded soldiers who had lost certain portions of their faculties or expressions and so on, and found out where the head wound was and then, you know, one case at a time, just one case for each thing, you see? If they were shot in the left side of the head then they would say, well, speech is con-tained in the left side of the brain, you see, because the fellow was wounded there and he couldn't talk. I know a lot of fellows who've simply been kicked in the pants that can't talk.

And that is that a person can become a Release or become more free or become re-leased from some of his travail on the idea of becoming wiser. Now that's why you find phi-losophy is such an agreeable statement to people, when you try to – try to tell them about Sci-entology as a philosophy. Because you're simply telling them of the philosophy of Dharma. Now your next level of Release that was acceptable to the world at large – that man is a spiritual being. Now that is in decay. That has been known and has been suppressed, and has been suppressed since 1879, Professor Wundt, Leipzig, Germany. I always like to re-member the man's name. Man was an animal and he was nothing but an animal and therefore it was all right to kill him, maim him, shoot him, do anything you possibly could to him be-cause he was \"Nyaa, no good,\" see? Now this is something like some of the Christian phi-losophy that was advanced in the second or third century A.D., that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly all right to kill him, maim him, harm him, do anything you wanted to. Do you see these things as justifications? Justifications for overts, no more than that. So you have the entire, what is laughingly called \"field of philosophy\" – it is a field, too, out there in the rain, man. You have what is laughingly called a field of philosophy em-bracing now uniformly, the idea that they're dealing with rats or something. Well, they're not going to make very much progress and they could get themselves into one awful bloody revo-lution. I'm not using that as a swear word, I mean a bleeding revolution. They could, they could be cut down in the streets, man. Because the Christian has not yet found out that the psychologist is an atheist. And there is atheism being taught right in the colleges and there's a bunch of bigoted Christians going to find out about that someday and they're going to get mad. Fortunately for psych... for psychology it is such an inarticulate subject that it hasn't made itself sufficiently plain to be understood that it's an atheistic subject. But if your psychologist were ever to succeed he would have to come closer to the truth than the brain is all that is there, and a man is dead forever. Because it's very unpopular, very unpopular. But suppressives would like it, and so psychology, psychiatry and things like that tend to be supported by governments rather than by the populace. The populace think anything is better. They think psychology is silly. But governments employ it. So you see suppressives employ these nontruthful subjects or subjects which prevent philosophic ad-vances, or subjects which prevent releasing. So your actual – you'd be surprised how far you could go just doing this – you actually could move in to the whole subject on the subject convincing somebody that man was a spiri-tual being. See, he's already halfway agreed with it. \"Well, you're a Christian, aren't you?\" \"Oh yes, yes, yes.\" You know he knows better than to say he's not a Christian. He gets an auto-da-fé. Well, you find even in Christianity – you know the whole subject of reincarnation was barred very recently by the Roman Catholic Church – very recently. Only in the last few hun-dred years. They carried reincarnation right along with them, pockety-pock. They said the guy who hadn't been good enough had to come back and live it all over again. And somehow or"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 14 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 20 17.11.12 another they dropped that, they had an edict of Scrantes? Or something, I don't know, some stupid edict by which they abolished wisdom. Now, therefore that man is a spiritual being and not an animal – you could become very involved with as an argument – but if somebody bought the idea, if somebody bought the idea that he was a spiritual being rather than an animal, you have then got a state of Release. He's released from an untruth that could trap him. Now very possibly – very possibly, this is where you could use exteriorization, but I do not advise it. What's useful at this point is Dianetics. Because a person goes rapidly back, but it's a little bit ahead of itself; don't you see? There isn't a perfect answer to this. Ah, a guy goes back and only runs so many engrams and there he is sitting on the parapets of the castle, you know, watching the enemy march across the plain. And he says, what am I doing here, this is obviously me. And he makes it up out of his own head that he must be an immortal being because he has lived before quite obviously. Dianetics will bring people up to that point. But, this is a release from this lifetime. A person is released from the very narrow span of just one lifetime. And that is a terrific release because the death of – the terrible consequences of death fall away, he stands around and laughs as the funerals go by, you know. I mean, I remember a long time ago I was – I had to pull off the road – I had to pull off the road down in Arizona to let a funeral go by. And boy, people's eyes were streaming so that it looked like rain falling out behind that funeral. And boy, everybody was real sad. And I sat there and watched this, you know. And I just got through gauging on some researches into the immortal nature of man, you know. But it suddenly looked so silly to me that I sat there and laughed like a fool for about ten minutes. I couldn't get the car going again, I didn't dare drive. It just suddenly seemed so funny. All of this action with regard to this one thing, you see, such a production. And of course it was a very big funeral and a very sad one for a banker. Of course they... I knew he'd never get to heaven. I know he would be back there stirring it up again. Anyhow, you, in that fashion would take people out of the one-lifetime idea. And that is your – a tremendous breakthrough that is available to you because it's a release from the idea of one lifetime. There is a breakthrough for concentration which is quite acceptable to the society in which we exist. Now people do know, fortunately, there is such a thing as a mind. They've been told there is such a thing as a mind and they haven't been taught well enough to know the psy-chologist is defining the \"brain\" as the mind. So you catch the philosophy which has been put forward to them that men have minds and things go wrong with their minds, that there are mental things about existence, and just redefine it before it takes root. You see? What they mean they're putting forward this philosophy, is that people have brains which get their neu-rons crossed and you give them biochemical and electrostimuli of some kind or another or surgical stuff; why, you can do something with this brain mass, you see. Well, you move in, just move in ahead of this and you say, \"The mind, well, yes, they're speaking of mental image pictures.\" \"What?\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 15 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 21 17.11.12 \"Well, have you ever had a picture?\" Now you see, A looking at B never sees B's mind. So it doesn't come through to him that B has a mind. See, if he's very, very wog, why he thinks B only has a brain, see, that's getting pretty wog. Now the only thing you have to put across is that because this fellow has a mind, that fellow has a mind. That's just a different new observation. Now right on the heels of that will follow that he's immortal. With a little Dianetic auditing he can't help but find it out. Do you see? Now you've released him from the idea that man is matter. You've released him from the idea that he only has one life, and these are stages of Release. Now when you're teaching people realize that you are working in the field of releasing people. Realize that. That you can in actual fact, by talking to people, release them. But you start crawling up the line here very far and you're going to run into far more mass – mental mass – than you can easily talk them out of. By the time you get to here, skip it. By the time you get to VI, it would be fatal to try to talk them out of it, and if you tried to talk them out at Class – well that's, that's not... All you've got to do is pass a despatch with VII materials on it through the lines and you have, \"Where's Janie?\" \"Oh, she's in the hospital.\" \"What happened to her?\" \"She came down with appendicitis yesterday.\" \"Well, what happened?\" That's right, I'm not kidding. I... there's too much – too much horsepower. Now, the funny part of it is, there's technology up here that the Clear doesn't notice. A lot of Clears go suddenly, \"What? What's this?\" Interest! [laughter] But you should recognize that an ultimate in Release would be a Release from the universe. True. You say, who's going to fool around with the things that makes the universe. Is somebody going to fool around with what's making the universe, and so forth, somebody's going to fool around? You'll be glad to know that we have now got a policy letter out which forbids destructive actions – [laughter, applause] you see. So you see you can very rapidly go outside of people's head. What they did in Mel-bourne during that inquiry down there – this guy Peter Williams just cons... insisted on spin-ning people with past lives. He just – all he would talk about was – was Grade V stuff you see, all the way up the line and he'd let them get no subjective reality on it, and it spun them. That was what upset that whole thing. He wouldn't follow any order I gave him. He's had himself a ball. Now, recognize then, that when we use the word \"release\" we mean freeing. Now we can free somebody of an idea which enslaves him or entraps him. And recognize that all traps are basically ideas. And if a man can be talked or per-suaded out of a certain idea you have freed him to that extent. So the word release is best un-derstood on the basis of freeing somebody from something. Now as we progress from Grade 0 up – see, I've already shown you there are many grades of Release below zero. We are now getting extremely sophisticated when we get to Grade 0. This is a very sophisticated level of Release. We are actually starting to free him from his self-manufactured trap called a mind. And we're starting to free him directly and intimately as a spiritual being. And we're working on it right at that point just as surely as though we're digging a ditch. And we release him from ideas that he can't communicate and we make a Communications Release."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 16 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 22 17.11.12 Now the funny part of it is, to do that we've got to actually pull him out of a little bit of mass that he is in that tells him he can't communicate. Do you see? So from here on we're not only pulling him out of ideas but we're also starting to pull him out of his own mental mass. Now at this level, Class VII, we don't pull him out of any more mental mass. We turn around and eat the tiger. We eradicate mental mass. Erase it. Now that of course is again a form of Release that we call Clear; it means he's cleared the being of his reactive mind. But we note he's still in the universe. He's still associated with a body, he's still in the universe and still this and still that. In other words, there are some grades of Release above this. But in actual fact that is such a triumphant level for a man to attain that you find not many people below it look any higher. It's quite adequate, it's big. It's quite absolute – very nearly absolute. Now when you see on this meter, this needle somewhere between 1.9 and 3.25, we will allow for the slight vagaries of your setting the trim knob, [laughter] and you see this needle get floppy and it's a little bit hard to set this for a moment – SHUT UP! [laughter] Be-cause you released him from something. Now of course you probably have to know why, to get him through Qual. [laughter, applause] That is really too bad. But you would best do it from your auditing notes not from the pc. Now accidentally anywhere from the moment that the guy hears about the fact that wisdom will make him free on up to some idea that he is a spiritual being, on up through to a Grade 0 or a I or a II or somewhere up the line, the guy at any time may blow out of his skull. You may even find somebody that isn't in one. He's very surprised why other people are in their heads. Horrors! I've actually run into one or two. You'll actually run into this thing called an exteriorization. Now that is a relatively premature manifestation which will remain very unstable. Now most states of Release have a certain degree of stability and those which we have listed and those that I'm talking to you about have stability of a sort. Of a sort. The guy's ideas get invalidated, he gets invalidated that he's a spiritual being, somebody chops him up somehow or another, he gets suppressed, something like that, and he gets over the idea, and so on and he ceases to manifest as a Re-lease. But wait a minute, he is actually not as bad off as he was before. A Release never unre-leases to the same degree of Stygian dark that they were in before they got released. Now this, then – this then is what we mean by Release. What we mean by Clear is an erasure of the mental mass which inhibits their thinking, postulating, and so on. You should see a Clear postulate on a meter; it's very interesting. I've got a couple of Clears right now that are doing a little bit of fooling about with the first part of the OT course and they've skipped a couple of steps in the OT course and now they are finding various banks. It's very interest-ing – it's very interesting because they really have not discovered that they're quite capable of postulating a bank. So after they postulated it they haven't bothered to blow it. That's very silly. I received, almost hilarity, a report, two reports from two of them, and I obediently checked them out. It was quite obvious what they were. They have not realized they are very skilled people, they can make a bank.

These are the states you are at-tempting to achieve with a human being. These are the manifestations of having achieved it. The E-Meter in the early days I used: \"Ahh, no kidding! Hey!\" And that would be a Release. And in the early days this was so good that a Dianetic Clear – we're making them now, we're making Dianetic Clears again. I've gotten two or three thank-you despatches and things like that. We're making Dianetic Clears. But of course a Dianetic Clear is actually merely a Re-lease and unfortunate, but they strangely enough have approximately the same manifestations that are described in Book One. And the way we started making them again is we stopped overauditing. Man was making his Releases too well. It's something on the order of: you make a Release, this guy becomes – let me talk at – about it at a lower level. The guy got the idea completely, he's got it now, \"Hey, you know, gee! That's true! That if I knew more I would be freer. Gosh! That is right!\" you know? And you start teaching him that if he knew more he would be freer. Now at the moment he realized that and you had him on this meter his needle would have floated. And his needle would have floated quite handsomely. But if you'd continued to teach him, his needle would have ceased to float almost right away. Now what fools you is that a Release, a lower level releases – now let me get this mystery explained for you. A lower level Release is released at the level they're released at. And there are higher levels of Release to be attained. And they don't so much relapse as go into the sticky plaster of the next level that they are going to have to climb to get all the way out. Do you see? So they in actual fact, in auditing very rapidly – unless you just suppress them by con-tinuing to audit the same gain which they already have which is sort of an ARC break, not acknowledgment or so forth. But when they walk out of that session and come back in the next morning and they haven't got a floating needle, realize they have simply moved up into the mass of the next strata they should be released in. They haven't unreleased. You under-stand that? So don't overrun them and don't get worried that they fold up awful fast. As a mat-ter of fact I've considered it sort of – sort of like the Indian, you know. He has several differ-ent types of pony. And you've noticed all the Indians' horses along a hitch rack and these In-dians' horses will be tied with different knots of greater and greater complication until you finally get to a knot which is very complicated that's tying up this one pony. Well, this one at the end – the other end, you see, he's just a dunce because he can – he can't even untie just dropping the reins across the hitch rack, you see? But this other one up at the other end, he's such a clever pony that he can untie any kind of knot anybody could dream up so they have to tie the most complicated knots anybody ever heard of to get the pony to stand there, you see? And they call him an enterprising pony. Now, if you have a Release who for some reason best known to man or beast, insists on staying there with a floating needle for days and days and weeks and months and if you were to pick him up a year from then and still find his needle floating, I would tell you you had a very unenterprising pony. [laughter] He's become smarter so he should become specula-tive at that point. Because it's quite natural sequence – these sequences of Release. And if he was able to think or act, to look around at all of course, he would dive into the next level very promptly."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 18 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 24 17.11.12 Now does this make the whole subject of Release seem a little clearer to you? I hope it does because the next audience I have to tell: \"When a needle floats and goes free you stop the process, and that is proper end phenomena for any conversation or any process anyplace up to Grade VI,\" I'm going to collect a dollar apiece from them. Be – watch it! Don't be part of that audience. But that's what barriered the way. Not knocking it off and not acknowledg-ing the fact that such states existed. Now in this lecture you could probably also find ways and means of dissemination, you could probably spot your errors of dissemination. I don't say that there aren't additional methods of dissemination, but I'm just pointing out those that have been startlingly successful and which in actual fact, are the dominant points of philosophy in our society today. Where they are lacking the society is barbarous and where they are present the society is advanced. Therefore you could fully expect a society to get very barbarous on psychology since it has yet to assimilate the principles of Buddhism. That tells you how backward any race is, is how far have they moved up that line. Now, the other – the other thing that is interesting to note before I close is that Re-leases seem to want other people to be released and Clears want other people to be cleared and all of this is very heartening. If that fact – which is quite accidental – did not exist, and so forth, why the whole of the race would be hopelessly lost. And if man were not basically good it would be extremely dangerous to improve him. Improve his abilities, would be very dan-gerous. But he happens to be basically good. Anybody who tells you basically – man is basi-cally evil, of course is fixing you up so that you then will be afraid to make somebody good. Now you can have a great many qualms about clearing or releasing even, somebody who is a benighted villain. Should I release him? Well, don't – don't worry about his activities after he's released because these will be better. His abilities will be better but so will the na-ture of his activities. Don't worry about that, worry about it on the basis of, has he got a good enough statistic that I'm going to do him this much favor. And don't release people to make them better for other people's sake. It is something which is a reward, it is not something which has to be done. And that is why I always object to Dianetics and Scientology being used only on backwards children classes, because I think the geniuses in the class are really the ones who need it. Now, therefore, I hope this will be of some small use to you when you find yourself sitting there looking at somebody and he has just asked you this embarrassing question: \"What is Scientology?\" Maybe if you remember this lecture it will help you know where to chip in, at what moment and what to tell him about.

They are separate subjects. They have in common certain tools like the E-Meter, TRs and auditor presence. But there it ends. Dianetics addresses the body. Scientology addresses the thetan. While a thetan can produce illness, it is the body that is ill. Thus Dianetics is used to knock out and erase illnesses, unwanted sensations, misemo-tion, somatics, pain, etc. Scientology and its grades are never used for such things. Scientology is used to increase spiritual freedom, intelligence, ability, to produce im-mortality. To mix the two has been a very bad error. Dianetics came before Scientology. It disposed of body illness and the difficulties a thetan was having with his body. This was a Present Time Problem to the thetan. In the pres-ence of a PTP no case gain results (an old discovery). When a thetan has body discomfort or upset solved, he could then go on with what he really wanted which were the improvements to be found in Scientology. Mixing the two practices in any way produced and will produce no real case gain. Sci-entology grades will only occasionally get rid of body ills and Dianetics will not achieve real spiritual freedom. Used within their own areas they both each one separately achieves that for which it was intended. Dianetics can make a well body, Scientology can make a recovered thetan.

I found that Dianetics had been forgotten for a dozen years and was being given a light brush-off as a course and that auditors and pcs were trying to use Scientology grades to han-dle body ills such as headaches, chronic somatics and so on. Man's usual PTP is his body. So if one gave him gold ornaments he'd try to use them to cure his aches and pains. Thus Dianetics was forgotten and unused and Scientology was being made to attempt cures. Thus they were, both subjects, busily being made to fail to some degree. Dianetics as it now exists is so simple, so elementary and so broadly applicable to the body that it requires a real effort to complicate it or make it unworking.

The preclear may outflow, jabber, discuss, pause, hedge, disperse, dither or be silent; no matter what he does or how he does it, between the asking of the question and the giving of the answer, the time is the communication lag. The near answer, a guessing answer, an undecided answer, are alike imprecise answers, and are not adequate re-sponses to the question. On receipt of such questionable answers, the auditor must ask the question again. That he asks the question again does not reduce the communication lag; he is still operating from the moment he asked the question the first time. And if he has to ask the question 20 or 30 times more in the next hour in order to get a precise and adequate answer from the preclear, the length of time of the lag would be from the asking of the first question to the final receipt of the answer.

No. 38 PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR'S BULLETIN From L. RON HUBBARD Via Hubbard Communications Office 163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11 ___________________________________________________________________________ 29 October 1954 THE AUDITOR'S CODE 1954 A Basic Course in Scientology – Part 5 1. Do Not Evaluate For The Preclear. The main difficulty of the preclear is other-knowingness. An auditor auditing a pre-clear has before him someone whose last stronghold of owned knowingness is his engram bank and various mental phenomena. As much as possible, the preclear should be permitted to discover the answers to this phenomena through the process of auditing. What the auditor is doing is steering. If he tells consistently what is to be found or what will happen, the preclear will not get well. The steering, of course, is a covert but highly acceptable method of inviting the preclear to find out. Giving a process's commands is an invitation to this discovery. The auditor is working from a body of knowledge as to how all minds and spirits function. The preclear could even be trained in this high generality without harm, and certainly can be au-dited in such a high generality, but its particularities and peculiarities, the phenomena which occur, must not be \"telegraphed\" to the preclear before they occur, and when something has occurred to the preclear the auditor should not then come up with its explanation. This was the entire failure of psychoanalysis. The preclear would say something, and the analyst would then tell the preclear what it meant. The auditor should confine himself to giving the proper auditing commands and en-gaging in enough \"dunnage\" (extra and relatively meaningless talk) to maintain a two-way communication line. 2. Do Not Invalidate Or Correct The Preclear's Data. After a preclear has informed the auditor of an incident in his life it would be a fatal error, so far as the preclear's case is concerned, for the auditor, using other data, to inform the preclear that he did not have a proper recall on the incident. This is the main trouble with hus-band and wife auditing teams, and why they normally do not work. Both have been present under various circumstances, and the husband or the wife doing the auditing on the other may find it impossible to repress his or her own version after the other one has delivered up an incident. Today's type of auditing enters incidents minimally; therefore opportunities of this"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE AUDITOR’S CODE 1954 2 PAB 39 – 29.10.54 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 30 17.11.12 kind are not as frequent as in earlier days. Verbal invalidation is, of course, the symbolic manifestation of force. Invalidation, when expressed in emotion and effort, is force. When the preclear is invalidated he feels as though he has been struck by some force. One of the lowest levels on this line of invalidation is criticism. Lacking the effort or energy to hit somebody, a covert person criticizes or otherwise invalidates. 3. Use The Processes Which Improve The Preclear's Case. In a series of tests conducted to discover why certain co-auditing teams had failed to effect an improvement, it was found that the auditor in each of these failed teams had been auditing out of the preclear what should have been audited out of the auditor. Top-flight Sci-entology processes minimize this difficulty, for they audit the common denominator, as nearly as it can be approached, of the difficulties in any and all minds. Nevertheless, auditors have a tendency to do to the preclear what should be done to the auditor in the way of processing. Furthermore, there are processes which effect improvement only after a great deal of auditing, and although this might be considered remunerative, it is actually not efficient since an audi-tor tying himself to one case is not benefiting the society as a whole, and is so defying his own third dynamic. 4. Keep All Appointments Once Made. Many a case has failed, not because of processing, but because the auditor was so ir-regular in keeping appointments that he introduced into the case an anxiety about waiting or unpunctuality. By failing to keep an appointment the auditor is actually telling the case that the case is not important, therefore not interesting, and the case will not run for an auditor who will not keep appointments. If an auditor has, himself, difficulty in keeping appoint-ments, then he should not make specific appointments. 5. Do Not Process A Preclear After Ten P.M. Utilizing all the experience of four years, it has been discovered that items 5, 6 and 7 of the Auditor's Code were the only actual causative agents in spinning preclears. Whenever a preclear markedly worsened under processing, the process itself was found to be guiltless, and it was discovered that items 5, 6 and 7 of this Code had one or all been present. In every case where a psychosis or neurosis was restimulated by bad auditing, all these factors, 5, 6 and 7, were present. Because the body is built of cells which contain in their experience line, evi-dently, the pattern of plankton, energy level actually drops after sundown, but for a while there is a certain franticness which can be mistaken for energy. In other words, when the sun went down the source of energy was no longer present, therefore auditing during any of the dark hours is not as effective as auditing during daylight. However, a person can be audited safely up to 10 p.m. regardless of the state of his case. After 10 p.m. the curve of ability to handle energy drops quickly and hits its low at 2:00 a.m. But any auditing after 10 p.m. has been found to be at least ineffective, and might as well not have been done."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE AUDITOR’S CODE 1954 3 PAB 39 – 29.10.54 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 31 17.11.12 6. Do Not Process A Preclear Who Is Improperly Fed. It is an unhappy thing that occasional hidden factors such as lack of sleep, lack of food, or an urgent present time problem may defeat the efforts of an excellent auditor. The best process will not benefit a preclear who, still interiorized, is being drained down as a thetan by a body which is badly in need of food. Every bit of energy which the thetan puts out is being absorbed by the body, which is improperly fed. A body suffering from malnutrition, or even lack of a proper breakfast, will thus inhibit auditing. Sometimes a preclear who has come from a distant area to be audited is sufficiently short of cash that he will attempt to subsist during the week of an intensive upon sandwiches and coffee. He might as well have stayed home, for his body, being hungry, will pull in en-grams, which are after all edible energy, will drain down every beam which a thetan throws out, and will in general defeat processing. An improperly fed preclear demonstrates on a basal metabolism test, even when sane, the same oxygen burning rate as a psychotic. You can take any preclear, have him omit eating breakfast, and a psychotic, and test the two of them, and you will discover their metabolism and breathing behavior to be similar. It is not prescribing a diet to demand that your preclear eats as a normal human being should during an auditing intensive or before any auditing. Preclears who are not adequately fed can be spun if bad auditing and some other factors are added into the session. This does not mean that a body can get so starved that it cannot benefit from auditing, but it does mean that a proper diet, as is normal with the preclear, should be observed during an intensive. Diet, by the way, is nowhere near as large a factor in the recovery of cases as nutrition \"ads\" would have you believe, and today no HASI auditor is allowed to prescribe diets if he is to continue in the protection of the organization. However, number six must be observed during auditing. 7. Do Not Permit A Frequent Change Of Auditors. Although it is almost impossible for a case to escape having two or three auditors, when the number gets up to six or eight over a relatively short space of time, such as a few months, the case is seen to suffer by reason of the change. As much as possible a case should be run by one auditor. The basic reason for this is that one auditor running a case has a better chance of completing what he starts. A frequent change of auditors nearly always means a frequent change of estimates of a case, and a frequent change of processes none of which get finished. 8. Do Not Sympathize With The Preclear. There are three ways of handling those who need help. The first and most senior of them is to be effective and remedy the condition once and for all. The second method would be to make the person comfortable. If you cannot be effective, and you cannot make the per-son comfortable, only then would you be justified in giving the person sympathy.

Sympa-thetic auditing invites the preclear to dredge up more data about which the auditor can be sympathetic, and finally becomes a mutual sympathetic society. 9. Never Permit The Preclear To End The Session On His Own Independent Deci-sion. With such processes in existence as Opening Procedure by Duplication, it becomes important that the auditor carry through what he starts. You will discover that a preclear very often will get up to a point where he desires to fight the auditor, and then will walk off from a session. It is the auditor's responsibility to bring the preclear back and to finish the session. Sessions end when the auditor says they are over, not when the preclear says they are over. However, in order to continue the session it is not legitimate to abuse the preclear or disobey any other sections of the Code. L.

Never Walk Off From A Preclear During A Session. Although no auditor of any decency or attainment would believe that a person apply-ing Scientology processes would need number ten, it has happened often enough that auditors have walked off from preclears who were in the midst of long communication lags to make it necessary that this be included in the Auditor's Code. The auditor's effort to punish the pre-clear for not obeying his command is responsible for this. One notable case, a poorly trained person practicing Scientology – you would hardly call him an auditor – became incensed with a psychotic girl he was auditing, got her into the middle of a long communication lag, raged at her, and then walked off from her. It took fifteen hours of extremely good and clever process-ing on the part of a top-flight auditor to regain the ground lost. 11. Never Get Angry With A Preclear. What must be the level of self-confidence of an auditor who feels that the introduction of misemotion into a session is necessary to express his inability to cope with his preclear? 12. Always Reduce Every Communication Lag Encountered By Continued Use Of The Same Question Or Process. Numbers 12 and 13 of the Auditor's Code 1954 are the essential difference between a good auditor and a bad one. If you want to know who is a bad auditor, then discover the audi-tor who fails to reduce communication lags encountered in the preclear by a repetition of the same question or process. This auditor is expressing his own inability to persist, and is ex-pressing as well his own inability to duplicate, and he is more under the control of the pre-clear than the preclear is under his control.

Always Continue A Process As Long As It Produces Change, And No Longer. Here is the other way you tell a bad auditor. A person whose case is in poor condition will express his state by changing every time the preclear changes. Here is the auditor being the effect of the preclear. The preclear changes his condition, changes his communication lag, changes his ideas, and if, between auditor and preclear, he is actually cause, the auditor will then change the question or change the process. You watch some auditor auditing who is or-dinarily not reputed to get results, and you will find out that in the course of an hour he is likely to use ten or twelve different processes. Each time some change occurs in the preclear, instead of pursuing it and reducing the communication lag on the process the auditor promptly changes. He excuses this to himself by saying some other process is needed or nec-essary. It so happens that the process which brings about a change will probably bring about further change. There is an auditing maxim concerning this: \"The process which turns on a condition will turn it off.\" This is true within limits, but it is true enough to drive home the fact that a person should use a process as long as it produces change. This can also be true of an auditing question. An auditing question should be used as long as it continues to produce change. But if one has used a question or process for some little time – in the case of a straight wire question five or eight minutes, in the case of Opening Procedures two or three hours – with no real change in the preclear, it is time to change the process. If the auditor does not change a good process, the process will then produce a change in the preclear. A bad auditor will use a process until it turns on a somatic, will then change to another process, will run it until it turns on another somatic, and then change it, and so on until he has thoroughly bogged a case. In spotting spots to get rid of old auditing in preclears who have been audited between 1950 and 1954, the plaint is often heard from the preclear, \"Oh, if only just one engram had been run a second time, or if one secondary had been run again, or if any auditor had said 'go through that again' how wonderful it would have been.\" It was the inability of the auditor to repeat the process of erasure which prevented Dianetics from being all we would ever have needed. The inability of the auditor to duplicate is mirrored in the fact that he cannot duplicate over and over the same question or the same process. This also comes into view in another way. An auditor who is unable to duplicate must always give the given and standard process with his own slight twist. He is given an auditing phrase, but he finds that he cannot use it unless he gives it a small curve. This auditor is worried about his own thinkingness and is using other thinkingness as his randomity. You can always tell a good auditor. He uses and abides by 12 and 13 of this Code. 14. Be Willing To Grant Beingness To The Preclear. An auditor who is unwilling to grant beingness to those around him will find himself unable to run a process which is effectively producing a change for the better in the preclear. This auditor will try to discover all manner of processes which reduce the status of the pre-clear. Whatever rationale he uses to explain this, he will not use an effective process if he is himself unwilling to grant beingness or life to the preclear. Thus we get two sharp divisions amongst auditors: those who are using the preclear as an opponent in a game, and those who"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE AUDITOR’S CODE 1954 (CONCLUDED) 3 PAB 39 — 12.11.54 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 35 17.11.12 are using the preclear as though the preclear was something being created by the auditor. The latter state of mind will produce remarkable results, the earlier will produce chaos. An auditor who needs preclears in order to have a fight would probably also beat children or small dogs – not big dogs, small dogs. 15. Never Mix The Processes Of Scientology With Those Of Other Practices. Auditors in general have considerable contempt for those who mix Scientology with some other practice or who use Scientology, change it around, and out of position or coward-ice call it something else. Auditors do not like this because they almost invariably, one or an-other of them, will inherit at least some of the preclears of people who disobey this line of the Code. There follows then an auditor's effort to unscramble a case which has had its spine ad-justed while running engrams or which has discovered an incident only to have discovered immediately after that it has tremendous mystic significance or psychoanalytic bearing. An auditor who mixes Scientology or miscalls it has never learned Scientology. If he knew Scien-tology he would not feel it necessary to do something else, for Scientology is nothing if not extremely effective – certainly more effective than any other existing practice today. Sometimes auditors encounter people who \"really use Scientology, but because of the acceptance level of the public\" mix it with something else. The public has no difficulty and has never had any real difficulty in accepting or using Scientology under that name practiced according to its own procedures. In a particular instance, an auditor who prescribes diets or who does other things of a material nature additive to the practices of Scientology immedi-ately divorces himself from the protection of the HASI and is subject to action by the CECS.* An auditor who has to mix Scientology to make it work didn't know Scientology in the first place and so wasn't really an auditor anyway. ____________________ This is the Auditor's Code of 1954. It supersedes any earlier Codes. It has been devel-oped by the CECS as its standard of practice, and latterly was adopted by the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for use in the field of Dianetics. It is the official Auditor's Code. It is required of students under training that they know this Code by heart, know what it means, and as they process, practice it. It is one thing to know it – another thing to practice it. A good auditor does both. It is not something to be read, agreed with and forgotten. Fol-lowing it means success in cases. Neglecting any part of it means failures. It combines the arduously won experiences collected during four years from the practices of three thousand auditors. We want successes. L.

When a pc answers, in reply to the question asking for what he wants to improve, \"To be clear\" and this is then pursued in the session, serious trouble occurs. Why? \"What do you want to improve?\" is not answered by \"To be clear.\" It would be an-swered by \"My sanity.\" It would not be answered by \"My aberrations\" (since nobody wants his aberrations to improve). If your pc is not trained into being in session you of course don't get answers to your questions. What auditor has recently (as you should to all new pcs particularly) explained what was expected in the session? \"I am going to ask you something, then you are going to answer it, then I will acknowledge, then I will ask again\" etc. In other words what auditor has re-cently explained to a new pc the auditing cycle? Well, if he hasn't on a new pc an auditor can't control anything that goes wrong in the session as there's no session. Clay Table, like all other auditing, has to have an auditing cycle of asking or telling the pc, getting that exact question answered or command complied with, acknowledging it and so forth. When this is omitted particularly on Clay Table work, disaster follows faster than in other types of processes as Clay Table bites deep. So 1. Get your pc trained into what the auditing cycle is and 2. Get the question or command that was asked or given answered. Pcs can say whatever else they please. But they must answer the auditing question or no auditing occurs. More than any other sin, this one is bedeviling Clay Table work and slowing results and every upset on Clay Table so far has been traced to this. L.

If you do not show him what auditing is, he does not know what is expected of him. Thus he is not only not in session but in mystery. 2. If you do not indoctrinate him into what he is supposed to do when the auditor gives him a question or command, he often does not answer the question or comply with the command and only then can things go wrong in the session. 3. If the pc is not in the auditor's control and if anything goes wrong, then the auditor can do nothing about it as he does not have any session or control of the pc. COVERT AUDITING Some, particularly HAS students, are very remiss in this and \"covertly audit\". In \"talking\" to someone they also seek to audit that person \"without the person know-ing anything about it\". This of course is nonsense since auditing results are best achieved in a session and a session depends upon a self-determined agreement to be audited. You can achieve changes in a person with covert auditing – I won't say you can't since I have done so. But it is uncertain and not very popular. You have to audit without agreement when the pc is unconscious and can't respond. But to make it a common practice when it is really used only in emergency (as in un-consciousness or when you have no time) would be foolish. Further, using Scientology to handle situations in life is a whole subject in itself and it isn't auditing. (Example: Person angry, a Scientologist locates and indicates the by-passed charge. Example: On a raving psychotic, the Scientologist arranges for the person to have a rest away from his ordinary environment and associates and forbids damaging \"treatments\". Example: Somebody seems to have lots of problems so the Scientologist teaches him what a problem is.

There are countless ways to use the philosophy of Scientology in direct application to life. And even hopeless physical conditions respond to just understanding more about life. For instance there are many cases on record of a bedridden person reading no more than Dianet-ics: The Evolution of a Science and becoming well and active. So one doesn't have to \"covertly audit\" if any communication is possible. One can teach, advise, orient someone in existence, applying the truths and knowledge of Scientology. The point is, when auditing is begun it is best done by agreement to be audited and is most successful when the preclear understands what he is supposed to do in response to audi-tor actions, and is only disastrous when there is not enough control in the session to set things right if they start to go wrong. Any auditor who just sits and lets a pc ramble on and on with no regard to the subject being handled, even in Itsa, is very foolish, has no session and is wasting time. The wrong thing to do is chop the pc up and cut his comm because he is so far adrift. The right thing to do is to prevent it before it happens by not auditing preclears who have not agreed to be audited or who have no faintest idea of what's expected of them. In the hands of an unskilled \"auditor\" I have seen a preclear, who was running a psy-cho-analytic type session, giving all the expected psycho-analytic symptoms and responses. And getting nowhere. There are two ways it could have been handled – one is to have explained this wasn't psycho-analysis and then explained the auditing cycle. The other would have been to run O/W on the analysis the pc had had or even do a by-passed charge assessment on the analysis. Probably both would be necessary if mere information about how auditing was done did not care for the condition. One of the rules of auditing is never to let any part of any question or command be agreed upon once and never repeated. Example: The auditor tells the pc, \"When I say 'her' in this command, I mean your mother. Now what have you done to her?\" The pc is always hav-ing to think back to this agreement to answer the command. Educating a pc is not the same thing. Here one is knocking out past response patterns, as in social actions or some earlier form of treatment. One is in effect cancelling out earlier habits of response in order to get auditing to occur. Once that is done one does not of course have to do it again and what the pc says in a session is what the pc says. Sometimes he wan-ders all about before he answers the question. But the auditor in any case must get his ques-tion answered or the command complied with. So auditing in general is a clean-cut agreement to be audited, a session is conducted with an auditing cycle, no matter how long or short that cycle may be. LRH:jw.cden L.

Beautiful, sunshiny day here; cherish it. Go out and make a facsimile of it. This is what? Audience: 25 July. 25 July. What do you know about that? A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The auditing cycle. Once upon a time there was an auditor and he knew he could au-dit; he knew he could audit. But PCs, they just wouldn't PC worth a nickel. And the auditor said, \"Well, I'll have to get out of Scientology because PCs are no good.\" You'd be surprised how often this line of logic – ha – gets in the road. Most auditors, early on, have a definite idea that there's tremendous variation in PCs, and that some PCs can be audited and some PCs can't be audited, and that there are good PCs and bad PCs, and all different kinds of PCs. Well, there are worrisome PCs, but just to the degree that you can't get them to get tone arm action. And some PCs are closer to aquiver on the subject of a communication breakdown than others; they're more nervy. Those things are true. But practically no PC can stand up against a good auditing cycle, you know, and say, \"Well, I'm going on being aber-rated for the rest of my days because that makes everybody wrong and makes me right.\" The difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle and his own impatience. His disabilities in this particular line are last detected by himself. In other words, he's really the last to find this out. If an auditor wants to polish up his auditing, I recommend putting a piece of session on a tape, at least a piece of a session, and then listening to that tape back, and not listening to the ramifications or the flubs. Anybody is liable to make a duplicative-type flub, you know. Like, you've had to change your auditing command – you heard me make one the other day on that tape. I had to change the command, because I was getting so much bang out of \"mainly\" that I had to put \"mostly.\" And then I was grooved into saying \"mainly,\" and my concentration, of course, was for the PC, and I was slipping up and I was occasionally saying \"mainly\" again when I was trying to say \"mostly.\" Well, you're liable to pick on that kind of thing as being a very important error. Actu-ally, it isn't very important. What's important is: Did you complete your auditing cycle? See, it really isn't how gracefully you completed it, but did you complete it? There are two communication cycles that make up the auditing cycles, and those are: cause-distance-effect with the auditor at cause and the PC at effect; and cause-distance-effect"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 2 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 42 17.11.12 with the PC at cause and the auditor at effect. Those are completely distinct, one from the other. Now, the only place they impinge on each other at all – and this is the only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle – is the fact that the auditor, on his cycle, has cal-culatingly restimulated something in the PC, which is then discharged by the pc's auditing cycle. So you see, you've kind of got a V lying on its side. You see, you've got the upper V here with the auditor at the top of the wing, you see, and he's cause, distance, effect; and here at the point of the V, you customarily think of that as just one turn. Actually, there's a compli-cation right there: It's what the auditor has said has caused a restimulation at that point, and then the PC is honor bound to start an auditing cycle to get rid of the restimulation. Can you see that? And that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle, and that's the entirety of the game. There's nothing else esoteric about it at all. Don't think otherwise than that the auditor is restimulating the PC. Now, some audit-ing – some auditing – breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the PC. Now, you'll see this on a gross level when somebody said, \"I had to stop auditing him because the somatics were so great.\" You see? I've actually heard somebody say that – seriously. And I think to myself, \"The poor PC, man.\" At that point of the V where those two come together and where effect turns into cause, where the PC is there, at that point, you have a restimulation and then the necessity of answering the question to get rid of the restimula-tion. Now, if the PC doesn't answer the question, the PC does not get rid of the restimula-tion. If he alter-ises at that point, then every restimulation is going to become an alter-is. And all PCs who are having any trouble alter-is at that point of the V. Here, I'll draw you a picture.2 Here is your V. And this is cause and this is distance and this is effect. Now, here's your auditor, see? And here's the PC. Now, at this point here is where you get your restimulation factor. And this point is again, now, cause-distance-effect, see? So we get cause-distance-effect, see? And that's what an auditing cycle in actual fact looks like. Now, there are some little inner cycles – there are some little inner cycles that throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle. And these little inner cycles are when you get cause-distance-effect, and he has answered the question, the auditor then says, \"Thank you.\" Well, actually, that's a shadow. And this now starts the shadow back, you see? You understand? See, there's a little extra communication cycle on here; it's an extra cycle, see? And you have this as the acknowledgment – the acknowledgment cycle. So you have here an ack, and of course that goes this way, you understand, and is received over here; and that's all there is to it. That's a little fade-out, don't you see?   2 Editor's note: See Lecture Graphs published as HCOB 14 Aug 63, Red Vol. V, page 339"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 3 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 43 17.11.12 Well, I very often berate you for being not perceptive, and not auditing the PC and not seeing what's happening to the PC, or what's going on there, don't you see? So I get this kind of an action here: There is another one of these little shadow cycles. The PC has received the auditing command. And that is such a tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any trouble finding out what's going on with the PC are missing that one. You say, \"Do birds fly?\" and then you fail to perceive that the PC received the audit-ing command. Now, that's because he doesn't say anything. See, here's your main cycle: cause-distance-effect; \"Do birds fly?\" See? And the PC says, \"No.\" Well, actually, there's another cause in here; there's another little tiny one, and it's right here and it's a little c, see? And you're missing that one where you're not perceiving the PC. Does he receive it? You say, \"Do birds fly?\" And he says... That's all the cause that is emanated at this point, by the PC. See, he just... See, that would be exaggerating it. But you can tell by looking at him that he didn't understand what you'd said, or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving, you see? Doing something peculiar with this command. Well, it's actually whatever that message is that is in response here, whatever message that is, does ride on this line. And an auditor who isn't watching the PC at all then never no-tices a PC who isn't receiving or understanding the auditing command; and all of a sudden, somewhere along the line, there's an ARC break, and then we do assessments and then we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong. Well, they actually needn't ever have gone wrong in the first place. What is the PC doing, completely aside from answering? Well, that what he is doing is this other little sub-cause-distance-effect line. So a complete auditing cycle consists of no less than six communication cycles, if you really want to get it down to the last ramifications. But the important ones are four. You've got four communication cycles. Well, where are the other two? Where's the other two? They're so tiny that you would-n't really notice them, but they are there. Cause-distance-effect of \"Is the PC ready to receive an auditing command?\" See, is he ready to receive an auditing command? He's going, \"Oh, rum-rum-rum-rum-rum.\" Well, that action is actually PC causing, isn't it? And it has to ride up the line across distance and [be] received at the auditor; and the auditor perceives that the PC is doing something else. You say, \"That's not very important,\" you see? But it is; it is. You'll find auditors goof that one very often. And the PC is going... And the auditor says – he's nulling, let us say – and he says, \"catfish,\" \"cat fur,\" and so forth. And the PC is going like this, you see? See, he's not noticed this first one. That causes this kind of trouble: You've got the item \"fur\" on a list that you're nulling, and you hit the item \"fur\" and it goes through, actually, a complete auditing cycle, one way or"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 4 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 44 17.11.12 the other, because you very often say thank you after you've done so. It's a very jammed-up auditing cycle, but it's there, you see? And then you go on to \"catfish\" on the next one, without performing this top cycle: Is the PC ready to have \"catfish\" read to him? No, he's hung up on \"fur,\" and the only time you ever get into real catastrophe is when the PC is really hung up on \"fur.\" God, when you said \"fur,\" the PC went, \"Ew-w-w-w.\" Dong! and there he is, see? \"What's happened? Where is it? Ho! What's happened?\" See? You ever have that hap-pen to you? Somebody goes over a line – bong! it goes. And the next thing you know, in the far-off distance you hear \"catfish, cat whiskers... \" And you say, \"What's that? Where's this? Who's what?\" This one becomes terribly im-portant when you run into a situation like that. You don't really pay too much attention to it. But it exists. Got it? It exists. And there's another one down here. There's another little one down here: Pc received the acknowledgment. And sometimes you violate that sixth one. You say, \"Thank you!\" and the PC goes like this. Or that you say, \"Thank you,\" and the PC... If you were to do old-time Model Session end-of-session mid ruds at that point, you'd find out the PC asked you why you never acknowledged him. See? You have been acknowledging him, but you've never seen that he didn't receive the acknowledgment, don't you see? That perception has another little tiny one in it, is: Has the PC said everything? But that actually comes on this line here: Has the PC answered everything, see? And it becomes... the auditor is watching the PC, see? And the auditor sees that the PC has not said all he was going to say. Sometimes get in trouble with PCs that way. Pc says, \"Oh, yeah, it was sometime in the later days of the Roman Empire...\" You know he's going to say something else, see? Well, this one isn't complete. So everything at cause hasn't moved down the line here to you, effect. And you haven't perceived all of the effect. So you go into the acknowledgment one before this line has completed itself, don't you see? \"Well, it was in the early days of the Roman Empire. Um...\" \"Thank you! Now, we will...\" Duh-uh-uh-uh. You've seen that happen. That's chop-ping a pc's comm, see? They didn't let this line here, which is the fourth communication cycle, flow to its complete end. And then this one, the acknowledgment, takes place. And of course it can't go through because this, the fifth communication cycle, is sitting up here on the fourth communi-cation cycle. So you say, \"Thank you,\" and of course you're right back against... and it's an inflow-ing line and they jam right there. So there are six – if you really want to break it all down – there are six communication cycles that make up one auditing cycle. Six – not more than six, unless you start running into trouble. And when you violate that – one of those six, when you violate one of those six – you of course are going to get into trouble, then, which causes a mishmash of one kind or another."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 5 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 45 17.11.12 Now, I'll go over these again. I think you would care to have me do that, wouldn't you? Audience: Yes. All right. Up here we have number one: the PC. His emanation at that point is simply his appearance and presence. That's number one. Is he ready to have an auditing command given to him? See, are we all set here for the auditing command? That's number one. That's a communication cycle consistence of cause, distance, effect. Your next communication cycle on the thing – we had better go into number three – is your auditor's communication straight down to the PC. That is the auditing command and that you normally consider the communication cycle. Got it? That's what you normally say: \"Do birds fly?\" That's cause-distance-effect received at the pc's – here. Now he has to take care of and handle the charge at this point (and I'll cover this in a minute), he'll have to handle the charge at this point which has been restimulated by the audi-tor. And now he originates (although we use another designation; I've used origination other-wise, and so forth): He has his answer, which is what you normally call it. His answer, how-ever, is a cause. And that's a cause, a distance and an effect. You understand? Now, your next one is an acknowledgment by the auditor which goes over cause, dis-tance, effect, is received by the PC; and this is the perception of whether or not the PC re-ceives the acknowledgment. Got that? But you go over this, work this thing out, you'll find out that it's a very complicated ar-rangement. And you can count on anybody studying this, promptly and immediately after-wards not being able to audit at all. It's something like taking a golf pro and say, \"How do you handle your club?\" But this is your main show. Now, what you've considered ordinarily the auditing cycle has been this first V which I drew, which is cause-distance-effect – with the PC at effect, the auditor at cause. And then, at that V, the restimulation takes place and you get cause-distance-effect. Now, I'm not going to go into the rest of the auditing cycle till I show you the center of this thing, okay? There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle – another communica-tion cycle. And that is at the point of the V. [starts to draw the second graph] Here's your PC and here's your auditor, and here was your cause, your distance, effect; here is your cause, your distance, effect and here was a C and here was an E. Don't you see? Cause-distance-effect at the PC. That's the auditing command. And then you've got cause-distance-effect which is the auditing response. Well, we've opened up the point of the V. And here is your little additional one, and that's between the PC and himself. Here – see what this is. Now, this actually can be multiple, and it depends upon the complications of the mind. But because there has been an effect there, that causes a cause. See? Because you have an effect at this point of impact, you get a res-timulation. Now, that stimulation brings about charge, which then causes the PC to emanate"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 6 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 46 17.11.12 to get rid of that charge. So you have an internal one, here, of cause-distance-effect inside the pc's skull. Well, that gives us seven communication cycles. Now, I said this could be multiple. This is him talking to him, see? And you say, \"Do birds fly?\" and this causes a picture of birds. He receives the effect of the picture of birds, and he causes a query of the picture. \"Are they flying?\" And as a result, the answer comes back of the flapping of the wings and he says, \"Yes, they're flying.\" And so with his thought he transmits, then, the causative action to the auditor – now directed at the auditor – \"Yes.\" You see how that can be multiple? Now, you're listening to the inside of his skull when you're examining that V down there. Now, if you think that the inside of the skull is more important than the rest of the cy-cles, you're going to be very, very disabused. This happens to be the least important of all of the actions, except when it isn't being done. And of course it's the hardest to detect when it isn't being done. It's the hardest to detect. Pc says, \"Yes.\" Well now, what has the PC said yes to? And you sometimes are insuf-ficiently incurious. You've said, \"Do birds fly?\" and the PC receives this, and he gets a picture of a dinosaur who is eating, and perceives that dinosaurs eat and says, \"Yes.\" And carrying out the remaining part of the sentence, it would be, \"Yes, dinosaurs eat.\" So this is actually what it sounds like to the auditor: \"Do birds fly?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thank you.\" See, that's what it sounds like to the auditor – that's the big V. Actually, this is what happened: \"Do birds fly?\" And the point of the V is haywire; we get a dub-in, see? Picture of a dinosaur flies up, because that's safer to look at than birds, for some reason, or more interesting or different. It's an alter-is of some kind or another – happens on an automaticity. The PC thinks he understands the question now on the basis of \"Do dinosaurs eat?\" and says, \"Yes.\" And the auditor says, \"Thank you.\" Hey, wait a minute. What's going to happen to this PC? What's going to happen to the PC? And that, in essence, is this internal perception of line, which I showed you on the other side. This cause-distance-effect backflash here, and so forth, happens to include \"Is the PC answering the command I gave him?\" Question. Now, all of this is very complicated, isn't it? And it's sufficiently complicated that any auditor ought to sit down with a piece of paper and work it all out – and not expect me to tell them. I think there are very few auditors ever really inspected that to the degree that it's a multiple cycle. There are seven or more communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 7 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 47 17.11.12 Now, it's actually weighty enough that standing up here giving you a lecture on the subject, off the cuff, see, it's very easy to get mixed up on which cycle is which, because it requires a little bit of concentration. You have to actually mock up a complete session, see – complete auditing cycle – and pick out every communication cycle in the auditing cycle. Now, a communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication. That's all – that's a communication cycle. How many of these are there in one auditing cycle? And that would include every nuance of the auditing session. So you have to answer with how many principal ones are there? Because some auditing cycles could contain a couple of more. The PC says, \"Huh?\" You see, that's a cause. That goes over distance, effect. And the auditor says, \"Do birds fly?\" He says, \"I will repeat the auditing question. Do birds fly?\" And that goes cause-distance-effect. But you immediately have added two more cycles and so you've got nine – because there was a flub, see? You got that? So anything unusual that happens in the session adds to the number of communication cycles to the auditing cycle, but they're still all part of the auditing cycle. Now, we've got repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, and that's doing this same cycle over and over and over. Now, I'll give you some homework here; this is for your own good. You draw out all these communication cycles on a scrap of paper for yourself. Just take a look at all these things and mock up a session, like you do this and the PC does that, and so forth. And all of a sudden it'll come very straight in your skull how many of these things there are, and you won't have a couple of them jammed up. Because actually, what's mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is you have confused a couple of communication cycles to such a degree that you don't differentiate that they exist. That's why you sometimes chop a PC who is trying to answer the question, see? You know whether he has answered the question or not. Well, how did you know if he has answered the question or not? By esoterics? New subject matter: esoterics. If you're very skilled at esoterics, you could probably manage it. But there are no esoterics involved. Even if it's telepathy, it's cause, distance, effect. Doesn't mat-ter how that communication took place; you know whether he's answered the auditing com-mand by a communication cycle. I don't care if the distance was zero. It was permeation from same location in space; you were in the pc's head. I don't care how you sense this or if you know that ordinarily this PC is green when he answers an auditing command, and he turns pale white this particular time. You realize he's not answered the auditing command. Well, how did you know that? Well, obviously, it's a communication cycle inside the auditing cycle. So, I'll give you a little assignment there. You work that thing out. How many of these things are there? And then expect to drop the mashie and the niblick and hook one into the woods for a day or two. So that's perfectly all right to do that, see? I myself occasionally take apart a piece of auditing and find myself gaping briefly in a session, because I've been trying to put together a very flexible R2H, because R2H is a very –"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 8 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 48 17.11.12 the way it was originally released – is a very skilled activity. It's too much for me. That's right! It's just too confoundedly skilled. I know you can't do it. Impossible! It's too prone to error. Good training: Man, if you can do that, you can do anything! I mean it. If you can do that, you can do anything. But, boy, by the time you get some PC who's got an insignificant ARC break that doesn't have the punch of an engram or anything like that behind it, and you're trying to date that confounded thing on a meter – it's just smooth as glass, and so forth – you practically have to ARC break the PC again to get the meter to read! [laughs] Terrific training. But inherent in that process – inherent in that process – there are a great many proc-esses which go pretty well south and which will, actually, practically go one shot to OT, see? It's masked, however, in the exact mechanics that you're handling. I found out that you have to use ten – a minimum of ten – steps to get the terrific therapeutic result of which it's capable. At least ten steps. In fact, I got one version of it on the drawing table right now, which I've been working with: I don't know, I think it must have about eighteen separate steps. I'm just trying to milk this thing down for maximum tone arm action, minimal error and maximal ease of auditing. You're doing a training version now. It won't be changed. Go right ahead with it. But this is really putting that process up to make it get its most results, see? And, by the way, there are only nine levels of assessment in this newest version I'm working out – just nine lines, takes care of the lot. But that's all progress. But I'm running all this on a PC. You get the idea? It's all brand-new, and it's impossi-ble to audit the original version of it anyway. And I'm handling something that has fifteen steps in it, all of which are strange and different, and the PC has done something incredible in the session that I haven't yet suspected. And boy! You talk about the mashie and the niblick, man! You know? That golf ball goes straight through the trees, hits a tree trunk, caroms off a rock, goes straight up into the sky and vanishes forever. [laughs, laughter] All right. Well, if you're nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing, if that's giving you trouble and if you can get yourself into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it, then it should be broken down and analyzed at the time you're auditing something nice and simple. That's the time it should be broken down – not until you have three woods in your right hand and four irons in your left hand and you're going to putt with the heel of your golf shoe, see? I mean, this is not the time to practice this auditing cycle. So you go ahead and break it down. I've given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle. Maybe in working it over you can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they're all there, and if you made somebody go through each one painstakingly and painfully, you would find out where his auditing cycle was jammed up. And it isn't necessar-ily jammed up on his ability to say \"Thank you!\" It may very well be jammed up in another quarter. Got that? Now, there's a completely different auditing cycle inside the same pattern. Just wanted to make you comfortable and make you feel relaxed. [starts to draw the third graph]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 9 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 49 17.11.12 Let's work this one out. Here's the PC. This PC, he gonna originate. This has got noth-ing to do with the auditing cycle. Scrub that other one! This now has nothing to do with it. The only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles. That they have in common. But this is brand-new. This is the bolt from Mars. It comes out of the blue, and an auditor who is already concentrating... he's auditing, you know... There are people, they used to read – they'd move their lips while they read, you know? And everybody would make a lot of fun of them, you know, for... You know? Well, an auditor who's handling his communication cycles and his main auditing cycle on a lip-moving level, see – he's brand-new at this sort of thing: the PC says something, see, that is not germane to what the auditor is saying or doing. And there is just – well, just trucks go over the cliff, jet ships crash, see? All goes to hell, man! So you actually have to be alert for this thing happening at any time. And the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen any time; and just go into the drill that han-dles it, and don't get it confused with the drill which you have as an auditing cycle; and con-sider it as its own drill. It's its own drill. You shift gears into this drill when the PC does something unexpected. And by the way, this handles such a thing as the PC originates by throwing down the cans. That's still an origin, see? That had nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The auditing cycle went to pieces, maybe, and this cycle came in. Well, the other auditing cycle can't com-plete because this cycle is now here. Well, that doesn't mean that this cycle has precedence or dominance, but this cycle can start and take place and have to be finished off before the other one can resume. So this is an interruptive cycle. And it is cause and distance and effect. And here's your auditor. The PC causes something. Now your auditor has to originate, and your V is in-verted. Now let's investigate here. Let's investigate that point. Let's expand the point, just as we did in the auditing cycle. [laughter] What's this going to be, a mad spate of question marks [laughter] or rockets flying off at oblique angles, or what's going to happen at this point? Well, frankly, you can't put a machine at that point. You can't put a machine action at that point, because this thing has to be understood – has to be understood. So, to the degree that it is hard to understand, you have cause-distance-effect, cause-distance-effect. You un-derstand? This is the auditor trying to clarify this thing. And every time he asks a question, he's got a new communication cycle. Well, the trick that happens at the open V must not be such as to merely get the origi-nal line, cause-distance-effect, repeating itself. You mustn't have the PC continuing to repeat that line, because the PC is now going to go frantic. Because he can't get off of that line, he's stuck in time, and it really upsets him. So the auditor, when this V is expanded here, has to be able to understand what the devil the PC is talking about. Now, there's really no substitute for simply trying to understand it. The PC all of a sudden says, \"But the Roman Empire didn't have any legs!\""},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 10 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 50 17.11.12 \"Tell me a little more about that, please.\" That's a good response. And the PC immediately goes off into can gesticulations like mad and explains how – how because of North Africa being in its situation, you see, Egypt being in its situation, and that sort of thing, the Roman Empire didn't run on legs. It didn't run on legs at all; it ran on rivers. We're now getting in deeper. \"All right. Good enough; good enough. I hear what you're saying, now. Ah... \" [laugh-ter] \"Give me a little more dope on this so I can get a good grasp of it.\" Oh, and the PC will go on and he'll expostulate and understand it. And he'll understand it better through telling you. And all of a sudden, you'll find out that he's telling you it didn't have any legs, and it didn't have any legs to stand on – that is what he really meant, and so forth. And he's got it all doped out, and all of a sudden you see what the hell he's talking about. And at that point, you can resolve this point at the open V, you see? And \"Oh, that's what the hell he's talking about\" is the name of that expanded little V. \"Oh, that's what the hell he's talking about\" is the name of that cause-distance-effect, see? And then you say (cause-distance-effect), \"Thank you.\" How many more lines can you put in there? Well, you have to have another little line up here, which is another little cause-distance-effect, before that origination takes place so that you don't run into a jam and you don't give the auditing command. He's originated that he's going to say something. He says... see, whatever it is – and that's not the time for you to say \"Do fish swim?\" See? You suddenly notice there's a flicker across the table and the PC is saying... [breathes in] See, that's another little communication cycle. So it's cause-distance-effect. And effect at your point is to shut up. See? And then, you actually can have another little one, here, that's a cause-distance-effect, of \"I'm listening.\" Get the idea? And then, of course, there's your extra ones down here – when you've said \"Thank you,\" then it's your perception of the fact that he has received the thank-you. And there's your origin. Got it? Audience: Yeah. The building brick out of which all of these things are made are communication cy-cles. That's just cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication, see? That's the lot, see? But when you say \"duplication\" – when you say this – you are carrying, then, the communication cycle over into the A and the R, because there must be understanding. Now, this is peculiar: There is a difference between an auditing cycle and a military communication cycle. \"Theirs is not to question why; theirs is but to do and die\" is definitely the military attitude toward the whole thing. And whereas this, too, can get into auditing... and actually is not disallowed and is sometimes used, and not without benefit. The guy is not go-ing to touch that wall. \"Thou shalt touch that wall,\" you see? This kind of an action very often takes place. He's not going to give up the withhold. \"Well, you goddamn well are going to give up the withhold,\" you know? Bow! see? That sort of thing is very often better than not"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 11 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 51 17.11.12 doing anything about it. There are more adroit ways to do it – but this is real crude auditing. But that's the only time it gets over into the military cycle. Now, the military cycle is simply cause, distance, effect, compliance. And the auditing cycle is cause, distance, effect, understand. So there is an A and an R at the effect point. And therefore, there has to be an A and an R at the cause point, so as to make \"understand\" accept-able at the effect point. There doesn't have to be, but there had better be. You see that? So there's where A and R fit in on the communication cycle where auditing are con-cerned. They are very carefully designed. Now, a very syrupy affinity is very often highly detrimental to auditing. But too snarly or abrupt an affinity is also detrimental to auditing. We haven't completed talking about the auditing cycle by a long ways. The auditing cycle, you would say, then, is TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, the auditing cycle has very little to do with TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, just as such, and only as such. The TRs have to do with the communication cycle. And you have to put one all the way together at about TR 5 or TR 6 to take in all of these communication cycles. You understand? What the lower TRs do is teach you to handle one communication cycle – see, from one side or the other – in varying degrees of complication. Now, of course you've got to have TR 0, because all of these things have to do with confront. All of them have to do with con-front, so you'd say TR 0 is native to all of them. TR 1: Well, that's an emanation. And TR 2 is a receipt. So of course, those just handle what? They just handle nothing but the communica-tion cycle. Do you see that? Now, you can go on and build this up from this point on, but you will find that a com-plete auditing cycle would require a full-dress-parade TR that covered, maybe, at least six. And then you could have another TR that covered it up to nine, ten or twelve. And you could have another TR that handled an origin through all of its cycles – but that's supposed to be, right now, TR 4. See, TR 4 – you've always had trouble with TR 4. Maybe I've shown you why today. Look at TR 4. See, that's a picture of TR 4. The V is the other way around. This thing is all upside down, you see? But that isn't all there is to the A and the R in connection with the communication cy-cle. TR 1: How good is somebody's TR 1? Well, let me tell you that the ability to say \"Do fish swim?\" might serve, but how about being comprehensible? How about being comprehensi-ble? Enunciatively comprehensible: you can understand the syllables. How about that? We can get over that point. But how about giving it an understandable communication? Now, let's look at this in its widest ramifications. The R-factor has to be present there so that it can be duplicatable. You very often, when you leave some auditors loose on making up a command, or asking something, or there's a hole in the routine and it doesn't give them those words, will do a put-together of the statement to be said to the PC which, at the arrival at the PC, is incom-prehensible. And yet an auditor is very often called upon to do this. I've noticed this. I'm not being condemnatory of auditors in general, but I've noticed here and there. When an auditor –"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 12 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 52 17.11.12 some auditors are left completely on their own... Well, something like this: \"Well, get me a list. Get me a list of the stuff he's worried about.\" And you expect them to put together a ques-tion something like \"What are you worried about?\" see? And you get some entirely different, incomprehensible version, like \"What are the worst part of your worries sometimes?\" Some-thing like this. Now, that's almost sensible compared to some of them I've seen. They're just absolutely incomprehensible. Absolutely incomprehensible. I don't know how anybody – and I have actually seen somebody run a level fitted into one of these five-to-fifteen command brackets, which didn't make any sense at all, and sud-denly found to my horror that some PC had actually been running on this for hours and hours and hours, and every time they arrive at it, says, \"I don't have a clue what you're talking about at this point.\" And the auditor just says, \"I will repeat the auditing question.\" So there's this factor in this communication cycle, that the TR 1 aspect must be (1) enunciated in such a way as to arrive in an understandable form, but very often, when the auditor is formulating something, has to be formulated so that it can be duplicated. So these two other factors are involved, besides simply being at cause – is the cause going out with any R? In other words, can you understand any part of this thing? Is this an understandable state-ment? \"Do fish someti... I'll repeat the auditing question: Do fish somet...\" Naturally, no au-diting can proceed. You start dropping s's off of everything; or get somebody with a Japanese curve; you get somebody doing something that is a little bit offbeat in pronunciation – somebody from Boston. Let's go worse – somebody from Maine. You ever hear a \"Maine-iac\" talk? [laughter] I was up there finding the Canadian border. The United States government lost it. (They'd lose their heads, you know, if you didn't watch them.) Anyway, they lost the Cana-dian border and went up and found it again. Found a tree had fallen on it and buried the marker. They have little pyramids that look like the Washington Monument that mark the border. It was very necessary, because the prohibition agents didn't know where their author-ity started and ended, see? It caused terrible things. We took the problem off because what we were doing when we were surveying is we would stop the rum runners and tell them we were prohibition agents, relieve them of their cargo, and we always had a lot to drink! Anyway... [laughter] We solved this problem practically. The U.S. government could've taken a lot of leaves from, I think, most of us on practical solutions to these problems. But I spent the most delighted summer trying to learn to speak \"Maineiac.\" Gorgeous. And the French that had been living up along the St. Lawrence didn't speak French and they didn't speak English. They spoke something else. But it was sure interesting. Got so I could speak the thing, you know? I'd talk about \"Baa-haaba\" [Bar Harbor] with the best of them. But it wouldn't go in an auditing session. And very often, some PC gets saddled with an auditor that he can't quite comprehend along some corner or another. Now, you should recognize what's out. The only thing that is"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 13 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 53 17.11.12 out is the R-factor in the TR 1. And an auditor should actually take great care to keep that one smoothed out. If he knows he's doing something weird that the PC can't comprehend, it does-n't matter how clumsily he sets it right so long as he sets it right. Supposing you can't tell the difference between the way he pronounces five and the way he pronounces six. You can imagine these two getting jammed. The PC, for some reason or other, always thinks the auditor is saying five when he's saying six, and six when he's say-ing five. What do you think's going to happen in R3R, see?3 So therefore, it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible. That's where the R-factor comes in. Be comprehensible. Not only from standpoint of accent, but sense: the comprehen-sibility. Diction enters into this. I can see some university in the future teaching \"Auditing English, \" you see, or \"Auditing Speech. \" Actually, it'd be a big department, because you'd have to have the translation of all this stuff into German; you have a translation and then its enunciation in German – same factor would apply, don't you see? The same factor in Swed-ish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, all of this stuff. How do you audit these guys, you see? Well, all right. So you're going to have auditors perhaps from that country, but remember, they will have the same frailties of pronunciation. How about translation of line plots, what line plots actually sum up into. Some of these countries don't have good terminology to follow through on a line plot. And yet the line plot will only fire on the right terminology. Don't you see, there's a lot of stuff to be worked out on this particular factor. But there's stuff to be worked out on it right now. An auditor who is not comprehended by the PC isn't doing his TR 1 right. And there-fore the R-factor is very germane to whether the communication cycle can take place at all. And if you say \"Do fish...?\" You can't do that. Do you see that nothing happens and no com-munication cycle takes place at all? So the R-factor can do a complete wipeout. Interesting, isn't it? Then you have the PC who doesn't want to be audited. He doesn't want to be audited at all. Well, how on earth can you start that one going? Because you've got to have a communi-cation cycle before you can even put an R-factor in. See, that's worse end to. He just won't listen to any part of Scientology. This is not a speech defect, but actually requires a lower-level process which gets him to talk about Scientology anyhow. We used to have one, \"Well, tell me why you shouldn't be audited.\" Tricky kind of an approach of this particular character. This is all very feasible. But this comes under the heading of getting a communication cycle started, and the auditor is very often confronted by that. So there is something which actually is prior to the communication cycle, see, and that you are very often happy to see exists. And when it goes out the window, you very often are sitting there with your eyes popped – you don't know quite what to do. Well, the thing is, you can't get the communication cycle going.   3 Editor's note: At that time, part of R3R was dating, what means the auditor had to call out numbers."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 14 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 54 17.11.12 Now, very often the R-factor is out – wildly. Or the affinity factor is out. The affinity factor is out because the PC is being very misemotional. Well, oddly enough, you can do an ARC Break Assessment today, and find the bypassed charge and use that to complete the communication cycle which you started and which wouldn't complete, because it is the gener-ated charge. And that was why I showed you, particularly, the expanded point of the V. What has happened there is inadvertently, one way or the other, the point of the V has gone awry. The auditor somehow or another or the PC somehow or another has restimulated a charge which has then not been originated either to the auditor or the PC. See, an overres-timulation has taken place there. It's quite easy to do. It's quite easy, though, to pick up these days. So, these ARC Break Assessments is [are] a pilot of completing the communication cycle and getting the auditing cycle going again. See how that fits in? All right. Now, that's all very well to talk about the auditing cycle and say that's just all there is to the auditing cycle, but there's (I mentioned a moment ago) the repetitive audit-ing cycle. This cycle going over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, is a specialized activity. There's an auditing cycle of one cycle and then there is the auditing cycle of the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle, see? That's a different thing – doing it many times. You get your repetitive process, and this is where that gets you in trou-ble. There is a point where this over-and-over-again gets you in trouble. You must, you absolutely must, complete a communication – all communication cy-cles of an auditing cycle. Therefore, you must complete an auditing cycle. But you must also differentiate the difference between one auditing cycle and the repetitive auditing cycle. And why must you generate this difference? It's because one auditing cycle must be completed, and a repetitive auditing cycles are very often overdone, and don't need to be completed in some cases. There's a difference. Ooohh, where am I leading you now? You will say, \"What's this? What's this? You mean you don't flatten a process?\" Yes, you always flatten a process. But some auditor can get so eager-beaver with his series – which is flatten the process, see – that he forgets why he is flattening the process. And that is your dominant cycle – is ability regained. Why are you auditing the person in the first place? To do an auditing cycle? To do a series of auditing cycles, known as repetitive cycles, so that you can get a flattened process? Now, you say, \"Well, you're doing that to flatten the tone arm action.\" No, that's right there with repetitive auditing cycle; that belongs right there with repetitive auditing cycle, don't you see? There is something that dominates all of this; there's a greater domination. I'll show you what these points are. This will intrigue you; I don't think perhaps many of you have ever looked at this before. [begins to draw the fourth graph] Here's your big cy-cle, which is major cycle. See, that's a major auditing cycle. And its proper name is Ability Regained. Ha. I can see some of you now. You're auditing engrams like mad and you hit this key engram and you hit the thing and you all of a sudden got an OT on your hands, and the fellow gets up and stretches and that sort of thing, and he's getting all ready to square away, and he's wondering what he should do with the body, and – you know? He's all set and you're going"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITING 15 SHSBC-319 – 25.7.63 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 55 17.11.12 on: \"All right. What is the duration of this engram?\" Well, that's just too much dedication to this next cycle, see? And this you can call the Process Cycle – Process Auditing Cycle. This, of course, is just your single auditing cycle. Your progress of case is up, like this, see? Now, if you don't have your single cycle down, then of course you can't do a repetitive cycle. Can't do a repeti-tive auditing cycle, you can't flatten the process, in other words, you see? Now, a process is flattened by tone arm action out, no comm lag left, or cognition – I'll draw you a picture of these things – or ability regained. [begins to draw fifth graph] Now, you understand, we're going here from the Process Cycle to this Ability Regained cycle, you un-derstand? We're going just between those two. You understand here, that if you can't do a single cycle, then it's certain that you're not going to be very successful in completing any process auditing cycle – which is the repetitive cycles – and if you can't do this, then you cer-tainly are not going to produce the upper one of ability regained. See? That's obvious. But what is a flat process cycle? You sometimes come a cropper on this and don't real-ize what you're coming up against. Now, three equal commands – this is the lousiest one, see? Three equal commands. That's smelly, but you say the process is flat, see? Safe to leave it. Well, you'd better leave it at the CCHs, otherwise your PC is going to start being unhappy. But remember that they must be confidently done, or something like that. You can't have \"He screamed three times,\" you see? You very often – you'd be surprised – you very often have this question asked of you. You have some HPA student sometime saying, \"Well, but he was angry the same way for three different commands, so therefore the process was flat.\" Now, your next level up here – your next level – is a more interesting level from a standpoint of that, but it's perfectly safe to flatten it on a cognition. Guy gets a cognition: \"Oh, yes!\" see? Even a minor cognition, do you understand? That's not a major cognition; that's, you know, minor cognition – he had a win. \"Hey, well, what do you know! That's why ele-phants fly.\" You know, that's all set. Hasn't too much to do with the process, but you sort of stop the process at that point. The PC is not going to suffer. You understand that these first two levels that I'm talking to you about, of \"How do you flatten a process?\" are just – oh, that's awful shabby sort of a way to look at the thing, but that's just the minimum. That's the minimum security. Now let's get to the real one, which is TA Flat – flat by TA. That's your auditing cy-cles, repetitive auditing cycles, and you no longer have TA action on it here, don't you see? And up above this – and there are two levels of this, to make it better – is a Major Cognition. You'll see that sometimes. You'll see that sometimes. That takes precedence. You haven't got the TA flat, but all of a sudden he cognites all of the level is flat you're running. You'll see him go pow! pow! pow! – off the meter. You've got – \"failure to scream\" was the level you were running, \"about cats.\" And he says, \"Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

He hasn't got any level there left to run. In fact, continuing the process after one of those things is invalidation of the PC. Now, this is Ability Regained and that takes precedence over all of these. This guy couldn't walk and you're halfway through this and you haven't got the TA flat and so forth and he hasn't had any cognition you're thinking about and your processing cycle's a repetitive cy-cle, and all of a sudden the PC says, \"Hey, what do you know!\" you know? And he throws the electrodes down sideways and he gets up and starts walking, you know? \"Eh! Yeah, I can do it!\" Good, are you going to flatten the process now? [laughter] You may think I'm pointing out something ridiculous, but you do this quite often. You spoil it. You've got to know when to cut and run. See what I mean? What you got coming right up is you're all of a sudden going to make an OT – and continue to flatten the process. Now, let's look at this, then. This single cycle – you got to have that one down cold, and there's no doubt about that! Got to be able to complete that. You got to be able to com-plete it repetitively, time after time again, and that's for flattening out a process. And the thing which takes dominance over that, of course, is you flatten out the process until you run into the ability regained. Now, sometimes you don't run into an ability regained and you go on and flatten the process, and have to do another process before you regain the ability, don't you see? Some-times you have to flatten a lot of these before you get up to that. Sometimes you halfway flat-ten one and you're suddenly up to it. You see, but I'm just talking about auditing cycles – re-petitive auditing cycles – and where they're aiming toward. You're aiming toward always get-ting this one completed, but the only thing that interrupts it, in any single cycle, is a cognition. Similar to repetitive cycles, ability regained – a single auditing cycle that you are doing runs into a cognition. What do you do in a case like that? Well, you don't spoil the cognition by completing the auditing cycle. You can start another auditing cycle, if it is necessary to do so. To that degree, to those modifications, these other things must be pushed through to the bitter end. All right. Well, I've given you the dope on this. I imagine that you find this somewhat intriguing. It's a better look, perhaps, than we have had at it. I've been meaning to get around to it for some time, actually, and I've been breaking it down myself so that it could be talked about better. And you're seeing here a bit of gain; this isn't something which I've known all the time and so forth and so on. But I have been studying this ability regained in relationship to finishing a whole series of auditing cycles, and then I started breaking down the single au-diting cycle in its communication cycles and got it into a more communicable form. And I think you'll find this very useful, both in teaching people and in auditing, yourself. I wish you luck. Just go on and audit. Don't try to make me guilty by suddenly knock-ing the ball into the rough because you've lost the grip. Okay.

There are basically two communication cycles between the Auditor and the Pc that make up the auditing cycle. They are cause, distance, effect with the Auditor at cause and the Pc at effect, and cause, distance, effect with the Pc at cause and the Auditor at effect. Cause ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Distance ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Effect Auditor PCEffect ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Distance ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Cause These are completely distinct one from the other. The only thing that connects them and makes an auditing cycle, is the fact that the Auditor, on his communication cycle, has calculatingly restimulated something in the Pc which is then discharged by the Pc's communi-cation cycle. What the Auditor has said has caused a restimulation and then the Pc needs to answer the question to get rid of the restimulation. If the Pc does not answer the question he doesn't get rid of the restimulation. That is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game. (Some auditing breaks down because the Auditor is unwilling to restimulate the Pc.)"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 2 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 62 17.11.12 There is a little extra communication cycle on here. The Auditor says, \"Thank you\" and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle. C ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Command ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ E Auditor E ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Answer ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ C PC C ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Acknowledgment ¡¡¡¡¡ E Now there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle. There is another little shadow cycle: it is the observation of \"Has the Pc received the auditing command?\" This is such a tiny \"cause\" that nearly all Auditors who are having any trouble finding out what's going on with the Pc are missing this one. \"Does he receive it?\" Actually there is another cause in here and you're missing that one when you're not perceiving the Pc. You can tell by looking at the Pc that he didn't hear or understand what you'd said or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving. Whatever that message is in response, it rides on this line. Did pc receive, e ¡¡¡¡¡¡ understand and ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ c answer command?

Then all of a sudden somewhere along the line there is an ARC Break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things go wrong. Well, they actually needn't ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in. What is the Pc doing completely aside from answering? Well, what he is doing is this other little sub-cause, distance, effect line. Another of these tiny lines is the cause, distance, effect line of – \"Is the Pc ready to re-ceive an auditing command?\" This is the Pc causing and it rides up the line across distance, is received at the Auditor and the Auditor perceives that the Pc is doing something else."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 3 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 63 17.11.12 It is an important one and you find that Auditors goof that one very often; the Pc's at-tention is still on a prior action. Now here's another one – \"Has the Pc received the acknowledgement?\" Sometimes you violate this one. You have been acknowledging but you've never seen that he didn't re-ceive the acknowledgement. That perception has another little tiny one in it that actually comes on this line; it is – \"Has the Pc answered everything?\" The Auditor is watching the Pc and the Auditor sees that the Pc has not said all that the Pc is going to say. You sometimes get into trouble with Pcs that way. Everything at \"cause\" hasn't moved on down the line to effect and you haven't perceived all of the \"effect\" and you go into the acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself. That's chopping the Pc's communication. You didn't let the communication cycle flow to its complete end. The acknowledgement takes place and of course it can't go through as it's an inflowing line and it jams right there on the Pc's incomplete outflowing answer line. e ¡¡ Is the pc ready for the command? ¡¡¡¡ c Did pc receive, e ¡¡¡¡¡¡ understand and ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ c answer command?

So if you want to break it all down, there are six communication cycles which make up one auditing cycle. Six, not more than six unless you start running into trouble. If you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes a mish-mash of one kind or another. There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at the point of the Pc. It's a little additional one and it's between the Pc and himself. This is him talking to him. You're listening to the inside of his skull when you're examining it. It actually can be mul-tiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind. This happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isn't being done. And of course it's the hardest to detect when it isn't being done. Pc says: \"Yes. \" Now what has the Pc said yes to? And sometimes you are insufficiently curious. And that in es-sence is this internal perception of line. It includes this cause, distance, effect backflash here – \"Is the Pc answering the command I gave him?\" So with this, there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle. It is a multiple cycle."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 4 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 64 17.11.12 A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention, atten-tion, duplication and understanding. How many of these are there in one auditing cycle? You'd have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain a few more. If a Pc indicates that he didn't get the command (cause, distance, effect), the Auditor would give a repeat of it (cause, distance, effect) and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle, so you've got 9 – because there was a flub. So anything unusual that happens in a session adds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle, but they are still all part of the auditing cycle. Repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, is doing the same cycle over and over again. Now there is a completely different cycle inside the same pattern. The Pc is going to originate and it's got nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The only thing they have in com-mon is that they both use communication cycles. But this is brand new. The Pc says some-thing that is not germane to what the Auditor is saying or doing and you actually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it. Don't get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cycle. Consider it its own drill. You shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected. And, by the way, this handles such a thing as the Pc originates by throwing down the cans. That's still an origin. It has nothing to do with the auditing cycle. Maybe the auditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in. Well, the auditing cycle can't com-plete because this origin cycle is now here. That doesn't mean that this origin has precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cycle can resume. So this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause, distance, effect. The Pc causes some-thing. The Auditor now has to originate as the Auditor has to understand what the Pc is talk-ing about – and then acknowledge. And to the degree that it is hard to understand, you have the cause, distance, effect of the Auditor trying to clarify this thing; and every time he asks a question, he's got a new communication cycle. You can't put a machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood. And this must be done in such a way that the Pc isn't merely repeating his same origination or the Pc will go frantic. He'll go frantic because he can't get off that line – he's stuck in time and it really upsets him. So the Auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the Pc is talking about. And there's really no substitute for simply trying to understand it. There is a little line where the Pc indicates he is going to say something. This is a line (cause, distance, effect) that comes before the origination takes place so you don't run into a jam and you don't give the auditing command. The effect at the Auditor's point is to shut up and let him. There can be another little line (cause, distance, effect) where the Auditor indi-cates he is listening. Then there is the origination, the Auditor's acknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the Pc received the acknowledgement. That's your origination cycle."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN 5 BAS-04 – HCOB 23.5.71R IV THE AUDITING CYCLE LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 65 17.11.12 An Auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on a scrap of paper. Just take a look at all these things; mock up a session and all of a sudden it will become very straight how these things are and you won't have a couple of them jammed up. What's mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused a couple of communication cycles to such a degree that you don't differentiate that they exist. That's why you sometimes chop a Pc who is trying to answer the question. You know whether the Pc has answered the question or not. How did you know? Even if it's telepathy it's cause, distance, effect. It doesn't matter how that communication took place, you know whether he's answered the command by a communication cycle. I don't care how you sense this. If you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if that's giv-ing you trouble (and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it) then it should be broken down and analyzed at a time when you're auditing something nice and simple. I've given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle; maybe in working it over you can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they are all there and if you made someone go through each one painstakingly, you would find out where his auditing cy-cle is jammed up. It isn't necessarily jammed up on his ability to say \"Thank you\". It may very well be jammed up in another quarter. L.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says, \"Your needle is float-ing.\" This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the sub-ject of \"Floating Needles\". A lot of by-passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called end phenomena. End phenomena is defined as \"those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended\". It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended. 1. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 2 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 68 17.11.12 But that's if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating nee-dle. If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know – so that's . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,\" he can upset the pc's bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won't ap-pear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor's pre-mature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc's end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition. C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N van-ished and TA rising, requiring \"rehab\") can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a begin-ning F/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating\" can be a chop. Also it's a false report if it isn't widely floating and will keep floating."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 69 17.11.12 Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor's Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changed to read \"A real wide F/N\". Here it's a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problem is not difficult. I follow this rule – I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don't ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it's his case we are han-dling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc's cognition. If it isn't there, I give the next command due. If it still isn't there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure or Release, depending on whether it's Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, \"Your needle is floating.\" DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn't been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn't grinding. It's waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon. The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an era-sure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in.

Keeping Scientology Working Series 26 OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN The term \"Out Tech\" means that Scientology is not being applied or is not being cor-rectly applied. When Tech is in we mean that Scientology is being applied and is being cor-rectly applied. By Tech is meant technology, referring of course to the application of the pre-cise scientific drills and processes of Scientology. Technology means the methods of applica-tion of an art or science as opposed to mere knowledge of the science or art itself. One could know all about the theory of motor cars and the science of building them and the art of de-signing them and still not be able to build, plan or drive one. The practices of building, plan-ning or driving a motor car are quite distinct from the theory, science and art of motor cars. An auditor is not just a Scientologist. He or she is one who can apply it. Thus the tech-nology of Scientology is its actual application to oneself, a preclear or the situations one en-counters in life. Tech implies use. There is a wide gap between mere knowledge and the application of that knowledge. When we say tech is out, we might also say, \"While that unit or person may know all about Scientology, that person does not actually apply it.\" A skilled auditor knows not only Scientology but how to apply the technology to self, pcs and life. Many persons auditing have not yet crossed over from \"knowing about\" to \"applying\". Thus you see them fooling about with pcs. When a skilled auditor sees a critical pc he knows bang – pc has a withhold and pulls it. That's because this auditor's tech is in. Meaning he knows what to do with his data."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 2 HCOB 13.9.65R LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 74 17.11.12 Some other person who knows a lot of Scientology, has had courses and all that, yet sees a critical pc and then tries to add up everything he knows about pcs and stumbles about and then decides on a Zero pc it's a new thing that's wrong that's never been seen before. What's the difference here? It's the difference between a person who knows but cannot apply and a skilled technician who can apply the knowledge. Most golfers know that you have to keep your eye on the ball just before, during and after you hit it. That's the basic datum of powerful, long drives down the fairway. So if this is so well known then why do so few golfers do it? They have arrived at a point of knowing they must. They have not yet arrived at a point of being able to. Then their heads get so scrambled, seeing all their bad drives which didn't go down the fairway, that they buy rabbits feet or new clubs or study ballistics. In short, not being able to do it, they disperse and do something else. All auditors go through this. All of them, once trained, know the right processes. Then they have to graduate up to doing the right processes. Observation plays an enormous role in this. The auditor is so all thumbs with his meter and unfamiliar tools he has no time or attention to see what goes on with the pc. So for 15 years lots of auditors made releases without ever noticing it. They were so involved in know-ing and so unskilled in applying, they never saw the ball go down the fairway for a 200 yard drive! So they began to do something else and squirrel. There was the pc going release, but the auditor, unskilled as a technician for all his knowledge of the science, never saw the audit-ing work even though even the auditing done that badly did work. Do you get the point? You have to know your tools very very well to see past them! An auditor who squir-rels, who fools about with a pc, who fumbles around and seldom gets results just isn't suffi-ciently familiar with a session, its patter, his meter and the mind to see past them to the pc. Drill overcomes this. The keynote of the skilled technician is that he is a product of practice. He has to know what he is trying to do and what elements he is handling. Then he can produce a result. I'll give you an example: I told an auditor to look over a past session of known date on a pc and find what was missed in that session. Something must have been missed as the pc's tone arm action collapsed in that session and ever afterwards was nil. So this auditor looked for a \"missed withhold from the auditor in that session\". The ordered repair was a complete dud. Why? This auditor did not know that anything could be missed except a withhold of the hidden overt type. He didn't know there could be an inadvertent withhold wherein the pc thinks he is withholding because the auditor didn't hear or acknowledge. This auditor didn't know that an item on a list could be missed and tie up TA. But if he did know these things he didn't know them well enough to do them. A second more skilled auditor took over and bang! the missed item on the list was quickly found. The more skilled auditor simply asked, \"In that session what was missed?\" and promptly got it. The former auditor had taken a simple order, \"Find what was missed in that session,\" and turned it into something else: \"What withhold was missed in that session?\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 3 HCOB 13.9.65R LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 75 17.11.12 His skill did not include applying a simple direct order as auditing looked very com-plex to him as he had so much trouble with doing it. You can train somebody in all the data and not have an auditor. A real auditor has to be able to apply the data to the pc. Importances play a huge part in this. I had a newly graduated darkroom photographic technician at work. It was pathetic to see the inability to apply important data. The virtues of ancient equipment and strange tricks to get seldom required effects were all at his fingertips. But he did not know that you wiped developer off your hands before loading fresh film. Con-sequently he ruined every picture taken with any film he loaded. He did not know you washed chemicals out of bottles before you put different chemicals in them. Yet he could quote by the yard formulas not in use for 50 years! He knew photography. He could not apply what he knew. Soon he was straying all over the place trying to find new developers and papers and new methods. Whereas all he had to do was learn how to wash his hands and dry them before handling new film. I also recall a 90-day wonder in World War II who came aboard in fresh new gold braid and with popped eyes stared at the wheel and compass. He said he'd studied all about them but had never seen any before and had often wondered if they really were used. How he imagined ships were steered and guided beyond the sight of land is a mystery. Maybe he thought it was all done by telepathy or an order from the Bureau of Navigation! Alter-is and poor results do not really come from not-know. They come from can't-apply. Drills, drills, drills and the continual repetition of the important data handle this condi-tion of can't-apply. If you drill auditors hard and repeat often enough basic auditing facts, they eventually disentangle themselves and begin to do a job of application. IMPORTANT DATA The truly important data in an auditing session are so few that one could easily memo-rize them in a few minutes. From case supervisor or auditor viewpoint: 1. If an auditor isn't getting results either he or the pc is doing something else. 2. There is no substitute for knowing how to run and read a meter perfectly. 3. An auditor must be able to read, comprehend and apply HCO Bs and instructions. 4. An auditor must be familiar enough with what he's doing and the mechanics of the mind to be able to observe what is happening with the pc. 5. There is no substitute for perfect TRs. 6. An auditor must be able to duplicate the auditing command and observe what is hap-pening and continue or end processes according to their results on the pc."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 4 HCOB 13.9.65R LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 76 17.11.12 7. An auditor must be able to see when he's released the pc and end off quickly and eas-ily with no shock or overrun. 8. An auditor must have observed results of his standard auditing and have confidence in it. CASE REACTION The auditor and the Case Supervisor must know the only six reasons a case does not advance. They are: 1. Pc is Suppressive. 2. Pc is always a Potential Trouble Source if he Roller Coasters and only finding the right suppressive will clean it up. No other action will. There are no other reasons for a Roller Coaster (loss of gain obtained in auditing). 3. One must never audit an ARC Broken pc for a minute even but must locate and indi-cate the by-passed charge at once. To do otherwise will injure the pc's case. 4. A present time problem of long duration prevents good gain and sends the pc into the back track. 5. The only reasons a pc is critical are a withhold or a misunderstood word and there is NO reason other than those. And in trying to locate a withhold it is not a motivator done to the pc but something the pc has done. 6. Continuing overts hidden from view are the cause of no case gain (see number 1, Sup-pressive). The only other possible reason a pc does not gain on standard processing is the pc or the auditor failed to appear for the session. Now honestly, aren't those easy? But a trainee fumbling about with meter and what he learned in a bog of unfamiliarity will always tell you it is something else than the above. Such pull motivators, audit ARC Broken pcs who won't even look at them, think Roller Coaster is caused by eating the wrong cereal and remedy it all with some new wonderful action that collapses the lot. ASSESSMENT You could meter assess the first group 1 to 8 on an auditor and the right one would fall and you could fix it up. You could meter assess the second group 1 to 6 on a pc and get the right answer every time that would remedy the case. You have a C/S Series 53 which lists any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan and you have a Green Form which covers the things bugging a case. Plus there are"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 5 HCOB 13.9.65R LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 77 17.11.12 dozens of other Prepared Lists which are designed to handle various things that can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. HCOB 29 April 80 PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND PURPOSE, summarizes the various types of Prepared Lists and their use. When I tell you these are the answers, I mean it. I don't use anything else. And I catch my sinning auditor or bogged down pc every time. To give you an idea of the simplicity of it, a pc says she is \"tired\" and therefore has a somatic. Well, that can't be it because it's still there. So I ask for a problem and after a few given the pc hasn't changed so it's not a problem. I ask for an ARC Break and bang! I find one. Knowing the principles of the mind, and as I observe pcs, I see it's better but not gone and ask for a previous one like it. Bang! That's the one and it blows completely. I know that if the pc says it's A and it doesn't blow, it must be something else. I know that it's one of six things. I assess by starting down the list. I know when I've got it by looking at the pc's reac-tions (or the meter's). And I handle it accordingly. Also, quite vitally, I know it's a limited number of things. And even more vitally I know by long experience as a technician that I can handle it fully and proceed to do so. There is no \"magic\" touch in auditing like the psychiatrist believes. There is only skilled touch, using known data and applying it. Until you have an auditor familiar with his tools, cases and results you don't have an auditor. You have a collected confusion of hope and despair rampant amongst non-stable data. Study, drill and familiarity overcome these things. A skilled technician knows what gets results and gets them. So drill them. Drill into them the above data until they chant them in their sleep. And finally comes the dawn. They observe the pc before them, they apply standard tech. And wonderful to behold there are the results of Scientology, complete. Tech is in. L.

Well, you probably won't applaud so loud when you hear the kind of a lecture I'm about to give you. You know – mean. [part missing] This is what date? Audience: September 21st, AD 15. Twenty-first of September. Isn't that awfully significant in some way? What happened on the 21st of September? Fall or something? All right. I gave a lecture on it. I guess that's what's significant. [part missing] Well, you see, I have reformed. I have reformed, and I've decided to lecture to you once in a while. But, truth of the matter is, there are so many lectures on tapes, you see, it's rather like gilding it all and putting an unnecessary coat of paint on it and that sort of thing, you see? But the truth of the matter is, what's happening at this particular moment is we're in the eagle's-eye-view position. Do you see? An eagle's-eye view. That is, we're way up at the top of the Gradation Chart looking back down the lines. Now, that's a very optimum position to be in, because you can see at once what's necessary and what's unnecessary. You can take a look at this and you can say, \"Well, that stuff over there, that just went into a slight diversion, don't you see? And this material over here – well, that was not too important. That datum right there, though, boy, that's right straight through. That's important.\" Do you see? So that when you're taking an eagle's-eye view of the situation, you can select importances of data. Now, the one thing that the poor bloke down at the bottom of the line, about – along about HAS – he's got an entirely different attitude. He's got an entirely different attitude. He's in a sea of data, and this sea of data is overwhelmingly and overpoweringly general. Every drop of water in the ocean has the same importance of every drop of water in the ocean. He's unable to differentiate between one drop and another. He's in this sad state, then, of drowning. Now, he isn't drowning – actually, he doesn't start his drowning in Scientology. He starts his drowning in life, and that is much more general than Scientology at its early stages. Scientol-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 2 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 80 17.11.12 ogy at least tells you \"Scientology is important.\" But life is liable to tell you \"life is unimpor-tant\" and \"life is important\" almost in the same breath. In other words, did you ever hear anybody say, \"Well, life is unimportant?\" Hm? \"It doesn't matter,\" and so forth. And then they say, \"Well, life is very important and earnest,\" you know, next breath. And then they say, \"You should revere your parents. The trouble with you is – what's wrong with you is you've revered your parents.\" See? \"Now, the trouble with you is, Mr. Jones, is sex. Here – haven't had enough.\" And when you get all through, you feel pretty groggy. You start going through school, for instance (when you pick up a body, you get into kindergarten, and so forth): Every teacher tells you that every datum in every part of a subject is very important. And not only that, but each teacher tells you that only that subject is impor-tant really. And when you get all through, you've been told so much is important that you generally just go on a retreat from the whole thing. And the hardest thing that a thetan has to do, and the most significant thing he can re-cover across the boards is his ability to evaluate importances – what's important and what isn't. Now, processing, the basic scheme of processing – what is it? The duplicative question. The examination of the mind for the apparent answer to the question. The knocking out, then, of this, that and the other thing until the individual can take a look at it and see before him some data that is important. Do you understand? Now, you mustn't underestimate the value of the administration of processing as an entirely separate thing than what is processed. In Scientology we have developed the repeti-tive process which permits the individual to examine his mind and environment, and out of it select the unimportances and importances. Now, yes, additionally he knocks out of restimula-tion, he does a little erasure, he gets things out of his road, he clarifies his view, he can see better – oh yes, all of those things too. But remember that all he's basically doing is taking a look at the situation and finding out what is important and what isn't important, but to do that he has to find out what is and what isn't. That is even more fundamental. So in all of the processing as you come up the line, you are following, in actual fact, a duplicative system of questioning, which is in itself, new, strange, and totally unique to Scien-tology, which makes the other things work. Other things work because of this. Do you see? So it comes back, in its original stages, to the auditor. Now, yes, an individual can lis-ten to a few tapes, and he can read a few bulletins and read a few books. Yes, he'll get a great clarification of various things, because all the time what's happening is is I'm presenting him with certain vistas of existence and conditions of existence, and he's examining them, and he's taking them in or knocking them out and handling it and reorienting himself, don't you see? Now, as he does this, he however is straightening up his own mind. And his real gain, when the chips are all the way down, largely depends upon the auditor. And the auditor is very, very important. Now, the individual who is drowning in a sea of life receives a repetitive question from an auditor, and his statements on it are – the pc's statements on it are handled and as-ised, and those statements are then acknowledged by the auditor, making a full cycle of the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 3 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 81 17.11.12 situation – only then can get up to a point of where he himself might, all by himself, confront his own mind. He's got his own mind and life so mixed up that man has completely forgotten what a mind was all about and, in a large numb – the majority of cases, isn't even aware of the fact he has a mind. He thinks the mind is himself. He's made the same mistake that the religionist makes. And the religionist has a ball; he talks about, \"You must save your soul.\" How you are going to save your soul, I'm not sure, see, because your soul happens to be you. But it would be too self-centered and egotistical for you to go out on an all-out crush of saving you, wouldn't it? So we have to divide this out so that it is \"save your soul.\" And where is your soul? \"Well, my soul is over there,\" some theetie-weetie will tell you. \"Yes, I am over there. Oh, I know I'm exteriorized now. I am over there by the radiator.\" Now, how can an individual be over there by the radiator? Well, he can't be over there by the radiator, because if he were exteriorized he'd be \"Oh, I'm over here by the radiator.\" Do you see that? So what is all this now? It means that the importance – the big important gain... These all look important to you as you go up the line. They all look important to you. But the big ones – the big ones, actually, are not at the top; the big ones are getting started. And you get some of the most startling gains from some fellow who walks in off the street, and he starts to orient himself just by the fact that Scientology exists, that there is a body of knowledge that leads somewhere, that there is a road out. He starts orienting himself; he gets tremendous gain. Now, under expert handling by an auditor using a duplicative question, he is able to look at life and his own mind and himself and his circumstances and so forth, and he's able to come up with additional gains. And we've got tremendous numbers of things that can happen to this individual on improvement, because it's a long ladder; it isn't a short ladder. Of course, we live in a society which rather demands of the individual that he takes a twenty-two-gauge needle and receives it in the gluteus maximus with just one shot, and at that moment goes, \"Whee, I'm Clear!\" You see? Society has originated, \"All you've got to do is eat one bowl of Wheaties and you are Superman.\" Well, I'm afraid you have to work for it. It isn't that Scientology is slow; it's that man has gone so far down. To dig him out at all is pretty heroic! And the first step in making him come up the line is, of course, making him aware of the fact that such a thing as Scientology exists. This alone will give him a start. But he actually makes his real first gains on becoming aware that there is a road out. Because he's sure there is none; he's heard that before. He's been told that all he had to do was eat a bowl of Wheaties and he was Superman, you see? And he ate bowls and bowls of Wheaties and he's still not Superman. So what's the – what's the dependency here? A basic dependency is upon your Course Supervisor – the person who is teaching Scientology. That's a basic dependency. There's a slightly prior dependency. That's the fellow who disseminates Scientology. He's doing some-thing for the society all like that – just like that. Even though you get somebody up into argu-ing of \"is it or is it not,\" he's better off than not being aware of it at all."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 4 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 82 17.11.12 So you get the disseminator of Scientology, you get the teacher of Scientology – as in an introductory lecture, as in early classes, that sort of thing – these people are performing a tremendously important function. And it's a function that you, knowing the gains that can be achieved from auditing itself, are prone to overlook. If you present this acceptably and if you teach it so that it reaches in its early stages, you will find the people right in front of your face are experiencing remarkable recoveries up along the road. These things you don't ordinarily see, because they're not on an E-Meter, they're not being categorized as an individual. But I'll give you an example: I took a rather raw crew of students one time and I did nothing but lecture to them – nothing but lecture to them at all – and got some of the best graph changes I have ever seen in an ACC. I didn't – they didn't re-ceive any auditing for six weeks at all – no auditing at all. They just had lectures. Now, some individual hears about Scientology, and having heard about it – that there is a road out – hope resurges. He thinks, \"Well, maybe I'm not totally licked.\" Well, that is something like finding a straw in the middle of a vast ocean of nowhere. Something exists. Now, the suppressive counters this, of course, by saying it doesn't exist, and it isn't, and it isn't any good, and it isn't that. Because all the suppressive is saying, \"Boy, the last thing in the world I want to have happen to you is that you get any better. Because if you got any better, you would then get stronger. And I'm having a hard enough time murdering you now\". So therefore – therefore, the person who begins with the dissemination of it – he reaches people; he's giving them the straw in the very tumultuous ocean, something to grip on to. Then the fellow who tells them about it, who teaches them – why, he gets another upward movement. And then it comes into the hands of the auditor. Now, in the auditor it's in very sure hands, because there's ways to audit and ways not to audit, and there's ways to do a good job on a pc and ways not to. And the big upsurging gains that the individual makes that can be marked on a chart, and so forth, are of course found in auditing sessions. But remember that if the disseminator and the teacher did not do their job first, that person never gets into the chair of the auditor. So the biggest mistake you can make is not to disseminate Scientology and to teach it in an unacceptable fashion. Those are big steps that can be very badly muffed. Now, when you reach into a society at large and try to get some common denomina-tors that you can get people to agree with and walk on forward with and so forth, you're talk-ing to very confused and very distracted people, so that you actually could have many ap-proaches and probably many answers as to how to do it. One of the soundest of those answers is speak to them about communication and teach them simply, one, that Scientology does ex-ist, that he has got some friends somewhere in the world, that there is somebody interested in what happens to him. This is all part of the message that Scientology exists. And then your next line that you throw to him, and so on, is that there is some value in being able to communicate. You teach him the datum, really, that if he could communicate to his environment better, he could handle it better. Now, that's dicey, because some fellows know that if you communicate you will be punished. Do you understand? So you're selling across that line that he's afraid to communicate and you tell him, \"Well, it's all right,\" and he"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 5 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 83 17.11.12 eventually does get the idea that if he could just communicate a bit better, he could handle his life better. Now, of course, that's – that is one of these horribly obvious truisms that you as a – as an auditor are so familiar with that you forget that this is a new, strange and startling datum to the man in the street: That if an alarm clock is rolling off the table, if you stopped the alarm clock from rolling off the table, it would be better than letting it drop on the floor. And there-fore, when you reach over and stop the alarm clock from falling off the table, you are then handling your environment. But if you don't know enough to reach over and stop the alarm clock from falling off the table, you are not handling your environment. You get the idea? Well, he agrees with this. \"Of course,\" he says, \"Well, that's silly!\" And you say, \"Well now, if you talk to your wife about the situation, it probably would straighten up bet-ter.\" Now, that's getting adventurous. And he looks that over. So you fix it up on the basis that he might... You say, \"Well now, he might be – she might be rather upset at first, but it'd come out better in the long run.\" And nervously he tries to communicate to somebody and he has some wins, and he has some loses, and gradually it moves into his perimeter that there is some truth in this: that if you communicate in your environment, you can handle it better, and if you don't communicate at all, you don't handle it at all, and you just get worse. Now, when the auditor moves in on it, and this fellow has never been able to pass a driving test in his life, and the auditor says, \"Touch that car,\" and \"Withdraw from that car,\" and so on, and he puts him through a familiarization of just a Touch Assist on a car, the fel-low goes out and passes his driving test. Now, that's very convincing. That's very convincing. He finds out all kinds of wild things happen with a – such a basic and fundamental thing as a Touch Assist. He's now being brought up right, he can now see the gains and so forth. So that your first wins on dissemination and teaching Scientology do not naturally have to follow a perfect line. They – it can be a pretty wobbly line and you can still get them along it. But when it comes to that auditing line, that, if it is wobbly, will sink him. In other words, our first touchy operation that we've really got to know our business on is auditing. And that doesn't matter whether you're auditing a little child or you're auditing a dog or you're auditing somebody on very upstage processes. It doesn't matter; that auditing has got to be good. It's got to contain its auditing cycle. It's got to be addressed to the general condition of the person whom you're auditing. The questions have to be understood and acceptable to the person you are auditing. These conditions have got to be straight and you've got to be able to do a good job. So that, although it's very important to move the person in toward auditing, remember that when you have moved him in toward auditing, then we are now in a position where tech-nology is technology with an exclamation point. Up to that time it's debatable. It's debatable what is the best way to disseminate Scientology, because you're disseminating into such a confusion: Life as it exists. It's also debatable what's the best thing to lecture to people about Scientology. See, that's also debatable. Now, it's a little less debatable, but it's still debatable, and we can have lots of opinions on this. Do you see?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 6 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 84 17.11.12 The only common denominator we have – well, we tell them about communication, and that sort of thing; people seem, in general, to be happy with this. But that's still subject to a number of questions. See? And we can debate on this and find out this system is better, that system is better, what you tell students when they first come into Scientology should be, and then we can have opinions on it, and we've had personal experiences. You get the idea. But when we move it into tech we are no longer in a debatable sphere. That is such a highly sophisticated, highly developed technology, that it works only if it is right along the line – one, two, three, four. Do you see that? So we move out of the debatability of life into the precision of auditing. And auditing is very precise. Now, when we say technology is out – although we might also include that we have Instructors who refuse to let students study bulletins or something like this – technology would be out, you see, if the Instructor was never in the classroom, and wouldn't give the stu-dents any bulletins and refused to teach them anything; we would say that it was out. But anybody would see that it was out. Do you understand? Anybody could see that fellow wasn't teaching Scientology and so forth. That – well, that's easy to see! Ah, but auditing – the ability to observe auditing and tell whether or not it is good or bad – is far; far more precise. That is much harder to do. We can observe whether the teach-ing is right or wrong; that's easy. But to observe whether the auditing is right or wrong, that's much harder to do. In the first place, the auditor can make little, tiny mistakes – little micro-scopic mistakes – that sufficiently upset the preclear that the preclear then acts up and the casual observer would then say, \"That is simply a difficult preclear.\" Do you follow? Where as a matter of fact the auditor goofed somewhere. You have to be a very, very good auditor to be able to perceive good and bad auditing. Now, in the earlier days, particularly the newer students on course would be observed to miss, on TV demonstrations, the most horrible auditing goofs you ever heard of. You would ask them for an analysis of the session they have just seen. And the new student, being relatively unfamiliar with the subject of auditing, he wouldn't be able to find any. And quite uniformly he would say the best session there was the one that had the most goofs in it. Here, I'll give you an example: He sees the auditor sitting there, and the pc is a little bit critical, and the auditor, with soothing syrup, sort of butters the pc down and the pc sub-sides, you see? And they say, \"Wasn't that a wonderful job of auditing,\" and they're absolutely amazed when the Supervisor would say, \"Well, that guy has flunked. Get him back to unit so – and – so and get him trained.\" And the new student says, \"Get him back to unit so – but the guy – absolute genius! Look at the fellow, he just said, 'Now, now, that's all right,' or 'We'll take that up later'\". You get the idea of this? They weren't educated enough in it to see whether it was goofed. Now, frankly, almost any auditing is better than no auditing. So, therefore, what you're bargaining for is only about 60 or 70 percent of the gains of auditing. You'd get 30 or 40 per-cent of the gains of auditing, you see, if it was all goofed up. Just by duplicative question and somebody being interested in the fellow, you're going to get some gain, see? But how about getting real gains out of this?"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 7 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 85 17.11.12 Well, when we say \"out-tech,\" – which is what this lecture concerns – when we say \"out-tech,\" we don't mean, in actual fact, that some auditor isn't sitting there interestedly au-diting the pc. We really don't mean that. It's not as corny as what's out-supervision, see, or out-instruction. We mean that they're just not getting that 60 percent of the gains. See, they're settling for 20, 30, 40 percent of the gain and letting it go at that. We mean tech is out because they are not getting out of auditing what they should be getting out of auditing, on a 100 per-cent basis. Do you follow? This, in other words, is \"the niceties of the thing are not with it.\" So that we can have an HGC which is auditing with mad enthusiasm. Pcs are coming in and they're being audited and they're being set a goal and all this. And this is all going on and we say, \"Goodness, isn't that a busy HGC and the auditors are seldom late for auditing sessions and that sort of thing. And whenever pcs blow they get them right back to Ethics. Really snap and pop, see?\" And we say, \"Tech is out.\" Somebody will say, \"But, that's impossible!\" Oh, no, that's not impossible at all. They're just only getting 20 or 30 percent of what they ought to be getting. Why? It is simply and entirely and completely a matter of: The fine points of auditing are missing and what really goes wrong with cases is not understood. They're sitting there giving the auditing com-mand, yes, but making lots of goofs with it, yes! Now, what does it take to make a good auditor? Now, a fellow who is a good auditor is so far above \"somebody who can audit\" that it would take an expert, in actual fact, to dif-ferentiate the difference. In other words, you'd have to be an awfully good auditor to watch the difference and watch what he is doing. You'd also have to be something of a Case Super-visor. You'd have to know these various phenomena. So a good auditor is what it takes to get good results. What's a good auditor? Well, let's take up here the first part of this – the GAEs. Now you've heard of this GAE a long time and this has not, really, to any great degree been pub-lished. It's not really been published the way it could have been published. These are the five GAEs and there are only really five GAEs – really only five. Can't handle and read the E-Meter. Gross auditing error – GAE. Auditor is sitting there. He's got a meter in front of him. He's got a pc connected to the meter. He's getting blowdowns. He's getting this and that, and he sees falls – falls occur, but he doesn't see these falls. Do you understand? He's getting tone arm action, but he never adjusts the tone arm so as to be able to record or note the action. You got the idea? Or when he brings his tone arm back to set, and so forth, he overcompensates so the pc is getting 435 divisions of TA for two-and-a-half hours. In other words, he just goofed up on this subject about the E-Meter. That needle moves, he doesn't see it; that tone arm moves, he doesn't see it. The needle doesn't move at all and he sees it move. This type of error – big errors. Now, it'd take a fellow who could run an E-Meter in order to detect whether or not somebody was running an E-Meter. Right? Oh, a man can look terribly competent! You know? I see a lot of these medical in-struments, and I see these fellows around in white coats and lead aprons and – although why they use a lead apron, I wouldn't know – but they – here are these fellows and they're all duded up, and they're reading meters and dials and turning them on and off. Honest, some of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 8 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 86 17.11.12 their machines cover the wall. And when they're all finished reading that and looking so sci-entific, and so forth, they don't know anything about the person whatsoever. And an E-Meter could have found it out a long time earlier without any white coats and without a whole wall. It doesn't, then, matter the pose with which you handle an E-Meter or the attitude with which you handle the E-Meter. The E-Meter just is – reads; do you see, it read? You see? It doesn't read; do you see that it doesn't read? I mean, it's elementary. When you adjust the tone arm, well, have you adjusted it or have you overadjusted it or not adjusted it, you know? That's it. Now, let me assure you, every time you see an auditing session break down, one of these GAEs is going to be out. One of them is going to be out, man. And don't go looking for whether or not he was worried about his girl-friend while he was giving the session as the reason for giving a lousy session. It's never that. It's always a gross auditing error. It's always a big one. So out-tech, when it comes down to research on out-tech, if you go around looking for specks of dust on the session, you're going to be wrong. What you want is a boulder. And there are only five boulders and one of these boulders is going to be in that session. I assure you, there's one place where the Case Supervisor very often takes his finger off of his number. He forgets these GAEs and he thinks it's something about the pc, or it's something about the process, or it's something about this and something about that. And if that Case Supervisor went right down to it and looked real hard, he would find in that session one of these GAEs. Well, we've covered the meter one. Let's get the next one: Doesn't know and apply technical data. Now, actually, the original writing of that was: Couldn't read and apply an HCOB. That's a gross auditing error. That also comes to the Case Supervisor. The Case Su-pervisor says, \"Give the person an assessment for any present time problem.\" And this auditor who has this as a gross auditing error (you'll find out it's rather consistent with this person) will simply say to the pc, \"You got any problems?\" And then write, \"Assessment negative.\" Do you see? So you gave one instruction and some other action resulted. Well, it's a gross auditing error not to be able to read and apply auditing directions or a bulletin or something. You should be able to read it and apply it. It isn't necessary that you have to do that one, but don't do something else and think you've done that one. You see, that's the gross auditing error, really. The ability to read and apply data. That's all. Now, that actually moves into the zone of the next gross auditing error. And the next gross auditing error is: Can't get or keep a pc in-session. Boy, you will just be amazed how often that is the case. The pc is flying all around the place and saying, \"Oh well, my – I'm terribly worried. You know, I have an appointment with Bill this after-noon, and I want to make sure that I've gone and – and – .\" And the auditor says, \"Here's the next auditing question.\" \"Yeah, well, I hope I make the appointment with Bill all right.\" The auditor says, \"Well, here's the next question: Do birds rap?\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 9 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 87 17.11.12 And the pc says, \"Do birds rap? Do birds – I think – yeah well I don't know about that. But I do want to get out there in time to catch Bill when he drives by.\" \"Well, all right. Now, do birds rap?\" You see, that can be so gross that the auditor doesn't even see that the pc is totally out of session; pc isn't with it. Well now, getting and keeping a pc in-session is a little body of technology in itself. Part of the communication formula is you've got to get somebody's attention. See? You've got to get somebody's attention before you can tell them something. Well, if the pc's attention is flying all over the MEST universe, how are you going to get his attention long enough to get in an auditing command? So what you ought to do is try to find his – where his attention is going to. It actually doesn't matter much how you do it. Don't do it on an endless itsa. But where is this guy? What's he thinking about? Well, naturally there's only a few things that he could be thinking about. He could be ARC broken or he could have a present time problem or he's got a with-hold or he's got an overt; I'll take those up in a minute. But that's – the auditor who can't get the pc in-session and keep the pc in-session, and so forth, is actually committing a gross au-diting error. Because he's sitting there applying a process to a nobody in a nothing. He hasn't got any pc to audit. Now, the ne plus ultra of this is, of course – is, of course, down in silliness. These are all pretty gross, but this can get that silly that he just didn't tell the pc to come to session, did-n't have a pc in session and didn't himself appear. And you'll be very surprised to find out how often that was the source of no gain for your pc. You'd just be amazed! I know you say, \"Well, such errors as that can't possibly ex-ist.\" The devil they can't, man. We had somebody around here who was just having an awful time a few weeks ago, and the HCO Exec Sec and Area Sec and Ethics Officer were about to shoot this person down in flames for just raising the devil all over the place. An investigation – I heard about this, and I said, \"You wait a minute.\" See? I know my auditing. I said, \"There's something else here. You'd better look at that just a little bit further – little bit further\" And they looked, and I'll be a son of a gun, that pc had been ended and wasn't audited for five consecutive days, although a top-priority pc. Gross auditing error! Didn't audit the pc, much less just didn't get the pc in session. You follow me? So, at the bottom of all this stew and stir was, sure enough, one of these GAEs. Do you understand? Pc wasn't being audited. Of course, the pc was upset. Pc paid for auditing and wasn't getting audited. Obvious. Auditor never appeared in session; pc's name never appeared on the assignment board. You got the idea? So a gross auditing error – don't you go looking for dust motes. Now, Can't get the pc in-session and keep a pc in-session. Well, that is very broadly stated and purposely so, be-cause there are innumerable ways to keep a pc out of session, such as locking the door. Other ways is the pc comes right into session, sits right in the chair, is totally in-session, says, \"I've got the answer to that. All night long I've had the answer to that next question, and I've got it,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 10 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 88 17.11.12 and so forth, and I had a terrific cognition on it.\" And the auditor says, \"Well, we'll have to go over the rudiments first.\" So part of this could be the PC is right there in-session, madly, you see, and the auditor carefully picks him up by the scruff of the neck and moves him right out. \"We'll have to find out if there's some reason you can't go into session before we audit you.\" Now, I'm making jokes here, but honestly, these things occur. And that's a gross audit-ing error, and that's gross auditing error number three. All right. Now, gross auditing error number four is: Can't complete an auditing cycle. The auditor simply can't complete an auditing cycle. Now, it's quite remarkable that all this obsessive itsa you see will lay right here in this number four. You know, the PC just talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked, and you couldn't get a question in sideways. What's wrong with that pc? Well, in life or in auditing sessions he has been prematurely acknowledged so often that he feels that he's never been acknowledged. Premature acknowledgment. Fellow says – maybe to his mother, you know, habitually – \"I've got a brilliant idea!\" And his mother says, \"That's very good!\" Or instead of acknowledging, they argue. \"Are you sure you have answered the ques-tion I asked you? I asked you, 'Do birds fly?' and you said, 'When they had wings.' Now, are you sure that that is an answer to the question I asked you?\" In other words, he stops the roll of the auditing cycle. Well, believe me, there are literally hundreds of ways you can stop an auditing cycle from completing. One of the ways is not starting one. I've had this happen to me in the early days of auditing. The auditor simply sat there. I'd answered the auditing command, and the auditor simply sat there and said nothing. Literally, factually true – twenty minutes. I don't know to this day whether or not it was the auditor couldn't think of the next auditing com-mand? Never started the cycle to finish. You got that? That was all. Now, there'll be something wrong with that auditing cycle. And that's a gross auditing error to have something goofed up about your auditing cycle. Now, you can get your auditing cycle better and better and better, but there is a point when it is a passable auditing cycle. And that is, you ask the question, the PC answers it and you say, \"Cheers,\" you know? If you can do that, why, from there on it really isn't a gross auditing error, it simply needs refinement and polish. No, a gross auditing error, when you come down on it as number four gross auditing error (Can't complete an auditing cycle), it will be something utterly mad, if it's really getting in the road of the session. It will be completely gruesome. The auditor never asks the auditing question, just Qs-and-As with every answer. The pc says, \"Well, I think my mother.\" You know, answered the auditing question, \"Who did you know?\" You know? \"I think my mother\" \"All right, what about your mother?\" \"Oh? Well, she had bunions.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 11 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 89 17.11.12 \"What about bunions?\" Where's this session going? It's going to go over the hills and get lost completely. Started one auditing cycle, never finished it off, never did anything with it, never repeated it. You got it? No, if you're ever case supervising and you suddenly detect that your pc – he could only get in one auditing question in a two-and-a-half-hour session. What's this? It must have been that he prematurely acknowledged it, or he must have told the pc not to say it, or the pc is stark staring crazy and has been audited by somebody who only prematurely acknowl-edged. There's something very wrong here. And you got to handle it, man; you got to handle it. Auditing sessions will not progress, because there's a gross auditing error present here of some kind or another. And somebody couldn't complete an auditing cycle, that's for sure, and the auditor for sure isn't handling the fact so that he can. Do you understand? You could go, even on this basis, you find out – you say, \"Do fish swim?\" And to the – some actual process, you see. And the PC says, \"Oh, well. Now, when you bring up something like that, that brings to mind a time when I was taking ichthyology in the Univer-sity of Glasgow, and so forth. And I had a professor who had bugs in his skull, and we used to have to get flit guns in the middle of class and blow them in his ear\". An auditor who listens to that very long without spotting something is in error and he's unable to finish his auditing cycle, and who doesn't do anything about it, has not even become aware that he should finish an auditing cycle. Do you see? So it's a gross auditing error in just not knowing he should finish an auditing cycle. Do you follow? You've seen pcs wander on and on and on. They're the very low-level guys in a stag-gery frame of mind out in life. You get ahold of them and you start asking repetitive ques-tions. Psychologists are the real howl. The psychologist is certain that an auditing question is disposed of by being answered once, and it's really crazy auditing those boys. They have given you the answer. You talk about a fixated subject; every question has one answer. Oh brother! So, of course, they never discovered repetitive auditing. All right, that's number four: Can't complete an auditing cycle. Now, number five is: Can't complete a repetitive auditing cycle. And that's a GAE. Now, completely aside from an auditing cycle, how about a repetitive auditing cycle? And you'd be – just be amazed at the trouble we had in early days of getting somebody to at least say, \"Do fish swim?\" a second time. And by the time they had been duplicative for about three or four consecutive questions, with somebody holding a pistol on them, their head began to burst and they started falling apart at the seams. It was asking too much that they repeat the auditing question. All sorts of shifts were gone to, and we eventually developed the TRs. And then we also developed Op Pro by Dup – Opening Procedure by Duplication – and that is simply cal-culated to cure somebody of this weird malady. But you should hear somebody who had just been caught and is just brought in for training when he is first told to do a duplicative auditing command. He's supposed to ask this"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 12 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 90 17.11.12 question over and over and over. Many of them get away with it, but you'll find some bird who knows the proper thing to do is vary it. \"Do fish swim?\" \"Have you any idea about the swimming characteristics of fish?\" See? \"Do you mind if we discuss fish?\" \"Give me a synonym for fish.\" He thinks he's dupli-cating the auditing question. Now, in other words, these are the five GAEs. These are the five GAEs which, if committed, will dish auditing squarely and tremendously, just like that. It'll be finished. Now, when you're case supervising and you're looking over auditors, this is what you look over when you find that you're consistently having misses. You look over this one. You look over the five GAEs on the auditor. When you're – when you're case supervising, then you tell anybody responsible for training – this is what I'm trying to relay – that they had jolly well better look over the five gross auditing errors on that auditor, because that auditor isn't going along all right. The sessions weren't going along all right, so we suspect at once one of the five GAEs, if not two or three. We don't inspect the antagonism of this girl for large ruddy-faced men. We don't ex-amine the auditor's case, you see? We don't do this; we don't do that. All we do, and so on is when we say, \"John Doakes has been having a very rough time auditing his last two or three pcs. I want you to go over this pc – this auditor and find out what the score is,\" now, the Training Officer should not then get the auditor audited. Training Officer should promptly and immediately check this guy out on five GAEs. Can this guy read an E-Meter? You sometimes find out he's been bluffing for a long time. He's needed glasses for quite a while, but as a Scientologist he doesn't dare wear them. He can't even see the blur of the needle. You find weird things like this if you look for them. If you look for the gross error, you're going to handle the situation. But if you just look for little dust specks and dust motes, and so forth, you'll never get to it. And this is the list of the gross errors. Then you want to know – you give him a little checkout – give him a little checkout. Say, \"Well, let's see. Last week you were studying up on assessment, and so forth, and we went into assessment quite a little bit in the training classes. Here's a little examination on assessment.\" And the fellow can't pass any corner of it. What's the matter with him? Well, he doesn't know and apply his technical data. So now – now we could maybe go into his case a little bit. We could say, \"What would happen to you if you did apply some technical data? Is there anything wrong with ap-plying straight data? Oh, well, there isn't. All right. Well, then, what word have you misun-derstood in Scientology?\" And that's the secret of it and we're away. So we'd straighten out his vocabulary. All of a sudden he could know and apply technical data. You understand? So we might go into it on a case basis, but only if we reached that point there: Doesn't know and apply technical data. We'd find out if he could get and keep a pc in-session. We'd ask him such an offhand question as, \"What's wrong with a pc who's critical of the auditor? Flunk!\" The guy'd say, \"Flunk? You didn't give me a chance to answer it.\" \"Huh! Gave you a second and a half to"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 13 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 91 17.11.12 answer the question as you ought to know that in a millisecond! You ought to know that right now! That pc has got a withhold! And nothing else!\" \"Oh. Well, I thought there were several other reasons.\" \"No! There aren't any other reasons.\" GAE. Do you see? Can't get and keep a pc in-session. Well, he doesn't know the various things which take a pc out of session or get a pc in-session. So how the devil could he get a pc in-session or keep him out of session if he didn't know what took pcs out of session or got them back into session? He couldn't do that at all, could he? So it'd be a gross auditing error on his part. He just doesn't know that – that little list of things, because it's not long. And if he can't complete an auditing cycle, we can tell that fast enough. All we've got to do is set him up with some TRs and inspect how he does his TRs. And you'll find out about – maybe he can do 1, 2 and 3 or 0 all right, but when you get him to 4, every time he hits origin – no matter how you run origin, complicatedly or simply or anything of that sort – he will go appetite over tin cup on this whole basis. He can't handle the whole package all together. The pc says something unexpected, he's thrown. Now you know what'll happen; this person will Q-and-A with the pc because he gets thrown all the time. The pc originates, \"Gee, the wall is covered with spiders!\" And the auditor says, \"That's – I didn't get that far in my drills.\" And then we go into the inability to repeat an auditing cycle. Well, one of the ways to do that is just go into any kind of a repetitive line. Does the pc – does this auditor get nerv-ous? Make him say, \"Constantinople\" fifty times. Does this make him nervous? You'll find it will, if he can't complete an auditing cycle. Oh, boy. He knows what happens if he's in the same place twice: you get shot. Life is dangerous. So that – that handles – where we consider out-tech – that handles what can be wrong with the auditor, and that's all that can be wrong with an auditor. And if you go and imagine a bunch of other things can be wrong with an auditor, why, that's silly, and so forth. Because even if you get to such extremities as the auditor is unable to talk at all – not having any tongue or something – well, he can't complete an auditing cycle. Do you understand? He can't even start one. So you'd have to teach him how to audit by writing his commands down. Well, he can't write. All right, we'll fix him up; so, you teach him how to write. There was somebody around the other day we were having to teach the English lan-guage so he could run R6. It was very interesting. I think he was unable to run it in his own native language because he'd forgotten it and he didn't know English well enough to run it in R6, and so forth. Well, the answer to that was very elementary: learn English. So these things are resolvable. But if you don't know that those are the five gross au-diting errors, then you can't resolve an auditor in his training or activities. Now, let's go to the other side of this auditing team and let's take up a pc. And al-though this is much weightier and longer technology and, you know, is very difficult technol-ogy, the actual fact is there are only four things, really, that can be wrong with a pc, but we'll expand it to six, just to be happy about the thing. We cover these in the HCOB of 13 Septem-ber 1965, out of which we're speaking, but I did not put in here the five gross auditing errors, but could well have done so. I gave some other data concerning the analysis of auditors. I give"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 14 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 92 17.11.12 you now very fundamental data on the analysis of an auditor – whether or not he can audit. He'll have one of his five gross auditing errors out. Now, let's take up pc – which is very, very important – and let's find out what about the pc. Well, there can be two things wrong with a pc that immediately don't really come into the auditing session, but tell whether or not the pc should be audited. There are only two things; these are only two things: The PC is suppressive or the pc is a PTS. Now, in either case you're running into heavy weather. Now, what is a suppressive? Well, a suppressive, actually, is somebody who doesn't get any case gain. And that in actual fact is taken up under the later one here of the continuing overts. He really doesn't get case gain because of continuing overts. Now, a suppressive is simply defined as – for your information, regardless – this is an auditor's viewpoint, now, not an Ethics Officer's viewpoint – but a suppressive is somebody who doesn't get any case gain. And you say, \"Well, isn't that nice.\" That lets you out. So you don't have to get a case gain on this fellow, and if you don't get a case gain on this fellow, you just get rid of the whole thing. You don't have to do a better technical job. You just say, \"He's a suppressive! Ha-ha! That lets us out.\" Well, the truth of the matter is, in my experience, it's very nearly impossible not to get a case gain. Very close to impossible not to get a case gain. You're only talking about 2½ per-cent of the pcs in actual fact. You'll have trouble with about 20 percent of the pcs because they're SPs or PTSes, but in actual fact only about 2½ percent of the total pcs running along the line... Now, this doesn't include the society as a whole, but it's certainly people who come into Scientology or around Scientology; you're only handling about 2½ percent of them that are suppressive. Now, it doesn't mean that you didn't get a gain in the session, so therefore the fellow was suppressive. It means this fellow has been audited by this one and that and the other one, and people have really tried, and this person gets no case gain. Well, it so happens that we're good enough today to be able to say \"SP.\" What makes an SP an SP? From an auditor's standpoint, he is not even vaguely really interested in what makes an SP an SP. He's just interested in the fact that you shouldn't ought to audit one and devote and dedicate your life to auditing an SP who isn't going to get any case gain anyhow. What's going to happen to this fellow? Well, I'm afraid he should have thought about that be-fore he started going so bad! So he's still populating the universe when the rest of us aren't. What's this worry about the SP? Believe me, he never worries about you. Now, what about this boy? Well, actually, it's covered down here under six on the same list, as I've just said: He actually is committing continuing overts. Now, trying to get those continuing overts off and trying to get to the source of those continuing overts and trying to move forward with any kind of case gain on this person at all is very, very hard to do, but can be done. And the only process that will really handle a suppressive – the only series of processes are Power Processes – Second Stage Release. And that will handle one. Now, occasionally a person can be overaudited so heavily and so far – particularly overaudited, let us say, on R6EW or in some very powerful process, and they've just been"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 15 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 93 17.11.12 audited up the spout – they, thereafter, won't get any case gain. You have to go back and pick them up where they should have been picked up and rehabilitate where they were overrun before they'll get a case gain. And the funny part of it is, is during that period the person's actions will be slightly suppressive. Quite interesting. Don't confuse, then, somebody who's been overrun and isn't getting any case gain the last few days. What you want is – on a suppressive is – he's never gotten any case gain. It doesn't ever exist. He has never had any case gain. He has never had any TA. You get the idea? That's the category. And you'll find out that about 2½ percent of the people that are around on the streets, and so forth, will come under that category. And he doesn't get a case gain because he continually commits little tiny overts. He is so engaged in fighting some imaginary battle in the past that he has no time to have any friends in the present. Everyone to him is an enemy and each individual is an \"everyone.\" He is the master of generalities. The world itself around him is A=A=A. He's actually in a pretty mad spin. And in institutions there are only two types of people: suppressives and PTSes. There is nothing else in an institution, from top to bottom. Therefore, the poor old ruddy psy-chiatrist never gets a crack at anything but a suppressive or a PTS. That is why consistently I have said to you, \"Don't fool with the insane.\" I couldn't give you a pat explanation of why you shouldn't fool with the insane, but I told you, you just shouldn't. Well, that is why. The insane are composed – you see, well, there's an insane per-son; he's always fighting an imaginary enemy. That's one of the biggest definitions of insan-ity. Or he's retreating madly from an imaginary enemy. And then in the insane asylum, you will find the PTSes that the SPs have put there. And you do anything for this person – this PTS – and of course, the SP will cave him in again within twenty – four hours of contact. You're going to see this inevitably. You couldn't win if you had to. Here, then, is this whole subject of insanity. Now, what is a PTS? Number one: the pc – a case does not advance. Only six reasons a case does not advance – number one: the PC is suppressive. All right, we could go into that. We could get the person to Saint Hill, and so forth. But remember, we don't have any padded cells here. We can't accommodate certain types of personnel here. We have no hospital keep-ers, guards, all that sort of thing. You'd just be surprised how many people are walking around in that society out there who do need keepers and guards. It's quite interesting. There are a lot of them. And because the psychiatrist isn't any better than he is, he really can't spot his really insane people. Oh, he spots them when they finally wind up in his lap. His recognition is up to recognizing an insane person when the insane person is dropped in his lap. But going out into the society and trying to analyze who is crazy and who isn't, the psychiatrist, being a PTS, professionally, himself, has not actually done anything more than just give you a big general-ity: \"Everybody is crazy.\" You find Menninger was saying that: \"Well, everybody is crazy, you know.\" It's quite interesting. \"Some people are more crazy than others.\" He's not right at all. He's not right at all."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 16 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 94 17.11.12 Every once in a while a guy gets a sensation like he's going to blow his top or going nuts. That's for sure. But if he recognizes it is a sensation, he isn't crazy, because a crazy per-son never finds out. Now, a potential trouble source is simply, for an auditor's – from an auditor's view-point, somebody connected to a suppressive. That's all a potential trouble source is; don't look for any other trimmings. And from an auditor and a Case Supervisor's viewpoint, a PTS (po-tential trouble source) is always recognized as a \"rolly coaster.\" Now rolly coaster – that un-fortunately adds another tough term to Scientology technology and vocabulary. But a rolly coaster is simply just that: A person goes up and he goes down and he goes up and he goes down. And it's just a jolly-o, billy-o, around the corners. \"Whoop up! Ah, whee! I feel fine! Oh, it's terrific – uah – oh, I feel awful.\" Now, the psychiatrist specialized in a type of thing called \"manic-depressive.\" Maybe you remember the term. That means the guy is www – up and the guy is down. Manic, up; depressive, down. The manic-depressive is one of the common and standard symptoms of insanity, but in some types of insanity-\"types\" of insanity – why, it's manifested mainly as just frozen fish, you know? The guy doesn't go up or down and that's the suppressive. You got it? Psychiatrist has differentiated, then, between the manic-depressive and the paranoid. The paranoid doesn't change. He's already got his types, see? But this manic-depressive action is simply symptomatic of a person being next to an undetected suppressive. And I don't care whether he's insanely manic-depressive or sanely manic-depressive. He feels good today and bad tomorrow, don't you see? That's a rolly coaster. Now, we particularly mean a rolly coaster is: he feels good after auditing and then feels bad. He leaves the session; he's terrific. His tone arm is down. Everything is going along fine. He's had some good cognitions. The somatic is gone. He walks out of that session, he comes back to the next session, and he's on the bottom. And you say, \"Oh, I've must have done something wrong. Oh, the pc must have self-audited. Oh, figure – figure – figure – fig-ure – figure – figure,\" and until you really – till you really got your wits wrapped around this important datum, you're going on figuring yourself to death about this. That person is a PTS. And then the next little bridge you're going to cover is: \"Well, he couldn't be a PTS, because he didn't meet the suppressive person between sessions. Now, you've interjected that arbitrary, nobody else has. He didn't have to. All he had to think was, \"What will Jonesy think about this?\" Do you follow? Person didn't have to be present. You don't have to locate the physical presence. This suppressive is around in the environment, even though they're ten thousand miles away. Do you see? A person rolly coastering – there's only one reason a person rolly coasters and that is-n't because an auditor forgets to say, \"End of session,\" with the proper happy lilt in his voice. That person felt good on Monday and on Tuesday came into session feeling bad. Now, an auditor can pull a couple of accidental suppressive acts, like refuse to ac-knowledge the PC or ARC break and make the guy feel worse. We're not talking about that sort of thing. We're talking about just pure, outright rolly coaster. And there's only one thing wrong with a rolly coaster and that is he is a potential trouble source, meaning he is connected to a suppressive. I imagine Ethics Officers around the world are learning this and unlearning"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 17 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 95 17.11.12 it and relearning it and all of a sudden will eventually sort it out and say, \"By God, that's true,\" you know? Because every once in a while, they can't find the SP; they can't find the suppressive. Why do we say \"potential trouble source?\" Because they always commit trouble, and that's the big generality that you can make about a PTS. Sooner or later you're going to have trouble. Any time you got – we got one the other day – I – well, the other day. We've had one hanging around the fringes for about, I don't know, five, six months and he wasn't convinced there was any SP. And no SP had been really located on the case and confirmed, and so forth. And this person was going up to HASI London and getting audited and getting tremendous results and going down to the bottom the next week, and so on. And they finally found the suppressive and got the good indicators in and straightened the person out after this long pe-riod of time. Actually, it was just really not really convincingly locating the SP in that person's life. And that's the only thing that masks it, because an SP speaks totally in generalities. An SP speaks, \"Everybody thinks you are a heel.\" Like, \"The community believes you are a dog.\" You see? \"Men are always like that. All men are like that.\" This is this type of sweeping gen-erality and the guys are not locatable in the environment. They just sort of butter themselves all over the environment. And you try to get a case to go spot a suppressive in its vicinity and, \"No, no, no, no, no. I haven't got any. No, there's nobody there.\" This person has spoken in generalities to such a point that he doesn't exist anymore. He's just a generality himself – he's everybody! So in Scientology these days, we know this well enough, and somebody who sails in, and so forth, and says, \"Well, everybody thinks we advertise too much...\" The HCO Sec will inevitably say, \"What is everybody's name?\" or \"Who is everybody?\" And the person will think for a moment and think for a moment, \"Well, his name is Sweeney.\" And good indica-tors will come in. Now, if you audit this person, you're just setting this person up. And if you audit this person to a tremendously successful gain, you may get him killed. I say that advisedly, you know – just shot down in his tracks. Let's say you really pulled the technology out, and boy, you really did a bang-up job of auditing; man, you really cleaned up this case and this case was just sailing. (Of course, you couldn't get the case up to Clear, which is where you'd have had to take the case.) And you sent the case home at the end of the intensive, and the person is really walking on air. One of two things will happen. This has happened: the SP has committed suicide. Bang! Just like that. Or the SP just walks out in the kitchen and pours the arsenic into the coffee, because they can't have anybody better. They're having enough trouble killing them while they're sick. Do you see that? You really – you really can walk a PTS right straight into it, man. Maybe it's not that dramatic, but it will be that gruesome. So you really shouldn't audit an SP or a PTS. Actually, here at Saint Hill, we really shouldn't take on SPs. We can do so because we're insouciant. That's a word you can look up afterwards."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 18 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 96 17.11.12 But there we are. There's the two things, now. And one of these days you will sud-denly come up with a tremendously important datum, exclamation point, that \"By God, Ron's right: A person rolly coasters only because he's connected to a suppressive person and you jolly well better not audit them.\" And most of the trouble we've had has come from PTSes – actually not from SPs, but PTSes. SPs have incited it all, but the trouble has been made by the PTS. Quite fascinating. But see, the trouble is made by the PTS becoming better, and then the SP gets desperate and makes all kinds of trouble. Do you get the idea? So the source of the trouble is our auditing a PTS. We wouldn't get any trouble auditing the SP because he wouldn't go anyplace anyhow. All he'd do is snarl, and so forth, and make an auditor a bit unhappy and miserable, but he won't do anything like when you audit a PTS. And it's very discouraging to an auditor. This guy was fine on Monday, collapses on Friday. The auditor is absolutely certain he has done something wrong. He hasn't done any-thing wrong except audit a PTS. He audited a potential trouble source and didn't recognize it. There was another, earlier rolly coaster – and this is one of the things a Case Supervi-sor on pcs has to be very alert to – there was an earlier rolly coaster and they explained it all away. \"Oh, it was because he was up too late that night.\" Yes, I know. The earlier rolly coaster that was last week on Thursday when he was feeling so good and came back to the session on Friday and was feeling so bad – they ran that down and that turned out to be \"hav-ing been up too late Thursday night.\" They ignore that and there the guy rolly coasters again, and so forth, and people are wondering, \"What on Earth is going on here?\" Well, they just weren't industrious enough locating the SP of last week, see? What was it? Who is it? Where is it? That's what you want to locate and when you've got that located – you go right on hunt-ing until you do locate it, too. Because when you do locate the SP, why, the good indicators will all come in on the pc. But if the pc has accepted the fact that you have located the SP and the good indicators aren't in, you haven't found the SP. That's the little technology back of that that's been quite interesting. If you find the right SP, you'll always get the good indicators in. If you don't find the right suppressive person to which the PTS is connected, you will not get the good indicators in. And it's as obvious as all that. That's another one of these simple – elementary things. When you push down on the accelerator the engine will run faster, and when you take your foot off the accelerator the en-gine will run slower. You regulate the engine with the accelerator. Somebody goes out and they say, \"I'm very sure you regulate the engine with the brake.\" Well, they gets a little tiny success of regulating it with the brake. They try going sixty miles an hour and putting on the brake while leaving the car in gear and it slows down the engine, so they say, \"See?\" Burns the engine up, but then that doesn't much – burns the brakes up too. Long as they – as long as they don't know this very interesting little datum then they keep coming a cropper. See, they get in there – somebody operates without a meter, or they can't run a meter, or something like this. And they try to – they found this person rolly coastered, and then they try to get on this person what person it was, and then they can't find one. Or they find one and they say, \"Well, it's your Aunt Mamie.\" And the person says, \"Oh, all right, Aunt Mamie. I'll disconnect from her. All right.\" No, no, no, no. No, that PTS is not PTS because of Aunt Ma-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 19 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 97 17.11.12 mie. Nuh – uh. Good indicators didn't come in; your meter didn't blow up. Do you follow? It's very positive. I mean it's one of these things – I'm actually trying to describe to you something. But all the points I'm describing to you in this particular lecture are the types of points you make with searchlights. See? Searchlights in a perfectly black night. I mean, they're of that value and importance. This isn't just a bunch of tiny data that is all buried with the dust motes, you see? These are the basic regulating data, is what I'm talking to you about, all on the basis of getting tech in. So those are the first two. You could consider them technical, but actually to a large degree they are personal. And when we get right down to it, then, there are four – the remain-der of the six. There are four things, then, that can be wrong with a case and that's all. That – we've finished the whole door, we've got it all built right there at that point, and it opens, and the corridor is long beyond it. That's the lot. And if you're going around worrying about, \"Somebody isn't being audited, because I haven't got the right process, because if I just assess something or other with my left hand instead of my right hand... And Krishnamurti said that time was the devourer of all men. Maybe he has an eating fantasy that's mixed up with sex.\" You're just talking in a bunch of balderdash, because there aren't very many reasons why cases don't get along well. First is the SP; the second, the guy is a PTS. All right, if you've gotten rid of those two and he's neither of those two, then, one of these remaining will be it – not might be it; will be it. And they are: ARC broken – pc is ARC broken. Pc has got a present time problem of long duration; that comes under categories like hidden standards and all that sort of thing. They're just present time problems of long duration. And number five: The pc's got a withhold or a misunderstood word, which is a withhold of understanding; he's withholding himself from it, or reverse. And number six: continuing overts which he then withholds and that makes a suppressive. And there aren't any more things which drive tech out than that, because a Case Supervisor who doesn't look at those things, then can't get any process to work from there on down! Now, what are the processes? Processes are things that work if these six things aren't there. Got it? So when you say, \"Tech is out in a certain area,\" you are saying they are trying to make processes work while paying no attention to the five gross auditing errors in auditors; and no attention, or minimum attention, to the six things that prevent a case from advancing. You follow that? So if you ignore these six things and try to go on auditing cases, no process under the sun, moon and stars is going to work. But the funny part of it is, if these six cases are okay, practically any process under the sun, moon and stars will work, which is quite fascinating. The only reason a process doesn't work is because it has worked and is now being madly overrun. You got it? Processes don't work beyond the point when they're finished. You can't lift any more concrete off the sidewalk than there is concrete in the sidewalk, and you try to lift more and people are going to get upset."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 20 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 98 17.11.12 Now therefore, if anything goes wrong with technology from the Case Supervisor's viewpoint, on behalf of the auditor, it is covered in these five gross auditing errors. Those satisfied, if a case does not advance and so forth, then the case isn't advancing because of these six things: Pc is suppressive; Pc is PTS; pc is ARC broken; pc has a present time prob-lem of long duration; pc has a withhold or a misunderstood word; and continuing overts are hidden from view. Now honest, that's all. I'm talking now about an eagle's-eye view of the track and the mind and human beings. And when you look back over it all on the vast oceans of data that we could be covering here, and so forth, you find out that if tech is out, then it's just covered in that list. Either one or more of the five gross auditing errors are present, or one of these six things is wrong with the pc. That's all! There isn't whether he paid his dues to the \"I Will Arise\" Burial Society. It isn't because he hasn't paid for his E-Meter. So that's the total lump sum of important barriers that stop progress in auditing. And believe me, I have been at this now for about, actually, eighteen years, and I can tell you there are no data that lie outside these data. There are no other data. And I tell you that forcefully, just mainly because I don't want you to go on stumbling around thinking that you're going to find one, because you're cleaning a clean; you're looking for something else that isn't there. Now, therefore, analysis of out-tech would bring about getting tech in. Well, how would you get tech in? Well, you'd get tech in by fixing it up so these five gross auditing er-rors weren't being made, and so these six things, when – one of these six things, when wrong with a case, would be promptly detected and handled. And tech would then be in; tech would be in well. And you'd go on and audit standard processes and all goes along like a well – oiled dream. There's nothing worrisome or upsetting. You have minimum upsets along the line then. When all of a sudden something shows up over the horizon... Some auditor is on his second pc and hasn't made very fast gains on the first pc, and he didn't make very – he isn't making it very good. And he all of a sudden is having a big problem and suddenly comes up and wants to suddenly run \"Give me that hand\" in the middle of a Power Process. No, don't for God's sakes Q-and-A with that at all! Don't Q-and-A with that at all! Just go back to stable data, because you're going to be led all over the pasture! One of these five things is wrong with the auditor or one of these six things is wrong with the pc. I don't care what the auditor said. If it's some departure from what you know to be standard, or it's a suggestion that is over the hills and far away that doesn't have very much to do with the price of fish, or they're demanding that we change processes and run six of them in one session, or there's something peculiar has suddenly been presented to view; we don't bother to find out what's been presented to view. We just abandon all of that body of data, and we look for one of the five gross auditing errors in the auditor and one of the six things that can be wrong with a pc. And we just get those things looked for, right now! All of a sudden, we find out all this time this auditor thought that one process was an-other process, and it was – in actual fact had never run the first process they were supposed to run on the pc, but had run an entirely different process. You would get absolutely fascinated. The GAE, here, is indicated by the fact that the auditor also can't do a checkout on current or modern processes – second of the GAEs is wrong. So you go and look at what"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 21 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 99 17.11.12 they – you know, compare these things. Have they done that on this case too? Ah, well, yeah, yeah. They were supposed to run Process 1, 2, 3 and 4. They didn't; they ran Process 9, 12 and 2. And then ran them with the wrong wording. Do you see? And as far as the pc is concerned, why isn't this pc making advances? Aw, there's no reason to stand around and try to blow your brains out and worry and lie awake all night say-ing, \"Let's see, could there be some confusion with the collusion?\" There's no sense in lying around and lying awake on the thing. Relax! You got a pc you're worried about, roll up your sleeves and say, \"This pc has got one of six things wrong at this minute. One of these six things is wrong.\" Now, the funny, funny, funny part of it is, you say, \"Oh well, yes, you can overrun processes. That could also be wrong with the pc.\" No, that's one hell of a problem to the pc, and it either will wind up as a problem or an ARC break. I set up this exact run to be run a little while ago by the Qual Sec on a test case – not a test case particularly – a case we wanted to handle. (And I already knew this bird.) But I set it up, and sure enough he got case overrun showing up as a little tiny tick which, when he de-veloped it, developed into a blowdown. The process had been overrun and had previously not been detected. A case state had been attained which had never been acknowledged. It showed up on a problem. So there isn't even overrun. Ah, you're worried about what's wrong with this case? Well, just have a good night's sleep and in the next session you just hammer at it. Has this – just ask yourself (look over this case's folders and so forth), \"Has this case ever got a case gain? Has this case ever rolly coastered? Is this person ARC broken? Does this person have a chronic present time prob-lem?\" Which would include hidden standards and overrun processes and unacknowledged this and that. \"Is this person running along here with a withhold or something misunderstood that they're not telling us is misunderstood and pretending they understand? Is something wrong here in the withhold department? Or is this person every time they leave the auditing session casually go out and phone the FDA to give them some more data on us? Which is it?\" Well now, if GAE number one, Can't handle and read a meter... If an auditor can handle and read an auditing meter, I assure you, you can assess those things, and you're going to find the right one every time. There isn't anything else that can be wrong with a case. And then if you handled the five things that can be wrong with an auditor and if you handle the six things that can be wrong with a pc, then you won't ever have to worry about tech being out, because it will be in. And when it starts out it will go straight back in again. But you talk about the sea of data – tremendous, tremendous sea of data where we could have anything important anywhere – I pity you, drowning amongst the data of life. \"Is it really my father that drove me mad or was it my Uncle Jim? Or on the other hand, was it the teacher in the seventh grade? Somebody drove me mad. I wonder who it was?\" And you're absolutely certain that if you just solve that point and find out who it was that drove you mad, then you will be totally sane forevermore. Well, in the first place, you couldn't be totally mad if you were trying to find out what drove you totally mad, because the definition of a madman is, he's the last one to know. He thinks he's totally right."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 22 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 100 17.11.12 And you think, \"If I just dig up that data, that's what Clear means. All I have to do is dig up that one datum and I'll be there,\" and eventually get run on a process and you find out it wasn't any of those people; it wasn't any of those people. Actually, you did have a playmate who was rather mean to you and suppressive, and you locate him, and you'll feel fine, and you're shut of that problem, and you have made an advance. But you have made an advance of one little chip in a vast ocean. And when you look at all of the multitudinous data of your own past, all the confusing data of your own present and add to that a sea of data that you're given in Scientology, you say, \"How can I possibly ever pilot my way through all this? Look at all these bulletins. Look at all these tapes. And all these things seem to be so important, and everything seems to be so important, and nothing, and that, and so forth. And all I'm doing is sitting here trying to find out who was mean to me when I was five.\" Well, just remember the saving grace is, one, that people are making it routinely; and as you get on up the line, the selection of importances becomes more and more an ability that is easily practiced. In other words, you could be more and more capable of selecting impor-tances; given sixteen data you can select the one that is important out of the sixteen. And then you find out that you're really getting somewhere. And when I tell you, looking over all the auditing of the past, that there's just those five things that can be wrong with an auditor, and it's just those six things that can be wrong with a pc; all you've got to find out is how to apply and remedy those five, and how you've got to apply and straighten out those six. Do you understand? And frankly, there isn't an interminable body of data behind them. There are only a few data behind each one of those. And when we get down to it, that is what keeps the cases rolling; that's what makes them come on up the line in auditing. You generally look on it and say, \"It's processes that do.\" Oh yes, that's perfectly true. But if the case is going, why, the process will work. But if the case isn't going and the process isn't working, why, then it isn't the process that isn't working, you understand? It's one of these five things. One of the five is wrong with you or one of the six is wrong with the pc. You have to decide which it is and put it right, and all of a sudden it'll all run like a bomb. That should give you a terrific orientation. Furthermore, it should give anybody who is in charge of any activity or getting anything done, a terrifically keen insight into the situation, because the whole environment is trying to feed him different data than these. And these are the data, and the only data he can afford to look at. And when he pays attention to those, all works! When he ceases to pay attention to those, the whole world becomes a complete sea of confusion again. All right. Well, I hope that'll help you out. I hope that it narrows the field down. I wanted to talk to you today just to give you a fast reorientation on the subject of what you're looking at. Yes, processes are important. Yes, all the things you're studying are important. Yes, you have definitely got to know how to run a process and what are the manifestations and phenomena of the process. But when it comes right down to it, it isn't because you're running a process badly, in actual fact, that you're not getting case gains on the pc, it's because either you are practicing one of the five gross auditing errors undetectedly or the pc you're auditing"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"SHSBC-430 OUT-TECH 23 21.9.65 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 101 17.11.12 falls into one of the six which I have listed. It isn't that you're doing the process badly. So if you think that just by constant shift of process and constant changing everything around and constantly trying to invent Scientology all over again in the middle of a session you're sud-denly going to get a gain on a pc who isn't gaining, you're going to have a lose every time. What it takes is standard processing with all five gross auditing errors remedied in the auditor and none of those six things present in the pc. And if you've got that all straight, then it really doesn't matter, you'll get gains even if you run \"Do birds fly?\" Do you follow? And you'll find out, if you pay attention to this and learn how to handle these as a set of tools, that auditing – application of – becomes very, very simple indeed. And when you're very quick off the mark with these six things – particularly the last four are the ones that you really work on – and if you're very quick off the mark with those, and you can spot them, and you can handle them, and you can get rid of ARC breaks, PTPs and withholds, misunder-stoods, overts (you know, that little category of things; you can handle those brrrtt! why, there isn't a pc in the world ever gets away with a thing as far as you're concerned.

An Internship then is serving a period as an Interne, or an activity offered by an org by which Experience can be gained. Internships have been arranged this long while for every auditing class. The apprenticeship of an auditor is done as an org Interne. C/Ses very often have Internes on their lines and sometimes have trouble with getting them to audit. The why of this is that the Interne seldom knows the definition of the word \"Interne\" (which is as above). They sometimes think they are still students. They do not know this fact: A course graduate becomes an auditor by auditing. That means lots of auditing. The failure of \"auditors\" is that they go from one level to the next, HDC to IV to VIII, without ever becoming an auditor for that Class. Thus you can get a silly situation where a Class IX can't audit or C/S well. Thus you get tech going out. An HDC graduate who doesn't then audit under an experienced Case Supervisor who knows and demands the standard actions rarely gets to be an HDC Auditor. It takes tons of hours to make a real Dianetic auditor who can toss off standard sessions and get his routine miracles. So if an HDC doesn't Interne, but simply goes on to the Academy Courses or SHSBC he has skipped his apprenticeship as a Dianetic Auditor. If he gets his Class VI and never Internes but goes on to VIII – well, we now have somebody who has long since lost touch with the reality of why he is studying."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"INTERNES 2 C/S SERIES 52 – HCOB 19.7.71 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 104 17.11.12 Therefore you can't take a Class VI graduate who was never a Dianetic Auditor and Interne him as a VI.

When he can turn out flawless Dianetic sessions on all kinds of pcs you can Interne him as a IV etc. In other words you have to catch up all neglected Apprenticeships. I don't care if the guy is an VIII, if he wasn't ever a Dianetic Auditor and a Class VI Auditor and isn't Interning as an VIII then he is only a provisional. Flubby auditors are the biggest time wasters a C/S has. If auditors on his lines aren't good, he'll take forever to get his C/S work done. And he won't get results. The answer is, regardless of Class as a course graduate, a C/S must Interne his Audi-tors for each Internship missed on the way up. The \"ok to audit\" system is used. One takes any graduate and Internes him on the lowest Internship he has missed. He reviews his material, gets his drills checked, gets his misunderstood words cleared and gets an \"ok to audit\" for that level. If he goofs he is crammed. And sometimes wholly retreaded. The \"ok to audit Dianetics\" would be his first okay. This suspends if he has to retread. When he then has turned out pcs, pcs, pcs, pcs, 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day for weeks and weeks and is a total success as a Dianetic Auditor, he can go on up. At first as a Dianetic Interne he is part time studying Dianetics. Then as he gets flaw-less and while he is getting experience and practice on Dianetics, he can gradually phase over into re-studying his next Internship, usually IV or VI. Then one day he is word cleared, checked out on his drills, and he qualifies for \"ok to audit\" for IV or VI. Now it begins all over again.

His next real step is a VI or VII Interne at an SH. If he has been a good IV Interne Auditor his VI Internship after his SHSBC will be a VII Internship. VII is an Interne activity. When he's an Auditor that can do VI and Power, he is ready for VIII and IX. If he is going to be a good VIII-IX auditor he will Interne in an AO or SH under an experienced C/S. Now when he goes to his own org, you have a real honest to goodness C/S.

POINTS ON CASE SUPERVISION 1. Check your orders to find out if auditor did them. 2. Check to see if commands correct and if pc's reaction was expected reaction for those commands. 3. Check any list and find out if there was mislisting. 4. Advise against a background of Standard Tech. 5. Order any errors corrected or get the case on further up the grades. 6. Beware of over-correction. 7. Beware of false, pessimistic or over-enthusiastic auditor reports. They are detected by whether the case responded to usual actions as they all do. 8. Beware of talking to the auditor or the pc. 9. Have implicit confidence in Standard Tech. If it is reported not working the auditor's report is false or the application terrible but not reported. 10. Above all else hold a standard and never listen to or use unusual solutions. DOUBLE FOLDER DANGER When a preOT has a Solo and an Auditing folder, both, there is a great danger if the Case Supervisor does not look at both before C/Sing. There has been an instance of a preOT running strange C/Ses on himself. Another ran C/Ses out of other folders on himself. In both cases the consequences were hard to repair when finally found. In another case in the Solo folder the preOT had gone exterior with full perception. But the Non-Solo Auditing folder was being C/Sed. The TA shot up for 2 months without any C/S except myself calling for all folders. PreOTs unfortunately run on a Solo folder and an audited folder. Unless both are to hand when C/Sing wild errors can be made by the C/S. There is also the case of a person having two audited folders, being C/Sed at the same time. This is an Admin error. The firm rule is C/S only with all folders to hand. The embarrassing situation where one can't get a folder from another org or field audi-tor or where the old folder is lost has to be made up for somehow. It mustn't halt auditing to-tally."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 3 HCOB 25.6.70 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 109 17.11.12 CASE SUPERVISOR – FOLDER HANDLING Analyzing Folders Go back in the folder to the session where the preclear was running well and come forward from it doing a folder error summary. Reviewing Folders In reviewing a folder, the first thing to do is to look at the C/S to see if it was done. Use the Summary Sheet to get the Auditor's attitude and pc mannerism changes. Use the Auditor's Report Form to get the time of processes. Read and take all your data from Worksheets and compare it to and see that C/S was complied with and ensure Standard Tech was applied. If you can't read the reports, send it back to have the Auditor over-print illegible words. Never try to case supervise (C/S) an illegible worksheet as you'll only run into head-aches. The After Session Examiner's Report gives you the first clue of how suspicious you should be in examining the folder and whether or not auditing reports contain falsities. Standard Tech You're never led by anything into departing from Standard Tech. The only reason it doesn't work is that it hasn't been applied. The main question of a Case Supervisor is: Was it applied? If you follow this exactly, you'll never miss. CASE SUPERVISOR DATA A Case Supervisor should watch for Ethics record of pcs who have been C/Sed. If they fall on their head, get into low conditions, the folder should be reviewed. Most probably the auditor did not do what was ordered and, if folder looks okay, chances are the auditing report is false as something is wrong or pc would not be in trouble. AUDITING AND ETHICS Cases undergoing Ethics actions, Comm Evs, amends projects or low conditions should not be audited until the Ethics matter is cleared up and complete. It only louses up their cases to audit them when under such stress."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 4 HCOB 25.6.70 LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 110 17.11.12 ADMIN Auditors must always put the pc's grade or OT level very prominently on the Auditing Report. A Case Supervisor cannot properly C/S a case without having this data. To not do this is out admin. OUT ADMIN – LIABILITY Much has been said about the importance of admin in auditing but auditors just aren't getting it – so...... it now becomes a liability to have out admin in pcs' folders. Folders are to be submitted with the latest session on top. Auditor's report form is sta-pled to Worksheets which are dated, numbered and in order, latest on top. Summary Report is then attached to the auditing report and W/Ss with a paper clip. This of course is as well as the usual admin such as legible writing, re-writing illegible words, marking reads and F/Ns, and all End Phenomena, etc. The C/S instructions for that session go under that session, so you get C/S 4/6/68, Au-diting Session 4/6/68, C/S 5/6/68, Auditing Session 5/6/68, C/S 7/6/68, etc, etc. As the whole purpose of Class VIII is to minimize the time in auditing, by doing per-fect Standard Tech, this cannot be done if it takes 15 minutes to put the folder in order, so it can then be case supervised, so it can then be audited. GROSS CASE SUPERVISION ERRORS 1. Failing to use progress and advance programs when needed. 2. Ordering unnecessary repairs. 3. Trying to use repair processes to get case gain instead of getting the pc onto the next grade. 4. Not writing down C/S instructions, but giving them to an auditor verbally. 5. Talking to the auditor re the case. 6. Talking to pc re his case. 7. Failing to send pc to examiner if you're unsure why his folder has been sent up for C/S. 8. Being reasonable. 9. Not having enough Ethics presence to get his orders followed. 10. Issuing involved repair orders. 11. Biggest Gross Case Supervision Error for C/S is not to read through the pc folder.

A Worksheet is always foolscap, 8 x 13 inches, written on both sides and each page is numbered, back and front, top center of page. This is so an Auditor can say, \"Now the R/S occurred on page 25,\" which saves a lot of time. Further it gives the proper number of pages the session went. The Worksheet is written in two columns. The Auditor writes down the left-hand col-umn and then down the right-hand column. CONTENT OF WORKSHEET The most important parts of the session to be noted are: A. When the TA goes up (on what?) B. When the TA goes down (on what?) C. When an F/N occurs (on what – any cog?) D. When VGIs occur (on what?) E. When BIs occur (on what?) F. How the process ran (what commands are being run?) G.

SHORTHANDING Auditors usually develop a system of shorthanding the session actions being done, so that session speed is not hampered by Admin. For example, the repetitive process: Recall a change Recall a no-change Recall a failed change is run as a bracket (the pc is given the first command, then the second and then the third and then the first and then the second, etc.). The first command can be abbreviated to 1, the second to 2, and the third to 3. The W/S therefore would look like: 1232   2.8        a 9 failed 9 (note that each word of the command is cleared before clearing the command as a whole) change 9 no-change 9 recall 9  F/N    1.         cleared 2.       cleared 3.       cleared "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE WORKSHEETS 3 BTB 6.11.72R VII LEVEL 0-2 CASE SUPERVISOR INSTANT HAT 115 17.11.12 1249   2.6        1.

Whatever system of abbreviation is used by the auditor, the worksheet must communicate to the c/s what actions were taken during the session. LEGIBILITY Worksheets should be written legibly. They are never recopied. The Auditor should always read over his W/sheets before turning in the folder to the Case Supervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read, they should be put in in block print, in red. Example:   TOTALLY      (red) want to get 746'//< well  (illegible word) This can be overdone, to the extent that it is almost sarcasm. At the most it should just run into one or two corrections to a page. If the Auditor is having to correct the page more than that he should learn how to write rapidly and legibly.

It is not given by the C/S be-cause an auditor is a friend or because he would be offended if he didn't get one. \"Well Done\" given by the C/S for a session means the pc had F/N VGIs at the ex-aminer immediately after the session. This then presupposes that session lines include an Examiner even if it's a receptionist and it includes the use and understanding of Exam Reports. (See HCO PL 26 Jan '70, Issue III, or any rewrite and Exam tech.) It presupposes the Examiner has a meter to hand and that the pc makes a statement. Thus, if there are no Exam Reports there can't be a well done given, eh? True enough. A C/S who C/Ses without Exam Reports done by a different person than the auditor is asking to fly blind and to get auditor \"PR\" (public relations or brag) and false auditing reports. No F/N at Exam no well done. This is harsh as early on pcs often get no F/N at Examiner. But in every case there are current earlier tech errors on the case when the F/N doesn't get from the session to the Examiner. It is also harsh because the failure to get the F/N to the Examiner could be a C/S error! But (see HCO B 24 May '70, \"Auditor's Rights\", C/S Series 1), the auditor should not have accepted the C/S. The C/S could be too heavy, or the case needed a repair first or the process ordered is not part of a proper program. Hours successfully audited includes only \"Well Done\" or \"Very Well Done\" ses-sions.

F/N VGIs at Examiner. 2. The auditing is totally flubless and by the book. 3. The whole C/S ordered was done without departure and to the expected result. NO MENTION A no mention of well done or very well done or anything simply means: 1. F/N did not get to Examiner. 2. No major auditing errors exist in the session. FLUNKS A Flunk is given when: 1. The F/N did not get to Examiner and didn't occur at session end. 2. Major errors or flubs occurred like no EP, multiple somatic, unflown ruds, etc. 3. The C/S was not followed or completed. 4. Auditor's Rights listed errors occurred. 5. No F/N and BIs at Examiner. The exact error must be noted on the worksheet and in the next C/S along with the Flunk. FLUNK AND RETRAIN When an auditor does not improve but continues to get No Mentions and Flunks, he requires retraining. Such retraining must include: 1. Cleaning up all Misunderstoods of tech. 2. Cleaning up willingness to audit. 3. Cleaning up overts on people and pcs. 4. Examination by inspection of TRs. 5. Starrating material missed or not grasped as per session troubles.

Let him go on flubbing and getting no results. 2. Direct invalidation of his intentions or future or potential. In 1, nearly all auditors who stop auditing never really knew how to audit in the first place or have gross misunderstoods or have accumulated intentional or unintentional overts on pcs or have been too harshly invalidated. When they don't really grasp the ease and sim-plicity of auditing they get into other troubles. A really well trained, smooth auditor never gets any real charge on his case on the sub-ject of auditing. When you let an auditor flub, the whole subject gets invalidated and he loses his value because he goes into doubt. This can be said with complete confidence today as the whole of Dianetics and Scientology is there and it works very very well indeed if it is used and if the C/Sing and auditing is correct and flubless. AUDITOR HANDLING The C/S is really not just the Case Supervisor, he is also the auditors' handler. Like a boxer's trainer or a star's director, the C/S handles his guys. They are all a bit different, auditors. There are prima donnas and meek mousey ones and steady-on ones and all kinds. They get the credit for the sessions from the pcs most often. They really don't like not to be C/Sed. And they value the well dones and the very well dones and they flinch at the flunks. And the honest ones know all about it before they turn it in. And some don't mention the flub but think you're a fool if you miss it. So it's important to have a constant in assigning what the auditor is given for the ses-sion. Well Done Auditing Hours are all that's valid for a stat. So a C/S must be very exact and correct in his determination of well done, very well done, no mention and (forlornly) a flunk. This should remove argument from the matter and bring certainty. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:rr.rd"}]
