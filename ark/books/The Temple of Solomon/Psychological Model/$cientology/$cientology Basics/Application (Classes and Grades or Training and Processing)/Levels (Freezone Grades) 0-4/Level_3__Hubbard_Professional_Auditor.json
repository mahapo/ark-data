(issued May 1965) Note. Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. \"Quickie grades\" entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not \"entirely a tech matter\" as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can't get the technology applied then you can't deliver what's promised. It's as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what's promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 2 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 3 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 4 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 5 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 6 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 LEVEL 3 7 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don't muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs.

TRs DEFINITION The term \"TRs\" is an abbreviation for Training Regimen or Routine. TRs are also of-ten referred to as Training Drills. While each individual TR drill has its own specific purpose, the overall purpose and definition of TRs is given here fully and finally: TRs are methods of drilling the communication formula and be-coming expert in its handling and use. That definition applies to any TR. At times over the years when it has been dropped out or obscured or misunderstood, auditor training quality and results have suffered."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  2  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 22 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Therefore, this full and final definition is to be posted in large letters in any course room where Professional TRs are taught. It should be emblazoned upon the foreheads and minds of TR Course Supervisors and all students on TRs Courses in training to become audi-tors. It should be known broadly and understood and emphasized. In 1971, due to the following factors, I found it necessary to modernize TRs 0 to 4. 1. The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs. 2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit. 3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their sub-jects but TRs. 4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic proc-esses stem directly from inability to do the TRs. 5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further. 6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. The preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubs without ARC breaks. These factors hold very true today and always will. Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. Profes-sional TRs Courses are not a tea party. The TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy and HGC and in the future should never be relaxed. A more gradient approach to TRs is taught on specially packaged co-audits for those with no prior technical training, where the same degree of flawlessness and skill demanded of a professional auditor is not demanded of the untrained co-auditor. And there is still another gradient of TRs found on courses for new public in Division 6, where the person is getting his first experience in handling communication in his life and livingness. But on a Professional TRs Course for auditors absolutely no standards are lowered. Professional auditors in training are given real TRs – rough, tough and hard. To do oth-erwise is to lose 90% of the results. There is nothing pale and patty-cake about TRs. This HCOB means what it says. It does not mean something else. It does not im-ply another meaning. It is not open to interpretation from another source. THE A-R-C TRIANGLE As TRs are methods of drilling the communication cycle, one cannot expect to master TRs without familiarity with that cycle. And basic to the drilling or any real use of the comm"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  3  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 23 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR cycle is an understanding of Affinity, Reality and Communication, which make up the ARC Triangle. There is no attempt here to repeat all of the existing data on the ARC Triangle and its use. Any student put on TRs must first have done a sound study of this theory. The data exists in the books: THE PROBLEMS OF WORK, Chapter 6: Affinity, Reality and Communication THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THOUGHT, Chapter 5: The ARC Triangle DIANETICS 55! and in various HCOB Bulletins in the Technical Volumes. A student ready for TR drills would know and would have demonstrated how Affinity, Reality and Communication interrelate. He would be familiar with how one improves the level of ARC by first raising one side of this important triangle in order to raise the next side and the next, and how ARC brings about Understanding. When he has that data he's better prepared to handle the comm cycle. THE FULL CYCLE OF COMMUNICATION Communication Defined If one were to put it very simply, it could be said, correctly, that communication is the interchange of ideas across space. A finer statement of this is given in the following definition from Axiom 28: Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or parti-cle from source-point across a distance to receipt-point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt-point a duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source-point. The simplest statement of the formula of communication is Cause-Distance-Effect. When we do a close inspection of this formula and the cycle involved, its many ele-ments come to view. The Parts Of The Full Communication Cycle The full cycle of communication is made up of these components: Observation, Confront, Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Par-ticle or Impulse or Message, Distance, Estimation of Distance, Control (Start-Change-Continue-Stop), Direction, Time and Timing, Velocity, Volume, Clarity, Interest, Impinge-ment, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Answer, Acknowledgement, Understanding. It also includes Nothingness or Somethingness."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  4  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 24 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Each TR drill is designed to train the student in one or more of these various compo-nents, until he has become expert in handling each part of the communication cycle and the communication cycle as a whole. When a student understands and has fully demonstrated the basic theory of communi-cation in clay, including the theory of the ARC Triangle and how it works in practice and the use of the communication cycle and all of its parts, he is well equipped to begin his training in TRs. DRILLING TRs ON A PROFESSIONAL TRs COURSE The student first studies the TR, clears any misunderstood words in it and makes sure he understands it. Then he drills it. He must do TRs. If during the drilling he has questions about the TR, he restudies it and gets right back onto drilling it. At no time may a coach or supervisor give a verbal interpretation of the HCOB. All queries and questions are handled by referring the student to the HCOB, getting him to restudy or re-word clear the drill. Then getting him to do the drill. In addition to this Bulletin, the supervisor may have the student and his twin study, in HCOB 18 Apr 80 TR CRITICISM, the section on the specific TR drill they are trying to do. On professional TRs, done the hard way, students drill each TR to a pass, one at a time. This is the rough, tough way it was done earlier, in the '60s, with results. The earlier action of getting a student through each TR itself, one at a time, and increasing the gradient of toughness as he does that TR, is what has proven successful. If a student has trouble and hangs up and can't pass an upper TR, he hasn't made it on the lower TRs. This has been proven conclusively. Start him back at the be-ginning of the TRs again. He re-drills each TR until he does it competently to a pass. If he then hangs up on the lower TRs, you would put him all the way back to restudy ARC and the cycle of communication, as there will be something there he hasn't grasped. TRs are coached and supervised with attention and with the intention of getting the student to win. By win we mean honestly mastering each TR as he goes. There's got to be a supervisor there to ensure this occurs. Lax, permissive coaching or lax, permissive supervision have no place on a Profes-sional TRs Course. They are simply an extension of the permissiveness of modern education where nobody winds up educated. This is not how we train. Permissiveness is nothing more than a symptom of the inability to confront. A professional TRs Course is taught and taught hard, not permissively. The above points are those which make up the expertise of how it is done. There are not many of these points but they have to be emphasized."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  5  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 25 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR TRAINING DRILLS 0-4 These TRs are done exactly per this HCOB without added actions or change. NUMBER: OT TR 0 1971 REVISED 1980 NAME: Operating Thetan Being There THEORY: OT TR 0 is the drill which provides an undercut to the actual use of the communi-cation formula. For any communication to take place, it requires somebody there. On OT TR 0 the student is drilling simply being there as potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Receipt-point. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Two students sit facing each other with eyes closed, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train the student simply to be there comfortably. The idea is to get the student able to BE there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there and not do anything else but be there. TRAINING STRESS: Students sit facing each other with eyes closed. There is no conversa-tion. This is a silent drill. There is no twitching, moving, confronting with a body part, \"sys-tem\" or vias used or anything else added to be there. One will usually see blackness or an area of the room when one's eyes are closed. Be there, comfortably. This does not mean the stu-dent is supposed to be completely unfeeling or unaware. And he does not get into a figure-figure or go into weird additives or considerations. There is no complexity to this drill. It means exactly what it says – simply be there, comfortably. Students do not coach each other on OT TR 0. The Supervisor does the coaching, covering the whole classroom, spotting any twitches, squirming, etc., and flunking them. If a student goes to sleep or starts boiling off, the supervisor gets him back onto the drill. He simply keeps the students at it. PATTER: None for students. Supervisor starts the drill with \"Start\" and uses\"That's it\" to ter-minate the drill. When he needs to flunk a student he uses \"Flunk\" and indicates what the flunk is on. When a student can BE there comfortably for some time, the drill is passed. NOTE: OT TR 0 would only be coached on a student by his twin if the student had flunked a later TR and been put back onto OT TR 0. It is then up to his twin to get him through, coach-ing him as the supervisor would, with the supervisor also keeping an eye on it. This means the student coach (who would have his eyes open for this coaching) sits across from the student who is doing OT TR 0, observing him and flunking twitches, squirming, etc. During this coaching, the coach would use \"Start\" \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\" as given in the Patter section above.

NUMBER: TR 0 CONFRONTING REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting. THEORY: On TR 0, in addition to potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Re-ceipt-point, the following parts of the comm cycle are entered in: Observation, Distance, Con-sideration, Attention, Confront. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other with eyes open, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront another person with auditing only or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there comfortably and confront and not do anything else but be there and confront TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making any con-versation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and do noth-ing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle, be embarrassed or anaten, or ex-hibit any reactive body motion which would be distractive to a preclear. TR 0 requires some coaching. It can be done uncoached for an initial period to accustom stu-dents to confronting and to permit some time for student to get through the initial manifesta-tions he may encounter when first doing the drills. Thereafter, the drill is coached on a student by his twin, and vice versa, on a turnabout basis. It will be found the student tends to confront with a body part, rather than just confront, or tends to use a system of confronting rather than just be there. This can show up in any number of ways including fidgeting, giggling, twitching, or any distractive motion or manifestation. Flunks are given for those as they are indications of non-confront, and they would be taken up and coached on the drill. Automatic body functions which are not distractive, such as normal breathing, swallowing, blinking, are not taken up by the coach or the supervisor. To clarify what has been known in the past as \"Blinkless TR 0\", the statement should be made that this does not mean the person never blinks. It is defined here finally and in full to mean that when a person's TR 0 is in he doesn't exhibit manifestations of inability to confront, in-cluding blinking nervously or flinching or doing anything else that would be distractive to a pc and shows a non-confront. PATTER: When TR 0 is coached, coach uses \"Start\" to begin the coaching period. He uses \"Flunk\" when the student shows any manifestation of non-confront, indicates what the non-confront is, and uses \"Start\" to begin the drill again. \"That's it\" is used to terminate the drill."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  7  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 27 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR NOTE: The drill is mis-named if Confronting means to do something to the person. The whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of another person without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self. Confront-ing with a body part can cause somatics in that body part being used to confront. The solution is just to be there and confront. On a Professional TRs Course the student passes when he can just be there and do a straight, uninterrupted 2 hours of good, acceptable confront. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\". Revised by L. Ron Hubbard April 1961 on finding that SOP Goals required for its success a much higher level of technical skill than earlier processes. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in August 1971 after research discoveries on TRs. Further re-vised in 1980 by L. Ron Hubbard to clarify \"Blinkless TR 0\" and coaching, and to include theory on the communication cycle. NUMBER: TR 0 BULLBAIT REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting Preclear Bullbaited. THEORY: On TR 0 Bullbaited the student drills being there as potential Cause or Source-point and being there as Effect or Receipt-point, with Duplication. He is also drilling Obser-vation, Distance, Consideration, Attention, Confront and particularly confronting a preclear who is being Cause or Source-point. The gradient of confront is increased on this drill, with emphasis on the fact that the student is confronting a preclear no matter what the preclear says or does. COMMANDS: Coach: \"Start\" \"That's it\" \"Flunk\". POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably and confront a preclear in a position three feet in front of the preclear without being thrown off, distracted or reacting in any way to what the preclear says or does. It is on TR 0 Bullbaited that the student learns to confront a preclear. TRAINING STRESS: After the student has passed TR 0 and he can just BE there comfortably and confront, \"bull baiting\" can begin. Anything added to being there and confronting the preclear is sharply flunked by the coach. Twitches, sighs, fidgets, anything except just being there is promptly flunked, with the reason why. PATTER: Student coughs. Coach: \"Flunk! You coughed. Start.\" This is the whole of the coach's patter as a coach. Coach then repeats whatever he had said or done that caused the student to react. He continues to coach the student on that \"button\", flattening it to a win for the student before going on to another button or other bullbaiting."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  8  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 28 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Button: An item, word, phrase, subject, voice tone, mannerism, anything that causes a person to react, causes him discomfort, embarrassment, upset or to laugh uncontrollably, etc. It is called a \"button\" because when you push it you get a reaction. PATTER AS A CONFRONTED SUBJECT: Bullbaiting is done on a gradient, giving the stu-dent lighter situations to begin with so student is not plunged into overwhelm at the start. Coach gets the student through the lighter situations and confronting those, then gradually stiffens the gradient, giving the student more and more to confront. The coach may say any-thing or do anything except leave the chair. The student's \"buttons\" should be found (these will be spotted by the coach during drilling) and each button flattened before it is left. A but-ton is never left unflat. Any words that are not coaching words may receive no response from the student. If the student responds, the coach is instantly a coach (see patter above). Student passes when he can BE there comfortably and confront a preclear without being thrown off or distracted or reacting in any way to anything the coach says or does. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\".

Ron Hubbard in August 1971 after research discoveries on TRs. Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to emphasize the purpose of TR 0 Bullbaited and to include data on \"buttons\" and the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR-1 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Dear Alice THEORY: On TR 1, the student is using Observation, Consideration and confront as previ-ously drilled. He is also drilling being Cause or Source-point, awareness of Effect or Receipt-Point, and as Cause getting a Message (or Impulse or Particle) across a Distance to Receipt-point with Attention, Interest, Control, correct Direction, correct estimation of Distance, Time and correct Timing, correct Velocity, correct Volume, Clarity and Impingement, and with the Intention that it is received and duplicated at Receipt-point. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver a command newly and in a new unit of time to a preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using a via, and to deliver a command with the intention that it is received. COMMANDS: A phrase (with the \"he said\" omitted) is picked out of the book Alice in Won-derland and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where he is. In other words it must be received by the coach. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to the coach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural not artificial. Diction and elocution have no part in it. Loudness may have."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  9  HCOB  16.8.71RA  LEVEL 3 29 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The coach must have received the command (or question) clearly and have understood it be-fore he says \"Good\". The operative word here is received. The communication must be re-ceived at Receipt-point as when that has occurred duplication can take place. Any datum that every command must sound exactly like the last command is false. Each question or command is delivered in a new unit of time. When that does not occur the same tonality will be noted, command after command, and the student appears robotic. A command delivered naturally is one that is delivered newly in a new unit of time. Don't buy an unchanging student or a wrongly done TR. If a student is unchanging (delivers 3 or 4 robotic TR-1s in a row) flunk him, coax him to do it correctly, make sure he knows and understands the drill and do all possible to get him de-livering a command naturally that arrives. But if there is still no change, put him back on OT TR 0 as he hasn't made it on his lower TRs. PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", says \"Good\" without a new start if the command is re-ceived. He says \"Flunk\" if the command is not received. \"Start\" is not used again. \"That's it\" is used to end the activity or to terminate for a brief discussion. Any discussion is kept to a minimum. If student has a question it is acknowledged, student studies the TR again for any necessary clarification and is put back on the drill. If session is terminated for a discussion, coach must say \"Start\" again before it resumes. This drill is passed only when the student can put across a command naturally, without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures, and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly. When the coach thinks the student has done it he asks the student if he has done it. If the coach is satisfied that he is receiving the commands, each newly in a new unit of time, and the student is satisfied that he has done it, he passes on to the next TR. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to teach the communication formula to new students. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard 1961 to increase auditing ability. Fur-ther revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to emphasize the purpose of the drill and to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 2 REVISED 1978 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Acknowledgments. THEORY: On TR 2, the student is using all of those parts of the comm cycle previously drilled. He is also drilling switching from Cause (Source-point) to Effect (Receipt-point) in order to receive, Understand and Duplicate the preclear's Answer, and then back to Cause to give the Acknowledgement. The real emphasis here is on the drilling of Control (the Start-Change-Stop of a communica-tion), as he uses the Acknowledgement to bring the communication to a full stop. Timing, Velocity, Volume and Impingement also enter into this drill. PURPOSE: To teach the student that an acknowledgement is a method of controlling preclear communication and that an acknowledgement is a full stop. The student must understand and appropriately acknowledge the comm and in such a way that it does not continue the comm."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 10 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 30 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from \"Alice in Wonderland\" omitting the \"He said\" and the student thoroughly acknowledges them. The student says \"Good\", \"Fine\", \"Okay\", \"I heard that\", anything only so long as it is appropriate to the pc's comm – in such a way as ac-tually to convince the person who is sitting there as the preclear that he has heard it. The coach repeats any line he feels was not truly acknowledged. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knows it was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and under acknowl-edgement. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgement across, then even him out. Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle of communica-tion or an encouragement to the preclear to go on and that an acknowledgement must be ap-propriate for the pc's comm. The student must be broken of the habit of robotically using \"Good\", \"Thank you\" as the only acks. To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc with an acknowledgement or can take a pc's head off with an acknowledgement. PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", reads a line and says \"Flunk\" every time the coach feels there has been an improper acknowledgement. The coach repeats the same line each time the coach says \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate the ses-sion. \"Start\" must be used to begin a new coaching after a \"That's it\". HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach new students that an acknowledgement ends a communication cycle and a period of time, that a new command begins a new period of time. Revised 1961 and again in 1978 by L. Ron Hubbard. Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 2½ REVISED 1978 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Half Acks. THEORY: The same parts of the comm cycle are drilled on TR 2 1/2 as on TR 2, with one exception; the emphasis here is on drilling Acknowledgement and Control in such a way as to bring about the \"Continue\" (or \"change\") part of the Control cycle. PURPOSE: To teach the student that a half acknowledgement is a method of encouraging a pc to communicate. COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from \"Alice in Wonderland\" omitting the \"He said\" and the student half acks the coach. The coach repeats any line he feels was not half acked. POSITION: The student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: Teach student that a half acknowledgement is an encouragement to the pc to continue talking. Curb over-acknowledgement that stops a pc from talking. Teach him further that a half ack is a way of keeping a pc talking by giving the pc the feeling that he is being heard."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 11 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 31 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", reads a line and says \"Flunk\" every time the coach feels there has been an improper half ack. The coach repeats the same line each time the coach says \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate the session. If the session is terminated for discussion, the coach must say \"Start\" again before it resumes. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in July 1978 to train auditors in how to get a pc to continue talking as in R3RA. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 3 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Duplicative Question. THEORY: On TR 3 the student is drilling using all the parts of the comm cycle, with empha-sis on getting a communication duplicated and completed. PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each time newly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions, and to acknowledge it. To teach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked. COMMANDS: \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone be-fore. Duplicating the auditing question without variation in a new unit of time does not mean a robotic duplication of tone of voice, command after command. It means that the original ques-tion asked is asked in a new unit of time without variation of the question. Any idea that the student must give every command sounding exactly like the last command is a false datum and only serves to mis-train the student into robotic delivery. The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time. The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she fails to repeat the exact questions, if he or she \"Q and As\" with excursions taken by the coach. Q and A means: Asking a question that is based on the last answer. It never completes any cycle. (REF: HCOB 5 APR 1980, Q & A, THE REAL DEFINITION.) The student is also flunked for ro-botic delivery of the question or command. PATTER: The coach uses \"Start\" and \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" is used to terminate the session. \"Start\" must be used to begin a coaching session again after a \"That's it\". The coach is not bound after starting to answer the student's question but may comm lag or give a commenting type answer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer. Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the stu-dent. Example:"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 12 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 32 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Yes\" Student: \"Good\" Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Aren't you hungry?\" Student: \"Yes.\" Coach: \"Flunk\" When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, \"I'll repeat the auditing ques-tion\", and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgement and as needed, the repeat statement is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A is flunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utter the next com-mand (or with a long comm lag) is flunked. A choppy or premature acknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) is flunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" or \"That's it\" should have no influence on the student except to get him to give a repeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, \"I'll repeat the auditing command.\" \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" and \"That's it\" may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Any other statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If he succeeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as \"I just had a cognition.\" 'Coach divertive' statements should all concern the student, and should be de-signed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing. The student's job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, using only command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or her hands to prevent a 'Blow' (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than the above, it is a flunk and the coach must say so. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is no longer needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. This TR was redesigned to improve that frailty. Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to in-clude the definition of Q and A, flunks for robotic delivery of question, and to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Preclear Originations. THEORY: On TR 4 the student drills handling another's origination of a communication cycle as well as handling his own cycle of communication, and ensuring that both of these cycles are completed. All the parts of the cycle of communication come into play in this drill."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 13 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 33 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination. COMMANDS: The student runs \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" on coach. Coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list (see Attachment of this HCOB, taken from the Preclear Origination Sheet at the back of The Book of E-Meter Drills). Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1. Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he cor-rects the student into better handling. PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concern the auditor. Otherwise the coach's patter is the same as in TR 3 (\"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"That's it\" and \"Start\" to resume the coaching session after a \"That's it\"). The student's patter is governed by: 1. Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving the repeat statement \"I'll repeat the auditing command\", and then giving it. Anything else is a flunk. The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem that concerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3.) Flunks are given if the student does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session. Flunks are also given for too abrupt a shift of attention or too slow a shift of attention back to the session, or for failure to return the pc to session at all. Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student's failure to differentiate between these (by trying to handle them) and coach's remarks about self as \"pc\" is a flunk. Student's failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should not always read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. By Originate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. By Comment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations are handled, Comments are disregarded by the student."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 14 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 34 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The coach uses the Comments & Originations Sheet, attached to this issue, choosing items at random to drill the student in handling. When the student has mastered 1. Understanding; 2. Acknowledging; 3. Returning pc to session, the gradient is upped and the student is flunked for any part of the comm cycle being out. This would include non-confront, failure to get a communication across, using a half acknowl-edgement improperly (and thus inviting the pc to continue endlessly when the pc isn't even answering the question asked) when a full stop acknowledgement is required, failure to en-courage the pc to continue when it is necessary, failure to get the question answered or to de-liver each command in a new unit of time, as well as any flub in handling preclear origina-tions. The drill is passed when the student can handle cycles of communication smoothly and natu-rally. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks, Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the comm course TRs despite its appearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors. ROBOTIC TRS Stiff, unnatural TRs are robotic TRs. Students and auditors who haven't mastered the TRs will handle communication robotically. Anatomy Of A Robot It can be said of robots that: 1. They don't know what a comm cycle is. 2. They have never really passed OT TR 0. 3. They have never really passed TR 0. 4. They have never really passed TR 0 Bullbait. 5. They don't do TR 1 in a new unit of time each time they give it, so they all sound alike and they probably have TR 3 mixed up with TR 1, or they are stuck in an unflat 0 Se-ries (OT TR 0, TR 0, TR 0 BB)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 15 HCOB 16.8.71RA LEVEL 3 35 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR 6. They don't realize their TRs are addressed to the person in front of them but are probably addressed to the instructors for a pass. And so, with a combination of the above, these students and auditors will look like robots. They would never get the product of a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. And it's possible that they don't know that that is their product. The point is, however, that it would be almost impossible for any student or auditor to go on looking like a robot if he actually did the TRs. The remedy for robotic TRs is to put the student back onto restudy of the basics, the ARC Triangle and the cycle of communication, and then to re-drill the TRs from OT TR 0 on up, each one this time to a real pass. With these standard actions done he will reach the EP and wind up a Valuable Final Product. VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCT AND END PHENOMENON OF TRs ON A PROFESSIONAL TRs COURSE The Primary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A Professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. The Secondary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A person with the session and social presence of a professional auditor and that pres-ence can be summed up as a being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation no matter how rough. The End Phenomenon of TRs is: A being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out. With honest drilling of the cycle of communication on TRs these skills are fully achievable. And any being mastering these skills is capable in the extreme. L.

In assessing, some auditors have made assessment questions into statements of fact, which of course is a cousin to evaluation. A downcurve at the end of an assessment question contributes to making it a state-ment. Questions should go up at the end. WRONG  RIGHT cycles/sec or note A remedy for this is to record ordinary conversation. Ask some normal questions and make some normal statements and you will find that the voice tone rises on a question and goes down on a statement. Assessing with a statement's tone of voice instead of a questioning tone of voice re-sults in evaluation for the pc. The pc feels accused or evaluated for rather than assessed and an auditor can get a lot of false and protest reads. It's all tone of voice. Auditors have to be drilled in asking questions. Assessment ques-tions have an upcurve at the end. Get it? Then drill it. L.

Here are some observations I have made on the coaching of E-Meter drills, which I feel could be of use: 1. The coach's needle is dirty. The student's out comm cycle has cut his comm in some way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cycle that went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles. 2. If a coach's TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that the student's comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach is either (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing. 3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed him and pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blow down. If there is no blow down, the coach has flunked the wrong thing. 4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although the needle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR 0) for lack of impingement and reach. 5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with the student. 6. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get the Meter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably – \"but I'm assessing the bank!\" They haven't realized that banks don't read, only thetans impinged upon by the bank – therefore the TR 1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meter responds proportion-ately to the amount of ARC in the Session. (See HCOB 29 Jan 70 for lists that don't read.) L.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says, \"Your needle is float-ing.\" This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the sub-ject of \"Floating Needles\". A lot of by-passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called end phenomena. End phenomena is defined as \"those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended\". It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended. 1. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 2 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 3 46 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR But that's if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating nee-dle. If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know – so that's . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,\" he can upset the pc's bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won't ap-pear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor's pre-mature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc's end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition. C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N van-ished and TA rising, requiring \"rehab\") can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a begin-ning F/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. \"I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating\" can be a chop. Also it's a false report if it isn't widely floating and will keep floating."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 3 47 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor's Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changed to read \"A real wide F/N\". Here it's a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problem is not difficult. I follow this rule – I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don't ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it's his case we are han-dling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc's cognition. If it isn't there, I give the next command due. If it still isn't there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure or Release, depending on whether it's Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, \"Your needle is floating.\" DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn't been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn't grinding. It's waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon. The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an era-sure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientol-ogy as a problem than to Dianetics."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 4 HCOB 20.2.70 LEVEL 3 48 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR But ALL auditors must realize that the end phenomena of successful auditing is not just an F/N but has 3 more requisites.

This changes an earlier belief that, in order to be valid, the tone arm had to be between 2.0 and 3.0 for it to be called a floating needle. Carefully examining dozens of F/Ns which occurred with the TA well above 3.0 and looking for any troubles with the case following calling the F/N an F/N, I found that there were no adverse consequences. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that a floating needle is a floating needle regard-less of where the tone arm position may be.

There are low TA cases and high TA cases and the state of the TA remains im-portant and all data regarding TA positions are valid. An ARC break needle (an F/N accompanied by bad indicators) remains an ARC break needle and nothing in this finding changes that. It must be handled. (One ordinarily checks for an ARC break in this case.) This finding about TA position and F/Ns has been corrected earlier.

When not enough data to C/S. \"Two way comm to obtain data about case progress and status.\" 2. When pc infers something in case that's not been handled. \"Two way comm to find what pc thinks should be handled on case.\" 3. When pc hasn't cogged on end result. \"Two way comm on (process just run) to see what thoughts pc had regarding it.\" 4. When pc's post purpose is being cleaned up. \"Two way comm on how his post pur-pose fits into org – or if he can do it.\" In all these instances the C/S may be as specific as he likes about what he wants asked or cleared up. In other words the quoted C/Ses above are only examples. Each of the above four general types can have a great number of different questions. The C/S must be very fa-miliar with the four types given in capitals [bold] above. On his part the auditor can vary the C/S's question around to get different slants on it. The auditor doesn't have to get an F/N on the two way comm session but often does. The auditor can introduce a curve, an alter-is, by Q and A with the pc and by evalua-tion. The drill on two way comm is the old ask and listen. A Q and A is of course echoing the pc's statement. Example: Pc: \"I never liked my fa-ther.\" Auditor: \"What about your father?\" Pc: \"He was cruel.\" Auditor: \"What about cruel people?\" Pc: \"I don't like them.\" Auditor: \"What else don't you like?\" And so on and on. A correct session is for the auditor to hold to the C/S's main line of questioning no matter how he phrases it and listen to and write down what the pc says. Evaluation in auditing two way comm is the other deadly sin. The auditor asks and lis-tens. He doesn't explain anything to the pc. Example: Pc: \"I didn't dig the process.\" Auditor: \"Well you see that process was intended to........\" and here we go on evaluation. Even an auditor's facial expression can be evaluation. Ask and listen and ack. Prompt only by varying the original question now and then, that's what the good two way comm auditor does."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"TWO WAY COMM C/SES 2 HCOB 21.4.70 LEVEL 3 52 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR W/S The two way comm worksheet is rather more detailed as to what the pc says than process worksheets. The C/S needs the data. Or in looking it over the auditor himself, if he's his own C/S, will need the data. The questions the auditor asks should be noted on the worksheet as a guide. MAXIM It is a C/S maxim \"when in doubt order a two way comm\". TWO WAY COMM AUDITOR Any auditor can two way comm. Saint hillers were best at it. Academy level auditors can be used in this, even Dianetic auditors. The only reservation is not to assign an auditor whose grade is lower than the pc's. The auditor's class is not as important as his grade. The reason for this is that the OT, pre-OT, in being two way commed by a Grade V, can blow the poor auditor apart or can be stuck with a data withhold. METER All two way comm is of course done on a meter. It is, however, not a sec-check or prepcheck. TA position and needle reaction and F/Ns are important to the C/S. One doesn't two way comm past an F/N, cog and VGIs. L.

Therefore it follows all the rules of auditing. B. Any error that occurs in other auditing can occur in two way comm auditing. Errors in a two way comm session must be carefully looked for as they easily can be masked in the worksheet. C. Auditors must be persuaded by the C/S to make notation of auditing essentials in two way comm as of senior importance to pc's text (which is also made note of in the W/S). D. The questions asked in two way comm can be very incorrect just as rote processes can be. E. An auditor must be trained as a two way comm auditor (class II). Otherwise he will evaluate, Q and A and commit other faults. F. If an ARC break occurs early in a two way comm session and is not handled as such the rest of the session is audited over an ARC break and can put a pc into a sad effect. G.

Two way comm processes must be flattened to F/N. If an F/N doesn't occur then the subject didn't read in the first place or the auditor Qed and Aed or evaluated or changed the subject or the TRs were out or the pc's ruds were out. J. A two way comm subject chosen must be tested for read in that session before being used for two way comm. K. Improper two way comm questions can plunge the pc into an out rud situation not then handled. \"Is anything upsetting you?\" or any mention of upsets by the auditor is the same as asking for an ARC break. \"Has anything been troubling – worrying you lately?\" is the same as asking for a PTP. \"Who aren't you talking to?\" is asking for W/Hs. L. The subject of major processes should be kept out of two way comm C/Ses, auditors' questions and two way comm assessment lists (ARC breaks, problems, overts, changes or any major auditing subject, as they are too heavy, being the buttons of the bank). M. The C/S should only let class II or above auditors do two way comm sessions. N. A rud going out in a two way comm session must be put in by the auditor. O. A two way comm session should end in an F/N. P. Auditors whose two way comm sessions do not end in F/N must be taught to check the subject for read before using, not to Q and A, not to evaluate and given a refresher on two way comm tapes and HCO Bs. Q. In a two way comm session that flubs the C/S must be careful to isolate the errors just as in any other auditing session that flubs and put them right. R. A two way comm subject that reads on test and doesn't F/N on two way comm must be checked for O/R (if TA went up) and rehabbed by the 1965 rehab method, or prep-checked or just continued. ____________________ The whole point to all of this is that a two way comm session is auditing.

It is a science which has exact rules. Foremost in the rules is: Don't use a Listing Question in Two Way Comm. By a \"listing question\" is meant any question which directly or indirectly calls for items in the pc's answer. Use of \"who\", \"what\", \"which\" instantly turns a TWC into a listing question. Listing questions are governed by the rules of Listing and Nulling. If you use a listing question accidentally in TWC you can get the same bad reactions from a pc that you would get on a wrongly done list. The reason for pc upsets in TWC is hidden as it is not apparently a listing process, rarely gets the correction a bad list would get. Asking \"who\" or \"what\" or \"which\" during a TWC after the main question can also turn it into a Listing and Nulling process. TWC questions must be limited to feelings, reactions, significances. They must never ask for terminals or locations. Example: \"Who upset you?\" in TWC causes the pc to give items. This is a List. \"What are you upset about?\" does the same thing. \"Which town were you happiest in?\" is also a Listing question not a TWC question. Any of these results in the pc giving items. They are not then nulled or correctly indicated. The pc can get very upset just as he would with a wrong list. Yet the session is not a \"listing session\" so never gets corrected. Example: \"How are you doing lately?\" is an example of a correct TWC question. It gets off charge and gets no list items. \"Are you better these days than you used to be?\" \"How have you been since the last session?\" \"What happened\" is different than \"What illness\", \"What person\", \"What town\" which are listing questions."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 56 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR REPAIR When other things fail to locate the upset of a pc look into TWC processes in the folder and treat them as L&N processes where the pc has answered with items.

I've discovered the common denominator to ARC breaks. And that common denomi-nator of all ARC breaks – all ARC breaks – is bypassed charge. That's the common denomi-nator to all ARC breaks. And that includes, therefore, all misemotion exhibited by the pc at the auditor. Now, we should define an ARC break as the pc's transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and a dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor. And that is an ARC break. Now, you can get the mechanics of an ARC break just by dropping your E-Meter, or something of the sort, and just calling the pc's attention off of his bank onto the auditor. The ARC break might not take place, but you have approximated the mechanic of what happens. And the probability is that it will take place. See what I mean? So, we get down to this fundamental, which is not terribly important at first glimpse: but dragging the pc's attention onto the auditor, you see, and onto the session is a precipitating factor even though the pc doesn't dramatize.

See, the charge of the session now is not being as-ised, and therefore provides a background booster, and the pc \"row-rows\" at the auditor, see, or becomes annoyed or something of the sort, don't you see? Well, so not even that one falls outside this definition. It's bypassed charge. See, pc's attention is on his bank, the auditor does something weird, attracts the pc's attention off the bank. Then, you see, you've bypassed some charge. You've left some charge there, the pc's attention is not on the charge but the charge is restimulated. Do you get that as a simple me-chanic? So that in normal course of human events you're talking to this same pc out of session, you know, and you drop an anvil on his toe or something of this sort, and he'll argue with you about it, but he won't ARC break. You see? It is not, then, that a social faux pas has taken place that causes the pc to ARC break. So an auditor very often feels terribly reserved and preservative of the social amenities and all of this sort of thing, and walks around on tiptoe in a session being terribly polite and so forth. Well, you see, that isn't necessary to prevent an ARC break. You see? But this mystery is presented: In common course of human events, you make some crack at this person, and they, make a crack at you and you yap-yap, and that's all there is to it, you see? And in a session, you make the tiniest inference about this person and all of a sudden he's splattering all over the walls with an ARC break. Well now, if you understand what you have done, you understand this matter of by-passed charge and so forth, this most flagrant example – the easiest to observe, don't you see; the easiest to observe and actually not of any really very vast importance but I've just given as an example to show you what this is: In the session he's got his attention on charged areas. And then you take his attention off the charged area and put it on the auditor, you bypass charge and that's what causes the ARC break, see? He's about to tell you \"... and then they drowned me in a well.\" He's saying, \"And I – I – I'm standing here, and I'm looking down into the thing, and there's somebody grabs me by the arm, I can feel his arm, and he's about to throw me over...\" And you say [operates a switch on the meter very noisily], \"Just – just a minute. Let me see if I can get some charge on this. Let's see,\" [repeats the noise] \"I – I beg your pardon, my meter – I don't know, I guess I forgot to charge the thing,\" or something like that. And the pc goes splatter! Oh, that's very obvious, you see, what's happened there. See, he's got all this charge he's sitting down on, and all of a sudden his attention comes off of it, and you in effect have bypassed the charge right there. Well, now, the other part of it is he is being cause over the charge, right? As long as he's running it he's being cause over it, see? All right. Now, the moment that his attention is"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 3 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 59 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR flicked off of it he is now the effect of that charge. And any tone level or Know to Mystery Scale level higher than the chronic tone of the pc... Now, get this; you know what chronic tone is, the old Know to Mystery Scale? Boy, we're back amongst the familiar tools here these days, you know? The Know to Mystery Scale, the Expanded Tone Scale, you see – all of those things – quite valid, see? And let's say the pc is at apathy as a chronic tone – that's pretty high, by the way. Very few pcs are there; they're more or less kind of wood, you know? They're way down below that. The other day I suddenly realized that I was feeling continuously apathetic, and I thought something is happening, my auditing is doing me in or something of the sort. I went around like that for about twenty-four hours and then suddenly realized it was I, a free thetan, who was feeling apathetic. All of a sudden, you know, any consequences of it blew, you see? And I realized suddenly I was feeling much better than I had for a long time. See, I hadn't felt like myself, a free thetan, for some time. You know? You get the idea? I mean, gradually the Tone Scale had come up, you see, not as Ron or human being, you see, but had gradually come up, up, up. See, I'd feel pretty good as Ron, you see? Fine, feel very high-toned. But I'd come up, up, up, and I didn't get the sneaker of it. And the first emotional response you get to it is feeling apathetic. You know, \"Well, guess I'm not worth much. Look what they're doing over in the States these days, you know? People talking about rerunning Kennedy. You know?\" I was kind of thinking about things that way, you know? And all of a sudden: \"Hey, that's me!\" you know? [laughter] \"Me! That's me I'm feeling about! \" And it felt wonderful. Was a great feeling after that. I went around and enjoyed it, you know? [laughter] Well, actually, a pc will come up through degradation as a chronic tone, and actually will come up from unconsciousness as a chronic tone. We had a pc over in the States. I mean, it isn't anything esoteric, you know; he just lies there conked out all the time. You try to audit him and he – conk – you know? And audit him and – conk. And talk to him – conk – you know? And he's actually existing above his chronic tone. His chronic tone is unconsciousness. And so this boy, of course, processed – you process him now to get rid of his unconsciousness – well, cut your throat; you'll never get anyplace, you see? You just have to generally process his case with processes which are real to him and bring up a general case advance, and the unconsciousness will disappear. You see that as a different look? That doesn't mean that there are chronic tone levels of maladies, you know? You don't have maladies as chronic tone levels, but anything above – anything above – the pc's chronic tone, you see, being higher than the pc, can be cause over the pc and therefore become a dramatization. There is nobody more amazed than the pc to find himself in raging anger in a session. He's absolutely flabbergasted! Well, some charge gets bypassed, and he doesn't know where to look, he doesn't know what charge is bypassed, he doesn't know where he looks – he does-n't know where to look. He looks at the auditor – the auditor doesn't even have to fiddle with the E-Meter, see? He looks at the auditor and there is something, you see, and anger or some-thing like that, being higher on the Tone Scale and contained in the incident which has been missed, causes the pc to dramatize. And the pc is actually as helpless as a dish towel in a hur-ricane. He's totally helpless. He says, \"Ohh – aww, what's going on?\" And he's shouting and screaming at the auditor, you know?"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 4 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 60 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Well, you can get somebody who is dramatizing effort. You know, he's got to pick up the chair and break it in half, you know, something like that? Well, that's a pretty low-level dramatization, that particular one. Anger is more common. Bored is something you very often don't recognize as a dramatization. PC is getting along fine, and all of a sudden ARC breaks and feels very bored. Now, similarly, you could go further and find a pc ARC break into a total manic. I have never seen this, but by extrapolation, you could say he would become very manic, you see – terribly, wildly enthusiastic, with glaring eyeballs, you see? Be an ARC break. So an ARC break, then, comes about whenever charge is bypassed, which then puts the pc at its effect-point. And the pc then dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed. This is actually far simpler than it sounds. I'm just giving you all of the ramifications of it – giving you all of the ramifications of it. These are the mechanics involved in the thing. Now, the remedy for an ARC break is to locate and indicate the bypassed charge, at which moment the ARC break ceases. Now, that could be interpreted by a Q-and-A artist as meaning you have to go and run the bypassed charge right now. You see, he goes into a do. No, that gets into impossibility. You find yourself fifth on the chain. You are running the fifth engram and the pc is ARC breaking on the chain, and... well, then you would interpret it and say, \"Well, you can't possibly run the fifth engram because the pc will ARC break,\" you see? Some Q-and-A artist would interpret it at once, you see, in that category. And you will find them doing so no matter if I've said so. And if you'll just remember I've told you this and re-member this particular mechanic, you can prevent this other consequence from taking place. And the consequence is this: Well, the pc is ARC breaking, running this engram, so therefore you have to at once go run the earlier engram. And that is not what I have told you. If that were the case, then to prevent everybody from ARC breaking would require continuous auditing. See, that is not the remedy. The remedy is to find and indicate the bypassed charge. And the ARC break ceases, [snaps fingers] right like that. Find and indicate the bypassed charge. It's actually as simple as that. Nothing to it. Now, you are, all of you, cognizant of the trick of turning off somebody's anger at you by saying \"somebody's missed your withholds.\" Sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes it doesn't work. The person just gets more insulted. Well, that's because a missed withhold isn't the source of the bypassed charge. You just indicated the wrong bypassed charge. But this fellow does have missed withholds, somebody has missed a withhold on him in session, he doesn't even know this, and he's ranting and raving at you, or something of the sort, and you say, \"Boy, somebody missed a withhold on you, man.\" He cools right down. It isn't, as you might think, that it introverts him so that he immediately begins to look around inside of his skull, \"I wonder what the missed withhold is,\" and so pulls him off of your neck. That isn't what's happened there. You take a good, close look at it. Get some ex-perience on this and get some reality on it yourself, and this material will really be in your grasp. Now, sometimes you've said to somebody, \"Well, somebody missed a withhold on you, man,\" and the person has said, \"Goddamn, don't you pull that on me!\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 5 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 61 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Well, it wasn't a withhold that was missed, see? Somebody missed a goal. Get the idea? And if you were to pursue it right then and say, \"Well, let's see, was it – it was probably a goal that was missed. Probably somebody missed a goal on you – missed a whole GPM. Somebody missed a whole RI. Somebody's missed some RIs on you.\" And he's just about to let out of his mouth a horrendous scream and follow this thing through, and he all of a sudden says, \"I wonder if it could have been a missed RI? Probably was.\" See? So the trick of turning off an ARC break is to find and indicate the bypassed charge. But it must be the charge that was bypassed. See, that's where the accuracy comes in. And that makes you an artist. Now, it's still within the realm of scientific approach – still within the realm of scien-tific approach because there are only a few charges that can be missed. See? There's engrams and GPMs and goals and RIs, an engram more basic on the chain or an incident more basic on the chain, or a failure to acknowledge, or a refutation of reality, or a rejection of affinity. This character is feeling you're a pretty good auditor and you say, \"Ah, nuts!\" see? All right, he's got a charge there of affinity, see, and that isn't acknowledged and you bypass it. You rejected it. So you get this thing firing back in your face. Don't you see what that is? Now, these are not mechanisms which are totally relegated to session, but they rele-gate themselves to life. Now, you're a Registrar and somebody is coming in, or you're signing up pcs. (All of you have to wear a Registrar's hat at one time or another.) And you're trying to get somebody to get some auditing, you're a Registrar, see? And there you are one fine day with a yow-yow-yow and a scream-scream-scream standing in front of your face: Seventy-five hours of auditing have been delivered – he feels terrible! He says, \"Oh, I could kill everybody in the place,\" and he ought to go out and sue everybody, and he's going to inform the govern-ment that so on and so on and so on and so on – yap, yap, yap, you never hear such a thing. Don't worry too much about the threats, because the person totally lacks direction. Person will go halfway down the steps and change his mind and do something else, don't you see? They're incapable of carrying forward a program that has any cohesion or direction, see? Now, you actually are very foolish to engage this individual in any reasonable conver-sation, because it's not a reasonable situation. That attitude is wholly the product of bypassed charge. And as Registrar, you simply should hunt and punch around till you find the bypassed charge. That's all, just hunt and punch around till you find the pc's bypassed charge. All of a sudden the thing expires. It just goes, because you've found and indicated it. Be perfectly all right to just grab a meter, and – trying somehow or another, to get him to hold the cans – and just give him the standard sort of an assessment: \"Did somebody run an engram too late on the chain?\" you see? \"There's a more basic engram run? Oh, clang. That fired. Ah, yes. Well, somebody was running an engram on you and there's an earlier engram.\" \"Oh, is there? Yes, you know, yeah.\" Where's all this rage? Well, you see, the rage is an automaticity. And I have told you often, often, often, often, often, the tenuous character, the extremely delicate, balanced char-acter of neurosis and psychosis – and such other nasty words – makes it almost impossible not to undo it. Because it is incapable of continuation. It is set up in such a delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip, if it's effective. You understand that?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 6 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 62 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR You see, some guy is down in a padded cell someplace, and he's a \"raving gamaniac\" and he is screaming away and throwing stools at the warders and so forth. And although I don't blame him for throwing stools at these blokes, this is the point: His condition is not a condition of terrible, difficult, hard, mean, impossible-to-reach, go-on-forever dramatization, see? That is not true. Actually, the difficulty of maintaining such a state is almost impossibly difficult. You can make it go bzzzt! And all of a sudden it no longer hangs in balance and can't go on dramatizing. You've heard me talk to you before about the slip: old ARC Straightwire, the way you can knock apart a neurosis – the difficulty of maintaining a neurosis. Old ARC Straightwire has broken up more neuroses than you can count. See, it – too difficult for the pc to go on being neurotic on this particular point. And this, of course, is at wild variance to the commonly held belief. The commonly held belief is a person is psychotic – well, that's it, they've had it, you see, and they're psy-chotic, and that's all you can do about it. You can't do anything about it, you see, because it's a very tough, vigorous, dangerous, enduring condition. See, that's the commonly held belief. They believe that a neurosis is a fantastically arduous thing. Read a funny story: Somebody – people send me clippings all the time. I get lots of clippings (appreciate them). And one of the clippings I got the other day was a yap-yap about a psychiatrist; it was very funny. It seems like he'd been treating this fellow – he's telling his story, you see? And he'd been treating this fellow for four years at an hour a day. And when the fellow – he'd had a tremendous success, the psychiatrist was saying, because when the fellow first came to him, why, he just felt terrible all the time, because he just had this urge to kill somebody. And so he gave him an hour's treatment every day for four years, and at the end of that time, why, the fellow walked into the office, and the psychiatrist knew he'd had a wonderful success because the fellow said he just felt wonderful, he just felt wonderful, he'd never felt better, and so forth, and that neurosis that he had been working with, that always used to make him feel terrible, now made him feel wonderful. And as the fellow pulled the iron bar out of his pocket, the psychiatrist said... And that was the end of the story. [laughter] In other words, there are two things, you see, that argue in favor of a lie in this direc-tion: One, the absence of technology and the absence of understanding of these states com-bines with the professional need of tough cases. You see, if psychosis wasn't unsolvable, you wouldn't find the – and very tough and very enduring and very terrible – you wouldn't find the US (ha!) government shelling out sixteen billion quid (or bucks or whatever they're using these days) to build themselves up endless numbers of sanitariums, and ten research centers. They're going to build ten research centers and so forth. And they might even get up to prena-tals in these things, you know, because they'll probably use our work. And man, look at the kitty! Sixteen billion, see? And that's just the initial appropriation. That's going to cost five billion a year afterwards. The armed-forces construction program of the United States is only 1.6 or 1.8 billion. Give you some weird perspective? That is fantastic. Look at the vested interest in psychosis being incurable. These nuts that are in charge of the nuts will never do anything, of course. It's worth too much to them not to. Somebody"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 7 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 63 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR comes along and said, \"All you have to do is find and indicate the bypassed charge and the Person go fftt! and he's sane.\" \"Oh,\" they'd say, \"take that nut out and kill him, ha-ha-ha-ha! He's about to cost us sixteen billion hard-earned legislative bucks! Ha! Shoot him.\" It's not for nothing the FDA is mad at us. You see, they don't for a moment believe any of their charges. See, they have made a comprehensive, thorough investigation all up and down the land, and they haven't found one single human being who ever was told that an E-Meter would cure anything. But they've invented the statements. Why? Well, we constitute a fantastic threat to a fantastic vested interest. These are not men of goodwill. They're caved-in dramatizers themselves. Never make that error. You can very easily make that error. These guys are dramatizing. I don't know – much care what they're dramatizing, but they themselves are doing a heavy, hard dramatiza-tion, by which they say, \"We can do what we do without conscience, because man is after all an animal and is nothing.\" See, so they spread the plea that man is an animal and is nothing as an effort to get over committing overts. So this hangs them with being an animal and being nothing. I imagine that if you took thirty psychiatrists – I know it's unpopular to talk about these people, but if you took thirty psychiatrists at random, at least one of those thirty would be sitting there barking. If you just called on thirty in a row. You think I'm kidding – try it sometime. I'm not kidding. These people need help probably worse than their own patients. How would you like to be up against something that you advertisedly considered incurable, totally damaging, nothing could be done about it, and you're collecting money right and left to do something about it? Krrrrr! That's a pretty nasty position for anybody to work himself into. Now, we probably cut those blokes off by my continuous saying this and that, we probably deny them help one way or the other. But every time I have ever tried to work with any group of psychiatrists or anything of the sort, the only thing they'll send me is one of their number who has already gone potty. This bird's around the bend or something like that. And I've never been able to teach them anything. And they actually have worn out their welcome with me, that's all. But I would still help them today. That's beside the point. The point I'm making on the thing is that you can work your-self into a position where you consider an ARC break unremediable, terribly powerful and overwhelmingly destructive, so that you will label certain pcs as ARC-breaky pcs. You can fear this ARC break, you see? You can become afraid of these ARC breaks occurring. And that can make you unwilling to audit, or if you don't even go that far, will rough you up enough to do a stinking auditing job, which of course causes more ARC breaks. You got that? So unless you corral the ARC break, unless you yourself get a good reality on han-dling the ARC break, unless you understand this one and you develop the skill necessary to find and indicate the bypassed charge – that's the only skill you've got to develop – you'll get into a position where you'll audit for a while and then feel like it isn't worth the candle and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 8 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 64 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR man is no good, and go the route, man! Another half a century you'll be telling Congress, \"Well, we need sixteen billion dollars because – to handle the nuts.\" You see, what you've got to break through with you is, one, a condemnation of ARC breaks. They don't mean anything; they're not diagnostic in any way, shape or form. They're not diagnostic, that's all. They don't tell you the ease with which a pc runs or the unease with which he runs. They tell you nothing. See, the pc who runs like a well-oiled player piano may ARC break all over the ceiling. And some pc that you couldn't get a gain on with a building jack never ARC breaks at all. So, you see, it's no indication at all. There's no index there. The pc who is very easy to audit very often is the pc that is very hardest to get a gain on. And the pc who is very difficult to audit very often gets the highest gains. So, you see, these are not coordinated factors. So this is something that should tell you that temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor or just get out of the auditing chair. It'll catch up with you sooner or later, man. I catch myself every once in a while in some kind of a session. You know, pc says, \"Row-row, row-row-row-row, row-row-row-row-row.\" See? \"You just ask me for one more of those suppresses on this RI and I'm going to blow! Because there aren't any suppresses left on the RI!\" You get that kind of an approach? I say to myself, \"This pc's trying to convince me that I mustn't take the charge off the RIs. This pc is in a big sell.\" See? Well, actually that would be the inevitable effect of it. I eventually would say, \"Well, all right.\" And, \"All right, that rocket read,\" you know. \"It rocket read,\" and so on. Get the next one, the next one, the next one, and so on. All right. Yeah, you've finished the bank.* To hell with you,\" you know? See? You're doing the very thing you must have done in the first place that caused the ARC break. And you got to get some wins on this, auditor – you got to get some wins on this. This one you got to get wins on. I want you to get a confidence that when a pc goes row-row-row, that you can find the bypassed charge, either just by knowing what it must be because it couldn't be anything else because you weren't doing anything else, don't you see? And checking on a meter, or going into a full dress parade of assessment to get the bypassed charge – however you get that by-passed charge – find it and then by indicating it to this pc, realize the tool that is in your power. By the fact that the mere indication of it turns off the ARC break, right like that. You didn't do a thing about it except indicate it. How do you indicate it? You say to the pc whatever you say to the pc that indicates it, that's all. I mean it's as elementary as that. There isn't any hidden magic here. It's not like that if you... \"I can teach you now how to make gold.

Impos-sible – completely impossible assignment. Now, this is not an impossible one. This lies well within your reality, your action, your ability and so forth. There isn't anything else spotted here, see, that is esoteric or outside. I didn't mean to degrade your reality or anything like that; I'm saying, just, it's something that you can have a reality on right now. The only times you'll miss on this, you very often will pick it up a session or two later. You had an ARC break, bow! and you couldn't find anything to – and then nothing happened, and you couldn't cure the thing, and blooww! and you could-n't do anything about it. And two sessions later you find out – my God, you had passed a whole GPM. You all of a sudden remember, \"Hey! Two sessions ago when I jumped that bank, you know, I got that next goal, and – ha-ha! And we just found out that in between there is the goal 'to spit.' Hey, what do you know. Ho-ho!\" And you say to the pc, \"Hey, what do you know about that.\" And the pc gets very calm all of a sudden. You very often find out a couple of... some time afterwards what the bypassed charge was, and that will make you very enthusiastic on what I'm saying just now. You'll get more enthusiastic than that, because you find out it's an invariable fact. It doesn't vary. Why didn't you find the bypassed charge at the time the charge was bypassed? Now, the rest of it is, you actually shouldn't let an ARC break endure more than two or three minutes, because ARC breaks multiply by the square. They're not a lineal development. You let an ARC break run one minute and it doubles. You let it run two minutes and it quad-ruples. You let it run three minutes – you get the idea? There it goes. This thing is developing on a very steep curve. And you actually owe it to the pc – not because you're afraid of it, but because you'll have more trouble and waste more session time – you owe it to the pc to get in and turn it off fast. Now, you see, a whole government can be intimidated by a riot. The United States government is actually being conducted today by riot. The only people who get any attention or get anything passed are those people who riot. See? The Japanese government went by the boards because there was a riot. Somebody went down and slipped a few yen to a few stu-dents and they went up and went yow-yow-yow, and Eisenhower was unable to visit the coun-try, and so forth (because, after all, students are pretty dangerous, you know?). And can't have all that shouting, you know, and so forth, and the government fell. This government – my hat's off to this government. They \"Ban the bomb,\" you know, and the police go out and pick them up and put them away. And they \"Ban the bomb,\" and the police go out and pick them up and put them away. And I don't think there's been a ripple in Parliament. I don't think Parliament has even heard about it. It's very, very remarkable. They've gotten used to that over here, see? So they're not being run by riot. Get this as a method of government: running a government by riot. There are many methods of government which I have studied from time to time and been called to my attention, and so on, which aren't in the civics textbooks. You know? You elect the mayor, and the mayor does this and the aldermen do that and all that sort of thing. These aren't in the civics textbook, but they are basic methods of government.

Some bird dramatizing the Helatrobus Implants. I think they're called the Sharif Mo-hammedans or something like that, they were at the time, from which you get the word assas-sin. Old Hashshashin, the Old Man of the Mountain, used to kidnap young fellows and tell them that when they got killed they could come back to paradise. He'd give them a few days in paradise, you know, and he'd get a lot of good-looking dolls and rivers of milk and honey and all that sort of thing, and the guy up there – that's where you get the word hashish too. They'd get this young fellow in some cafe and feed him some hashish, take him up there, and these babes would chuck him under the chin for a few days, and then the old man with the false halo would come around and say, \"Now, son, the way you get back here and live forever in perfect enjoyment is to do exactly what we say.\" \"And what is that?\" \"Well, go get yourself killed, of course.\" \"Well, how am I – get myself killed?\" \"Well, you have to assassinate the sultan of Persia.\" Well, the young fellows look at these girls and all the curves, and he'd say, \"Tsk, tsk! Why not?\" See? And the next drink of wine they slipped to him, why, it'd have some more hashish in it, and he'd wake up in the capital of the shah. Next time the shah walked through the streets or rode through the streets or something like that, there he was and off went the shah's head, see? Of course, the guards would kill the fellow, but that was exactly in the plans. And a lot of young fellows got surprised by not being able to find the top of this moun-tain again, and there they were. But that was government by assassination. And all the Old Man of the Mountain ever had to do was just indicate to the Chinese head of state that he'd like a couple of camel loads of gold, please, and they would be on the way at once. Everybody was terrified of this person. Government by assassination. Any policy could be laid down, anything else, because of this fear of assassination. This lasted a couple of hundred years, by the way, and it's oddly enough, a direct dramatization of the Helatrobus Implants. The Helatrobus Implants didn't have that as a purpose. They just had a purpose as do-ing you in – it was far more elementary. But – that's why they're so easy to deal with. They're so monomanic on the subject. You were supposed to be human, have a body, not fly around anymore, not trouble anybody. And then you were supposed to have such diverse purposes that you could never unite on a single cause. Easy to govern. Yes, I must say so. But, of course, the Helatrobus government never got around to establishing the government they had then set up. Rest their bones, rest their bones. They must have had the whole galaxy laid out for a total conquest. And they were too covert to ever take over. Covertion became the order of the day, you see? They could never"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 11 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 67 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR assert dominion of what they'd set up. Interesting. Interesting point. I see that that saddened you. Don't worry about it, don't worry about it. We can straighten that up. Anyhow, getting back on this other: You realize that if you governed all of your ac-tions by reason of ARC breaks, you'll get a government of Scientology by ARC break. And you as an auditor, in your auditing actions, will be governed by ARC breaks. Do you see that? Do you see that? That's why I was taking this political excursion, just to show you there that it is possible to have your actions governed by that. You are never governed by that which you can handle with ease. So therefore the greater the facility you develop in handling ARC breaks, the less you are governed by ARC breaks, until you're not governed at all by ARC breaks. It just becomes another phenomenon. Pc's nose is running or he starts... tears leaking out of his eyes, hand him a Kleenex. Has an ARC break, why, locate and indicate the bypassed charge. Bang-bang, you see? And keep on with what you're doing. You got it? Now at first in developing these activities, you will make mistakes as to what the by-passed charge is on, and your faith will quiver and grow faint. And you'll say, \"The ARC break must be caused by something else, because look, I found and indicated the charge and the pc still has an ARC break. Therefore there must be something about this that Ron did not tell us.\" No, there was something about it that you didn't hear. You have to find and indicate the right bypassed charge. There are only a few of them, but you have to find the right one. And the ARC break vanishes at once. Therefore, there is no reason under the sun to have ARC breaky sessions. No reason to keep a pc ARC breaking. Now, those pcs who have continuously ARC broken sessions can be run on a process which is the three-way ARC Break Process. I'm not talking now about they have an ARC break, you run this process. You get that one wrong way to and I'll get cross, because we used to have processes to handle the ARC break. But they won't handle the immediate ARC break, you understand? We're not interested in a process that handles the immediate ARC break. We got that technology and it's much faster than a process. But somebody whose bank is mixed up because of ARC breaks has this other ARC Break Process. And an auditor who has gotten himself stuck around and messed up because he has just run too many ARC breaky pcs, with this run on him, finds it all stripped away. \"In session...,\" \"in auditing...,\" you know, \"what attitude has been refused?\" You know, the \"In auditing, what reality has been rejected?\" \"In auditing, what communication has not been ac-knowledged?\" It's that trio. And they'll straighten up, using \"In auditing\" as a prefix, more auditing than any quantity of mid-rud buttons. I've gotten a repetitive process which upscales this. We needed a repetitive process at this time for many reasons. But there is a doll, because this one even runs an implant. You see, we have good history on this process, because this is old ARC Straightwire. 1958, the only thing that'd go into implants and open them wide open was ARC Break Straightwire. Remember that process, 1958? All right, this is the immediate successor. And here's one of the most worked-over areas of repetitive processes known. It's based, of course, on the whole technology of the ARC triangle. Now I'm giving you the rest of the technology."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 12 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 68 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Why does it work, you see? Because it does nothing but spot bypassed charge. That's how I redeveloped it and redeveloped it, you see? And I got it redeveloped along this line. And there's trick ways of clearing the auditing command and so forth I'll put into your hands so that you can do an assessment on certain words, so the pc has a complete understanding of what you're doing. And this is a doll. It isn't any too little, two-bit process. In fact you will be doing it on Fridays. Well, what I'm getting around to here is your attitude on the subject of ARC breaks must never be one whereby you're driven by the ARC break. Because you'll be driven, man, into not getting the items clean. You'll be driven into taking the pc's orders, because a pc ARC breaks just for so much time and then starts to issue orders because his duress is so great, and those orders are the direct result of dramatizations. So, the orders are the significance. See, he's dramatizing the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of. See, not only is he capable of dramatizing the emotion of the bypassed charge, but he's also capable of dramatizing the significance contained in the bypassed charge. And therefore it's a very dan-gerous thing to take the orders – it's very dangerous to the pc to take the orders of a very ARC broke pc. Very dangerous – to the pc, not to you. So what's this add up to? This adds up to two things: that you should learn to handle bypassed charge, and be good enough as an auditor not to ever bypass charge! Period! How do you do that? Well, just get hot, man. How can you bypass charge? You can bypass charge by not finding any. You get a pc who is on suppress, suppress, suppress and is all upset and going sideways, and you try to find the next goal. You're pressing on with the session in the teeth of some kind of a weird, apathetic ARC break or a low morale, see? So you do this list, only he never puts the goal on the list. He puts some other goal three goals down the bank on this list. You take that goal, you see, because you can't do anything else and so forth, and you just really can't do a good job on it. So you take this goal and you bypass a couple of GPMs. Now, brother, you're going to have a picnic. See, you were driven into auditing somewhat carelessly or apathetically or defensively or something of the sort, so you did a bad job of auditing and then you laid in more charge – bypassed, see? You lay... you didn't lay in more charge, you bypassed more charge. See? The harder you are driven into doing a bad job, then the more charge you bypass. So then you try to find the top oppterm of this new one you found; it doesn't fire. Got two GPMs ahead of it. Or you try to find its terminal, and that takes you two sessions. What do you think the magnitude of built-up charge is by this time on the bypassed charge? The bypassed charge is always prior to the charge you were working, you see – al-ways prior. What do you think this does? Well, it just confirms the bypassed charge. The reason you can't get anyplace with what you are doing is because you have by-passed charge. And therefore look on the ARC break as a blessing in disguise. It tells you, even more accurately than the meter, that you have bypassed some charge. Well, it tells you you haven't got basic on the chain of the engrams, regardless of the meter. \"Is there a more basic incident on this chain?\" The meter doesn't do a thing; it just sits there and does nothing."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 13 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 69 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR If the pc ARC breaks, well, brother, there is a more basic incident on that chain. In other words, he can look deeper than the meter, see? You've said, \"All right, now let's pick up the first incident. Good. What are you look-ing at?\" \"Oh, I'm looking at the clouds going by here.\" \"All right. Good. Now, see anything else around you?\" \"Yeah, I see this black cord that seems to be coming down from the sky.\" \"All right. Now go to the moment just before that black cord reaches the ground or reaches toward you.\" Pc ARC breaks. Well, you say, \"Well, I'm – I was just sitting here trying to run the ba-sic engram on the chain, and it said on the meter that it was the basic engram, and – and – hu-uh-mm-mm.\" Don't feel so damn pathetic. You asked him to go to the beginning, so that restimu-lated it. And then he didn't get there, and he saw a picture that was the fifteenth incident. And you started to run the fifteenth incident; there were fourteen before it. So the pc ARC broke. Now, you say, \"Well, I've got to run this incident, because I can't get any trace of the earlier incidents unless I run through this one once. So therefore I don't dare run through this one once because the pc will ARC break.\" Not unless you haven't heard a word I said in this lecture. See, you won't be able to if you haven't heard a word I've said. You will always have to run the basic and, of course, it's not available. It's seldom available till you've peeled off a couple off the top of it. Look at the trouble you're having trying to get the first goal on the first series. Look at the trouble you're having. Why are you having trouble? That's because you've got to audit a few later ones to get the charge off enough to find the first one. Well, all right, isn't that automatically bypassed charge? No. It's bypassed charge, but you've already cured the ARC break. How? You told the pc, \"I can't find the first goal right now and it's undoubtedly there; we're going to run the one we've got our hands on.\" So you've already found and indicated the charge. So the pc won't ARC break, of course, because he knows there's charge up ahead. All right. All you have to do is find and indicate the basic... the fact that there is a ba-sic on the chain. Well, the pc ARC breaks... start to run this chain. You just try it on for size. You say, \"Well, you know, the engram that we've just started into here, that's evi-dently late on the chain, isn't it?\" And you look at your E-Meter and it'll fire right about that time, because you said, \"Now, we're going to run the one we get through so we can get back earlier.\" \"Oh, well – oh, yes? All right, fine.\" And the pc'll go right through it. He'll run – he'll run the eighty-ninth on the chain, as long as he knows not even that it's the eighty-ninth but that there's an earlier one on the chain. It's that elementary. It's that ele-mentary."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 14 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 70 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, why does a pc ARC break when you're putting in rudiments? Well, the rudiment is out in the incident that you are running, and of course that's prior to the session. You try to put the rudiment in in the session; it is out in the incident, so of course you've bypassed the charge, so therefore the pc ARC breaks and said, \"All you're doing is sitting there running mid ruds and mid ruds and mid ruds, and you're mid-ruding me to death.\" See, that's just an-other case of bypassed charge. Pc ARC breaks in mid ruds, you say... you don't have to find it. In fact, you better hadn't. There's probably a suppress in the incident. See, you're running Suppress and the pc ARC breaks. You say, \"Well, in the incident we'll probably run there's probably a suppress.\" And the pc – \"Oh, yes!\" That's the end of the ARC break. You understand? You get how many ways this cookie crumbles? See? It's the number of ways this pie can be cut. It's always bypassed charge. And what's that make you for chickening off on cleaning an RI? What's that do, when because the pc is so ARC breaky and restive that you don't get all the charge off of... out of an RI? What does that set up? What does that set up for the next two or three RIs? Learn to think in those terms. It sets up an ARC break, of course. Because you didn't get the charge off the RI, the next RI now has bypassed charge behind it. Least that'll happen is your pc's morale goes down, and you can't get the charge off the next one. And you get a cumulative error. See? But, of course, you are so protective of your skill as an auditor you never say to the pc, \"Hey, I don't think I've gotten any of the charge off the earlier incidents in this bank.\" And the pc says, \"Oh, no? Haven't you? Well, careless of you.\" And that's the end of that ARC break. Look at the cumulative error. Item one: you got it to fire; it fired over a sixteenth of an inch, sensitivity 128 on the meter. \"Well, that's the end of that one. All right, what opposes it? 'Nix scrambled eggishness.'\" You know? \"All right, that fired a sixteenth of an inch.\" So you say, \"Good. All right, let's take the next one, number two. 'Absolutably scrambled eggish-ness.'\" You know? \"Well, that ticked. Well, that's good enough. There probably wasn't any charge on it. Probably the speaker was out that day. So let's get the next one. 'Nix scrambled eggishness.' Hm – hm. That fell slightly.\" (Tone arm went up so you got \"tone arm action\" on it!) [laughter] \"Oh,\" you say, \"well, I better get industrious. 'Perfectably scrambled eggish-ness.' I better get industrious and I'll really clean this one. This item been suppressed? Any-thing in the session been suppressed? Protested? Upset? Anything – anything been Upset? Anything Protested? Upset? Invalidated? 'Perfectable scrambled eggishness' – anything been perfectabled?\" And you're sitting there looking at the wildest ARC break you ever heard of. \"Where did it come from? Just because I'm trying to put in a couple of rudiments on 'perfectable scrambled eggishness,' this pc is ARC broke because he doesn't want me to...\" Looks mysteri-ous, doesn't it? Well, it comes from \"nix absolutable,\" \"absolutable nix,\" and the top oppterm. Want to set up an ARC break? You can set it up perfectly mechanically. Just start go-ing down the list, just drop one – just drop an RI. See? Notice the pc is a little abstracted and say, \"Give me number thirty-one.\" Ticks. You say, \"All right, that's fine. Give me number thirty-two.\" This pc will get a weird look in his eye. And certainly by thirty-three, thirty-four"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 15 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 71 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR or thirty-five, you will have a God-awful ARC break on your hands. And then you say, \"I didn't take the charge off number thirty-one. Didn't take the charge of it off.\" \"Oh? Oh.\" I wouldn't say you'd do this to any pc, but you actually could. And it's just as predict-able as that. One, two, three: You bypass the charge, keep it a secret, ARC break. Now, you start struggling around with a pc and ramming around one kind or another and harassing the pc and chewing the pc up, after you've bypassed two and three-quarters banks full of no blown charge, and what do you think you're going to be able to do with this pc? Exactly nothing. You're going to get nothing to discharge, you're not going to be able to run a session and so forth. What's your remedy? Your remedy ordinarily is find an earlier goal and run it well. What if the pc is so bogged down by this time that you can't get up to an earlier goal? Well, run this ARC Break Recall Process for half a session, your pc will be able to find some earlier goals. Yeah, well, that's a crude remedy. Any trouble you have with Routine 3 today is caused by bypassed charge. Any ARC break that you're having is caused by bypassed charge which has neither been found nor indi-cated. It's all under the heading of bypassed charge. Get a reality on it. How many ways can you bypass charge? Then you'll be able, not only to run a smooth session, but you'll have eve-rything blowing, left and right, all the way on down. There are numbers of ways to run charge off of RIs – numbers of ways to do it. But don't take the charge off of a GPM, your next GPM isn't going to fire. Don't take the charge off of four or five consecutive RIs, the sixth isn't going to fire. That's all. Now, don't yammer at the pc on the seventh, trying to get it to discharge. Well, that's nonsense. How can it discharge? Pc is all of a sudden... his morale's down, he's ARC broken and so forth. The perfect way to keep these implants from running is to bypass charge. Then you're not going to get anything to run. Well, I've even given you a weapon that puts the pc back together again so you can bypass the charge you've left on the bank. And that's your ARC Break Process, and that's marvelous anyway. The only thing known that'll cut into an implant like a band saw. Good Straightwire process – sit there and run it for a while, pc's that upset. But find out the charge reason first. Cure these ARC breaks before running a process. Now, there's the trouble you is havin' – if you have any trouble with pcs, and if you have any trouble running banks; it all comes under that one heading of bypassed charge. You're going to have ARC breaks and no rocket reads. Everybody was sitting marveling at the big rocket reads I was getting on that TV demonstration. Well, it might strike you as very interesting that it was one of the most difficult sessions I have given for a very long time and those were the smallest rocket reads I have had for a long time. It was very difficult. The pc was very restimulated by the amount of electronic hum on the television cameras, because she was going through an electronic implant that hummed. Therefore wasn't firing very well. And I fought that on down the line and there was a bypassed charge of a cognition which almost caused an ARC break, and finally gave you the cognition, only it had been bypassed. And"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKS 16 SHSBC-297 – 28.5.63 LEVEL 3 72 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR then you saw some rocket reads that were really rocket reads. You saw a lot of rocket reads; those things were clean. There's way... many ways to blow RIs. This is not a lecture on how to blow RIs. But let me tell you that if you start bypassing charge early on, you're going to find no charge later. And let me tell you something else: Don't buy an RI that doesn't rocket read a full dial. Got it? Just don't buy them. Let's see that thing fire, man! Let's see it really fire. There isn't a pc made that won't give you a dial rocket read per item. Now, how much charge do you think you've left on the bank? How long do you think your pc will remain ARC unbroken? All right. Now, I told you you wouldn't like this lecture, but there it is. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 73 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE A lecture given on 24 July 1963 Thank you. Well, you're going to get some demonstrations before we're much older. And I'm grooving in Model Session a little bit better. Couple little bugs these days in Model Session. \"Do you agree that's clean?\" can cause an ARC break. What you want to communicate to the pc is that did the pc have anything to say about it? You, after all, have asked a question, and you inform him of the state of the needle and ask him if he's got anything he wants to say about it. But I haven't quite got the pat wording for that. But it's interesting that the two, three little changes that – they're just little refinements make it easier on the auditor. We're using mostly the 3N Model Session and in actual fact have not used the old, original, long-drawn-out beginning ruds-end ruds Model Session for some time. And it's a good training ground, maybe, but in actual fact, the since mid ruds are enormously better. Since mid ruds and pull missed withholds are enormously better than any beginning rudi-ments we ever had. And an ARC break assessment at the end of session, just whether there's been an ARC break or not, is enormously superior to any end rudiments we ever had. Don't you see? So you just clean every line of it. You don't do an assessment by elimination. Just, if you got a tick, find out what it is. And just clean that up, and your pc comes up shining. So it actually makes Model Session pretty easy to do, but it's still a very precise activ-ity. We've now got the body of the session, we end the body of the session, you know? Goals and gains, all that sort of thing. Everything is there – you know, we adjust the pc's chair and ask if it's all right to audit in the room and get a can squeeze and put in the R-factor and start the session, you know? Same thing. Get the goals and roll right on through. Get the pc's goals, and... pc's needle's a bit agitated, your tone arm is higher than it was the last session, we put in our since mid ruds and see if there's any missed withholds, and carry right on through to the – into the body of the session, and do whatever we've got to do. Come right on up to the end of the body of the session and chatter with him a little bit before we tell him that's the end of the body of the session – that's very informal but still there. Then we get the pc's... ARC break assessment – usually omitted, if the session's quite happy and the pc has had a big win in the session; we certainly don't harass him with an ARC break assessment. And then we take our goals, and we take up each goal. I notice some not quite doing that, maybe. And actually, those are written on the auditor's report, diagonally across the goal. See, we just write \"yes,\" you know, or \"maybe,\" see, across each goal. We don't write down"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 2 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 74 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR another section here that says whether or not he made his goals, see? \"To have a good ses-sion\": Well, we give him that goal, you know – did he make it? He says yes, we write \"yes\" diagonally across that top there, see? So we can see what his goals and gains were just by looking at that one block. And it's easy to review, see? When he's got all that, we don't keep pestering him; we just read it to him, did he make them or didn't he make them? Then we thank him for making his goals in this session, or if he only made part of them, why, \"Thank you for making some of your goals in this session; I'm sorry you didn't make all of them.\" Then we ask him for his gains, and we take down the gains. And we don't keep bleeding gains. We don't keep asking the question \"Did you make any gains for the session?\" We just take what he's got, see? We make sure that he's answered it to his satisfaction – and remember he's pretty foggy, so sometimes that's a little difficult to get closed out. You're still trying to end the session, he's still trying to give you gains, you know? Long time to answer the question or something like that. Well, let him answer it to his satisfaction, but don't you keep pounding with the question about gains for the session. You understand? You can over-ask him, see? And next thing you know, he's giving imaginary gains that he never heard of. When he's got those you say, \"Thank you for making these gains in this session,\" or, \"Thank you for making some gains in this session; I'm sorry you didn't make all of them.\" And – \"Sorry you didn't make more gains,\" rather – and close that out. And then we just get a can squeeze test, run any Havingness that we have to run if the can squeeze test was less than the beginning of the session, and simply ask him, \"Is there any-thing you want to say before we end the session?\" Let him say it. Then we say, \"Is it all right with you if I end the session now?\" and get a yes on that and we just end the session. That's it. And \"Tell me I'm no longer auditing you.\" All of these various lines we've had before – those little courtesy lines are in there. The only additional ones: thanking him for his goals, then thanking him for his gains. And that is the form of a Model Session these days. But it still requires a precision, don't you see? It is still a Model Session and its wording is very fixed for each one of these points. Before I gave you a demonstration of this Model Session brought up-to-date, however, I wanted to get that business of what do you say to a pc? What is exactly the best thing to say, you know? \"That didn't read.\" \"Do you agree that that is clean?\" – that type of approach can cause ARC breaks. I myself have felt like saying, \"Well, I don't have to agree that it's clean. To hell with it!\" you know? [laughs] \"What are you trying to do, force me to say there are no more an-swers on this question, 'In the last trillion trillion years is there anything you have sup-pressed?' Hell, I know it can't be clean. It's clean for the purposes of the session, maybe, but sure isn't clean!\" That's why, when you heard a demonstration I was giving on that tape a short time ago, I was slipping that. You saw I wasn't using it very much, and fumbling around with it. I was still trying to find a proper wording. Soon as I get that taped, why, I'll give you this new one. It's almost exactly the same one as you're using now; I'm just giving you these little refinements. All refinements these days are just in the direction of causing less ARC breaks and getting more auditing done."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 3 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 75 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The reason you have rough needles, however, has nothing to do with your Model Ses-sion or your rudiments or anything else. The reason you have rough needles is you miss on TR 2 or TR 4. You miss TR 2 and TR 4 and you got a rough needle. That's it – bang. Just like that. Comes back to auditing cycle. If an auditor's pc has a clean needle consistently, you know that this pc is either phe-nomenal or this auditor has very, very good TR 2 and TR 4 – very good TR 2 and TR 4, see? And if pc has a rough needle, not all the rudiments in the world will put it together if the audi-tor's TR 2 and TR 4 are for the birds. See? That's a big point. That's a big point. Now, I invite you sometime to just watch this. Any auditor will have this happen to him. It happens about once a session. Sometime in the session you got a clean needle, it's flowing along here very neatly and very nicely and smoothly – clean needle, everything going fine – and all of a sudden you got a dirty needle. You immediately assume pc has a missed withhold. If you were to take a tape of your auditing session, you would find out very rapidly that your TR 2 went out or the pc originated and you did something about it. Something hap-pened there between TR 2 and TR 4, and immediately your needle was rough. Be very revelatory to you if you had a tape of the needle – we're trying to accomplish this technically, a very hard problem – if you had a tape of your needle in your session and you could play it back sometime, you'd learn a lot. And it's quite intriguing. And you say, \"What the hell gets into me?\" you know? Pc said, \"I had an ache.\" \"Oh yes, where was it? Oh yeah, hm-mm? Have anything to do with the process we were running?\" Dirty needle. Just like that. Bang-bang! \"Uh, well, I feel better now.\" \"Well, you don't have to worry about that. We'll get you into another...\" [laughter] But you watch the coordination between auditing cycle and dirty and clean needles, and you're going to be fascinated! And whenever you look around and you see an awful lot of pcs have dirty needles, you look around, you'll see an awful lot of auditors have dirty TR 2 and TR 4. You clean up the TR 2 and TR 4 and you'll clean up more needles than you can shake a stick at. It isn't the significance of it, you see; it's the calm flow of the auditing cycle. Well, I didn't come in here to give you a lecture on this today. I'm going to give you a lecture on the subject of ARC breaks, so I might as well start this lecture. This is what? Audience: July 24th. Twenty-four July, AD 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And here is a lecture on the subject of ARC break assessments – one which you need. You need. You need this worse than you think. ARC break assessments. Now, I've just been rattling along here and talking about sessioning in general, which is of course a very applicable part of this lecture. But you normally consider a dirty needle,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 4 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 76 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR you see, as a withhold or something that the pc has done. And you seldom look at it as some-thing that the auditor has done. Well, let me point out to you that there are two communication cycles in an auditing cycle – two communication cycles in an auditing cycle – and either one of those two commu-nication cycles can be active. Now, number one is auditor to pc. Number two is pc to auditor. Now, either of those can operate independently. And one of those cycles goes this way: \"Do fish swim?\" see, and the pc hears it and understands it, see? And that is simply cause, distance, effect. So that's a communication cycle, see? Cause, distance, effect. Now, pc says, \"Yes,\" and auditor hears it and understands it. Now, that's cause, dis-tance, effect. Now, you're used to all this, of course, but you probably haven't looked at it in the de-gree of separateness which it deserves, since either one of them can exist independent of the other one, and both of those communication cycles have to be perfect or very acceptable be-fore you have an auditing cycle. An auditing cycle is not made up, then, of auditor command, pc's reply, auditor's acknowledgment, see? That is a very, very loose look at an auditing cycle. An auditing cycle can exist, frankly, on either of these independently. The pc doesn't have to say a thing and yet be perfectly satisfied. Do you see – a communication can exist from the auditor to the pc. What's your R-factor? That's a communication from the auditor to the pc, isn't it? Pc understands it. You ever hear a pc say very much to an R-factor? He doesn't even have to sig-nify he's heard it. There's nothing in the books that says he did. But he has to understand it. He doesn't have to say anything. \"Okay, all right. Well, I agree that is the R-factor\" – you don't expect the pc to say that, see? Similarly, you're going along in an auditing session, the pc suddenly says, \"Hey! I just realized that dirigibles aren't airplanes, see? You know, it's a fact!\" And you haven't even been auditing dirigibles or airplanes or anything else. This very often takes you by surprise. It can be close or far from the subject of the auditing session – that has nothing to do with it – but it's an independent communication cycle. An independent communication cycle. Now, you're so cheerful on the subject of getting your TR 2 in, just right, in answer to the TR 4 that you don't sometimes look at the fact that TR 4 doesn't depend on TR 2, not even vaguely. That's why it's TR 4. It's up – up numbered. What is this? Do you know that some of the most successful origin handling I've ever done had no acknowledgment connected with them. Although you can say the auditor is supposed to un-derstand and acknowledge the thing – receive, understand and acknowledge the communica-tion, all that sort of thing – you can go into that kind of thing and try to explain what this is; in actual fact, look at this in its most naked form. This is just simply a single communication cycle, originated by the pc and received and understood by the auditor. And if you look at that, not with any tricks or gimmicks around it, all will suddenly make sense. Just as the audi-tor is emanating and originating his auditing cycle as a one-way communication in its first step, and just as an auditor can originate things which the pc doesn't have to respond to at all,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 5 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 77 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR so can you get the reverse thing going in a session – which is to say, the pc says something. And that's a communication cycle. And the only thing you're trying to do is signify that it ex-ists. You're not trying to do TR 2 or anything else. I mean, the pc originates, he says, \"Dirigi-bles are not airplanes.\" He's had a cognition of some kind or another. One of the ways to knock him off his base is to give him a very artificial TR 2. Did you ever have an origin knocked off its base by having the auditor say \"Very good. Thank you?\" – get a very artificial piece of stuff back in your teeth. You've just said something that was important to you. Very often in auditing I'll handle an origin with a facial expression or a head nod, be-cause it's a one-way cycle. And only a ghost of the thing the other way needs go, and actually needn't really go at all. If you're really good at projecting your think tank, you could sit there with the face of a wooden Indian and do a perfect TR 4. I know that sounds utterly incredible. The way not to handle a TR 4 is to make it obvi-ous that you haven't understood and that you have re-ceived the com-mu-ni-ca-tion. \"Thank-you.\" [speaks in a robotic manner] \"I suddenly – I suddenly realize,\" the pc says, \"I suddenly realize – I suddenly realize my migraine headache's gone! I had it for years! Gone! Hey, what do you know! Ha! It's gone! Gone!\" [in a robotic manner:] \"Thank you.\" [laughter] What the auditor has done in that particular regard is make a mistake of thinking a pc runs a reverse auditing cycle. See, he thinks the pc is now going to audit him. [laughter] The point here is you audit any little kid on \"Touch that table\" or \"Touch that chair\" for a little while, and nearly all of them will suddenly start giving the command to you. They get their flow going so far, and you're a fool if you don't do them, too. And you touch the table and touch the chair, and the kid's all satisfied and so forth. And they're perfectly willing for your next command, see? It's quite a game they play. They go into a very complete duplication of the auditing session. A good auditor of children and so on is quite well aware of this and doesn't refuse to execute the auditing command. It throws a kid completely out of session. Kid is overwhelmed. That's the kid's effort to be right, don't you see? All right. But in handling an origin, the pc has not started to audit the auditor. That's a different kettle of fish. The pc doesn't expect anything but a comprehension. That's all the pc expects. Now, how do you signify a comprehension? Well, I know your telepather is kind of busted; it's been busted for quite a while. I know mine has been, to the degree that it might be. I sometimes look back at what telepathy once was, and a guy is two thousand yards away and you hear all of his thoughts with a crash, don't you see? That's OT stuff. You can also have obsessive telepathy where you hear everybody all the time. This is sort of out of control. But we're not asking for anything that is that marvelous. We're asking for pure and simple, an or-dinary response to a communication. Now, how do you signify that you comprehended? Until you can answer that question well – till you can answer that question well and pleasantly – to yourself, see – I mean, not pleasantly but satisfactorily."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 6 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 78 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Well, you're sitting there right now. How are you \"comprehending\" to me that you heard what I said and understand it? Yeah, I look at your faces and you're all doing it beauti-fully. [laughter] See? Perfect. Now, that is an origin; handling of. And that's all there is to handling an origin. Pc says something and you understand it. Now, we say \"and acknowledge it,\" but we've gone too far because we're tending to put it in a thing. We let the pc know we've understood it. For in-stance, once in a while I'll just laugh like hell, see, you know? Pc has said something that's very funny to the pc, you know, and seems funny to me (I won't laugh if I don't think it's funny to me; I won't corn up the emotions on it), and I'll just laugh, you know. I'll say... Pc's perfectly satisfied. That's because there's no auditing cycle involved. That's just a communica-tion cycle. That's all there is to it, see? Now, there are a bunch of processes which require no answer from the pc but do re-quire a response from the pc of some kind or another. But they are Concept Processes – the old Concept Processes: \"Get the idea of...\" Well, the pc can sit there and get the idea and never really say \"Yes, I...\" No, nothing to the auditor. You know he's done it. Well, how did you know he s done it? Oh, you look at his breathing and that sort of thing, you take a look at him and so on. You get into this trouble in R3R. How do you know the pc has moved to the beginning of the incident? See, that's an interesting little hole. Because you didn't say \"Move to the be-ginning of the incident at approximately... and tell me when you get there.\" In the first place, that would be very sour, because it's two auditing commands, they're already complicated, he's in too much trouble already; and once in a while, any auditor will get dopey and have moved the pc to the beginning of the incident and then not move him through it. You know, forget. The pc will sit there for a while, finally look at you kind of hos-tilely and say, \"Well, when are you going to move me through the rest of the incident, you knucklehead?\" Any auditor is liable to do this, because he's all busy with his computation of where the beginning of the incident is and how many time it was and so forth. And the pc's been taking quite a while, let us say, to get to the beginning of the incident. And so he moves him to the beginning of the incident and then all of a sudden wakes up to realize at last that he hasn't moved him through the incident. This can happen – not to you just once or twice because you're new at it; this will probably continue to happen to you, embarrassedly, now and then, from here on out. Because you've got an incident that's a trillion years long, or something stupid like this. And the pc's at the end of the thing and has had an awful time trying to find the beginning of it anyhow. And you say, \"Move to the beginning of the incident at approximately wumpty-wump-bump tril-lion years ago.\" And you decide, \"Well, while he's moving to the beginning of the incident I'll just catch up on my note of what he's just told me, because I didn't want to slow him down,\" you see? And you're busy writing and writing. You get interested in what you're writing, you know? [laughter, laughs] Well, actually, the pc wouldn't be upset with you if he didn't notice that your attention was on something else rather than following through the auditing command. Pc usually for-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 7 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 79 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR gives this; doesn't cause any ARC break. But ordinarily, you... pc says, \"Well, I'm there. So what?\" And you say, \"Oh! Uh-ho-hah-ho. Oh.\" [laughter, laughs] The exact auditing com-mand that follows that, of course, is \"Move through the incident to a point (duration time) later.\" That's the exact command that should be given him at that moment. And he'll go ahead and happily carry this out. Well, this is a point where, if you're on the ball, you say, \"Move to the beginning of the incident\" and if you keep your eye on your meter it'll flick sooner or later. You don't have to ask him \"Are you there?\" That's terribly bad form. You want to ask him \"What are you looking at?\" \"Well, so-and-so and so-and-so.\" And I wouldn't spend much time asking him what he was looking at either. As soon as I had any inkling that he was at the beginning of the incident I'd move him on through, because you can't make any real mistakes there anyway. But the point I'm making here is the pc doesn't have to tell you he's at the beginning of the incident; he simply executes the auditing command. Causes a little bit of embarrassment sometimes, when you don't realize that he's executed the auditing command. But it is a com-munication cycle. It has taken place. The auditor said something, the pc's done it. That's all you expect. That's it. All right. Now, the pc says something. It's a communication cycle. He's, not auditing you. It must be, therefore, a communication cycle. He originates see? And he originates something to you, and you receive it and understand it: that is a communication cycle. Com-munication cycle complete, right there. Now, to make it an originated cycle, you should sig-nify to him in some tiny fashion that you have received it and understood it. Now, if you try to phony this up and he says, \"Eugulala blou-uboog,\" and you say, \"Hm-mm, hm-mm, hm-mm,\" and you don't know what the hell he's talking about, there is some mystic influence sets in at this point which you will see go on the meter. He knows damn well you didn't understand that – half the time because he didn't. Now, the auditor who specializes in this phrase should be stonewalled: \"I just don't understand what you said,\" see? \"I didn't understand you.\" \"I don't understand what you are saying.\" \"Don't understand.\" In the first place, that's lousy – a lousy approach – from the basis that it uses a very, very powerful word. Understand is the crossroads of A, R and C. And you say \"don't understand,\" you're just asking at once for a complete ARC break. But more impor-tantly, you have said to the pc to communicate the same thing again. If you'll notice, he said, \"I have a pain in my back.\" And you say, \"I just don't understand what you said.\" And the pc will only say, \"I have a pain in my back.\" And you say, \"I don't understand that.\" And he will say, \"I have a pain in my back!\" We're all of a sudden seeing the buildup of the ARC break, see?"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 8 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 80 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And you say, \"I just don't understand that.\" \"I have a pain in my back!!\" You can build this up. But do you notice that the pc is saying the same words over and over and over? It's a peculiarity of Homo sap. If you indicate that you don't understand what he's talking about, he says the same thing again. He says the exact same thing again. He never varies it. What you want him to do is vary the explanation. What you're asking him to do is to help you get this, if he's got to say something more. What you want to indicate to him is he should tell you a little more broadly what he is talking about so that you can get a very good grasp of it. And if you are very clever and there's no substitute for cleverness; you can't give anybody a pat phrase with it because they vary all the time – if you're very clever, he will explain it to you in a half a dozen different ways. And then he understands it and so do you. But it's mainly you that's got to understand it. Now here, basically and elementarily, we get the basis of an ARC break. I don't care what kind of charge is bypassed, the thing is a bunged up communication cycle, whatever else it is, see? It's affinity, reality, communication – these things are all out. It's a bunged up com-munication cycle, but what in it is bunged up? Detected and understood – those are what's bunged up in it. How can you have a communication cycle where the communication is not fully de-tected and is not understood? How can you have one? It isn't a communication cycle, because the communication cycle is cause, distance, effect, with duplication occurring at the effect-point of the cause-point. That's a very pure, accurate definition. Not over all the years has there been any shift of that. But look at this. Are you going to call this a communication cycle: cause, distance, al-ter-ised effect, no comprehension? You said, \"Good morning,\" and she thought you insulted her. How did that come about? Well, it just came about by the nonexistence of a communica-tion cycle. It was imperfectly detected and it was not understood. Now, of course, it's not understood because it's imperfectly detected. I mean, how much more elementary can we get? Somebody rolls a lollipop in your direction, how can you detect what it is if you don't receive it? Oh yes, it can arrive within four feet of you, and you can look out there and see a lollipop. Then you could detect it without receiving it, which is another thing. This would also be an ARC breaky situation. It's detected, but you didn't re-ceive it. Usually you'll find TR 4 breaks down at this point. It's detected, but not received. Pc says, \"I don't – I-I-I don't think you have to keep – keep the session going much longer; I feel fine.\" You say, \"Well, we're going – we're going to keep it going as long as is necessary to fill in this particular period.\" You detected he said something, but you didn't receive it. You've said you didn't receive it because you didn't do anything about it. You said it should be something else before it arrived at you, and you have therefore busted down the communi-cation line between the pc and yourself"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 9 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 81 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, that was a very pleasant origin, wasn't it? Do you know that you could so work on that origin that you would have that pc – I don't care what pc, or how calm this pc nor-mally is or how splendid and pleasant this pc is – you could get that pc into an absolute screaming fit, just on that, by just continuing that. Just continue it and continue it, and if you ever want to see an ARC break, man, just rig one of these things so that you don't receive what the pc says. And that can be done to any pc. Some pcs are really a bit below spitting in your face, but they just – you can just see them go blyaaahhh. And they just sort of pass out right where they sit. But it produces a fantastic effect. A fantastic effect. Now, an auditor must realize that that is a primary effect, and that is a primary cause of ARC break. That is not one of the causes of ARC break. That is your textbook, perfect ex-ample. From the pc's point of view, there is cause, and there's distance; the distance is not covered, and the communication cycle does not complete. And that's it. That's it. I don't care what pc you've got, you can reduce a pc to a screaming fit, no matter what this pc has said. You can just get the pc gibbering. A pc will just be shaking and exhausted in a very short space of time. And that's an ARC break. Well, why is it an ARC break? That's because both A, R and C are out. The combination of A, R and C equals understanding, and the understanding is out. The intention is cause, distance, effect, and the progress of that cycle is prevented so that the communication is actually not fully detected. See? Not fully detected. This is a very, very interesting point in ARC breaks. That forms a woof and a warp of all ARC breaks. Not fully detected – partially detected but not fully detected. Nobody's going to ARC break going out here and yelling at a rock. You could go out here and yell at a rock all morning. You can say, \"Oh rock, I hate thee,\" or \"Oh rock, whither dost thou comest?\" – anything you want to say – and you will go out and yell at the rock and talk at the rock and speak at the rock and so forth, but your expectancy of what's going to happen at the rock never does get quite up to expecting the rock to give you a TR 2. So therefore, your estimate of the detection is not at fault. The rock isn't going to de-tect the communication to it, so you then don't expect anything to happen in the communica-tion cycle, so therefore you do not ARC break. See? Ah, but the pc is under a very, very definite detection cycle. The pc expects the auditor to detect the communication from the pc and understand it. And when that is thrown sideways – because understanding has entered into it, because detection has entered into it, because only partial detection or no detection has entered into it, in spite of the expectancy of its being detected – you can reduce a pc to an absolute shaking mess of jelly. I'm not kidding you now. I see from your silence that you're either accepting this as too grim to confront, or you think I may be exaggerating it. This is not so. This is not so. You can take the most common statement, such as \"I feel pretty good now,\" refuse to detect what the pc is saying, don't duplicate it (don't understand it, in other words), and keep giving the pc evidence that you haven't understood it, and have that pc – I don't care how calm, cool and collected that pc has always suspected himself – in utter amazement at having been a shuddering mess of jelly, because he eventually will start screaming. \"But I was just trying to tell you I feel perfectly good now,\" see? And it goes up, up, up, up, up, scream,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 10 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 82 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR scream, scream, and he'll then break downscale. You can see him go down the scale. \"I was just trying to tell you...!\" And he'll be crying, you know? He gets on the same line – the stuck flow of his communication on the thing, and he can't get it through, he tries everything under God's green earth to get it through, and eventu-ally he starts giving up and you can see his whole emotional tone scale follow this, then. Well, that is a basic ARC break. That's fundamental. Now, you expect me to tell you there are many other kinds of ARC breaks, but there are no other kinds of ARC breaks. These mechanisms are all based on the communication cycle. I don't care what the devil happens with the rest of the bank, the whole definition of bypassed charge is \"partially detected.\" Now, it wouldn't become bypassed charge unless it were at least slightly detected. You understand? Somebody had to drag a magnet within a few feet of it. It had to be stirred up one way or the other for the thing. But that is a communica-tion line which begins. Going to restimulate an engram in the session. Let's take this as a bypassed charge source, see? The auditor does this, knuckleheadedly. You want to be careful in R3R, in selecting incidents, using things like \"the first inci-dent,\" \"the earliest incident.\" Cut your throat, man! What are you talking about? You want \"an earlier\" incident, \"the next\" incident, not \"first\" and \"earliest.\" Why? What are you trying to do? Life's so dull you have to have an ARC break? Well, how are you going to get this ARC break? The pc can't give you the earliest incident on the chain but could give you the earlier incident than the one you just had. But you ask him for the earliest incident and you will kick in some earlier incident which he then doesn't reach. So, he now partially detects. And you have partially detected. Both of you, now, are guilty of partial detection of a started communication. And somewhere down deep it follows the same cycle as a communication cycle, right there – bang-bang-bang. It'll go all to flinders, just like that – bang-bang-bang. The more you scrape it up and the less you detect it, the more ARC break you're going to have. And that's all there is to it. If you considered the time track a series of mines – nah, I shouldn't do this; some of you girls are timid enough when it comes to approaching some of these things. But let me give you this anyway. Supposing we consider it a bunch of mines which were activated mag-netically. All you had to do was drag a magnet somewhere near them and they'd explode, see? And you want mine number four, and you're all set to sit on it and pull its teeth and not let it explode, see? So you throw a magnet down to mine number eight and then start to prevent mine number four from exploding – and you wonder what that shattering roar is! Well, you see, you just miscalculated on what one you were going to explode. Now, a time track isn't quite that dramatic, but it gives you an example, see? You want mine number four, so you activate mine number eight. Now, what in actual fact is that? Well, it's a bum origin as far as the auditor is concerned, but actually, the communica-tion cycle is reverse end to. Somebody has told mine number eight to speak, accidentally. And mine number eight speaks, and nobody detects it, quite. See, it's partially detected. But it is activated and being partially detected now, will follow that same incomplete communica-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 11 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 83 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR tion cycle. Nobody understands it, see? It isn't that that has life in it which is capable of doing that at all. It's just that a communication cycle, once begun, must go through. And if there is any type of thing that you want... A big truism – a big truism: A communication cycle once begun must go through. If that communication cycle isn't permitted to go through, there will be upset somewhere, some-time, someplace. In fact, most of the difficulties of mankind, if you wanted to lay them out, are simply begun communication cycles which are not then detected. You know, they're only partially detected, let us say. There it is, see? Let me give you an idea. The President of the United States says, \"I want all of you bums and all of the indigent and the poor and the pauperized characters – I want all of you to write me a letter and tell me exactly what I can do to help you personally, individually and personally.\" Gluck! Nobody would see in this the eventual revolution. Do you see what's go-ing to happen? The guy's got no technology for handling the communication cycle at all. To say something like that would be weird. And yet the politician in a democratic country has always got this as his stock in trade. He's a glad-hander tell-me Joe, you know – this kind of thing. Eventually it starts exploding in his face. We are very adventurous in that I go ahead and do something like that. Remember, there's a slight difference here. Slight difference here: You know how to catch the ball. We can catch the ball, we know the mechanics of this sort of thing, and gener-ally the communication cycle doesn't have that as a source. I mean, it isn't that communication cycle that's at fault. It will have been somebody audited somebody, and they got into an ARC break and they bypassed some charge, and then the person wouldn't admit that they had by-passed some charge, you see, on the pc, and then the pc gets more and more disturbed. And eventually they go to see somebody in the area, and eventually the HCO Sec. And then the HCO Sec tries to handle it one way or the other, but it misses there one way or the other. And it slides sideways and slips around and so forth, and eventually hear about it. And once in a while I drop a ball on these, and I only know of one case extant right now where the ball has been dropped forever, as far as I'm concerned, because he got into the hands of a psychiatrist. Incomplete communication cycle was the immediate and direct cause of that particular action. He already, let us say – we know this – had a tremendous number of overts on the organization and everything was gone to hell, and he'd been in a mess for a long time, see? But a communication cycle – I didn't pay attention to it just as a communication cycle, just directly didn't. And the character sprung sideways, and there wasn't any way you could pick up the ball after that because there was a psychiatrist standing there. Haven't done anything to the guy – apparently some psychiatrist that doesn't use ice picks in the morning, only the afternoon. I only know one that's extant like that. Well, that's a pretty good tribute to us, and it doesn't say, then, that the situation isn't dangerous merely because it's being handled. But look at this: It is a situation which is pretty doggone violent if it is not handled. And if you're unaware of this... you realize that gunners and that sort of thing are al-ways chucking around live ammunition, and they're not spooked about it at all.

This stuff, you know, is not very dangerous. I don't mean to minimize it, so on. Frankly not very dangerous. It re-quires understanding. It never has been very dangerous. But look how desperate it has made practitioners of the past. Look how desperate it has made people. Look how desperate a problem it is and look how frightened people can get if the United States – whatever you call it – is appropriating sixteen billion bucks to let psy-chiatry figure out how to give quicker and faster prefrontal lobotomies to more people. Oh, I tell you, man, they must be worried! That worry must be proportional – at least one third as much worry invested in that as they have invested in the Russian situation, be-cause that's about the proportionate amounts of appropriation. I think that's fascinating. You mean, they're so worried about this problem, they're so worried about the mind, that they in-vest treasure to this extent? They must be frantic to put it in the hands of the people they put it in, too. I don't exaggerate. If you'd talk to most psychiatrists yourself, or if you were to – if you were head of a committee or something like that and you called in two or three psychia-trists or something like that to get testimony from them as to how to handle the community mental health – if you were just an average citizen – you'd probably wind up with your eyes like saucers. Police listening to these fellows testify in courts, and that sort of thing, have be-come confirmed in the fact the psychiatrists are always crazier than the patients.

Very few of you would be convinced you couldn't talk to anybody about anything. After you talk to them for a while you know you can handle the situation to some degree or another and so on. Well, that's not the general state of mind with regard to this sort of thing in this soci-ety. \"Talk to somebody about something? Huuuhhh!\" See? \"Impossible! Hu-ooohh! Danger-ous!\" What are these characters reacting to? They're reacting to a communication cycle. So the communication cycle is itself the most deadly thing, if mishandled, that interpersonal rela-tionships has, and the most valuable if it can be handled. The reason you can't fish the ants out and straighten them up is because you can't talk to them. Desperation enters in only when communication goes out. Just remember that. You only get desperate – you can look back on sessions you've given: the only times you've been worried and desperate and that sort of thing is when you actually had the communication cy-cle go out, one way or the other. You want to say to this pc, \"What the hell is the matter with you?\" See? \"What's the matter with you? I mean, I'm asking you a perfectly simple question here, you know? And you poor sod! If you can't answer that question, get some tone arm ac-tion, you've just about had it, man!\" You know? You know this, sitting there, you see, and you sit there and you get tied up in the situation. After a while you find yourself kind of peeved with the pc. Pc isn't responding cor-rectly. Then you get all right when you do get the pc at some level that the pc is responding all right with communication; you find out that, much to your red face, that you had eight wrong dates on the case and that's why the TA action wasn't moving – something like this. You get these things straightened out, you notice the situation evaporates. In other words, your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you can put a communication between yourself and the aberration that's bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge. Don't ever think you worry about a case for any other reason. You don't. It's that basic thing. You're having an effect on the case, the case is re-sponding and the case is coming along, and that is what you expect to have happen, and there-fore that is happening and all is well. And when that ceases to happen, when your breakdown comes in, and you can't seem to reach this pc with an auditing command, you can't seem to reach this bank with a communication of any kind whatsoever, you can't seem to untangle this knot by speaking at it or into it, you start getting worried and you start getting upset. And that's when you as an auditor become upset, and that's when you as an auditor become wor-ried about your pc. And it's off... There's no reason for me to give you some pat answer, because there isn't a broad, pat answer to it, because cases have these various bugs and complications of which you're aware and which you get around eventually. But you look it over and try to find out what communi-cation you're not getting home to the pc, and you as an auditor will feel better."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 14 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 86 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, if the pc is feeling like the devil, pc's feeling miserable about an auditing session or auditor, or something like that, you can just be sure that a – not his communication cycle; now, don't get this one awry. His... as an auditor, it's always your communication cycle that is awry, from your analysis of the thing. You want to improve something, you improve your communication cycle. But from a pc's point of view – a pc is very much the effect of very heavy and strong processes – and from the pc's point of view, a communication cycle is awry, but it can be awry in various ways. It's awry. The communication cycle is awry. A communication has started, it hasn't been fully detected and it certainly hasn't been understood. And where a pc is going awry as a pc – you want happy pcs, you just listen to these little words and don't bother about anything else, and you just start figuring out exactly how you apply these to any case that you're audit-ing that you want to make a happier case one way or the other, and it'll work. And that is, some communication cycle has begun, it hasn't been detected – fully detected, you see; has to be slightly detected or it wouldn't be active – and it hasn't been understood. Now, if you put that in a nutshell as to the basis of low ARC or ARC breaks in pcs that you are auditing, you actually never need another line of anything. You need the mechanics of how to detect these things, you need a list of how many things these can be and so forth, but I give you that as a basic principle. And you go at that as a basic principle, and you figure out the pc you're auditing has that as a basic principle, even when the pc doesn't have an ARC break. You know, there's no reason to figure this out. Now, get this: there's no reason to figure this out at all. Go ahead and figure it out and you all of a sudden will understand something about your pc that you haven't understood before. You're going to find a communication cycle out. I mean, it doesn't matter what pc, you see, where. You're always going to find a communication cycle out. What's the evidence? He's not OT. For instance, he's always missing the telepathic communication cycle; see, he's always missing that one – that's always out. Didn't go out in a session I was in last night. The auditor and pc practically blew each other's brains out by having exactly the same communication cycle on a telepathic wave hit midway and almost blow up in the middle of the session. It was an incomplete communica-tion cycle had taken place in the session. Both auditor and pc thought of it simultaneously and almost went around the bend trying to figure out which one had thought of it first so as to unbalance – so as to unbalance this sudden ridge that had appeared in the middle of the audit-ing session. Quite an amusing situation. Missed a goal, back in the session; you know, one of these skitter-scatter sorts of re-views of putting things back together again, redating and that sort of thing, and just up and missed a goal. Didn't realize any goal had been missed until the end of session, then all of a sudden thought of it. Either the auditor thought of it first or the pc thought of it first. The im-mediate result was a telepath on the subject, and it... [claps]! It was pretty weird. You watch some of this stuff you haven't seen for a long time, you know, you get tremendously intrigued. You say, \"Huh! This stuff can exist,\" you know?"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 15 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 87 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Anyway, we had quite a ball on that. But that's just a communication cycle of some kind or another which is completing. There are all kinds of communication cycles. Now, what do you think of a pc who isn't receiving the auditing command? And what do you think of the auditor that goes ahead and gives auditing commands the pc is only par-tially detecting? Hm? Now, does this explain why you can run a \"touch\" process on an uncon-scious person, particularly if you're monitoring their hands? You say, \"Touch the sheet. Touch the pillow.\" You say, \"Touch the pillow,\" and then you have them touch the pillow, and now they know they've received the communication. You understand? You see that as a surety? So it even works at the level of unconsciousness. It's quite interesting. What do you think an auditor is going to walk into who keeps saying, \"Squizzle-wig the ruddy rods. Thank you. Squizzle-wig the ruddy rods. Thank you.\" And the pc keeps saying, \"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.\" What do you think the assessment at the end of session is going to look like? There's going to be a communication cycle missing. It happens to be the auditor's originated communication which is only partially detected by the pc and never understood. Now, what do you think's going to happen in that session? It's going to blow in some weird direction and there isn't going to be progress, and things are going to go to hell in a balloon one way or the other, and it's all going to be very hard to detect. You see that? All right. Now, let's look at another communication cycle. The pc is – I'm not trying to tell you all ARC breaks are based on the communication cycle. You understand, the com-munication cycle is primary but goes awry at the point of detection and understanding. Un-derstanding throws it into A and R. You understand? There are the affinity factors and the reality factors are what tend to make it not understood. This is why it's ARC. But still you can analyze it head-on on the basis of communication, you see, and it'll fall into that category. It's the reasons why the communication cycle didn't complete and was only partially detected when it should have been really detected, see? Well, let's say the auditor has never cleared the auditing command with the pc. The pc has gone on answering this endlessly. Well, of course, you're going to get into trouble. What's the primary source of trouble? The fact that a communication cycle existed and the communi-cation cycle was only partially detected, only the communication cycle didn't cycle. It didn't get all the way through. It was partially detected and it was not understood. So of course you're going to get into trouble. All right. Let's take another look at the situation. We try to get engram four and we trigger engram eight. Well, we've started a communication cycle, don't you see, of engram eight without knowing we started engram eight, and we suddenly hear an explosion some-place and we can't quite detect where it came from. We look it over, and we find out the communication cycle was that we accidentally got the response of engram eight, but then we abandoned that somehow or another and we got four. So actually the communication cycle was not completed. Was directed to eight, was not received at eight, don't you see? It was received at four instead, so therefore you've got a partial detection, and the pc didn't find it out, really, and the auditor didn't find it out, so there it remains as a sleeper, don't you see?"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 16 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 88 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR There was something that didn't go through. That's all you've got to figure on the thing, if you left all of your lists home. Something didn't go through. Well, it's only a question of how many things won't go through. Well, the basic things that won't go through are affinity, reality and communication. And the basic things that those three things face are time. Time – matter, energy, space and time. It's ARC versus time. Don't you see that the livingness of the individual consists of ARC and he faces the material universe which consists of M-E-S-T. So you have the factors of M-E-S-T and you have the factors of ARC. And these confront each other. But this basically takes up the communication cycle. The individual communicating with time, or time commu-nicating with the individual, goes awry. And as a result you get an incomplete and a partially detected communication cycle. All of these things end up in what you call an ARC break. This ARC break results in all sorts of violent emotions which actually could not be exagger-ated in their violence. It's just an ARC break amongst nations that causes wars. And yet here's millions of people strewn out across the battlefields causing all kinds of work up here at the between-lives area. (Poor fellows – I bet they even have to work overtime. Let's hope they don't belong to the union or anything like that. The boys must have an awful time.) Well, that's an immediate, direct result of ARC break. Communication breakdown of some kind or another, with the affinity and reality attendant thereunto. So don't think that because these factors are very simple and very easy to handle and very easy to detect that the results of not detecting them are not severe; and that the severe results that you see in life, interpersonally and in auditing sessions, too, as well, are not catas-trophic, or think that these results do not stem from this very simple little factor. Because it always does. An incomplete communication cycle results in bypassed charge – always. The common denominator of an ARC break is bypassed charge. There's charge some-place. But what do we mean by charge? We mean – well, of course, ergs, dynes and all the rest of it. Well, we apply it to the communication cycle and we mean that a communication or a charge has been excited and was channeled to go in a certain direction, and then was not detected and not understood, and that charge then explodes in a dispersal of some sort or an-other. It goes blooey. Don't you see? This is elementary. Bypassed charge is something that originates as the beginning of a communication cycle, and then not having been wholly de-tected or understood, remains then as bypassed charge. And it's very often not detected by the auditor or the pc. And you have a session sort of running at a low gear. Now, don't think these things are just explosive either. Pc just isn't feeling so well lately, so forth. Well, you've got some sleeping bypassed charge of some kind or another you didn't pick up, that's all. Bypassed charge, we mean we bypassed getting the completion of the communication cycle, or we carelessly started a communication cycle which didn't get com-pleted. That's all. Accidentally did so. It's very easy to do. We say, \"Give me the earliest engram on this chain.\" Little while later, pc has an ARC break. We say, \"Let's see, did I miss an origin, or what did I do? What happened?\" Then you hit, finally, \"an earlier incident was restimulated.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 17 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 89 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR This usually settles it away one way or the other, particularly if the pc spots what was res-timulated. Bang! There goes your ARC break. Now, it's attended with great magic. But the magical look at it is the fact that we have the anatomy of this tremendously explosive stuff – the explosive stuff of interpersonal rela-tions. We know the magic of that. We know how many different ways the thing can be – a communication can be begun and not be detected and therefore become bypassed charge. It's a lot of ways in which this thing can be done. Well, knowing those things, you should be able to handle a session better. You should be able to handle a session better. Pc says, \"Oh, I – I don't think we ought to go on too long.\" And you say, \"Very good.\" Just as your words fly out the window, at least have the grace to realize that you are adding something into the communication cycle, if this then bears bad fruit. Just realize how come it came about. It's a partially detected communication, wasn't understood, far as the pc is concerned. You say, well, obviously that leaves you in a position of always doing what the pc says. No, it doesn't. \"Well, good. I'm glad that's the way you feel. All right. All right. Yeah, okay. Okay. Don't want to carry on too long. All right. All right. Well, good thing that I'm perfectly fresh, and I hope you are the same, because I intended to go for another two hours.\" We find that one cycle isn't the other cycle, don't you see? You've originated a new series of communica-tions on the subject; you haven't slapped the old one in the head. You only get into trouble by slapping the old one in the head, don't you see? Pc said, \"I think you ought to go all over the track and restimulate all these engrams, because actually the best thing to do is to get to basic-basic, which is tomorrow.\" And you say, \"All right.\" You take a look at this, you understand what he said. You may not understand why he said it, but you sure understand what he said. And you say, \"All right. Good enough,\" and go on and do what you're doing. He still isn't too upset about the situation. See, he only gets up-set if you slap him in the face. Therefore, you've got to be an expert in the detection of a communication that has be-gun. The better you are at detecting a begun communication – the better you are at this – the less ARC breaks you'll have. But actually you needn't worry about ARC breaks, because you can handle these things before they get catastrophic. Now, that's an ARC break. That's handling the ARC break. These are the basic funda-mentals stripped right down to rock bottom. Your ARC break assessment form is simply the number of types of communications which can be started and only partially detected by the auditor and the pc. Now, some of you are prone to this (now, this can be done; so you are led astray by some wins): You can say, \"Well, an earlier incident was restimulated in the session. That's what's wrong. That's what the ARC break was about,\" and the pc suddenly feels better. And if you go on that way, and you get wins, and you say, \"Boy, this is the cat's. There's nothing to this. This is absolute magic,\" right up to the point when you get the ARC break that you didn't"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 18 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 90 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR assess the right line for or you assessed the wrong list for or the pc didn't quite know where to go to in order to look at and is still fubble-fubbled. You didn't find it, even though it read on an assessment. So therefore, there are several actions undertaken in the detection of one of these things, and one is to assess it on the form where the ARC break reason lies. That sounds idi-otic for me to say something like that, but if the ARC break is in the session and you do an R3R ARC break form, you're not going to find the ARC break, are you? And so forth. So the right form, the right list – the right list comes as primary in this. And if you don't find it on the right list, why, you better get another list. In other words, if you don't find it, get another list. Your commonest error on these things is not now that the lists are not complete, but that the lists are in several pieces to save you time, so your commonest error is wrong list.* You actually didn't find the ARC break. You didn't find the communication cycle that began and so left bypassed charge. Now, the main mistake you're making or could make in this, if you do make any mis-take on it, is not making sure that it's all straightened out with the pc. That's the biggest com-mon error. You say, \"Well, that was an earlier incident restimulated. That's all right. Okay,\" and go on with the session. The pc's sitting there frying. It wasn't an earlier incident. Or he didn't know what incident it was, and he's totally baffled. The ARC break charge has not been spotted and laid to rest, see? It says right there in the bulletin on this that you better take it up with the pc and find out if that's right. Well, you can go to the point of dating all of the things which you dated wrongly and finding and locating and dating all of the bypassed incidents. In fact, it could become a total production which will go on for sessions, trying to clean up one ARC break. You understand? A good stunt in this regard is to find the order of magnitude of the bypassed charge. That doesn't let you in for more trouble. \"An earlier incident was restimulated.\" Yeah, but what? Who? What? Where? What's? Which? Which? What's? Which? It's all you can find, is an earlier incident was restimulated. You don't know what earlier incident was restimulated, you don't know what the hell, and all of a sudden the pc says, \"Oh, yes. And, yes, it must have been...\" and so on. And, \"I wonder when that was. Can you date that? Yeah, there it is,\" and so on. \"Can you date it?\" Good trick is just give it order of magnitude: \"Is it hundreds of years ago, thousands of years ago, millions of years ago, billions of years ago, trillions of years ago, trillions of tril-lions of year – ? It's trillions of trillions of years ago.\" \"No kidding? All right, that's fine.\" That's the end of it, see? That's a way of parking one without getting yourself all solidified in a dating. You know that the pc's attention is still stuck on this thing, and he's still trying to sort out what incident it was, and that sort of thing. Well, one of the ways to get rid of it is find its order of magnitude – not go ahead and date it and find its duration and run it by R3R when you, in the first place, were doing 3N. You un-derstand? You can go that far.   * Editor's note: Refers to the lists in HCOB 5 July 1963 \"ARC Break Assessments\", Red Vol. V, p.306"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 19 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 91 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR But locating – locating it on the list – is where the semantic error turns up here. You don't locate it on the list. The list only locates the type – the type of charge bypassed. In other words, the type of communication cycle that began and was never completed, never detected, see? That's all. That just locates its type. Now it's up to you to take the additional steps of locate and indicate to the pc the charge. In other words, doing the assessment is really not locating the charge. The charge is not on the list, it's in the pc. You get this? I'm not saying that just to be clever. The truth of the matter is, it's only the type; the list will only give you the type of charge. And you haven't accomplished the step of location. You've only found the type, see? People are saying \"All right. Well, you locate and indicate. That means you do an assessment. Bang – that is located now, and we indicate it to the pc.\" Well, the funny part of it is, this is so good that even that works. See, there's where you get tripped up. You can short-circuit it to that degree and still make it work. Well, recognize what you're doing. That's terribly short-circuited. You've only found the type of charge. You haven't done the location step at all. So in some ARC breaks you are totally baffled as to why the ARC break doesn't evaporate. You're totally baffled. You say, \"Why doesn't it go away?\" Well, the primary reason is you haven't done it on the right list. That, oddly enough, is the most flagrant one. But you've never done the location step at all. The assessment is not the location. See? And an earlier incident was restimulated. You say, \"All right, an earlier inci-dent was restimulated.\" Well, the magic of it is so great that occasionally this works, and it gives you a bit of a win, so you say, \"Well, this ARC break assessment stuff – pretty good. Ha-ha! That's it. Yeah, fine.\" And it'll work like that, and it'll always work if you've got the right list. And you've produced this minimal effect on the pc and pc isn't all coming apart now at his edges. See, because that works, this whole system tends to get very short-circuited. You see, the assessment is not the location. That isn't the way you locate the charge. That is the way you find the type of charge that you now want to locate. You go down this – pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa – and sometimes when you go over it you retrigger it, and your dirty needle turns off, and your next time down, why, it reads purely. See? You've had a dirty nee-dle on the first assessment. Expect that as normal. Next time you go through and flick those off that were still in – bang – one is standing out there clean. Now you can say, well, it says so-and-so and so-and-so. \"That's an earlier incident was restimulated. Earlier incident res-timulated, that's what it says here. How do you feel about that?\" The pc says, \"I feel lots better. Yeah, it's fine.\" Well, let's not plow up the field after it's plowed, man. See, this is just handling ARC breaks as they occur in session. You know? No reason to go into this, stir it all up again, find some more bypassed charge, bypass... no, you had it handled – let sleeping dogs lie. Your assessment, location and indication all occurred in the same breath, see? Then you verified to find out whether or not it was okay, and obviously it all occurred in the same breath, so why are you going to go into any trouble from here on? Everybody's satisfied, why are you going to any trouble? You're just going to stir up more trouble."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 20 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 92 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR But remember, you have done a very short-circuited, shorthand version of an ARC break rundown. That is very short-circuited. If you got the right charge, it can happen. But, \"Earlier incident restimulated. Yeah, that's what it says here. An earlier incident was restimu-lated in this session.\" Pc says, \"Ah, well. Okay now, that's good,\" and starts getting interested in something else, see? Ah-ah-ah, that's all right. Nobody's going to quarrel with him doing that. But you say, \"Well now, how do you feel about this?\" \"Ah, maybe so, but – uh – yeah, it was that earlier incident that was restimulated. Aorrwr-rahr! That earlier incident was restimulated!\" You haven't found the charge, man. And the first thing you should suspect is not your assessment but that you had the wrong list. Reach for another list. Do you know that you can do 3N and inadvertently do some 3R and be accidentally into 3R making ARC breaks of 3R? You can sometimes do R3R and get inadvertently into 3N, and your ARC break lies in 3N. Do you realize that? And sometimes if you have an ARC break on R3R and 3N, it is never the session ARC break list. But sometimes after you've cleared them up you then have to get the session ARC break that resulted from having had those out. You get the stunt here? But remember that there is an assessment, a location and an indication, and it has to be all right with the pc. So there are four steps, always four. You could say five: Finding out that the pc has an ARC break would normally be the first one. But that is the score on your ARC break assessments. And recognize – recognize those steps, in handling the existing ARC break, actually exist to that number, and the assessment is not the location. The assessment is just finding out the type of charge. You might have to go quite a bit further to find the loca-tion. You say, \"Wrong date.\" You've done nothing the whole session but date, you see? The ARC break's caused by a wrong date. Well, it reads well and it is a wrong date, and that is the ARC break, but the pc says, \"What date is wrong?\" Well, you think that you now have to redate everything in the session, and so forth. Well, just call off a few of the dates you found and ask if they're right, that's all. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang – do they read as wrong dates? That's one way of doing it. Another way of doing it is \"first half of the session, last half of the session.\" There's a dozen ways of doing it. I'm not going to try to teach you that trick. But you can go ahead and locate it right on down. Well, what is the right date for that thing? One of the ways of doing it is simply get order of magnitude. That makes the pc very happy. That causes it all to go back into place very smoothly. You ran the goal \"to spit.\" You thought it was in the Helatrobus implants; you have a wrong date on the thing all the way along the line. And you find the goal \"to spit\" had the order of magnitude of trillions of trillions of years ago. It's good enough. Not to go on to run the goal \"to spit,\" you understand, but to find out that you'd found the goal \"to spit\" and you want to get it out of your road so you can keep on with the goal \"to spat,\" see? Well, you find the order of magnitude for the goal \"to spit\" and it'll move out of your road."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLE 21 SHSBC-318 – 24.7.63 LEVEL 3 93 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR These are all just shorthand methods of handling the thing.

You are dealing, then, with indicating what that was, and then you are dealing with another factor here, is; was it all right with the pc, does he feel okay now? And that's what you were doing it for in the first place, so you're a ruddy fool not to find it out in the last place. Okay? All right. Well, because you can get away with it on the basis of do an assessment – bang – you say, \"That was it,\" and suddenly your location and indication take place just like that, see? You don't, then, break them down and realize that they are that additional steps. If you wanted to know a complete list of all types of ARC breaks in this whole uni-verse, you would have to find all types of communication that could be partially detected when originated and all the things, then, thereafter that could be misunderstood. And you would have a full list of all ARC breaks. Because we're dealing with the mind, we know the ones that are important, and we know what really causes the explosions and we include those.

Audience: August 7th. August the 7th, AD 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. I'm going to give you a talk today which isn't the official final rundown of R2H but which lays down the fundamentals of the process itself. All right. R2H is one of the most satisfying processes that you ever cared to run. It is ARC breaks taken apart by assessment. It has a tendency to succumb to inexpert handling, and as long as you give a good thought to the fundamentals of the process, you won't run a cropper. But here is one of the more interesting processes. Contained in the... this process is different than any process we've ever had in Dianetics and Scientology. Don't think that you understand this process, because it's quite different. This process will run engrams and secondaries. It has tremendous power. And there-fore it very well may be senior to R3R, in spite of the fact that it's an R2. It very well may be senior. It may run more bank than these. And the only thing it won't run is a GPM. And to run a GPM you have R3M and R3N. Oh, you'd forgotten R3M, huh? You wait till one day you run into a wildcat GPM, man. And you'll thank your stars for R3M, if you know how to do it. Because that's how you got the patterns in the first place, was R3M. That's how you got 3N. That's the papa process. Out of R3M can be borne patterns. 3N presupposes that you've got the pattern. You sit there and let the pc pattycake around and yap around and bark around and give you random items and you don't see them rocket read, and you don't know which end you're going – stand-ing on, and you let him hunt and punch, and keep sitting there at the E-Meter. I think the fash-ion is to sit there at the E-Meter as the auditor and just keep shaking your head, \"No, it didn't rocket read. No, it didn't rocket read,\" until the pc blows his brain out. Of course, he doesn't need a brain. That's – that's a good thing. [laughs] But R3M will do a wildcat GPM – by which we mean a GPM for which you have no pattern. And they exist all over the track, and you'll eventually run into one, inevitably. Don't think you can just go on running the pattern GPMs, because that'd mean your pc was never caught in a bind that was an oddball bind, see?

And the only change that I would make in it today – I wouldn't ask the cross-question on oppose the way it's asked. I wouldn't ask, \"Who or what would oppose...?\" to get your next pair. I would say, \"What does the next pair consist of? Give me the oppterm of the third pair.\" That's the one I would use. I would use something like that. And then \"Who or what would oppose it?\" Yeah. And I'd use that as phraseology. Now 3N, that's a lead-pipe cinch. But 3N has this liability: On some pcs if you don't random list – I don't care if they had the item or not and if it rocket read or not – you don't get tone arm action. And if your tone arm action ceases, just up and random list. Just as easy as that. That gets all of your locks off. The RI with all of its locks – nothing has changed that, don't you see? Even though you've got the item \"absolutably cantankerous,\" why, make him random list. \"Who or what would oppose it?\" And he gives you all kinds of things, and that blows the lock and your TA action may restore. But the big – the big thing that keeps 3N TA action down, of course, is having the wrong date and the wrong pattern. There's nothing like having the wrong date for the GPM and the wrong pattern from the GPM to freeze the tone arm. That's almost certain. Now, if you add to that session a wrong or out itsa line – return line from the pc to the auditor – you of course have got it made. The TA simply goes up to the moon and sticks, and won't go anyplace else. You understand that, don't you? You'd be surprised how often you find a wrong date. And you're running the Helatro-bus implants – so you think – and you go right into the next goal for which you've listed. And then you try to get \"absolutably\" and you can't get a rocket read, and you say, \"What's hap-pened? TA's up and stuck. I've got this next goal 'to be a goof.' It's obviously the next goal in line, only it isn't here.\" Shucks, man, you're probably running a Bear implant. It's probably shot back on the track Lord knows where, because the one thing a GPM won't do is properly time. You can duration a GPM and you can time a GPM and you can get the date of a GPM almost endlessly. Why? Because its primary basis is lousing up time. Those two opposing items fire against each other – sound like time to the pc – produces a no-change situation. So the GPM floats on the track and so it's very difficult to time a GPM. So it's just nothing to get the (quote) \"next GPM in line\" to run, and find out that it isn't at forty-three trillion but at fifteen trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion. Embarrassing. Eventually you go back and start looking for wrong dates on the case, and you finally locate that \"to be a goof\" is not the next Helatrobus GPM but a GPM which exists in the early limbos of nowhere. Now, what's very interesting is an exactly-the-same-looking hill with exactly-the-same-looking parking meters with exactly the same railroad track existed about trillions-four ago, which laid in an entirely different pattern which was far more aberrative than the Hela-trobus implants, and which is basic on the Helatrobus implants. And I told you one day the Helatrobus implants are on the screens they show you in the between-lives. No, that isn't. I've been making that mistake for about ten thousand years. Every time I put this thing up on the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 3 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 97 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR screen, why, it's the wrong implant. They're an early implant, and they had a hill there, unfor-tunately located in the same geographical area as the Helatrobus implants. And it looks to the pc just like the Helatrobus implants, only it isn't. You've got a date error, then, consisting of trillions-four – almost trillions-four, you see – trillion trillion trillion trillion. Your date error. Of course, your TA action will cease. So there's a lot of tricks in running GPMs. GPMs are what require special techniques. They require special techniques. Now, nothing else that I know of requires a special technique, and you might even do away with R3R (this is a very adventurous statement) if you had a perfect R2H. R2H has the potentiality of running engrams and secondaries on the whole track with greater avidity and speed than R3R because it takes apart the restimulated and bypassed charges which exist in the secondaries and engrams. It doesn't run the engram so much as it takes out of it all the bypassed charges and causes, of course, that particular segment to snap back onto track. You probably have not looked at it this way, but you're actually not trying to erase somebody's time track. In the between-lives area they apparently are trying to wipe out your time track so you don't know who you are. Well, we're actually not doing that. You're not in actual fact working with the time track to knock out all the pictures everybody has. That is really not what you're doing. You're trying to take out of the time track the things which pre-vent a person from having his pictures. And after that, you can restore to him the right to have pictures or not to have pictures, as the case may be. You're trying to pull his knowingness high enough up to a point where the individual does not have to have pictures to tell him who he is. Now, you got that? You really – your first target is not to erase somebody's time track. You're liable to think that, because that is what a between-lives screen specializes in. It allegedly is trying to invalidate a person's time track to a point where he doesn't have any, and therefore can't re-member who he is because he has no picture reference. I spoke to you this way about it yes-terday. Well, you're really not, then, trying to erase the whole time track, but there are certain unwanted pictures that he couldn't handle and which he became the effect of. If you take the charge off of those pictures, then pictures become available to the person and he can have them or not have them as the case may be. Now, the pictures which mostly louse up things are the GPMs. That's the real mess-up. But because a between-lives implant has a target of invalidating all of your pictures and there-fore wiping out your identity and memory, because of this you might think – and I'm sure many people who are upset about auditing might think – that you're trying to do this. You realize a Scientologist may be looked at with... askance by certain areas and interests and so forth as though they were between-lives implanters, because they get some whiff of the idea that you're going to erase the whole time track. And they might think we're between-lives im-planters. I don't know what would happen if we... I was toying with this this morning – let me give you a little bit of a laugh out of the side of this – I was thinking of outer-space tactics and strategy. This is an interesting and vast subject, and I have come to the conclusion that the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 4 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 98 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR missing factor in it is communication, and that lack of communication is what causes all the trouble. All right, that's beside the point – that makes, then, very intricate and complicated tactics and strategy, you see? I wondered if, impishly, you couldn't rise above this factor with a few curves of one kind or another by entering societies from within where you did have communication, you see? Well, how would you go about it then? I was sitting there idly speculating about it over my scrambled eggs, and I suddenly realized – still eating, I mean, I'm decadent – [laughter] I suddenly realized that these be-tween-lives blokes – the Marcabians – wouldn't know what to do if they came down here and saw that they had a Marcab headquarters here. We set up their headquarters for them, and you put up their flag, you see, and so forth. And look at the news story. I must have brought this news story on us, or had tele-pathically realized that somebody was going to call on us. The Mirror group was calling on us today: \"So many advances have happened in Dianetics and Scientology in the last three or four years that they had better be covered.\" We agree with them perfectly, but how they will cover them, God knows. That's one of the biggest newspaper chains in England, but they also are the author of the \"Death lesson\" stories, and so we regard them with some suspicion. But there is this pressure all the time of... We are, you see – were putting out fantas-tic – the stories involved here would make what's turned out in university labs and the psychi-atric blokes and this sort of thing – would stagger them, man. You see? I mean, there's more story in any given week in Dianetics and Scientology, you see, than these birds... and the pressure – the pressure of this much data inevitably will produce some sort of a reaction on the surroundings, you see? And you'd find these guys sooner or later are going to realize they missed the boat. Instead of writing about \"that cult,\" they might write about \"those people\" and you'll see them swinging around to this sooner or later. But look at the Marcabian press: \"Here in this prison, in spite of all that has been done to them, they're still loyal to their mother country.\" [laughter] God, you know, that's touching, you know? That's a tear-jerker. And I sort of sat back and I said, \"Well, Ronnie, you're a dan-gerous man.\" [laughter, laughs] But the reaction of Earth population, all of which has come down through that chan-nel, to these symbols might be something approaching the most fabulous thing you ever saw. It might be utter frothing, see? Might produce widespread riot and chaos. I don't know. But it was an interesting thought, anyway, as I think you will agree. Not that we're going to do any-thing desperate like that – at least this afternoon. The point I'm making here – the point I'm making here – is that if you tell the pc that you're going to erase his whole time track, why, he's liable to go into a sort of an anaten pro-pitiate, because this happens to him every sixty or seventy years to such a degree, you see, that he doesn't quite know whether he's coming or going. But you tell him you're going to give him back his pictures and you might entirely change your identity, as far as he's con-cerned, as an auditor."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 5 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 99 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR See, he's got certain pictures that make it impossible for him to get back his pictures. That's the condition he's in. And you're in actual fact trying to return him to Case Level 2. And oddly enough you have to move him to Case Level 2 before you can move him to Case Level 1. That's what's very interesting about it. And your pc – in spite of all your erasure of pictures – is going to wind up with pictures. Man, he's going to have pictures! He takes them all the time, they just aren't available. Some of these pictures aren't too pleasant, some of them aren't too unpleasant, but the point is there is no dearth of pictures. What's the matter with him is that he obsessively makes pictures of everything without discrimination. He's something like a garbage collector, see? Any old picture is good enough, you see? But he gets some of these pictures, like GPMs and jails and things like this from be-tween-lives implants, and they then hit him every time he tries to see his own pictures, you see? And he sees these, and of course they're his pictures, too, but he never realizes this. They're so hostile to his future and his mental health that he disowns them. I've just gone through a phase of disowning my whole track – out of disgust, you know? Had a beautiful case resurgence for about – oh, I don't know, must have lasted for an hour or two. Then of course it collapsed. But what I did was go through the consideration of track, and track became artificially, you see – the artificiality of it became less and less real until the track itself disappeared. And now the track is appearing with total reality, you see, and good knowingness. It's an interesting, through-the-knothole experience. You know, \"I wasn't. I don't know who the hell I am. I...\" You at least got up to the point of where you did-n't need a picture to tell you who you are – you got brave enough to say, \"Well, I just don't know.\" And from that point on you start getting your own track back. That's an interesting point, that this occurs. And perhaps, perhaps, you haven't given enough attention to this, as nobody's trying to wipe out your pictures – they're just trying to pick out those pictures which bar all other pictures and which the individual considers hostile. And when you've done that, why, the individual gets back all of his pictures. It's very simple. The hostile ones can no longer bite. Now you've got a Case Level 2. Now you go after the mechanism which makes it automatic for him to make pictures, and you put this back on power of choice, and of course you've got an OT. And that's the whole scope of processing where it has to do with pictures and bank and knowingness and so forth – they're all wrapped up in that. Well now, you see, instead of erasing pictures, you could go at this another way. You could bring up the individual's confront with regard to pictures to such an extent that he could even face the hostile ones. Ah, that's an interesting approach, too, isn't it? Now, this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach. Instead of erasing the guy's bank, pull him out of it. That's the old exteriorization approach. Well, this is a similar approach, but it's different than either of those approaches, you see, of erasing the pictures or pulling the guy out of the pictures. We're pushing the guy up so that he can disentangle and confront his pictures. In other words, were getting him so he can understand his pictures. And this one works, too, which actually gives you a third route to processing."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 6 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 100 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR So R2H is not just a method of erasing pictures or getting the pc away from his pic-tures, it actually raises the individual's potential in recognizing and owning his pictures and making the pictures better. Now, well-run R2H can make the pictures much better, much prettier, much solider, without them being obsessively solid so that they intimidate the pc with their tremendous so-lidity. Now, that's the important point of it. So, with R2H, you actually are embarked on another philosophy. If you understand this grip on it, it is its own philosophy. Doesn't make the other philosophies invalid, but it embarks on its own private, personal railroad car and says this is a whole philosophy in itself. Of course, it uses the elements and mechanics and other things, but the individualism of R2H is based on this. There have been some new discoveries about this, and they've been put to work in R2H. And let me show you what these things look like.1 Here is a thetan. Now, your first level of life and beingness – your first look at life and beingness – what life and beingness are, exist as potentials or abilities, not as things – and those potentials and abilities consist of A, R and C. You know all about A, R and C: Affinity, Reality and Communication. But think of those things as potentials – not affinity for anything special but the potential of having affin-ity. In other words, you could say, \"What is the potential of the A, R and C of an individual? What is his potential?\" You'd be asking the same thing as \"How alive is he?\" The more alive he is, the more ARC he's capable of – the less alive he is the less ARC he's capable of. That's interesting, isn't it? What do you think of a philosophy that thinks that man is mud? Well, let's take a look at this. ARC. ARC – and probably this could be drawn in different ways – ARC goes out to... and remember that communication with other beings is through matter, energy, space, time and so forth, see? This ARC potential, or ARC with what? What is this ARC with? Commu-nication with, reality about, affinity for, see? What are these things connected up with? Well, if there were just other beings, it'd be a telepathic ball and that would be that. But when you talk to Joe, you're actually talking through MEST to Joe – no matter how you're communicating with Joe – unless your ARC is so much on the ball that you can telepathically communicate. And by the way, your ARC doesn't have to be very high to telepathically communi-cate. That is quite interesting, that man is, at large, below this level of telepathy, but it is paid attention to in some civilizations to the degree that – oh, they set up – you've got a three-way communication. You got a conference with other departments or ship commanders or some-thing – it wouldn't matter whether it's a business or a unit of some kind or another – and you set up a box. You set up a box. And the thetan briefing them briefs them through a box which telepathically retranslates his thought onto an endless banner, and puts it out with sound also. In other words, telepathy sufficiently strong that it can be mechanically reconverted. A device   1 [Editor's note: Starting at this point in the lecture, Ron made diagrams of some of these points. These were issued in HCOB 14 Aug. 63, \"Lecture Graphs,\" which can be found in Technical Bulletins Volume V, page 339.]"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 7 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 101 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR no more difficult than the vocotyper that the IBM keeps trying to make. You talk to the type-writer and it types, you know? Well, this is telepathic vocotyper. I'm not talking to you out of Popular Mechanics. In other words, the telepathy factor is strong. It is something you have to deal with. They have anti-noise campaigns in New York City. Well, I imagine in a boarding-house, a bunch of thetans would have an anti-telepathic campaign, you know? That you stop shouting telepathically all night, you know? Telepathy is a very heavy, hard-hitting force. Some of you will be going through an implant, or something like that, and you'll pick up off the track what you think is your postulate and then suddenly realize it isn't your postu-late, that somebody thought it in your vicinity. You sometimes can pick up the thoughts or fear of some thetan down the line who is also being implanted. This stuff will sometimes kick back into an implant. It's quite valid. There's nothing to worry about with that. Now, this isn't any lecture about telepathy – it gives you an idea of how low ARC can go without disappearing and how high it can also go, because the birds I'm talking about that use telepathy for communication aren't even, by your chart estimates, in very good shape. See, they've had the Helatrobus implants, too, but they just aren't getting their lives wiped out every sixty or seventy years, see? That factor is missing – the only factor of difference be-tween your case and theirs. See, that's the sole difference. Every once in a while, why, their empire gets wiped out, and somebody implants the lot, but that's life. So here's your ARC. And your ARC can go up, then, to pretty high levels. And it depends below a certain level on matter, energy, space and time as its commu-nication media. ARC gets very important after you start dropping away from telepathic communica-tion. Becomes very important – because, you see, it's so much present before then that nobody ever thinks of it. Nobody ever thinks of it at all. You're just not mad at people, and reality is terrific and you know all about it – and communication is good, and your understanding and knowingness are pretty well up, so it wouldn't be something that you worried about at all. But the second you start introducing MEST into communication lines – living with great dependence upon this universe in this universe – then ARC become very important and become the measure of life. Of course, they're there all the way up. But you don't measure them as going out. In fact, I believe nobody would believe they could. Livingness – degree of livingness is meas-ured by ARC. How alive is somebody? It's how much ARC is he capable of. That is the test. Now when you get over here... Let's just rule out telepathy. I'm saying it exists, but it isn't necessary to our proposition at all, and it's a highly in-dividual and odd bit of business, see, that transcends matter, energy, space and time and goes straight to other beings."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 8 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 102 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR So, we would have thetans as a thing to be in ARC with, and then we would have mat-ter, energy, space, time, form, location. Now, you could add to this, you could break these down further, but they are the principal things beyond which there is no breakdown. Possibly in importance it ought to be L and then F. Now, the ARC that this individual has expresses the degree that he can be cause over these. The potential of ARC of the individual, gives you the degree that he can be at cause over thetans, matter, energy, space, time, form and location. The less life he has, the less he is. Now, as a thetan gets more and more solid, he is less and less capable of ARC. That's fairly obvious, isn't it? Why? It isn't that his solidity prevents him from communicating or feeling affinity or that sort of thing – but it's simply an indicator that he must have broken ARC with matter, energy, space, time, form and location, or it wouldn't be piled on him with-out his choice. That's an interesting point, isn't it? He must have had ARC breaks, then, with matter, energy, space, time, form and location. Ah, but how could he have ARC breaks with matter, energy, space, time, form and location without having ARC breaks with other thetans? Well, I think it's probable, and very possible, that he could have. But the truth of the matter is, it was having ARC breaks with other thetans that caused him to start to ARC break with mat-ter, energy, space, time, form and location. Doesn't necessarily follow that way, but normally that would be it. So, as an individual rises up the line – as he rises up the line – he then rises back to-ward direct communication, direct affinity, direct reality on other beings. The less ARC he has, the more matter, energy, space, time, form and location he has to go through in order to communicate to other beings. See you look a little bit dense on that one. Let me give you an idiot's line. Here you have Bill, and here you have space, and here you have Joe. Now, Joe, in order to hear Bill, has to register an air wave which is generated by Bill. So Bill generates an air wave – vibrations – that are received by Joe and are reinter-preted into ARC. So ARC here are converted, and then are converted from matter, energy, space, time to ARC. And you in actual fact have done this cycle. This thetan here communi-cates to those thetans there by going up here, here, see? And actually, they communicate back similarly. See? Get the idea? Once you drop away from telepathy, you enter MEST into the line, and ARC, then, becomes subordinate to MEST. And you eventually get a bunch of knuckleheads implanted up to their ears. Did you ever realize Einstein went through the between-lives area when he kicked the bucket? (Served him right. I wonder if he traveled faster than constant? These bru-tal, gruesome thoughts I have every once in a while.) Now, look at this – man is not mud, but a fellow who isn't alive at all would think only \"mudly.\" He'd have very muddy thinking. He'd come to mudlike conclusions. Therefore, his mental sciences are very mud-like. There are no mental studies which admit – today, that are currently being taught – that admit of the existence of a being. They only admit of the existence of biological combinations of mud resulting in a very muddy result. Psychology textbooks today begin by very carefully"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 9 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 103 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR defining the fact they do not know what a psyche is, and they do not even know if one exists, and they're pretty sure it doesn't – \"But we will now give you the parts of the brain.\" See? What are you dealing with there? You're dealing with somebody who is so far away from other beings that he is no longer talking through MEST, he's talking to MEST. Ding, ding, ding, here comes the wagon! Every once in a while you see some poor little kid that's been knocked in the dome too much, and he'll be out there beating his red wagon. And you yourself in your dippier moments will start talking to something on the mantelpiece. And when you're particularly foggy in the morning and haven't been awakened, you're very often prone to curse your shoes. Well, you may be doing it on another harmonic, because a thetan is always capable of investing things with life. And you're probably doing it because you've \"alived\" the shoe. You see, you're perfectly capable of mocking up a living being and making it talk and walk totally independent of you. Perfectly, perfectly capable of doing that. Used to do it as OTs all the time. So you're capable of investing matter, energy, space and time, and so forth, with life. And then other-determining it, saying it is no longer I, and having it walk around and talk. Now, those – that's a potential that's talked about in Dianetics: Evolution of a Science, that speaks of \"Throgmagog.\" You can always invest something with life, such as a shoe. And you can always pretend that a shoe is alive. But how would you like to be in the kind of a condition where you thought another living being was no more capable of life than a shoe? Let's reverse that, see? Let's get a total reverse on the situation. Let's look at a living being and say that this living being has no life in it. Now, you got some kind of an estimate of how far down scale you can go, and some-body can still sit there and eat breakfast. Got the idea? It's pretty far south. Matter, energy, space, time, form and location – ARC breaks with – cause the dwin-dling spiral of. ARC breaks with other beings, matter, energy, space, time, form and location bring about a deterioration of one's ARC. It never really deteriorates – one just believes it is deteriorated, you see? In other words, you can have an ARC break with MEST, you can have an ARC break with form, you can have an ARC break with locations. It's very common for an animal to have ARC break with locations. A place where an animal has been hurt will be avoided by that animal, very carefully. Now, what in essence does this forecast? That is the basic theory behind R2H. It fore-casts that by clearing up a person's ARC breaks, one then returns to him his ARC potential. Clean up his ARC breaks with matter, he feels better about matter. Clean up his ARC breaks with energy, he'll feel better about energy. Clean up his ARC breaks with space, he feels bet-ter about space. Clean up his ARC breaks with time and he will feel better about time. Clean up his ARC breaks with form and he will feel better about form. Clean up his ARC breaks with location, he feels better about location. Clean up his ARC breaks with other beings and he feels better about other beings. And all the way up the line, of course, his bank – that res-ervoir of ARC breaks – is getting plainer and plainer to him and more and more confrontable to him. Because his – all of his ARC breaks in terms of pictures have responded as the reac-"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 10 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 104 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR tive mind ARC breaks. Because the reactive mind is made, after all, out of images of other beings, matter, energy, space, time, form and location. It's as easy as that. And that consists of the reactive mind. So by cleaning up his ARC breaks with these things, you tend to clean up his ARC breaks with the things he's got pictures of in the reactive mind that he can't confront, and his reactive mind opens up and he can tolerate it and confront it. So R2H considers and conceives that the reactive mind is a reservoir of ARC breaks. That is the basic assumption on which that process hops off. We know that the reactive mind contains images or beliefs in other beings, and with – certainly their images in terms of thought, don't you see? We might, by the way, have put a \"T\" under other beings for \"thought,\" you see, because thought or significance could be included in that – but by just putting up other beings you also have the reflections of other beings, and so that you could omit that. But you know that the reactive mind consists of images of other beings, thoughts of other beings, thoughts of oneself and so forth, plus matter – if you don't believe it's composed of matter, someday run into a ridge, energy – you hear and see the energy flitter-flattering around in the reactive mind all the time and that's what registers on the tone arm, space – every once in a while a guy can't see a thing, and then he suddenly realizes he's looking across too much space to see it. In a picture, it always has space, and lack of space is the main thing that's upsetting in the reactive bank – you can't get away from the lousy thing, see? You can't put space between it and you. Space is the cure for no confront, see? And time – good heav-ens! The thing is not time. If there's any time in the bank, that is remarkable. What you have in the bank is an absence of time – an apparent absence in time in the presence of a totality of time. You've got a nothing where a something is and a something where a nothing is. And that's what makes it reactive. Reactive – remember, that's what the thing is called. That means instantaneous re-sponse, regardless of what time the response is laid in. A=A=A also equals twenty-nine years ago equals a billion years ago equals eight trillion years ago. Before you start inspecting it, they're all the same time. So you got this terrific time identification – you also have space, energy and matter identifications. Now, as far as form is concerned, that's not a terribly upgraded thing. It comes into the field of aesthetics and arts more than anything else. Some people like Picasso, some people don't. Some people like blondes, some people like brunettes. Form, aes-thetics, tastes, that sort of thing. And the reactive bank – the things least confronted in the reactive bank are those forms which one has disliked most. And so, of course, he's got a won-derful close-up stockpile of forms he detests. We're not talking now about income tax forms – we're talking about pleasanter things, like girls and things. Anyhow, as far as location is concerned, if there's anything that is A = A = A in the reactive mind, it's location. When I first collided with this early Helatrobus, I was absolutely sure that it was in exactly the same location – that here, trillions of trillions of trillions of years before, some knucklehead had begun this thing and then somebody had walked back in the vicinity and said, \"Well, this is what you do when you are here,\" and proceeded to give"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 11 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 105 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR the Helatrobus implants. I was sure that was the case. In fact, I only know now intellectually that it is not the same place, because it's the same type of scenery. Given a little similarity of form, and boy, those locations were identical. But what you're doing right now, packing around in your bank and your head and your ridges, planets which are light-years away? Looks to me like that's a very interesting identification of location. In an auditing session this comes off all the time. It happens so often that you don't even think about it. This guy is sitting there, let us say he's running something, and it's some-thing that happened in Australia. Doesn't seem either peculiar to the auditor or the pc that it is being run out in England. There's a 12,500-mile error in location. And you very often see this kind of an odd thing happen: You get the thing all run, and it goes spang! and stays there. It goes to its proper location. It seems to disappear or something. Of course, by moving in time you can make the thing disappear, too. But I've had this odd experience of not being able to run certain engrams because they were too well fixed in their proper location. You practically have to go to Arizona to run it – that's where it hap-pened! You can spot the facsimile, but it's over in Arizona. Well, it couldn't be very aberrative if it fixes its location that smartly, see, because that's the right location. Well now, if everything was on its proper time span, you'd have to move all over time in order to connect with anything, wouldn't you? So the thing must be in its improper time span if you can reach it in present time without yourself moving back trillions of years in time. Well, there's something wrong in the reactive mind with other beingness and other thoughts, with matter, with energy, with space, with time, with form and location – and every-thing that is the matter is they're identified one with another. Two times are identified, two forms are identified, two locations are identified, two spaces are identified, two energies iden-tified, two masses identified. Can also go the other way into what you call a disassociate. And you as Scientologists run less into this thing of disassociation. Someday you may read some Sigmund Freud, and you'll hear all about disassociation because he specialized in this thing, disassociation. It's not anything we've ever talked about to amount to anything, but two things which are the same thing, approximately, look entirely different. In other words, two pictures of the same person at two different locations look like two different people, see? That is an inverse of identifica-tion. Things that should be seen to be similar, are seen to be madly different. You don't pay much attention to this because after a person's done that he's more or less flipped his lid. But you're now going to run into disassociation – and that's why I'm mak-ing a little side comment on it here as we go – because you're going to run into it if you really put in the itsa line. And you're going to wonder what's happening. Because the pc doesn't at first answer the auditing question. You say, \"Have you had any gains in this session?\" And he says, \"The – well, so on – The floor dropped out, and then I had a couple of drinks. And three or four years ago, why, I knew a girl named Mabel.\" And now, in putting in your itsa line, by the rules of the game you shouldn't interrupt him. He may sit there, but he's not finished with that communication. And he'll keep on going and going and going, and you'll see all these disassociates come up. And then all of a sudden,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 12 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 106 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR if you let him go on, he will eventually come up and tell you a gain he has made for the ses-sion. But you're running such violent stuff, you see, on the whole track, that as he passes through the stuff, he's actually going through the session trying to answer your question – and these things are getting in his road – so he says them to you, they tend to as-is, and after that he can finally reach the material necessary to answer your question. Got the idea? But now, if you've put in an itsa line all the way across the line you're going to see dis-association, so you better know what it is. It's simply that two things which should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different. It's the inverse of identification. It's you ought to see a similarity between the question and the answer. \"Have you had a gain for the session?\" \"Yes, I've had a gain for the session. I can see better.\" You get that? Now, that's a similarity, you see? There's the same communication line, and the answer compares to the question that was asked. You get a disassociation this way: \"Have you had a gain in the session?\" \"I had a beer three years ago.\" That's a disassociate. Well, it isn't that the pc isn't answering your question, he's get-ting around to it. And if you're very good at your itsa line, he will eventually wander tortur-ously through and eventually will come up and say, \"Yes, I don't feel like I'll be so thirsty all the time.\" Of course, that is almost a sequitur statement. He will have uttered other statements less sequitur. But as you search the thing out, you would see that he was coming closer and closer to answering your question as he talked. Try that sometime on a full itsa line, and you will be very, very, very pleased with the result. The guy was answering your auditing question. If you let him go on talking, he eventu-ally would have answered your auditing question. He only didn't answer your auditing ques-tion if you cut him off at the point he was disassociating. Then he didn't seem to answer your auditing question. You'll notice his eye is no longer on you again, you'll notice he's still groping, you'll notice he's still fumbling with the bank, when he – as he tells you these things. You'll see this. Well, that's a disassociate. All right. Guy comes up and slugs his mother, thinking that she is about to rob him. Well, he's associated his mother with a burglar. Well, you'd say he's nuts. Well, yeah, true enough. But there are people who are nuts. But that is what that is. So identification isn't the only crime. There's one beyond identification. That's two things that you ought to recognize the similarity between, you see as vastly different. So this whole thing here goes on to an inversion. What you get is a restimulator factor. We knew a girl who had pink hair, see? We knew a girl who had pink hair, so therefore girls who have pink hair aren't to be trusted – therefore nothing pink must be trusted. And we know"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 13 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 107 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR a fellow named \"Pink,\" who brushes his teeth, so we'd better not brush our teeth anymore. Do you follow that torturous line of logic? Well, that is ARC as it goes down scale doesn't just stay as ARC, it goes into an in-verse, because it gets too many things identified, and then it gets things disassociated in some kind of an effort to see some separateness in existence, and eventually starts going into a twis-teroo. So that you will have people who consider good communication shooting people. High level of communication. I had a husky one time that knew what communication was – chewing people up and being bitten. There he was. He was quite a dog. It was very funny, I'll never forget that dog; he was the toughest dog I think I ever saw. I'd walk into the yard after being gone for a long time – you know, a year or two or something like that – and this dog would suddenly see this (quote) \"stranger,\" and he would bare his teeth – he was one of these fantastic malamutes – and he'd bare his teeth, come tearing across the yard, fangs just shooting out of his face in all directions. And I'd pick him up on either side of his jowl and, using his lunge, throw him twenty-five feet. You practice up a little bit with police dogs and things, you can get so you do – it's like dog judo, you know? And he'd go through the air and he'd land. And he'd get up: \"Oh, Ron!\" [laughter, laughs] He knew what communication was! [laughter] So, there's all kinds of wild levels of communication. You get people who tell you what pleasure is – they describe agony. It's very funny. So you get these various inversions. ARC, then, doesn't just decline, it goes and inverts and inverts again and inverts again. And you get a hodgepodge down at the end that nobody can make anything out of. Go down and listen to them in the spinbins and you'll see how far ARC can go, because those people are still alive. They're still alive. How far can ARC go south? All the way – there is no bottom at which one dies, but there's some mighty peculiar things happen on the way down. Beingnesses can die, but the individual – no. Forms can die, but the person actually – no. Memory can die, but not the person who is capable of remembering, you see? Not the person who – who is, you see? He can forget everything. And he's still in that kind of a state. Now, ARC never ceases, so you have no bottom to the process. There are no bottom limits to the process. There is some method of communicating all the way down. It gets down into weird versions of reach and withdraw, as I just described one to you – with the dog. That's a kind of a reach and withdraw. Want to make him happy all day Sunday? Why, chew him up all Saturday night, you know? Big case gain. This is your Tone Scale. As people go up scale, they go up through anger and so forth. It's very funny. I remember one poor psycho in New York – auditors would process her, get her up to anger, and she'd scold her family, and they'd promptly put her in restraints and put her back in the hospital. And then she'd get out, and then the auditors would process her, and she'd get back up to a point where she'd scold her family, and they put her back. And this nonsense just kept going, see? They'd never let her get up through anger. Of course, they'd been knocking"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 14 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 108 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR her in for a long time, and she just never was able to say that she was mad about it. She was never able to do that, so she never recovered. Now, here's a case, then, of a process which if you can get any C in at all and get an improvement of the C or an improvement of the R or an improvement of the A, you get an improvement of the C, an improvement of the R, an improvement of the A, an improvement of the C, an improvement of the R, an improvement of the A – you get the idea? And you just keep raising this triangle – all three corners of this triangle – up, up, up, by the process of running ARC breaks. Now, the basic limit of the process is the communication of the auditing command itself. And you'll be surprised how many interpretations there are of an ARC break. And one might make a criticism of the process by saying, \"Well, look, it has such a special-ized command, 'Recall an ARC break.' Only a Scientologist would know what that meant.\" Well, actually, you're really not asking for an upset, you're not asking for a worry, you're not asking for a time he was concerned, you're not asking for this, you're not asking for that; you're asking for an ARC break. Now, I don't think it'd take you any time to describe to the pc what an ARC break was, and he'd eventually settle in his own head what an ARC break was. He'd be better off if he could understand the communication of this phrase \"ARC break.\" But this is one of the weak spots of the process. But it's not a very weak spot. It's very funny how fast this communicates. You say, \"Life is composed of affinity, re-ality and communication. When one of these breaks down, a person doesn't feel so good about something. Now, an ARC break is a time when affinity, reality or communication have been cut down on a person, have been reduced. That's what an ARC break is.\" It may take the individual three or four days to digest the definition. But the funny part of it is, having digested the definition, he will have made a case gain. I don't really consider it a liability. Now, that process isn't going to be used very broadly, and shotgunish. You can't use it in a co-audit – it's too particularized. So there's the anatomy, however, of what you are trying to do with the process. You are trying to increase the individual's affinity and reality and communication with other thetans and thought, matter, energy, space, time, form and location by picking up those points in time when the individual has suffered a cut or reduction of communication, has suffered from a lowering of reality, or from a reduction of affinity level – period. You don't know – care what he had an ARC break with, because he has to come up quite a ways to recognize ARC breaks with MEST. This is a long way north – good, clean-cut ARC breaks with MEST. In that earlier GPM, about the only thing that was causing a great deal of difficulty in running it was a supreme ARC break with MEST, that it would obey people who would do things like this GPM implant – big ARC break with the fact that MEST obeyed that sort of thing – and an ARC break with the people for debasing and degrading MEST to such a usage and end. The items – to hell with it. See, that wasn't the important thing. The important thing was that anybody who would attempt something like this using MEST, that MEST would obey them, so on. Big ARC break. So there's one even wrapped up in a GPM."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 15 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 109 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The thought that you're trying to get across with your auditing command is you want a time when affinity, reality and communication have been reduced with other beings, matter, energy, space, time, form and locations. And you don't direct what you're going to get the ARC break about or with; that'll all work out more or less automatically. You simply ask for an ARC break. You don't ask \"in this lifetime\"; you don't limit him in time – you hope he'll give you something to at least let you get your teeth into the process and get the process grooved in before you're handling a God-'elp-us engram, but you want from the pc a time of that reduction. That is what you want. And that's all you want. And then you want to find out from the pc what it was. This goes into your form, which is still being worked out – but which is more or less grooved in now. The formal steps of R2H done for good gain on the case are: What, Where, When, and then an assessment, and then cleaning up every line of the assessment when it reads – not going by it. That is a difference. And working the ARC break over until it no longer reads on the meter and the pc feels all right about it, and so forth. Now, the exact way the assessment is done, I'll go over that again – I'd better go a little bit earlier. The exact way What is done, is you take what the pc is willing to tell you without probing. \"What's this ARC break about?\" and he'll give you a résumé of it, very brief usually. Where? Where – that's to help him get the time. See, these are all development of the ARC break so that he can more ably identify it. And then, When? Now, this When gets very impor-tant. He'll have trouble with the Where, but nothing compared to the trouble he may get into with the When. Now, the rule is – you use your meter on these three steps only when the last dog has been hanged. And you don't date nothing with the meter unless the pc is in despair and on the verge of tears about the actual time. And then you chip in, at the last moment, and you say – so on. Something like this: This meter dating is terribly easy. You know, there's a training version – that's to train you to date on a meter. I'm giving you the therapeutic version – this is the way she really rolls. You've been sitting there with the meter in front of you, and the pc's been saying, \"It's 1937 – no, it's 1936 – no, 1937; no, 1936; no, 1937; no, nineteen-thirty... 37, I think it was; 38, 38, maybe it was 38, 39. No, it could have been nineteen thir – [sighs] Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, I just don't know where. I don't know when it was. 1937, 19 – \" He's already admitted he doesn't know and your TA action has slowed down to noth-ing, and so forth. And you've watched 1937 bang every time he said it. You say, \"It's 1937, according to the meter.\" That's your dating step. Got that? Pc may also get into a specialized case sometimes, when if it was in 1937, it would be a terrible ARC break – whereas if it was in 1938 it wouldn't have been a terrible ARC break because something else had happened. So they keep saying it's 1938 when it was 1937. Here's the only other way you go about this: When your tone arm is hung up, you've got a wrong date – and you damn well better find it. Tone arm is hung up, you can't get it moving, everything is going to the devil, and so forth – well, you just better do a scout for wrong dates. \"Did we have a wrong date?\""},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 16 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 110 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR There is a number two that you scout for when the tone arm has stuck. (This is repair-ing it.) Number two is you get in your BMRs on the session or the process, because the pc has, recalled ARC breaks which he has then suppressed and has not given the auditor. That causes a tone arm hang-up. These are the three things that hang up a tone arm. And the pc ARC breaks in session because of an ARC break in the past. It isn't because you've bypassed charge in the session – he's recalled an ARC break in the past, which has given him an ARC break in the session. And when you find that – any one of those three (wrong date, suppressed ARC breaks or an ARC break in the session because of an ARC break in the past) – you've got to remedy the situation. Your tone arm will stick and the process becomes unworkable. But one of those three things exists if your tone arm ceases to move on this. The other one that can stop your tone arm from moving is just too corny. You've missed an assessment, you've missed a meter read, and you haven't got the reason of the by-passed charge. That's just pretty corny. That's under the heading of meter reading, and so forth. The ARC break is always cleaned up to the tremendous satisfaction of the pc, and you're looking on this as something whereby you do an assessment, you say, \"Well, that was the bypassed charge. That's it, thank you. Recall another ARC break.\" That isn't the way it's done. Now, let's go into the last end of this thing. You say to the pc... you're doing an as-sessment – you clear it line by line, just like you used to do old rudiments. If you get a read, you say, \"That read.\" You've got your pat assessment sheet. \"That read.\" You got a new one – there'll probably even be a different – newer ones developed from time to time. I haven't is-sued this latest sheet yet, but it's very comparable to the L1 which you've got – it's just a little better. You see that \"an attitude refused\" does so. That ticks. You didn't go down the whole thing, see? You just said – right off the bat, you said, \"All right. In that ARC break was an attitude refused?\" Tick. You say, \"All right. What attitude was refused?\" And that's the end of your job. It's now up to the itsa. That's your whatsa. And the pc is going to stem and fuss and stew and try to figure out what attitude was refused where. And the only time it won't come off is when those three things I gave you are out – you've had a wrong date in the session; the pc has recalled some ARC breaks and suppressed them; or the pc has had an ARC break in the present time in the session. See? And this system doesn't work if those three are present. And if this system doesn't work, those three are present. So you clean this line up, and it's all up to the pc. \"An attitude refused? I don't think any attitude was refused – attitude was refused...\" And so forth and so on. Says, \"Well, I don't – I don't think there was one.\" What do you know! At this point do you shove it down his throat. You say, \"No? All right, thank you,\" and go to the next line. Well, he can't remember it, so obviously the thing needs shaking up some more. But you leave that mark alongside of that thing, because you're going to come back to it. It was hot once – it's going to be hot again. In other words, it's – that just wasn't ready to be answered, that's the only thing you communicate on that. If he can't find it, and he says he"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 17 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 111 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR can't, that's it. Leave it marked. Don't even say, \"We'll come back to it later.\" Say, \"All right,\" and go on to the next line. Otherwise your needle's going to get so dirty you can't assess. Highly practical consideration. And you say, \"All right. Was that ARC break caused by a communication ignored?\" – you get down to that line, see? – and it goes ping! And you say, \"All right. I have here that a communication was ignored. What communication was ignored?\" \"Oh, well, let's see. It was Bill and me and Pete, and there were three dogs. And a spaceship landed. And the dog barked, and we said to hell with it, but if we'd listened to the dog bark – Yeah. Yeah. We ignored the dog barking. Heh-heh! Yeah.\" Down comes your tone arm. You run by blowdowns. Your whole meter action is by blowdowns – your whole de-termination is by blowdowns. You find an ARC break for which you get no blowdowns, then you haven't got the cause of the ARC break and the pc hasn't remembered anything about the ARC break. But just because you get one blowdown isn't – doesn't mean that the ARC break is gone. At this point you say to the pc, \"How do you feel about that ARC break?\" and watch it on the meter. The question is asked of the pc and watched on the meter. If you get a rough-up of a needle – the slightest reaction of a needle – that ARC break isn't gone. But usually the pc will tell you, \"Well, I don't feel as good about it as I want.\" Then keep on with your assessments. Do you understand? But every time you find one, and you clear one up, then you ask the pc how he feels about it. Pc feels all right and it doesn't bang on the meter – to hell with it, get off of it, man. That's it, that's it. Don't get into a situation where the pc feels perfectly all right about it and you haven't done three-quarters of your assessment sheet, so you just go on doggedly doing the remaining three-quarters of your assessment sheet. You're now trying to find the bypassed charge for an ARC break that doesn't exist. And I can guarantee that you've got the withhold of nothing. The pc hasn't got anything to tell you, so he's going to ARC break. So the other frailty of R2H, much more important than the communication of its audit-ing command, is that an inexpert handling of R2H can bring about an ARC break. Very inter-esting. Every time you find a line, you go through the same song and dance. You find a line, you ask him the question, he answers the question, he's got it all to his satisfaction no matter how long the itsa line is. Don't expect to do many of these a session, man. You probably won't do more than three, four, five a session. But boy, the tone arm action you can milk out of that thing – wham, wham, wham, wham, wham. You can get lots of tone arm action. Why recall ten and get the same tone arm action as you do get recalling four, and still leave the pc with some missed withholds? You get the idea? So you just want tone arm action out of it, not the number of ARC breaks handled. See, you're not interested in the number of ARC breaks handled – just handle those you get well. Every time you find a reason for it, you'll find a tick, and the pc will give you the answer, and you've now got that."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 18 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 112 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, you don't even necessarily test that line again. You can drive a pc berserk. He's now satisfied. He's found it, and so forth. Now, you may suspect, from the doubtful nature and the fact you haven't got a blow-down, that there is another tick on the same line. Just say, \"Well, I'll check this line now. In that ARC break was a communication ignored? You know, that still reads. Do you suppose you had – know any reason why that should still be reading?\" \"Well – no, I don't see why it should be reading. Maybe I protested.\" \"All right. You protested it, that's all. That's all I wanted to know.\" Down to the next line – leave it. You're not going to get anyplace shoving it down the pc's throat. But every now and then you say, \"That line still reads.\" \"Oh, it does? Oh, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The – ha-ha! – it wasn't really the dogs communication. I ignored their communication. They told me not to go anywhere near that place and I did and I ignored their c... Yeah, well, that caused the ARC break with them, because they should have told me more loudly.\" And you'll see your tone arm blow down. You see how it's done? Treat them like end rudiments that you don't care whether they clean up or not, and don't leave an ARC break unless the thing is reading smooth as glass. An ARC break is going to give you blowdowns. Just regard it as a source of getting some blow-downs. And if an ARC break doesn't blow down, you're now going to run into trouble with later ARC breaks. That is the way to forecast trouble. We had ARC break, and then we had another ARC break, and we didn't get any blowdown on either of these ARC breaks. Ohhh! Now, our third ARC break – our chances of our getting a blowdown on that... The next thing you know, you're getting in the mid ruds and the pc's going into an automaticity of suppress-ing ARC breaks, and we've got a sort of a mess on our hands. Why? Because we excited some bypassed charge by asking for the ARC break and then didn't clean the bypassed charge. Now, the whole basic mechanism on which you are operating here is that incidents will blow if the misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out, and that an ARC break is caused by bypassed charge. There is no ARC break without bypassed charge. So therefore you must find the bypassed charge, and if you do, there won't be any ARC break. And it straightens the bank out, and the guy gets oriented in the middle of his bank, and there you are. It's a terribly permissive process. It depends on the itsa line and for that accurate as-sessment, and then, having found what the thing assesses, let the guy run on. And it also depends on not to keep slugging him with assessments for ARC breaks that have cleaned up. It has a frailty. You can get the whole ARC break cleaned up, it doesn't seem hardly worthwhile. And there was a reality rejected, and you got a ping on that – it wasn't a very big ping – and he answered this thing, and we asked for the ARC break, and he didn't have much of an ARC break – but now we went on and did the rest of the assessment. Oh, you've got an ARC break now. Why? You've invalidated the reason which he gave for the ARC break."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALS 19 SHSBC-321 – 7.8.63 LEVEL 3 113 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Takes rather delicate, slippy auditing. But with those reservations, it's absolutely terri-fic. It's a fabulous process. Terribly mild, terribly permissive. I see I've left you hanging on the ropes a little bit – there's probably something you don't understand about the process. But if you just did it like end mid ruds, which you didn't bother to finish if your pc got bright, then you've got it made. You've got it made. And if you monitor its success by the number of blowdowns which you get, you've also got it made. And when it doesn't blow down, start worrying. And if it is blowing down and the TA is moving and so forth, don't worry. Just sit back and ride your luck. Look for trouble when it comes, not before it gets there, because it'll carry you through all the way. Pc wants to talk to you the whole session about one ARC break which is giving you tone arm action from 2 to 6.5, you are an absolute nut not to let him. See? It's the amount of tone arm action you can get in the session, up and down – not the number of ARC breaks you cover. Because the pc you are auditing is in, after all, present time. He is here – all there is of him is here. He isn't barred out of existence by his bank. And if you discharge all of these crossed bypassed charges off of present time, theoretically you could run him all the way to OT without him ever going backtrack to amount to anyone. He just picks up this item and that item and that incident and that incident and this one and straightens them out, and his pictures are getting better and the track is straightening out. And the next thing you know, he's eight feet back of his head saying, \"What do you want done with these between-lives guys?\" Thank you very much.

Only when an auditor real-izes this can he or she begin to obtain uniformly marvellous results everywhere. ___________________ No auditor now needs \"something else\", some odd mechanism to keep pcs in session. Picking up Missed Withholds keeps PCs in session. There is no need for a rough, angry ARC Breaky session. If there is one it is not the fault of the pc. It is the fault of the auditor. The auditor has failed to pick up missed withholds. As of now it is not the pc that sets the tone of the session. It is the auditor.

One does his CCHs in excellent 2 way comm with the pc. One has his TRs, Model Session and E-Meter operation completely perfect. And one follows exact technology.

We are not today beset by variable approaches. The less variable the audi-tor's actions and responses, the greater gain in the pc. It is terribly precise. There is no room for flubs. Further, every pc action has an exact auditor response. And each of these has its own drill by which it can be learned. Auditing today is not an art, either in technology or procedure. It is an exact science. This removes Scientology from every one of the past practices of the mind. Medicine advanced only to the degree that its responses by the practitioner were stan-dardized and the practitioner had a professional attitude toward the public.

Ask the exact question you asked the first time as a final test. The needle must be clean of all instant reaction before you can go on to anything else. It helps the pc if each time the needle twitches, the auditor says, \"That\" or \"There\" quietly but only to help the pc see what is twitching. One doesn't interrupt the pc if he or she is already giving it. This prompting is the only use of latent reads in Scientology – to help the pc spot what reacted in the first place. The commonest questions:  \"In this session, have I missed a withhold on you?\"  \"In this session have I failed to find out something?\"  \"In this session is there something I don't know about you?\" The best beginning rudiments withhold question:  \"Since the last session is there something you have done that I don't know about?\" Prepcheck Zero Questions follow:  \"Has somebody failed to find out about you who should have?\"  \"Has anyone ever failed to find out something about you?\"  \"Is there something I failed to find out about you?\"  \"Have you ever successfully hidden something from an auditor?\"  \"Have you ever done something somebody failed to discover?\"  \"Have you ever evaded discovery in this lifetime?\"  \"Have you ever hidden successfully?\"  \"Has anyone ever failed to locate you?\" (These Zeroes do not produce \"What\" questions until the auditor has located a specific overt.) ___________________ When Prepchecking, when running any process but the CCHs, if any one of the audit-ing circumstances in l to 15 above occurs, ask for missed withholds.

Two way comm consists of asking for what the meter showed, acknowledging what the pc said and checking the meter again with the missed withhold question. If pc says, \"I was mad at my wife,\" as an answer, just ack and check the meter with the missed withhold question. Don't say, \"What was she doing?\" In cleaning missed withholds do not use the Prepcheck system unless you are Prep-checking. And even in Prepchecking, if the zero is not a missed withhold question and you are only checking for missed withholds amid other activities, do it simply as above, by two way comm, not by the Prepcheck system. To get auditing into a state of perfection, to get clearing general, all we have to do is: 1. Know our basics (Axioms, Scales, Codes, the fundamental theory about the thetan and the mind); 2. Know our practical (TRs, Model Session, E-Meter, CCHs, Prepchecking and clearing routines). In actual fact this is not much to ask. For the return is smooth results and a far, far bet-ter world.

Why stir up new ones to be missed when you haven't cleaned up those already missed? In-stead of putting out the fire we pour on gunpowder. Why find more you can then miss when you haven't found those that have been missed. ___________________ Don't be so confounded reasonable about the pc's complaints. Sure, they may all be true but he's complaining only because withholds have been missed. Only then does the pc complain bitterly. ___________________ Whatever else you learn, learn and understand this please. Your auditing future hangs on it. The fate of Scientology hangs on it.

Skill in handling the Itsa Line of the Auditing Cycle. 3. Skill in Assessment. The lists given in HCO Bulletin of July 5, AD13 \"ARC BREAK ASSESSMENTS\", are used, either from that HCO Bulletin or amended. There are several uses for ARC Break Assessments. 1. Cleaning up a session ARC Break. 2. Cleaning up auditing in general. 3. Cleaning up a pc's or student's possible ARC Breaks. 4. Cleaning up a member of the public's possible or actual ARC Breaks. 5. Regular use on a weekly basis on staff or organization members. There are others. Those above are the chief uses. For long time periods the standard 18 button prepcheck is faster, but an ARC Break Assessment is still useful in conjunction with it. The drill is simple. If complicated by adding in R2H material, dating, and other addi-tives, the ARC Break Assessment ceases to work well and may even create more ARC Breaks. If used every time a pc gets in a little trouble in R3N or R3R the ARC Break Assess-ment is being used improperly. In R2H, R3N, R3R sessions it is used only when the pc shows definite signs of an ARC Break. To use it oftener constitutes no auditing."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 2 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 122 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Unnecessary use of an ARC Break Assessment may ARC Break the pc with the As-sessment. The ARC Break Assessment may be repaired by an 18 Button Prepcheck \"On ARC Break Assessments......\". ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT BY STEPS Step One: Select the proper list. This is done by establishing what the pc has been audited on. If more than one type of by-passed charge is suspected, do more than one list. If the ARC Break is not completely cured by one list, do another kind of list. (All lists have been in HCOBs as \"L\".) Step Two: Inform the pc that you are about to assess for any charge that might have been res-timulated or by-passed on his or her case. Do not heavily stress the ARC Break aspect. Right: \"I am going to assess a list to see if any charge has been by-passed on your case.\" Wrong: \"I'm going to try to cure (or assess) your ARC Break.\" Step Three: Without regard to pc's natter, but with quick attention for any cognition the pc may have during assessment as to by-passed charge, assess the list. Phrase the question in regard to the reason for the Assessment – \"In this session......\" \"During this week......\" \"In Scientology......\" etc. Call each line once to see if it gives an instant read. The moment a line gives a reaction, stop, and do Step Four. Step Four: When a line reacts on the needle, say to the pc, \"The line......reacts. What can you tell me about this?\" Step Five: Keep Itsa Line in. Do not cut the pc's line. Do not ask for more than pc has. Let pc flounder around until pc finds the charge asked for in Step Four or says there's no such charge. (If a line reacted because the pc did not understand it, or by protest or decide, make it right with the pc and continue assessing.) Step Six: In a session: If pc found the by-passed charge, ask pc \"How do you feel now?\" If pc says he or she feels OK, cease assessing for ARC Breaks and go back to session actions. If pc says there's no such charge or gets misemotional at Auditor, keep on assessing on down the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 3 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 123 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR list for another active line, or even on to another list until the charge is found which makes pc relax. In a routine ARC Break check (not a session but for a longer period), don't stop as-sessing but keep on going as in Step Five, unless pc's cognition is huge. End of Steps Please notice: This is not R2H. There is no dating. The auditor does not further assist the pc with the meter in any way. If the pc blows up in your face on being given a type of charge, keep going, as you have not yet found the charge. Typical response to wrong charge found: Pc: \"Well of course it's a cut communication! You've been cutting my communication the whole session. You ought to be retreaded... etc.\" Note here that pc's attention is still on auditor. Therefore the correct charge has not been found. If the by-passed charge has been found the pc will relax and look for it, attention on own case. Several by-passed charges can exist and be found on one list. Therefore in cleaning up a week or an intensive or a career (any long period) treat a list like rudiments, cleaning every-thing that reacts. Blow down of the Tone Arm is the meter reaction of having found the correct by-passed charge. Keep doing Steps One to Six until you get a blow down of the Tone Arm. The pc feeling better and being happy about the ARC Break will coincide almost always with a Tone Arm Blow Down. You can, however, undo a session ARC Break Assessment by continuing beyond the pc's cognition of what it is. Continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited, invalidates the pc's cognition and cuts the Itsa Line and may cause a new ARC Break. Rarely, but sometimes, the ARC Break is handled with no TA blow down. PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT The purpose of an ARC Break Assessment is to return the pc into session or into Sci-entology or into an Org or course. By-passed charge can cause the person to blow out of ses-sion, or out of an Org or a course or Scientology. With a session (formerly \"in\"): Is defined as \"interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor\".

With Organization: With organization can be defined as \"interested in org or post and willing to communicate with or about org\". Against organization: Against organiza-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 4 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 124 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR tionness is defined as \"against organization or posts and protesting at org behaviour or existence\". The data about ARC Breaks can be expanded to marriage, companies, jobs, etc. In-deed to all dynamics – With Dynamic, Against Dynamic. What it boils down to is this: There are only two conditions of living, but many shades of grey to each one. These conditions are: 1. Life: Not ARC Broken: Capable of some affinity for, some reality about and some communication with the environment; and 2. Death: ARC Broken: Incapable of affinity for, reality about and communication with the environment. Under One we have those who can disenturbulate themselves and make some progress in life. Under Two we have those who are in such protest that they are stopped and can make little or no progress in life. One, we consider to be in some ARC with existence. Two, we consider to be broken in ARC with existence. In a session or handling the living lightning we handle, people can be hit by a forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them. Their affinity, reality and communication (life force) is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an ARC Break or have an ARC Broken aspect. If they know what charge it is they do not ARC Break or they cease to be ARC Bro-ken. It is the unknown character of the charge that causes it to have such a violent effect on the person. People do not ARC Break on known charge. It is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the ARC Break. This makes life look different (and more understandable). People continuously explain so glibly why they are acting as badly as they are. Whereas, if they really knew, they would not act that way. When the true character of the charge (or many charges as in a full case) is known to the person the ARC Break ceases. How much by-passed charge does it take to make a case? The whole sum of past by-passed charge. This fortunately for the pc is not all of it in constant restimulation. Therefore the per-son stays somewhat in one piece but prey to any restimulation. Auditing selectively restimulates, locates the charge and discharges it (as seen on the action of a moving Tone Arm)."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 5 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 125 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR However, accidental rekindlings of past charge unseen by pc or auditor occur and the pc \"mysteriously\" ARC Breaks. Similarly people in life get restimulated also, but with nobody to locate the charge. Thus Scientologists are lucky. In heavily restimulated circumstances the person goes out of. In such a condition peo-ple want to stop things, cease to act, halt life, and failing this they try to run away. As soon as the actual by-passed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person, up goes Affinity and Reality and Communication and life can be lived. Therefore ARC Breaks are definite, their symptoms are known, their cure is very easy with this understanding and technology. An ARC Break Assessment seeks to locate the charge that served, being hidden, as a whip-hand force on the person. When it is located life returns. Locating the actual by-passed charge is returning life to the person. Therefore, properly handling ARC Breaks can be called, with no exaggeration \"Re-turning Life to the person\". One further word of caution: As experience will quickly tell you, seeking to do any-thing at all with an earlier by-passed charge incident which led to the ARC Break immedi-ately the earlier incident is found will lead to a vast mess. Let the pc talk about it all the pc pleases. But don't otherwise try to run it, date it or seek to find what by-passed charge caused the earlier incident. In assessing for ARC Breaks, keep the Itsa Line in very well and keep the What's It out in every respect except as contained in the above Six Steps. SUMMARY An ARC Break Assessment is simple stuff, so simple people are almost certain to complicate it. It only works when kept simple. Old auditors will see a similarity in an ARC Break Assessment List and old end rudi-ments. They can be handled much the same but only when one is covering a long time period. Otherwise assess only to cognition and drop it. The trouble in ARC Break Assessments comes from additives by the auditor, failure to keep on with additional lists if the type of charge causing the ARC Break isn't found on the first list chosen, failure to read the meter, and failure to keep the Itsa Line in. Doing ARC Break Assessments to cure ARC Breaks is not the same drill as R2H and confusing the two leads to trouble. Handled skillfully as above, ARC Break Assessing cures the great majority of woes of auditing, registraring, training and handling organization.

Worry about being able to cure them with assessment until you have confidence you can. There's nothing so uplifting as that confidence, except perhaps the ability to make any case get TA motion. Don't ever be \"reasonable\" about an ARC Break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one \"because......\".

No auditing is possible in the presence of an ARC Break. These are data like \"Acknowledge the pc\", \"An auditor is one who listens\" etc. These belong in the ABCs of Scientology. PRESENT TIME PROBLEMS When a pc has a PTP and you don't handle it, you get no gain. There will be no rise on a personality test graph. There will be little if any TA action. There will be no gain in the ses-sion. The pc will not make his session goals. Etc. Etc. So you don't audit pcs who have PTPs on anything but the PTPs the pc has. And you don't audit PTPs slowly and forever. There are numerous ways of handling PTPs. One of them is \"What communication have you left incomplete about that problem?\" A few answers and poof! no PTP. Another is \"What doesn't (that person or thing pc is having PTP with) know about you?\" Other versions of overts and withholds can be used. These are all fast PTP handling methods and they get rid of the PTP and you can audit what you started to audit. The mark of a ruddy amateur in auditing is somebody who can always do successful assists but can't do a real session. The secret is: in an assist you are handling the PTP, aren't you? So you never audit over the top of (in the presence of) a PTP! Another circumstance is \"can't get down to real auditing because the pc always has so many PTPs\". This is only a confession that one can't handle a PTP and then get on with the session. One fumbles with the PTPs so badly as an auditor one never really handles the pc's PTPs so of course one never gets on with the job at hand – auditing the pc. The pro, in a real session, just handles the PTPs quickly, gets the pc into session and gets on with whatever should be run. "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"PTPS OVERTS AND ARC BREAKS 2 HCOB 7.9.64 II LEVEL 3 128 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR OVERTS Overts are the other principal source of getting no gain. Here we really can tell the goony birds from the eagles professionally. No pro would think of auditing a pc on other processes in the presence of overts. 1. The Pro would recognize by the pc's natter, or lack of previous gain, that the pc had overts; 2. The Pro would know that if he tried to do something else besides pull these overts, the pc would eventually get critical of the auditor; and 3. The Pro wouldn't (a) fail to pull the real overts or (b) ARC Break the pc in getting the overts off. If one gets \"reasonable\" about the pc's condition and starts agreeing with the motiva-tors (\"look at all the bad things they did to me\"), thus ignoring the overts, that's the end of gains for that pc with that auditor. If one is clumsy in recognizing overts, if one fails to get the pc to give them up, if one fails to properly acknowledge the overt when given, or if one demands overts that aren't there, overt pulling becomes a howling mess. Because, then, getting the pc overts off is a tricky business auditors sometimes become shy of doing it. And fail as auditors. Sometimes pcs who have big overts become highly critical of the auditor and get in a lot of snide comments about the auditor. If the overt causing it is not pulled the pc will get no gains and may even get ARC broken. If the auditor doesn't realize that such natter always indicates a real overt, when pcs do it, eventually over the years it makes an auditor shy of au-diting. Auditors buy \"critical thoughts\" the pc \"has had\" as real overts, whereas a critical thought is a symptom of an overt, not the overt itself. Under these critical thoughts a real overt lies undetected. Also, I love these pcs who \"have to get off a withhold about you. Last night Jim said you were awful......\" An experienced auditor closes the right eye slightly, cocks his head a bit to the left and says, \"What have you been doing to me I haven't known about?\" \"I thought....\" begins the pc. \"The question is\", says the old pro, \"What have you been doing to me that I don't know about. The word is doing. \" And off comes the overt like \"I've been get-ting audited by Bessy Squirrel between sessions in the Coffee Shop.\" Well, some auditors are so \"reasonable\" they never really learn the mechanism and go on getting criticized and getting no gains on pcs and all that. I once heard an auditor say \"Of course he was critical of me. What he said was true. I'd been doing a terrible job.\" The moral of this story is contained in the fact that this auditor's pc died. A rare thing but a true one. The pc had terrible overts on Scientology and the auditor, yet this auditor was so \"reasonable\" those overts were never cleaned up. And that was the end of those auditing sessions."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"PTPS OVERTS AND ARC BREAKS 3 HCOB 7.9.64 II LEVEL 3 129 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR It's almost never that drastic, but if an auditor won't pull overts, well auditing gets pretty unpleasant and pretty pointless too. A lack of grasp of the overt-motivator sequence (when somebody has committed an overt, he or she has to claim the existence of motivators – the Ded-Dedex version of Dianet-ics – or simply when one has a motivator he is liable to hang himself by committing an overt) puts an auditor at a very bad disadvantage. Howling pcs and no pc wins. ARC BREAKS You can't audit an ARC Break. In fact you must never audit in the presence of one. Auditing below Level III, the best thing to do is find an auditor who can do ARC Break As-sessments. At Level III and above, do an ARC Break Assessment on the pc. An ARC Break As-sessment consists of reading an ARC Break list appropriate to the activity to the pc on a meter and doing nothing but locate and then indicate the charges found by telling the pc what regis-tered on the needle. That isn't auditing because it doesn't use the auditing comm cycle. You don't ack what the pc says, you don't ask the pc what it is. You don't comm. You assess the list between you and the meter, same as no pc there. Then you find what reads and-you tell the pc. And that's all. A by-passed charge assessment is auditing because you clean every tick of the needle on the list being assessed. The pc is acked, the pc is permitted to Itsa and give his opinions. But you never do a by-passed charge assessment on an ARC Broken pc. You do an ARC Break Assessment as per the paragraph above this one. These two different activities unfortunately have the word \"assessment\" in common and they use the same list. Therefore some students confuse them. To do so is sudden death. You can really clobber a pc by doing a by-passed charge assessment on an ARC Bro-ken pc. And also you can ARC Break a pc by doing an ARC Break Assessment on a pc who isn't (or has ceased to be) ARC Broken. So unless you have these two separate and different actions – the ARC Break Assess-ment and the by-passed charge assessment – clearly understood and can do both of them well and never get too rattled to know which one to use, you can get into plenty of trouble as an auditor. Only auditing over the top of an ARC Break can reduce a graph, hang the pc up in ses-sions or worsen his case. So it's the next to the most serious blunder that an auditor can make. (The most serious error is to deny assistance either by not trying to get the pc into session or not using Scientology at all.) Auditing an ARC Broken pc and never realizing it can lead to very serious trouble for the auditor and will worsen the pc's case – the only thing that will."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"PTPS OVERTS AND ARC BREAKS 4 HCOB 7.9.64 II LEVEL 3 130 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR SUMMARY It is elementary auditing knowledge that no gains occur in the presence of PTPs or overts and that cases worsen when audited over the top of an ARC Break. There aren't \"lots more conditions that can exist\". Given an auditing session there are only these three barriers to auditing. When you do Clay Table auditing or any other kind of auditing the rules all still apply. A change of process or routine doesn't change the rules. In doing Clay Table auditing off a meter one still handles the elements of a session. One puts the pc on the meter to start off and checks for PTPs, overts, withholds, even ARC Breaks, handles them quickly and then goes into the body of the session. Much the same as the oldest model session rudiments. One doesn't use Mid Ruds or buttons to get started. One just knows the things that mustn't be there (PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks) and checks for them, handles if found and goes on with the main session activity. If a PTP or an overt or an ARC Break shows up one handles them, putting the pc back on the meter if necessary. When they are handled, the pc is put back into the main activity of the session. It's true of any auditing that gets done. It isn't likely to alter and actually no new data is likely to be found that controverts any of this. The phenomena will still be the same phenom-ena as long as there are pcs. Ways of handling may change but not these basic principles. They're with the auditor in every session ever to be run. So one might as well stay alert to them and be continuously expert in handling them. They are the only big reefs on which an auditing session can go up high and dry, so their existence, causes and cures are of the greatest possible importance to the skilled auditor. L.

I've found the basis of ARC Breaks! As you know, only a PTP (Present Time Problem) can hold a graph unchanging and only an ARC Break can lower one. Therefore the Anatomy of an ARC Break is more vital to know, as it can worsen, than the anatomy of a PTP. But both are very important and with the overt act and misunderstood words in study form the vital four things anyone should know in auditing Pcs. The average student has a hard time getting rid of ARC Breaks in others, mostly be-cause he never really finds the ARC Break. One Auditor was sure a Pc had been ARC Broken by \"the last few inches of a lecture tape\" and was madly calling Washington to borrow the tape so the poor Pc could \"listen to it again to cure his ARC Break\"! Well I don't mind being cause, but my tape never ARC Broke the Pc. The Auditor just didn't locate the Charge. The whole trick is to keep cleaning up the ARC Break until the Pc is happy again and then quit. When you find it, that's it. You don't find it and still have an ARC Broken Pc! No, the terribly simple truth is that 1. The Pc is ARC Broken because something happened. 2. The Pc will continue to be ARC Broken until the thing is found. 3. The ARC Break will vanish magically when the source is found. Finding the ARC Break and indicating it clears the ARC Break. If it doesn't clear on what you find, then you haven't found it! You must not continue to run a Pc on some process when the Pc is ARC Broken. You must find the ARC Break and clear it. The Pc will go into a sad effect if you don't find the ARC Break but instead, continue the process. If you think you have found the ARC Break (and haven't) and then go on audit-ing, the Pc will go into a sad effect. ARC Broken Pcs are easy to identify. They gloom and mis-emote. They criticise and snarl. Sometimes they scream. They blow, they refuse auditing."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS 2 HCOB 29.3.65 LEVEL 3 132 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR If you can read a lighted neon sign at 10 feet on a dark night, you can detect a Pc who has an ARC Break. Some Auditors can detect them sooner than others. I can see one coming in a Pc 1½ hours of auditing before the Pc starts to get misemotional in earnest. Some new-comer in the business might not detect one until the Pc wraps a chair around the auditor's head. As I say, the ability to perceive one varies. The better you are the sooner you see one. If an auditor's Pc isn't bright and happy, there's an ARC Break there with life or the bank or the session. The thing to do is find it and clean it up. And now all is revealed: This is what makes an ARC Break occur: An ARC break occurs on a generality or a not there. THE GENERALITY Example of a Generality \"They say you are cold-hearted.\" \"Everybody thinks you are too young.\" \"The People Versus Sam Jones.\" \"The will of the masses.\" CASE MANIFESTATION Example: Little boy screaming in rage when he makes a mistake in drawing. Auditor observes little boy is upset. Auditor: \"What are you upset about?\" Little Boy: (howling) \"My drawing is no good!\" Auditor: \"Who said your drawing is no good?\" Little Boy: (crying) \"The teachers at school (plural).\" Auditor: \"What teacher (singular)?\" Little Boy: (sobbing) \"Not the teachers, the other children (plural)!\" Auditor: \"Which one of the other children?\" Little Boy: (suddenly quiet) \"Sammy.\" Auditor: \"How do you feel now?\" Little Boy: (cheerfully) \"Can I have some ice cream?\" THE FORMULA 1. Ask what the Pc is upset about. 2. Ask who thought so. 3. Repeat the generality the Pc used and 4. Ask for the singular."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS 3 HCOB 29.3.65 LEVEL 3 133 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR 5. Keep 3 and 4 going until the Pc is happy. As it's a near Q and A it should be awfully easy. They name prunes, you say what prune is prunes. RESULT It's quite magical done barehanded or on a meter. ERRORS You can miss in English sometimes on you. The Pc says you are mean. We have no plural or singular signal in the word you. Therefore a statement that \"You are ARC Breaking me\" or \"You are mean\" may not mean, as an egocentric auditor may take it, the auditor but you may be being used as The Whole World. The above formula holds 1 to 5. Just find out \"Which person is meant by the word you?\" Our old \"Look at me, who am I?\" was not too wrong. So next time your Pc says, \"The Instructors are mean,\" don't be goofy enough to indi-cate the charge with \"OK, you are ARC Broken because the Instructors are mean.\" And then be amazed when the ARC Break continues. You didn't find out \"What Instructor is Instruc-tors?\" If you ask a bit further you'll find it probably wasn't \"the Instructors\" but somebody else. And that somebody will be a unit, not a group. A less workable but interesting approach is \"Who uses the word 'everybody' fre-quently?\" It's of interest only because \"everybody\" makes a dispersal which the Pc can't see through. It will take quite a while sometimes for a Pc to spot such a person! How many people have died heartbroken because \"they\" were mean to him. And it was just one vicious being who had been blown up to \"they\". The Not There is also a generality because it can be anywhere. But it is a special case. When something becomes unlocatable it can cause an ARC Break. The cure for this one is to find out what's gone. If you see somebody with a cold, ask \"Who's gone?\" and you'll be amazed at the re-covery if you pursue the matter. One concludes it's less the loss than not knowing where something has gotten to, mak-ing a one into a generality. The common response to sudden loss is to feel everything is gone or going. This is the state of anxiety explained. The beaten and downtrodden respond well on this (when brought up through normal levels to the Level of Remedies). A very sneaky question is \"Who (or what) was everything to you?\" But use it sparingly. The Pc will go whole track like a flash if overworked."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS 4 HCOB 29.3.65 LEVEL 3 134 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Remarkably (at this late date to find it!) that's why he rather fancies his pictures!

LEVEL VI ARC BREAKS Of course, there's nothing wrong really with a thetan but his reactive bank. He can re-cover from the rest. And his reactive bank is full of generalities which explains the hard ARC Breaks of Level VI. But don't tamper with Level VI if the Pc belongs at II. You can get enough locks off any day from normal life to cure the ARC Breaks you'll encounter getting up to VI. Main thing to know is: An ARC break occurs because of a generality or a not there. Fortunately it doesn't always occur. Only sometimes. And when it does: Find the sin-gular form of the generality. In Admin particularly you save more executives that way.

As some auditors dislike pulling withholds (because they run into pcs who use it to carve the auditor up such as \"I have a withhold that everybody thinks you are awful –––\") it is easier to confront the idea that a pc has an ARC Break than the idea that the pc has a with-hold. In case of doubt one meter checks on a withhold to see if it is non-existent (\"Am I de-manding a withhold you haven't got?\"). If this is the case the TA will blow down. If it isn't the case the needle and TA remain unchanged. If the pc's nattery or ARC Breaky condition con-tinues despite finding by-passed charge, then of course it is obviously a withhold. ARC Break finding does work. When the pc doesn't change despite skillful ARC Break handling, locating and indicating, it was a withhold in the first place. The hardest pc to handle is the missed withhold pc. They ARC Break but you can't get the pc out of it. The answer is, the pc had a withhold all the time that is at the bottom of all these ARC Breaks. Scientology auditing does not leave the pc in poor condition unless one goofs on ARC Breaks. ARC Breaks occur most frequently on people with missed withholds. Therefore if a pc can't be patched up easily or won't stay patched up on ARC Breaks, there must be basic withholds on the case. One then works hard on withholds with any and all the tools that we've got. ARC Breaks don't cause blows. Missed withholds do. When you won't hear what the pc is saying, then you have made him have a withhold and it responds as a missed withhold. In short, the bottom of ARC Breaks is a missed withhold. But an anti-social act done and then withheld sets the pc up to become \"an ARC Breaky pc\". It isn't an accurate remark really since one has a pc with withholds who on being audited ARC Breaks easily. So the accurate statement is \"the pc is a withholdy type pc that ARC Breaks a lot\". Now that type exists. And they sure have lots of subsequent ARC Breaks and are regularly being patched up."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND MISSED WITHHOLDS 2 HCOB 4.4.65 LEVEL 3 136 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR If you have a pc, then, who seems to have a lot of ARC Breaks, the pc is a \"withholdy pc\" not an \"ARC Breaky pc\". Any auditor miss causes a pc blow-up. The auditor by calling this pc an \"ARC Breaky pc\" is not using a description which leads to a resolution of the case as thousands of ARC Break assessments leave the case still liable to ARC Break. If you call such a case that ARC Breaks a lot a \"withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot\" then you can solve the case. For all you have to do is work on withholds. The actual way to handle a \"withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot\" after you've cooled off the last of his many ARC Breaks is: 1. Get the pc to look at what's going on with his sessions. 2. Get the pc in comm. 3. Get the pc to look at what's really bugging him. 4. Get the pc's willingness to give withholds up on a gradient. 5. Bring the pc to an understanding of what he's doing. 6. Get the pc's purpose in being audited in plain view to him or her. Those are of course the names of the first six grades. However, low down, these six things are all crushed together and you could really pursue that cycle in one session just to get the pc up a bit without even touching the next grade up. Whenever I see a sour-faced person who has been \"trained\" or is being \"trained\" I know one thing – there goes a pc with lots of withholds. I also know, there is a pc who ARC Breaks a lot in session. And I also know his co-auditor is weak and flabby as an auditor. And I also know his auditing supervisor doesn't shove the student auditor into doing the process correctly. One sour-faced student, one glance and I know all the above things, bang! So why can't somebody else notice it? Auditing is a pleasure. But not when an auditor can't tell a withhold from an ARC Break and doesn't know that continual ARC Breaks are caused by missed withholds on the bottom of the chain. I never miss on this. Why should you? The only case that will really \"bug you\" is the continuous overt case. Here's one that commits anti-social acts daily during auditing. He's a nut. He'll never get better, case always hangs up. Unless you treat his continual overts as a solution to a PTP. And find what PTP he's trying to solve with these crazy overt acts. You see, we can even solve that case. But, don't go believing Scientology doesn't work when it meets an unchanging or con-tinually misemotional pc.

While there is considerably more data on these subjects in the Technical Volumes and on the Class VIII tapes, this issue sets forth the key data and presents the methods for rehab-bing in one consolidated issue for the first time. DEFINITIONS \"Rehab\" is a shortened version of \"rehabilitate\", which means: to restore to a former capacity or condition. \"Release\" is the term for what occurs when a person separates from his reactive mind or some part of it or when he separates from some mass. In Scientology we use the term \"rehabilitate\" most commonly to mean: restoring a state of release previously attained by the pc. RELEASES Scientology processes can be categorized as follows:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 2 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 142 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR 1. Those processes which direct the preclear's attention to the mental masses in his reac-tive mind in order to enable him to separate out from them. 2. Those processes which are aimed at increasing the preclear's abilities. Both types of processes lead to release Both types of processes are necessary to bring a person up the levels of awareness and up each step of the Grade Chart to OT. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that's a release. When you erase the mass and leave the thetan there, that's an erasure. Erasure is a dif-ferent phenomenon from release. In auditing, when the pc spots something in the bank he disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. That is a release. Or, when the pc becomes free of a difficulty or per-sonal \"block\" or inability stemming from the mind, that is a release. A person can and does go release many times in the course of his auditing. He may go release many times while being run on the processes of a Grade before he attains the ability of that Grade. The Grades Releases are covered fully in HCOB 22 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, NEW LEVELS OP RELEASE, in HCOB 27 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, ADDITIONAL DATA, and on the Grade Chart itself. Further data can be found in HCO PL 23 OCT 80 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES. Oddly enough, the idea of release can translate through to the pc to include releases in life, too. For example, a person was in prison and they let him out. This might well read as a release on a pc being asked about former releases, and it would be okay. One sees how this can be in view of the basic concept of release, e.g. when you take a person out of a mass - any mass - that is a release. So \"release\" points in life such as the above are valid, and, though one doesn't ask for them specifically, should they come up during a former release rehab on a pc, they are to be handled. However, the auditor must understand that such a release in no way means that a per-son is a release on a process or on one of the Grades! Prison might be a problem to someone but getting out doesn't make him a Problems Release! Don't misconstrue one for the other and declare someone a Grades Release at some Level because he had a release in life. Actually one can go release on any subject and theoretically one could rehab any re-lease a pc had. The exact subjects a pc must be released on in order to make it up the Bridge are those listed on the Grade Chart. Occasionally it is necessary to rehab a win or state at-tained by the pc which is not specifically mentioned on the Grade Chart. But, again, one would not mistake it for a Grade Chart Release. (Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, \"STATES\", AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.) "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 3 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 143 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR OVERRUN Overrun occurs when the thetan considers that something has gone on too long or happened too often. When the person begins to feel this way about something, he begins to protest it and try to stop it. This tends to make things more solid and builds up mass in the mind. People who are very intent on stopping things in life appear solid and massy. In auditing, an overrun means the preclear came out of the bank and then went back into it again. For instance, the pc released on the process \"From where could you communi-cate to your dog?\" but the auditor continued the process after he should have indicated the F/N and gone on to something else. By continuing, the auditor throws the pc back into the bank again and wrecks the release state. An overrun in auditing can also mean that the pc gained an ability to do something and the auditor continued the process or grade past the point where the ability had been regained. By pushing on, the ability can get invalidated. In both cases the person's attention goes back onto his case and hangs up. The person can feel the mass of it again. In life when something is overrun, the person begins to accumulate protests and upsets about the thing or activity he feels overrun on. His attention tends to stick on it. This also builds up mass. An overrun, whether it occurred in auditing or in life, is handled in auditing using the tech of rehabbing. THEORY OF REHABBING The theory of rehabs is based on the following stable datum: This particular universe is built by twos. One cannot know a datum unless there is another datum to compare it to. This fact can also be seen to operate in the field of the mind. (Ref: Logic 8, SCIENTOLOGY 0-8, THE BOOK OF BASICS.) Thus, in rehabbing a release point one is getting the pc to view one datum (a time of release from a mass) as compared to another datum (a time he was stuck in the mass) and when this is done the pc moves out of the mass once again. That is the simplicity of what oc-curs. To expand on the mechanics involved, it can be described as follows: When a person has been overrun, he is trying to stop the mass or thing he has gone back into. The other side to that is the time or times he was released from it. These are oppo-sites: the \"plus\" of the mass and the \"minus\" of the time the mass wasn't there. This idea of opposites tends to hang things up. The idea then behind handling an overrun is to unstabilize this plus-minus pair by get-ting the pc to clearly spot the \"minus\" side of it. When this happens, the \"plus\" side goes."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 4 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 144 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR When the pc's attention is directed to the points when he was released from the mass he ceases to try and stop the mass and it goes. The release state then rehabilitates. So the mechanism being worked with here is that the mass connected with an overrun can be knocked out by spotting the release connected with it. It is a very simple principle which has important uses in auditing. TYPES OF REHABS There are three types of rehab procedures for use in rehabbing releases or states. The earliest is Rehab 1965 Style. This is followed by Rehab by Counting which I de-veloped in 1968. Later on, in 1971, I developed the Date/Locate procedure. Each of the three has its uses depending on what it is one is trying to rehab. One does a Rehab '65 Style when one is rehabbing a specific point, such as the point a specific former release was attained. A Rehab by Counting is done when, for instance, a process appears overrun in session, or when one is rehabbing \"releases\" such as on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, or at any time something is likely to have a number of releases connected with it. A Date/Locate is used when one wants to directly spot the exact time and location of a specific incident and thus blow the mass connected with it. (Date/Locate is used on the last step of the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive to determine the exact point a person went Clear. The Date/Locate procedure has many other uses in other types of auditing as well, but in re-habbing its most frequent use is on the DCSI, per the above.) INDOCTRINATING THE PC The procedure for doing a rehab is quite simple when one understands the theory of it and makes sure the pc does, too. Before doing any rehab or Date/Locate, clear the terms and procedure with the pc so that he understands. Use the data in this issue to clear the theory of release and rehabs, and to clear the procedure to be used – Rehab '65 Style or Rehab by Counting. Use data in HCOB 15 NOV 78, DATING AND LOCATING, in indoctrinating the pc to the Date/Locate theory and pro-cedure. All the terms and steps of the procedure are covered in that issue. The better the pc understands what is going on the smoother it will go. Do not skimp this indoctrination step. Any auditing efforts can go up in smoke if one tries to audit the pc over misunderstoods. 1. Clear the terms below with the pc, using demos and consulting the pc's understanding. A. Release: 1. A person who has been able to back out of his bank. The bank is still there but the person isn't sunk into it with all its somatics and depressions. 2. When the pc disconnects from the mass in his bank, that is a release. When"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 5 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 145 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR this happens, the pc disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. 3. A person who has become free of a difficulty or personal \"block\" stemming from the mind. 4. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that is a release. B. Rehabilitate: to restore to a former capacity or condition. In auditing, this means to do the series of actions in session which result in regaining a state of release for the pc. Abbreviated \"Rehab\". C. Key-In: the action of some part of the reactive mind moving in on the person. A Key-in occurs when the environment around the awake but fatigued or dis-tressed individual is similar to some part of the reactive mind. Since the reac-tive mind operates on the equation A=A=A, the present time environment be-comes identified with the contents of a particular portion of the bank and so it activates and exerts its influence on the person. D. Key-Out: the action of the reactive mind or some portion of it dropping out of restimulation on the pc. E. Grade: a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. (See the Classification Gradation and Awareness Chart for the complete explanation of the different grades.) Auditing processes result in a release. The auditing processes of a Grade, when done, result in the pc attaining the specific ability of that Grade. 2. Clear \"overrun\" with the pc, using the section \"Overrun\" in this issue. Have the pc demo an overrun in auditing and in life. 3. Clear with the pc the stable datum on which rehabbing is based (under \"Theory of Re-habbing\" in this issue). Have him demo each (using a demo kit) as needed to ensure he's got it. 4. Using a demo kit, clear with the pc the simple mechanics of rehabbing (spotting the release connected with a mass). Ref: Section on \"Theory of Rehabbing\" in this issue. 5. Go over with the pc each step of the procedure to be used (Rehab '65 Style or Rehab by Counting or Date/Locate, if needed). Clear any words regarding these procedures, which have not previously been cleared in the pc's auditing. Use a demo kit as needed. 6. Cover meter dating with the pc so he understands its purpose and how it is done. Use E-Meter Drill 22 to explain it. Ensure the pc understands you don't want him depend-ent on the meter but that you will help him, using the meter, if necessary. (Ref: HCOB 4 AUG 63, ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR.) Be sure the pc understands the simple basics of rehabbing with no questions or confu-sions or misunderstood terms, before you begin any rehab. Additionally, when doing any type of rehab session it is important to ensure the pc's ruds are in before starting."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 6 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 146 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR REHAB PROCEDURES PROCEDURE FOR REHAB '65 STYLE I. Determine what is going to be rehabbed. This might be a release on a process, some other type of former release, the ability of a Grade attained or some other state achieved by the pc. A. For a process, use the question: \"Were you released on _____ (Process)?\". a. Clear the question on the pc first, omitting the name of the actual process. b. Then check the question (including the name of the actual process) on the meter. c. If no read on the question, check Suppress and Invalidate. d. If the pc says he was released but no read on the question, check Suppress or In-validate. If pc is assertive or protesty about having been released, check Asserted and/or Protest. B. For rehabbing a state: One would simply orient the pc to the state (having already verified that it is a valid state and having C/S instructions to do so) and proceed with the rehab steps. (Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, \"STATES\", AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.) (Exception: The State of Clear would only be handled on a full Dianetic Clear Special Intensive. Any other states which might come up on that Intensive would, if valid, be handled routinely by the trained DCSI auditor, per DCSI procedure.) C. Rehabbing Grades: Data on using '65 Style to rehab Grades is covered in the \"Rehab-bing Grades\" section of this issue. D. Rehabbing Former Releases: Data on using '65 Style to rehab former releases is cov-ered in the \"Rehabbing Former Releases\" section of this issue. II. When it has been determined that the pc was released on the process, the Ability Gained for a Grade had been attained or the state being rehabbed has been established, one pro-ceeds by first finding out when this occurred, per Step 1 below, and then continues with remainder of the rehab steps: 1. Loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred. (Note: This may have to be meter dated if the pc is unable to locate when it happened. For this reason, any auditor doing rehabs must be adept at E-Meter Drill 22, \"E-Meter Hidden Date, This Life\". Also, see HCOB 2 AUG 65, RELEASE GOOFS, Point 4, Meter Mis-use.) You simply want to determine when. The pc may give you the year, month and day of the release, he may describe it by significance (\"The moment I thought to myself,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 7 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 147 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR 'That's why I wrecked the car!\"'), or he may spot when it occurred by location (\"It oc-curred when I was in session for the first time with Joe in his new auditing room.\"). The reference for this is: HCOB 8 JUN AD13, THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUN-NING BY CHAINS, BULLETIN 2, HANDLING THE TIME TRACK. Note: The indicators which tell you that the release or state is rehabilitated are an F/N on the meter and VGIs on the pc. If this occurs on any step of the rehab procedure, simply indi-cate the F/N and gently end off on that rehab action. 2. Get in Suppress, Invalidate buttons on the session or time. 3. Get in \"unacknowledged\" or \"what was unacknowledged\". 4. Indicate anything found to the pc as By-Passed Charge. 5. Find the Key-in that was Keyed-out in that time or session. (The person went release because something keyed out in that time or session.) 6. When this is found and recognized by the pc, the pc will recover the release and the process, Grade, state, etc. will be rehabilitated. 7. If this does not happen, find out what keyed in (at some point after the release) that ended the release state and get it loosely located as in Step 1. 8. Repeat Steps 2 to 6 on it.* 9. Conditional: If, when the above is done, the release still has not rehabbed, get the pc to Itsa alternately the point of key-out when the pc released and the point of key-in af-terwards, one after the other. (Use the meter to guide the pc, if necessary, by asking \"What's that?\" when you see a fall on the needle.) This isn't an alternate/repetitive question - \"What was keyed out then?\"/\"What was keyed in then?\" - but a use of these and any such wording, one after the other, as Itsa invitations until the release is re-gained and F/N, VGIs obtained. CHECKING FOR EPs If one wants to check if the pc has reached the EP of a process, or if one suspects that the EP may have been reached out of session, one can check \"Did anything occur?\" per HCOB 5 DEC 71 IMPORTANT END PHENOMENAS and if the EP has been reached it can be re-habbed using the Rehab '65 Style. One would never ask leading questions or feed the EP to the pc in such situations. Simply check if anything occurred. PROCEDURE FOR REHAB BY COUNTING 1. Establish there is something to be rehabbed. (Naturally, you can't rehab a release if there isn't one. You couldn't rehab a process if the pc had never run it.)   * Editor's note: Obviously a mistake. Steps 2 to 4 are meant."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 8 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 148 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The question would vary depending on the situation being rehabbed. a. If it looks (due to overrun phenomena) as though a process has been overrun in session, one could ask, \"Have we by-passed a release point on this process?\". b. For rehabbing releases on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, one would check, \"Did you go release on ______ (drug)?\" 2. If there is a release the question should read. If no read, check Suppress and Invali-date. There must be a read either on checking the question or on the pc's origination that there is a release there, before proceeding with the rehab. 3. If no read but the pc says he was released, check if the release has been Suppressed or Invalidated. If the pc is asserting release or being protesty about it, check Asserted and/or Protest. 4. Sometimes the pc will F/N simply on spotting he was released. This can be quite common especially when the pc's ruds are in and the auditor's TRs are smooth. An F/N with good indicators tells you that the rehab is complete and the mass has keyed out or the state has been rehabilitated. 5. If no F/N on spotting there was a release, ask the pc how many times he was released. Get him to count the number of times and when he gets it he will F/N. 6. Sometimes the pc can't get the number and the auditor can then use the meter to count how many times and get it that way. He can ask the pc if he has some idea of ap-proximate number of times and then use \"More than ______?\"/\"Less than _____?\". He uses the tech of E-Meter Drill 22 to establish the general range of number of times. He would then count to the pc. (\"Were you released on (______) 10 times? 11, 12?\", etc.) The correct number of times will read and, when indicated, will F/N. Rehab by counting is a simple procedure but it can get messed up by an uncertain atti-tude on the part of the auditor or by rough auditor TRs, so be sure you are confident and well drilled. BRIDGING FROM REHAB BY COUNTING TO '65 STYLE If, even with the ruds in, doing a Rehab by Counting doesn't F/N, one can bridge over into a Rehab '65 Style and rehab it that way. Doing a Rehab '65 Style will clean up any by-passed charge on the release and allow it to rehab. If on the Rehab by Counting the pc had said he was released several times, one would have to find the primary release point (the one \"that is most real to him,\" or when he \"had the biggest win,\" etc.) in order to do the Rehab '65 Style steps on that release point. Handled smoothly in this way, you will be able to rehabilitate the release, with F/N, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 9 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 149 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR DATE/LOCATE/ PROCEDURE The Date/Locate procedure is very thoroughly covered in HCOB 15 November 1978, DATING AND LOCATING, and thus is not repeated here. It is based upon the fundamentals principles of rehab tech, but the additional theory and full Date/Locate procedure contained in HCOB 15 Nov 78 must be understood and drilled well before it is done on any pc. ADDITIONAL DATA ON SPECIFIC USES OF REHAB PROCEDURES If one is to handle rehabs he must know the fine differences involved in the applica-tion of rehab tech to each type of thing to be rehabbed. For example, the rehabbing of Grades and the rehabbing of former releases differ from each other and they also differ slightly in some of their steps from the rehabbing of specific processes or states as covered earlier in this issue. For this reason each is taken up separately here in its own section. REHABBING GRADES The rehabilitation of any Grade is done on the basis of actual auditing having been done to the end product of the specific Ability Gained for the Grade on all flows. (Note: Pc's should be Quaded up by the time they receive their Grades.) One does not rehab a Grade by checking \"Did anything occur?\" or \"Were you released on Grade ______?\" Of course something would have occurred on the Grade and the pc would released each time a process or a flow on a process of the Grade F/Ned. This is not what you're looking for. The End Phenomena of a Grade is the attainment of an ability by the pc which he did not previously have. Each level of the Grade Chart results in a specific ability gained by the pc when he does that particular Grade. These are expressed on the Grade Chart in the \"Ability Gained\" column. The specific ability for each of the four flows of a Grade is listed in HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 ISSUE II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED GRADES. These are what you are interested in finding out and rehabbing, if they have been attained. You want to determine that the pc has gained the ability for each flow of the Grade when you are rehabbing. It's not: Did he get his Grade 0 ability? It's: Is he willing for others to communicate to him on any subject? Does he no longer resist communication from others on unpleasant or unwanted subjects? Yes? Good, he's made it on Flow 1 of Grade 0."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 10 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 150 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Does he have the ability to communicate freely with anyone on any subject? Is he free from or no longer bothered by communication difficulties, and no longer withdrawn or reti-cent? Does he like to outflow? If so, he's attained the ability on Flow 2 of Grade 0. One checks each flow of a Grade for the ability of that flow in this way. If the pc says he can't, or if he reads on the meter as being unable to communicate freely to others, for ex-ample, then you know he is not complete on that Grade. He would need to have an FES done at least as far back as the beginning of that Grade and any errors found corrected, and then more processes for that Grade run on all flows until the Ability Gained had been genuinely attained. Further data about handling the pc who hasn't made a Grade is contained in C/S Se-ries 4. A Dianetic pc who couldn't honestly say he was a well and happy human being would need more somatic items run out R3RA. One would never try to rehab a Grade the pc had never really been run on, or for in-stance, Q and A with a pc who asserted he was a Grade 2 Release because he went to confes-sion as a youth. The Abilities Gained of the Grades are attained only by auditing on the vari-ous processes of each Grade. The results of well-run Grades are light years above anything that other fields or practices can offer, so don't sell them short by omitting or quickying them. The procedure, then, for rehabbing a Grade is as follows: 1. Establish from folder study that the pc has run the processes of the Grade on all flows in the first place. There should be some evidence in the folder that the pc has attained the Grade, whether previously declared or not. He should have run enough processes for this to be evident. 2. Show the pc (with pc on the meter) the written statement of the Ability Gained for Flow 1 of the Grade, and have him read it. (Ref: HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES.) 3. Then check with the pc as to whether he has attained (or \"can do\") the ability for that flow of the Grade, as stated in HCOB/HCO PL 23 October 1980 II. 4. If he has attained it, rehab it by Rehab '65 Style. 5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the Ability Gained for each of the remaining flows (Flows 2, 3 and 0) of the Grade. 6. If the pc has attained the ability on each flow of the Grade, he is a valid release on that Grade. 7. If the pc doesn't have the Ability Gained for one or more of the flows of the Grade, he doesn't have the abilities of the Grade. The processes (and the flows) he ran on it would have to be FES'd to locate any errors. The errors found would have to be cor-rected and any unflat process flattened. Then additional processes for that Grade would need to be run until the pc really had the Ability Gained for each flow of the Grade."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 11 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 151 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR REHABBING FORMER RELEASES Rehabbing former releases came into being in 1965 and was done most frequently in that year and the years immediately following it, after the Grades had been established. At that time it was necessary to clear up and get acknowledged the former releases a pc may have had during his processing in the previous years, and to determine that he had been re-leased on each Grade before he went onto Power and Clearing. It is still a very valid tech that is used when needed. It may in some instances be done, at the adjudication of the C/S, where a case is hav-ing trouble or is bogged and the C/S suspects from folder study that the case may be hung up on former release points. In genning the pc in to this action ensure he understands what is being looked for. Al-though one uses Rehab '65 Style, the action is not the same as rehabbing a Grade or even ex-actly the same as rehabbing a process. Here you are looking for times in the pc's auditing his-tory, recent or distant, when he felt good in sessions. This would not necessarily have to be a specific EP of a process the pc ran or the EP of a particular Grade. Rehabbing former releases is not limited by reference to any specific process or Grade. Also, when the pc is asked about an earlier release he may offer up a time he felt released from something in life. If so, this would be checked and handled just as any other release point, as in this action you are going to rehab any and all validly reading release points the pc may offer. When a former release is found it is rehabbed by the '65 Style. The procedure for rehabbing former releases is: 1. Ensure the pc's ruds are in and that he has been through steps 1-6 of the section \"In-doctrinating the pc\", in this issue. 2. Have the pc demo the idea of former releases as it applies to auditing and to life until he's got it. 3. R-Factor the pc that you are going to rehab any former releases he may have had. 4. Clear the question: \"Have you been released earlier?\" Then check the question. 5. If you get a read on Clearing or checking the question, find out what the release was on. a. If no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress and Invali-date. b. If pc says he was released earlier but no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress or Invalidate. If the pc is assertive or protesty about hav-ing been released, check Asserted and/or Protest. 6. When it has been determined that the pc has been released earlier, one then proceeds per Step 1 of Rehab '65 Style instructions until one gets an F/N and rehabilitation of the former release."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 12 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 152 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR 7. One then checks for any other former releases by checking, \"Is there another time you were released earlier?\" and handles per Steps 5 and 6 above. 8. Repeat Step 7 as long as the pc has former releases to rehab 9. Conditional: If on Steps 5 a or b the meter doesn't read or ceases reading even after Suppress, Invalidate, Asserted and/or Protest are checked, or if an ARC Break needle turns on while doing the rehabs, one checks for and handles any ARC Breaks which may be present in the session or connected with the thing you are trying to rehab. After handling any ARC Breaks, recheck for former releases and handle until the Auditor, pc and meter are in agreement that any former releases have been rehabbed and that there are no ARC Breaks preventing any former release from reading. It may be necessary to also check and handle the other rudiments (PTP and Missed With-holds) to ensure there is nothing preventing any former release from reading. 10. Conditional: If the pc has a big win in rehabbing former releases, one would let him have his win and end the session. When sessions are resumed, one would then check for and handle any remaining former releases. When all the pc's former releases have been rehabbed, the action is complete. ADVICE TO AUDITORS AND C/SES ON REHABS Meter Dependence In using the meter on a rehab of any sort, one does not want to get into a situation where the pc is made dependent on the meter for obtaining data. One uses the meter in a rehab only when the pc is unable to come up with the data needed. In getting the number of times released on a process, for instance, the auditor would get the pc to establish the number of times released and only if the pc could not get it would the auditor use the meter to find the number of times released. This all comes under increasing the pc's certainty of his data and is best expressed in HCOB 4 AUGUST 1963 ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR. Out Ruds When a rehab is not going to an F/N, one usually finds that there is an out rud over which the rehab is being done. This can be: a. An out rud on the subject being rehabbed; b. An out rud on something before the release occurred; c. An out rud in the rehab session itself. One has to find out what the out rud is, handle it and then the rehab should go easily to F/N."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 13 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 153 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR If at any time an ARC Break needle turns on during a rehab, immediately find what the ARC Break is on and handle fully. Then take the rehab to F/N. An ARC Break, particularly, may obscure a release and prevent it from reading. The remedy is to handle the ARC Break and then recheck for the release. Note: That one has F/Ned the ruds or handled session outnesses to F/N does not mean the rehab is finished, so complete the rehab if needed once the ruds are in. ____________________ Rehabs are very simple to do provided the auditor's comm cycle is not rough or dis-tracting and both he and the pc understand what is being done on a rehab and how the proce-dures go. The action is one of de-stimulation not re-stimulation. It is done with a light touch and is a smooth action. One doesn't get into forcing the pc on a rehab. Drilling the different rehab procedures must be a part of any High Crime checkout on this bulletin so that the auditor can confidently handle any situation that might arise during a rehab. The best way to run a session is to be so sharp as an auditor that you never let the pc overrun in the first place. But should this occur or should you inherit a pc that another auditor has overrun, or should life and livingness knock out a release state, this issue lays out the steps for restoring any type of release.

The Prepared List provides the auditor with a stable action when a session or case is confusing and can bring things under control. The idea of such lists and their development are original to Dianetics and Scientology. They are made possible because these subjects embrace the full extent of thought, the spirit and actual and potential aberration. Thousands of hours of research and development have gone into these lists. Thousands of case histories have been reviewed and condensed to make the lists possible. They are, in themselves, a considerable tour de force. They have often meant the difference between a failed case and a spectacular result. Just as they are important, a knowledge of them and skill in their use is vital to auditing suc-cess. HISTORY Probably the oldest \"prepared list\" is the White Form, (now called THE ORIGINAL AS-SESSMENT SHEET – HCOB 24 JUN 78R). This provided a series of questions which would give one the background of the preclear. It dates from 1950. By it one can get the probable this life areas of the preclear's heaviest charge. SELF ANALYSIS was written in 1951. It contains processing lists a preclear could run on himself. Group Auditing materials of the middle 50s contained lists of commands which were run on groups. Done on a meter, it provides a case entrance. The \"Joburg\" of 1961 is probably the next historical point. It was a list of the possible withholds a preclear might have. It was called the \"Joburg\" because it was developed in Jo-hannesburg, South Africa. The \"L1\" was probably next. The original gave a list of session rudiments which might have gone out and enabled the auditor to get the session rudiments back in. It is still in use as \"L1C\" or \"List One C\". The \"Green Form\" was developed in the early 60s so that Qual Review at Saint Hill would have a tool to analyze a case."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 2 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE LEVEL 3 156 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Correction lists for various auditing actions began to appear. These corrected an action in progress that had gone awry. In 1973, the famous \"C/S 53\" (meaning \"Case Supervisor Series 53\") was devised and continued to be improved and reissued. Today there are dozens of Prepared Lists. There is even a prepared list to repair re-paired lists in general. THEORY OF PREPARED LISTS A Prepared List is an assembly of the majority of things which can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. Such lists are quite remarkable, actually. Only a thorough knowledge of aberration makes such a list possible. When you look over the extent of Prepared Lists, you will see that they contain a grasp of the subject of aberration never before available. USE While an auditor is expected to have studied and mastered all this theory, it is a bit much to expect that in the confusion of a case or session gone wrong he will be able to spot instantly, without help, exactly what has gone wrong. Prepared Lists, where they exist, and his E-Meter will sort this out for him. All the auditor has to have is a general insight that something is going wrong, know in general what is being handled in the case, knows what list to use and then, with good TRs and metering, do an assessment of the Prepared List. Usually the trouble will come right, since the exact point will have been located. It is sometimes enough to merely indicate the point found to discharge it somewhat. One can F/N what is found or one can go into very wide, extensive handling. The point is, the use of the Prepared List has spotted the trouble. What is demanded of the auditor or C/S is which Prepared List to use, but this is determined by what has been going on. TYPES OF PREPARED LISTS There are four general types of Prepared Lists. These are: A. An Analysis list. This is a type of Prepared List which analyzes a case broadly or ana-lyzes a session. The purpose of it is to find out what to address in the case in order to program it. The White Form, the Green Form and the C/S 53 can all be used for this purpose. There are other such lists and there is even a Prepared List to debug produc-tion. B. A direct Auditing list. Prepared Lists exist which deliver direct auditing commands or questions which, run on the Pc, produce an auditing result. The lists of SELF ANALYSIS and the various Confessional Lists form this type of Prepared List."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 3 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE LEVEL 3 157 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR C. A Correction list. This type of list corrects an ongoing action. Examples are the Word Clearing Correction List, the Int Rundown Correction List, the Dianetic Correction List. There is a bit of a grey area in this type of list as one can also use some of them for analysis as in the case of a Course Supervisor Correction List or a Student Correc-tion List. The C/S 53 can also serve as a correction list. The real difference is what the list is being used for – to analyze to find out what to program or start or to correct something already in progress. D. Drill lists. These are used in training as dummy lists to get an auditor used to handling the meter and Prepared Lists. Such lists are contained in the Book of E-Meter Drills. METHOD OF HANDLING There are three methods of handling Prepared Lists, depending on the type of list. There is simply the method of asking the questions in sequence and getting the answer from the preclear. This would apply to a White Form or to auditing Prepared Lists as in Self Analysis or in Group Auditing. Very few lists are handled in this way. The second way is called \"Method 3\" wherein the list is assessed on a meter and when a read is noted, the meter-reading question is taken up with the preclear and F/Ned. Method 3 is covered in HCOB 3 JUL 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. The third way is called \"Method 5\". This type of assessment assesses the whole Pre-pared List rapidly without getting the preclear to talk and the reads are then noted. The largest read or reads are then taken up and F/Ned. Method 5 is covered in HCOB 3 JUL 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. TRs AND METERING Whether or not a Prepared List reads depends upon the auditor's TRs and Metering. At one time or another Case Supervisors have had a great deal of trouble with this. Accuracy as to what really read was greatly in question. This came to view on Flag in the early 70s when Prepared Lists that had been assessed by Class IV trainees were then reassessed, same list, same pc shortly after the first list assessment, by Class XIIs. Totally different results were found – lists on which few or no reads were obtained by the Class IV trainees were found to be very live by the Class XIIs. The difference of quality of TRs and metering were what made the difference with the prepared list response. HCOB 22 April 1980 contains the drills which remedy this. It is the TRs and metering of the auditor that makes a prepared list reliable, not the list itself. The champion list of all time is the C/S 53. On one page, any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan has been assembled. There are two forms of it – Short Form for preclears who know the terms and Long Form for preclears who are unindoctrinated (they are the same lists but the Short Form is in single word and the Long Form is a full question)."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 4 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE LEVEL 3 158 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR A Director of Processing giving a D of P Interview can use one of these and obtain enough material to enormously help a Case Supervisor. It is not the only D of P Interview action but it is very helpful when used. An auditor can debug a program or a session with it. It can analyze a case for programming and it can also be used to correct a program or to correct a session. Originally it was developed to handle high and low Tone Arm cases and although it still says this, it also says it can \"correct case outnesses\". And today, this is its greatest use. Priority of handling outnesses is a vital part of C/S 53. The first three groups of items – (Interiorization outnesses), B (List errors) and C (rudiments) – give the necessary or-der of handling. If Int is reading, nothing else can be handled until it is. List errors take the next priority. Then rudiments. If one were to try to repair a case out of sequence, a mess could occur. So this Prepared List also gives the sequence in which outnesses must be handled. The main fault in using a C/S 53 is overuse – an auditor reaching for it when he gets in trouble instead of improving the auditor's own TRs, metering or knowledge of programming in the first place. But the C/S 53 is one of the most valuable tools an Auditor or a Case Supervisor has. GENERAL CASE HANDLING The Prepared Lists of all types place in the hands of the Case Supervisor and the audi-tor a procedure by which a case can be analyzed and programmed. Some auditing can be done direct from Prepared Lists. WORD CLEARING PREPARED LISTS It can happen that a Prepared List gets stalled on misunderstood words. For many Prepared Lists there are also full word clearing lists which can be done on the pc. At one time it was thought that before one did a list one should always word clear it. However, this has the liability that a pc who is in one kind of trouble can't sit still until a full word clearing action is done. The amount of trouble which came from Prepared Lists came more from assessing and metering errors than it did from misunderstood words. When one is using a prepared list on a pc who has never had it word cleared, it is usu-ally enough to check that the read isn't coming from a Mis U. Early in a pc's auditing, about the time he gets a CS-1, the more critical prepared lists should be word cleared and the fact noted in his folder. But when one is doing this word"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 5 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE LEVEL 3 159 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR clearing, tone arm action or significant reads should also be noted. One is liable to think he is word clearing whereas he is actually assessing. True, there are a lot of tech words on a prepared list that the pc isn't likely to know. Unfortunately, the discoveries of Scientology exceed common language and require terms of their own. But a pc catches on to this quite rapidly. They are new ideas to him (even though he was been living with them all the eons of his existence). When the word is cleared, the idea is also thrown into action. So it is important to note meter reads and tone arm actions when clearing the words of prepared lists. No hard and fast rules can be drawn on this point of word clearing Prepared Lists. If you have already word cleared the key words of a key Prepared List before you need it, thank your stars. Otherwise, carry on and hope. SUMMARY A Case Supervisor and an auditor owe it to themselves to have a good command of this subject of Prepared Lists. There are many issues on the subject. There are dozens of Pre-pared Lists. Knowing what Prepared Lists exist is a vital step for a Case Supervisor and auditor. Knowing what each is used for is equally important. Knowing which lists have word clearing lists already prepared is of assistance. One has to know enough general tech in order to select what Prepared List to use. The ability to assess, as it applies to TRs and metering is extremely important in using Prepared Lists. When it comes to analyzing, auditing and correcting cases and actions, the Prepared Lists are a jewel box that glitters with potential success. L.

You are looking for an Instant Read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question. If it does not read, mark the list X.

He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc's remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on the W/S. If the pc's answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accom-pany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, \"Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.\" Do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do not chop what he is saying. Both are TR errors that are very bad. If there is no F/N, at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it, ask for an Earlier Similar _____ whatever the question concerned.

Do not take up things that don't read. Don't get \"hunches\". Don't let the pc run his own case by answering non-reading items and then the auditor taking them up. Also don't let a pc \"fiddle the cans\" to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Very rare but these two actions have happened.) BIG WIN If half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/S action or ending the session. There are two reasons for this – one, the F/N will usually just persist and can't be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. This is not true of any other list. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any ear-lier data contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change – we F/N everything that reads by E/S or a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an F/N) and we never tell the pc that it read or didn't read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are not used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up.

It is not a new Technique. It has been done for many years by well trained auditors and is done at Flag simply and expertly as needed. If one understands the anatomy of the human mind and what is by-passed charge he will understand this simple but important technique. Scientology auditors of all levels should be able to talk the TA down quickly and simply without restimulating the pc further. The TA is not talked down by getting overruns, ruds or ARC breaks. It is not done by rehabbing former releases. It is done by the simple time honored action of asking the right question, getting it answered, and – letting the tone arm blow down. By letting the tone arm blow down, it is meant that the auditor does not have any atti-tudes or ridges toward the preclear, and lets him blow off charge which will bring the tone arm down. The auditor never interrupts the PC while the tone arm is moving . To ask the right question on this technique, you must first know what you are trying to accomplish. Why do you want to bring the TA down? The answer is simply, that the TA being high (3.5 or above), indicates that there is some mass the preclear's attention is on. You want that mass out of the way so that you can direct the preclear's attention where you want it. So what you simply do is get the preclear to tell you what is in restimulation so that it will key out without driving the preclear further into his bank – and thus restimulating more mass. You must not further restimulate the preclear's bank because it already is restimulated by something. The mass is right there. You can see it reading on the meter. But as this is not the mass you came into session prepared to run, it would be a Q and A to change the C/S and program by running it. So you must destimulate the pc by having him tell you what it is that his attention is on and thus free his attention so that you can run the major action."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"TALKING THE TA DOWN 2 BTB 14.3.71RA II LEVEL 3 166 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Briefly, in talking the TA down, you are freeing the preclear's attention from where it is so that you can then direct it where you wish. HOW TALKING THE TA DOWN IS DONE Talking the TA down is simply starting the session as usual, and if the TA is high – 3.5 or above – asking the pc a question such as one of the following – using good ARC, ex-cellent TRs, granting the pc beingness not soppy or sugary, but being there comfortably and even pleasantly if the preclear is not upset. Some of the questions you could ask are: \"Do you have your attention on anything?\" \"Is there anything you'd care to tell me?\" \"Since your last session has anything happened you'd like to tell me about?\" \"How have things been going lately?\" \"How have things been going since your last session?\" Or on occasion you could ask \"Have you had any wins lately?\" The question should be phrased to limit the time period to just what the preclear's at-tention is on and not to drive him into his bank by restimulating new things. It is lightly, lightly, with one eye on the pc and one eye on the meter so you can see if the Tone Arm blows down and what it blows down on. This does not get wild and complicated. There is no Q and A. Perhaps the pc will say \"no\" and the question will not have any reaction on the meter. Try another question but stick to one of the types given. If the meter reads and the pc says nothing and the tone arm is not blowing down you could ask \"What was that?\" or \"Did you have a thought there?\" (See Fishing a Cognition drill, BTB 25 June 70 Fishing a Cognition.) You will also find certain subjects the pc mentions give a blow down. These can be used by noticing them, redirecting the pc's attention to them when the pc changes the subject and the TA starts up. Example: He says \"Mother\", TA blows down, he goes on to \"Father\", TA starts up. Casually ask him about his mother again and it will go on down. This is danger-ously close to a Q & A except it manipulates the TA. A little of this goes a long way. When all else fails look back on your W/S for the lowest TA read and redirect the pc's attention to that subject and you may get your F/N. Don't get accusative or abusive or evaluative. The preclear will answer you and the tone arm will start blowing down. Sometimes the preclear will not answer, but will be looking, and the tone arm will start falling. Never interrupt while the tone arm is blowing down, even if the preclear isn't talking. Write down on the worksheet whatever names, items, events or whatever it was that blew the tone arm down and circle it."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"TALKING THE TA DOWN 3 BTB 14.3.71RA II LEVEL 3 167 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR When the tone arm has stopped blowing down you can indicate to the pc what hap-pened by saying: \"There was charge on ......... (the subject which blew the TA down).\" (Warning: This may not be used as a substitute for a good TR 2 or to pull the pc out of ses-sion.) The pc will usually say something like: \"There sure is charge on the subject!\", and you'll almost certainly get F/N, cog, VGIs. You would, of course, indicate on the worksheet what happened and write \"indicated\". You'd let the preclear have his win on this by indicating the F/N, then you would go on to your C/S actions. If your C/S stated \"Fly a rud if no F/N.\" you wouldn't have to fly a rud because you have your F/N. CONCLUSION The auditor observes the preclear. By his presence alone, the auditor can make the preclear feel safe and willing to be in session and this alone will often bring the tone arm down if it is high at start of session. Auditors with presence have been seen to do this time after time. Auditor presence of this caliber is not unusual even at lower levels. It is the auditor who controls the session, the pc's bank, the pc's attention and the pc's TA. In talking the TA down, it is the action of getting the pc's attention off the mass and into session which brings the tone arm down. When the TA is down, the auditor skillfully directs the pc's attention to that portion of the bank he wishes to restimulate and run in accordance with the C/S. The major cautions in talking the TA down are: 1. Don't turn it into a major action. Use it only to get the TA down and leave it. 2. Use talking the TA down only at the start of session and not in the middle of a session if the TA goes high. An auditor should never start a session with the tone arm high. An auditor with good presence, good TRs and the ability to grant the preclear beingness will never need more than just a few minutes to talk the TA down and get into the C/S quickly. Lt. Cmdr.

Remimeo All Levels F/N EVERYTHING Whenever an auditor gets a read on an item from Ruds or a prepared list (L1B, L3A, L4B, etc., etc.) it must be carried to an F/N. To fail to do so is to leave the pc with by-passed charge. When a pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to F/N, it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason. As one has done the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong? The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not car-ried to F/N. This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it Flag Auditing. When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible. Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared list would F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn't F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning. So the rule: Never walk off from a reading item on a rudiment or a prepared repair list be-fore you carry it down (earlier similar) to an F/N. Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N, Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc. until he gets an F/N. Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns. Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there an earlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list. Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on it that read, by 2WC or other process, to an F/N. So there is a much more general rule:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 2 HCOB 14.3.71R LEVEL 3 170 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Every item that reads must F/N. In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure, F/N, Cog, VGIs. In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N. On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N. On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N. On GF you get by whatever process an F/N. On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N. So another rule: Every major and minor action must be carried to an F/N. There are no exceptions. Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc. Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained. You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge (a withheld cognition). __________________ I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with a very shining, cool calm pc. So \"Have reading items been left charged?\" would be a key question on a case. __________________ Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will get you reading items that won't F/N. So, another rule: Never try to fly ruds or do lib on a high or low TA. One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down). Or one can assess L4B. About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71 and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other items that read. __________________ "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 3 HCOB 14.3.71R LEVEL 3 171 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The most frequent errors in all this are: Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as \"clean\".

Not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called \"clean\" or were simply abandoned.

A C/S who cannot get a result on his pcs will find the most usual biggest improvement by getting the offending Auditors' Assessing handled. We used to say that \"the Auditor's TRs were out\" as the most fundamental reason for no results. This is not specific enough. The most common reason for failed sessions is the inability of the auditor to get reads on lists. Time after time I have checked this back as the real reason. It became evident when one could take almost any \"null\" (no read) list in a pc's folder, give it and the pc to an Auditor who could assess and get nice reads on it with consequent gain. Example: Pc has a high TA. C/S orders a C/S 53RF. List is null. Pc goes on having a high TA. C/S gets inventive, case crashes. Another C/S and another Auditor takes the same pc and the same list, gets good reads, handles. Case flies again. What was wrong was: (a) The Auditor's TR 1 was terrible. (b) The Auditor couldn't meter. REMEDY One takes the above two reference HCO Bs and gets their points fully checked on the flunking Auditor. The C/S gets the Auditor's TR 1 corrected.

There are many of these. Notable amongst them is C/S 53 and its corrections. It is customary for the auditor to be required to F/N such a list. This means on calling it that the whole list item by item is to F/N. To F/N a list, you do it Method 3. Somebody's got the wrong idea that it is done Method 5 – going over and over and over something. A recent C/S of mine on the subject stated: \"The reason you're having trouble F/Ning a list is because you don't do M3, handle each read to the end and then reassess M3 and handle each read to the end. It is obvious from your list markings that you were doing M5 over and over, which of course gets into protest. Usually M3 at some point will begin to F/N and that is the reason you do M3. Also, when you miss on a prepared list the F/N stops. So there were a few minor misses on these lists but mostly because you were doing it M5. Also, it takes an R-Factor that you're going to clean up everything on the list.\" You handle a list Method 3 by calling the line and handling the line. A prepared list should be used to get optimum results on a pc. If a prepared list reveals that more needs to be handled, i.e. engram in restimulation, then it would be handled. (Note: In this case the han-dling would be to assess the L3RF and handle the reads. Warning: You would not run Dianetics on a Clear, Dianetic Clear or OT. For C/ears and OTs you would assess the L3RF and then simply indicate the read.) If a more major action was found to be needed it would be programmed for handling, per list instructions. If something hot leaps into view on a prepared list then handle it. It is the wrong think that one has to quickie a prepared list and get it to F/N in a hurry rather than to use it to get optimum results on a pc. All the list must be called a final time."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"NULLING AND F/NING PREPARED LISTS 2 C/S SERIES 87RB – HCOB 15.10.73RB LEVEL 3 176 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR \"NON-READING, NON-F/Ning\" LISTS Now and then you get the extreme oddity of a list selected to exactly remedy the case not reading but not F/Ning. Of course this might happen if the list did not apply to the case (such as an OT pre-pared list being used on a Grade IV, heaven forbid). In the case of lists to correct listing and in particular the C/S 53 Series, it is nearly impossible for this situation to occur. A C/S will very often see that the auditor has assessed the list on the pc, has gotten no reads, and the list did not F/N. A \"reasonable\" C/S (heaven forbid) lets this go by. Yet he has before him first class evidence that the auditor 1. Has out-TRs in general, 2. Has no impingement whatever with TR 1, 3. Is placing his meter in the wrong position in the auditing session so that he cannot see it, the pc and his worksheet, 4. That the auditor's eyesight is bad. One or more of these conditions certainly exist. To do nothing about it is to ask for catastrophe after catastrophe with pcs and to have one's confidence in one's own C/Sing deteriorate badly. An amazing number of auditors cannot make a prepared list read for one of the above reasons. Putting in Suppress, Invalidation or Misunderstood Words on the list will either get a read or the list will F/N. If a list does not F/N then the subject of the list is still charged or there is something wrong with the list. The moral of this is that prepared lists that do not read F/N. When prepared lists that do not read do not F/N or when the auditor cannot get a prepared list to F/N, serious auditing errors are present which will defeat a C/S. In the interest of obtaining results and being merciful on pcs, the wise C/S never lets this situation go by without finding what it is all about. READING THROUGH AN F/N There is a skill that any auditor who is handling lists should master and that is reading through an F/N. When taking a list to F/Ning assessment an auditor must know how to read through an f/n. When going down a list that is F/Ning you'll sometimes see the F/N \"check\" briefly and then continue. The swinging weight of the F/Ning needle has momentum and it will tend"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"NULLING AND F/NING PREPARED LISTS 3 C/S SERIES 87RB – HCOB 15.10.73RB LEVEL 3 177 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR to obscure a read. But a sharp auditor will see this \"check\" or slow in an F/N, know he has a hot item and take it up and handle it. An auditor who can't read through an F/N will miss it and go right on by, and the F/N then kills within the next couple of items. Now he's got a suppressed read and he's going to have trouble F/Ning the list. When this happens, even if you can't read through an F/N, you should go back up the list an item or two and find it. But one should be able to read through an F/N. It is the secret of being able to take a list accurately to an honestly F/Ning assessment, with no wasted time or effort. (Ref: HCOB 4 December 78, HOW TO READ THROUGH AN F/N.) THE \"RABBIT BUTTONS\" To \"rabbit\" means to run away from the bank. (The term derives from the fact that a rabbit is timid and runs away from just about everything.) Some auditors have been known to \"rabbit\" from auditing sessions or from certain session actions. This is wholly due to out-TRs or shaky metering and the auditor not knowing how to use his tools. Rabbiting shows up in various ways – not getting the pc through the engram and not taking a Dianetic chain to full EP, or calling an F/N when it's an ARC break needle, or simply ending off when the going gets rough, etc. It's running away from the action rather than completing it. One of the ways some auditors rabbit from F/Ning a list is by using what have come to be known as the \"rabbit buttons.\" Given a C/S 53 (or other list) to take to F/Ning assess-ment, the auditor begins assessing and handling the list items but on the slightest provoca-tion (such as a minor protest from the pc), introduces such questions as: \"Is the C/S 53 being overrun?\", \"Is this list unnecessary?\", \"Do you feel over-repaired?\" or something similar. These questions are valid enough when they occur, as they do, at the end of some prepared lists. But used out of sequence they serve to get the auditor out of taking the C/S 53 or other assigned list to F/Ning assessment. Auditor throws in the \"rabbit buttons,\" pc im-mediately agrees it's \"overrun\" or \"unnecessary,\" and the auditor ends off, with the majority of the list items unchecked for charge. This is by no means true of all auditors but it has happened frequently enough for these questions, used out of sequence, to be dubbed the \"rabbit buttons.\" And each time an auditor has rabbited in this way from F/Ning a list, something has been found later that should have been handled. Thus: When the C/S calls for F/Ning a list it must be taken to completion and not quit before the entire list is F/Ning, item by item, on assessment. Any pc protest or upset or apprehension over extensive repair actions or a list having to be F/Ned stems mainly from auditor out-TRs and mismetering (missing reads and calling false reads) when doing repair lists. Any auditor back-off or protest on F/Ning a list stems from these same points plus having to handle pc upset or protest. The solution is for the auditor to polish his TRs and sharpen up his metering.

This is a skill that, up to this point, has been used routinely only by highly trained auditors or a few very sharp Class IIIs or IVs or above. But with the difficulty auditors have had in F/Ning prepared lists, it becomes obvious that, from Class III on up, all auditors should be trained to read the meter through an F/N. It is the answer to almost any difficulty an auditor has had in taking a list to F/Ning as-sessment. An F/N speeds up or slows down or does different things while still remaining an F/N and one can read through it. It is done like this: The swinging weight of the needle (F/Ning from an earlier item) has momentum and it will tend to obscure the read on another item. It will almost obscure it, but not quite. You'll see the F/N \"check\" or slow up briefly and then continue and this means you have a hot item. Any item that would cause an F/N to \"check\" will be hot. The auditor who can read through an F/N will spot this and handle the item then and there. Then he con-tinues on down the list, missing nothing, handling what is there to be handled and, with this skilled metering, takes it to a genuinely F/Ning list on assessment. And it doesn't take days or even several sessions, necessarily, to do it. If an auditor can't read through an F/N he'll miss this. He's going down the list, the F/N \"checks\" or slows and he doesn't see it so he goes right on by it. Then, within the next couple of items the F/N kills. He's going to have a hard time F/Ning that list because he's now got a suppressed read. Example: Auditor in assessing starts with an F/N which continues as he goes on down the list calling the items. On, say, item 5 the F/N \"checks\" or slows briefly. Auditor can't read through an F/N so he misses this and goes on by. On about the 6th or 7th item the F/N packs"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"HOW TO READ THROUGH AN F/N 2 HCOB 4.12.78 LEVEL 3 184 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR up, and the auditor is in a quandary because the F/N has turned off but he didn't get a read on items 6 or 7 either. Or he may misduplicate the killed F/N as a read on items 6 or 7 and at-tempt to take up one or the other of them. Either way he's in for trouble because he's missed the actual item and he may even try to handle a wrong item. He's going to find it difficult to take that list to an F/Ning assessment. The correct action when an F/N packs up this way is to go back up the list and reassess the last several items to find the missed read. But one should be able to read through an F/N. Probably the main reason for pc upset or protest against \"overrepair\" and being han-dled again and again with repair lists lies in this factor alone – the auditor can't read through an F/N. Thus he misses the charged items and takes up items that are uncharged. And the re-pair goes on interminably, as the charged lines are not found and handled. This is also probably the reason that auditors have been known to back off from hav-ing to F/N a list. They \"know\" from experience that it is a laborious business. The truth is it's not necessary for an auditor to labor over taking a list to F/Ning as-sessment. It simply requires good TRs and skilled metering, including the ability to read through F/Ns. An auditor can be trained to see a read through an F/N. The drill would be to sit him down in front of a meter with an F/Ning student on the cans and assess the prepared lists in The Book of E-Meter Drills, spotting each time he gets a \"check\" or a \"slow\" or any change in an otherwise continuing F/N. He'll find that he can read through an F/N and become very adept at this, and from then on he won't miss. You'll have an auditor who is confident of his ability to F/N a list accurately and thor-oughly in one-half the time (and trauma) it would take otherwise. And far fewer \"overrepaired\" pcs. (\"Overrepaired\" pcs are usually pcs with actual reads missed and false reads taken up. So \"overrepair\" is really \"misrepaired\" or \"not re-paired.\") This is metering at its best and most accurate. We now expect the best and most accu-rate metering from the auditor who is in the business of F/Ning prepared lists. L.

Listing and nulling is an entirely different subject from assessment. Please get these differences very clearly. They are completely different actions. They are even years apart in development. They have nothing to do with each other. ASSESSMENT Assessment is an action done from a prepared list. A prepared list. The list is prepared by the Auditor or the C/S or it is an HCOB of prepared lists. It is done by someone other than the PC. The prepared list for an Assessment is not made up by the preclear. Assessment is done exactly per the Book of E-Meter Drills, Number 24. Assessment is not done by the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Assessment has nothing to do with S & Ds, Remedy A or Remedy B (which are List-ing and Nulling actions). Assessment is not auditing. It is simply trying to locate something to audit. You say the words on the prepared list right to the Pc's bank, bang, bang, marking the reads, and go through the list of reading items until you are left with one reading item. That is the item. To get a clue as to what happened, the C/S prepares a list, and the Auditor starts as-sessing with the list already written out, The Auditor calls out each item and notes its read as follows: "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"TWO COMPLETE DIFFERENCES 2 BTB 20.8.70R ASSESSMENT – LISTING AND NULLING LEVEL 3 186 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Lions X Big Game SF Cats X Felines SF Tigers X Bearers X Trucks X Elephants X Killing F Camping X Three items are now reading after the first assessment .

It is the Preclear who lists. Listing and Nulling is listed by the preclear. This is done precisely per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. (HCOB 1 August 1968). There is no Listing and Nulling drill in the Book of E-Meter Drills. The Auditor asks the listing question, if it reads he asks the PC the question, the PC answers, item, item, item, item. The Auditor writes the items down as the PC gives them not-ing the read or no read as the PC gives the item. The Auditor then nulls the list per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. In Listing and Nulling, there should be only one reading item on the list after nulling. You don't go over and over the reading items by a process of elimination. You may extend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling. In its finest form, Listing and Nulling is done to LFBD F/N. The Auditor says the listing question to the PC, checks whether it read and notes the reads per Number 6 of the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Ideally, the following would happens. The Auditor checks the question \"Who got shot?\" It gets a long fall, so it is reading well. Auditor writes the read beside the question. Then the Auditor gives the PC the question with good TR 8, and PC gives items. The Auditor writes the Pc's items down, noting whether the item read and the read as the PC gives it. The first reads therefore is always the read the item gave as the PC said it. \"Who got shot?\" LF Me X Joe X Bearers Elephants X Tigers The Buffalo X IND.

'The White Hunter' is your item.\" Or he could just smile and say \"Thank you\", in acknowledgment. But the point is that he would never chop the pc's Cog or enforce his presence on the PC while this is happening. Good TRs are vital. And this is the way you do Listing and Nulling. You get an LFBD F/N while Listing or while Nulling, if you're a flubless Auditor. It is the finest hand that gets it while Listing and never has to get to the Nulling stage. However, both are excellent. A list that has to be nulled to cm LFBD item is acceptable, but not worthy of praise. There is of course one other place where you could get an LFBD F/N in Listing and Nulling - which is while checking the listing question for read before listing. You could get an F/N on checking the question, and the PC could start cogging and blow the whole subject. When that happens, the subject has blown. Don't do anything more with it. Indicate the F/N and let the PC have his Cog and VGIs. Listing and Nulling is so simple. Have perfect TRs, know the Laws of Listing and Nulling, and do it as shown above. Any Auditor who consistently cannot get an LFBD F/N while Listing and Nulling should retrain on Listing and Nulling. It is more than likely he'll find he has bought some one else's misunderstoods or considerations on the subject.

The question must be checked and must read as a question before it is listed. An item listed from a non-reading question will give you a \"Dead Horse\" (no item). 7. If the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling, the item is suppressed or invali-dated. 8. On a suppressed list, it must be nulled with suppressed. \"On...has anything been sup-pressed.\" 9.

On occasion when you pass the item in nulling, all subsequent items will read to a point where everything on list will then read. In this case take the first which read on first nulling. 12. An underlisted and overlisted list will ARC break the pc and he may refuse to be au-dited until list is corrected, and may become furious with auditor and will remain so till it is corrected. 13. Listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an ARC Br without handling the ARC Break first such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put a pc into a \"sad effect\". 14. A pc whose attention is on something else won't list easily. (List and null only with the rudiments in on the pc.) 15. An auditor whose TRs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items. 16. Listing and nulling errors in presence of Auditor's Code violations can unstabilize a pc. 17. The lack of a specific listing question or an incorrect non-standard listing question which doesn't really call for item will give you more than one item reading on a list. 18. You cease listing and nulling actions when a floating needle appears. 19. Always give a pc his item and circle it plainly on the list. 20. Listing and nulling are highly precise auditing actions and if not done exactly by the laws may bring about a down tone and slow case gain, but if done correctly exactly by the laws and with good auditing in general will produce the highest gains attainable.

Never prepcheck an item that doesn't read. These rules hold good for all lists, all items, even Dianetics. A \"tick\" or a \"stop\" is not a read. Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown (of TA). A preclear's case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn't read or prepchecking or running an item that doesn't read. On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens: The List is \"Who or what would fly kites?\" The C/S has said to \"List this to a BD F/N Item\". So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a \"Dead horse list\" because it gave no item. The reason it didn't was that the list question itself didn't read. One does an L4 on the pc to correct the situation and gets \"Unnecessary action\". On a list that is getting no item you don't extend. You correctly use L4 or any subse-quent issue of it. If you extend a \"dead horse list\" you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it will set it right. This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list \"Who or what would kill buffaloes?\" The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item \"A Hunter\". The C/S also says to list as a second action \"Who or what would feel tough?\" The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Had he tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, \"A mean hunter\". It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item \"A mean hunter\" is a wrong item as it is a misworded variation of the first list's item! Now we have an unnecessary action and a wrong item. We do an L4 and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read. ____________"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"UNREADING QUESTIONS AND ITEMS 2 HCOB 27.5.70 LEVEL 3 196 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR In a Dianetic \"list\" one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a so-matic or sensation, etc. that will run. The item must read well. Or it won't produce a chain to run. In actual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn't bother to test it. But an item that doesn't read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank. The moral of this story is: Always test a Listing Question before letting the pc list. Always mark the read it gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. Always test an item for read before prepchecking or running recall or engrams. Always mark the read an item gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. CHARGE The whole subject of \"charge\" is based on this. \"Charge\" is the electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. \"Charge\" shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc has possible reality on it. A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged but below the pc's reality. So it won't read. THINGS THAT DON'T READ WON'T RUN. The Case Supervisor always counts on the Auditor to test Questions and Items for read before running them. The auditor, when a Question or Item doesn't read, can and should always put in \"Suppress\" and \"Invalidate\". \"On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Suppressed?\" \"On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Invalidated?\" If either one read, the question or item will also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the Auditor to use Suppress and Invalidate on a Question or Item. If after this there is still no read on the Question or Item, that's it.

This is lecture two, 14 June AD 12, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Listing: Listing is an activity which is engaged upon after one has found a goal. I gave you a talk the other evening about how to find a goal. Well, the way you list a goal is rela-tively simple. If the goal is in – it stays in after being duly checked – you begin listing. Now, you may run into some problems of listing. And the first problems you run into is: the goal has been found, the goal has been checked out, the goal is – that's fine – and the first thing you run into are the first invalidations the pc is being careful not to make with his new-found possession. So the first action of listing is a Prepcheck. Now, you see, we – this has nothing to do with checking out goals or anything like that. Only let's emphasize lists and listing all over again. This person has had a lot of Prep-checks on this subject, but he now has a – new expansive opportunities to invalidate. Now, this goal that he's got there is going to do peculiar things in the next few ses-sions. It's going to read and not read and it's going to do this and it's going to do that; because its reads are going to go over on to lists, and these reads are going to go onto items, and it's going to flick back and forth. And it'd be funny if it didn't, because you are using the most powerful method of getting rid of an aberrated prime postulate that has been devised: 3GA. So, of course, it's going to do something to the goal. So the first thing we must know about listing is that when we start listing, we Prep-check and make very sure that the goal is there to be listed. That's for sure – because that's the last, pure, clean opportunity we're going to have to nail it down. Now, we make this as a specification for this particular reason: goals have often been found by other auditors and checked out by other auditors. But remember, if you are a listing auditor who did not find the goal, your responsibility for listing is tremendously great. So, you should start it with a Prepcheck. Now, if the goal is partially listed and been partially listed, you're kind of around the bend. Now you're not so sure about this whole thing. And I know of no other way to go about it than to check the line wordings for a read. If the goal doesn't read, perhaps the line word-ings will read. If a line wording reads, of course the goal is valid. Now, this means then, that your Prepcheck – if you're taking over a case that's had a partially listed goal – your Prepcheck must include \"discussion of items.\" You're going to ask"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"LISTING 2 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 198 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR about goals and you're going to ask about listing, and you must also ask about items, specific items and auditing sessions for items. Why? Because you could get a line ticking merely be-cause it was ARC broke. See? Now, these line wordings are just as vital as the goal itself, so don't skimp them. And they're going to offer you some very tricky problems. The usual and ordinary goal is something like \"to catch catfish.\" All right, that's fine. That's a perfectly ordinary goal. That lists – you can form up the wording very easily because you simply add \"want,\" \"not want,\" \"oppose,\" \"not oppose,\" before the goal, and then before each one of those, \"Who or what would ?\" See, the formula is very simple – nothing to this, \"Who or what would want to catch catfish?\" \"Who or what would not want to catch catfish?\" \"Who or what would oppose catch-ing catfish?\" \"Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\" So those are perfectly valid lines in most cases. But you have changed the goal, haven't you? \"To catch catfish\" has been changed to \"catching catfish.\" So there's one little alteration there that you should be rather careful of. Usually you will get away with it. This is quite valid and everything is fine. But if there's any question in your mind, you had better put \"the goal\" in front of the goal itself. \"Who or what would want the goal to catch catfish?\" \"Who or what would not want the goal to catch cat-fish?\" \"Who or what would oppose the goal to catch catfish?\" \"Who or what would not op-pose the goal to catch catfish?\" Now, that is not a perfect alternate, but it might be all right. Not perfect, but it might be all right. You must realize that there is no perfect wording. You've got to have, however, \"want to,\" \"not want to,\" \"oppose\" and \"not oppose\" as the subject and character of your lines. But goals vary, and for that reason – and pcs' reaction to goals vary – semantics gets in the road of it. Now, any way that you can get the actual goal – as originally worded – ex-pressed, is the best way to word it. That is the best way to word it. Now, I can give you an alternate wording, but – of various kinds – but no wording would fail to have in it \"want,\" \"not want,\" \"oppose\" and \"not oppose.\" Those are the four lines. They are not necessarily in that order while you list them, but those are certainly the proper ways. And each one is preceded by \"Who or what would ?\" Not \"could\" or \"can\" or anything but \"would.\" \"Who or what would ?\" Always \"Who or what would ?\" And now we get into interesting things. I have not seen many negative goals prove out, but negative goals can exist – not to invalidate negative goals. And it's very, very re-markable that a negative goal does not lend itself to good listing at all – wording – doesn't lend itself to good wording. Let's take the goal \"not to be detected.\" That's the goal, \"not to be detected.\" Not even \"to not to be,\" see? It's \"not to be detected.\" \"That's my goal, 'not to be detected.' That's it!\" It's not \"to not to be detected.\" See, just \"not to be detected.\" What the hell are you going to do with this?"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"LISTING 3 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 199 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Well, it depends on your meter. Your problem is to get \"want,\" \"not want,\" \"oppose\" and \"not oppose\" in front of that goal and \"Who or what would ?\" in front of each one of those in some fashion that (underscore) registers on the meter like the goal. It's got to register; got to make sense to the pc. So there's two tests there that you can immediately resort to. Now if you word it wrong, you're going to get a cow's dinner. You're going to have three lines worded right and one line at right angles to the Federal Church, Incorporated and has nothing whatsoever to do with the case. There's going to be one line missing. Now, that the pc can or cannot list on a line is actually no test. That's not a test, be-cause the line \"not oppose\" is always something on the order of reaching into the wild blue nowhere, because it has never offered any resistance. It is the bull and the cape. See, nothing solid to push against – every time he lunges at the cape there's nothing there. So you say to the pc, \"Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\" And the pc goes ... [demonstrates something] Nothing there, you know? Makes him feel bad. Dandy. It's nothing wrong with that. So he feels bad, but that's no test. So he feels bad, but if you were running that and the pc was telling you he has a lot of trouble with it – most pcs will tell you they have a lot of trou-ble with it. Believe me, it's a vital line, because it's one of the four flows. Well, let's suppose you worded it up in some fashion, \"Who or what would not oppose catfish?\" See? You make a horrible error like that, see? Everything else was \"catching cat-fish\" or \"to catch catfish.\" But this last one – this last one was \"would not oppose catfish.\" Well, he's going to have – very interesting – very interesting list! No doubt, it's going to be a fine list, but that needle is never going to go free. It's going to park the case, you see? A mess. Now, the negative goal offers you the problem of the double negative. \"Who or what would not oppose not being detected?\" Isn't that horrible? So the word the goal – by the way – by the way, don't say that that's impossible not to use the double negative, because for some reason or other a pc has already listed well on a double negative and wouldn't have it any other way – and just listed fine. But we can't count on all pcs doing this that well, so we get the goal interposed in there as a method of separating out the double negative. \"Who or what would not oppose the goal not to be detected?\" Now, when you're doing that a question enters into it on the first line: \"Who or what would want the goal not to be detected?\" Doesn't work, does it? Audience: Mm-mm. Mm. Well, it's a mess. Now, you'd better reach into the truth of the situation, because that first line is basically concerned with an item which does have this goal. So in that particular case you can test the line, \"Who or what would have the goal not to be detected?\" So we drop out \"want\" and we'd substitute \"have.\" But notice all the rest of them fall into line quite well, but that one changes. Do you see that? You've got to get four flows that operate against this line – now this particular goal – four flows that operate around and with and in this goal. Now what do those flows consist of? The goal is a prime postulate which has accumu-lated on to itself a number of identities by which the purpose could be executed. It has as-sumed these identities because there were a bunch of people that didn't want the goal and"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"LISTING 4 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 200 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR those were stupid and incomprehensible, so one had to prove it to them that the goal was okay. And there were a bunch of more people who violently and desperately opposed this goal and there were a bunch more people who didn't oppose it, and nevertheless, were in some peculiar way associated with it. Now, if you can't express those flows on your four listings directly and immediately surrounding this prime postulate, of course the thing is not going to go clean. This thing is going to mess itself up one way or the other. Now, to change wording in midflight can be quite upsetting to the pc. So after you've prepchecked and fixed up the goal, and it registers and it reads and it bangs like mad, and everything is fine, and any little dabs at listing or mon-keying with it or invalidation – these things are all knocked out and they're all cleaned up beautifully – you make sure of that wording. And that wording should register. Now, after you've gone into the wording – make sure that you go into it well enough and thoroughly enough with discussion with the pc and that sort of thing – that this wording actually works out to be the wording for the four flows for that goal. Because after that, to change it is going to be upsetting. Now, this doesn't say that you will never change the line – the wording of a listing, because you'll pull a bloomer sometime or another on something and you'll suddenly find out this line never has listed, you know? Nothing – no item on the line has anything to do with anything you've been doing, and something like that. That would be almost catastrophic, however. Try desperately to hold to your original solution, having established it. So establish it with care and then hold to it unless the spot is absolutely untenable. If every time you say to the pc, \"Who or what would not be a catfish?\" or whatever the goal is, he says, \"I – I can't answer it,\" see? And you get the middle rudiments in beautifully, polish it all off, and he still can't answer it – you're faced with some kind of a super emergency of this particular charac-ter. In other words, your wording was wrong in the first place and now it has moved into full view and the moon shines piteously down upon it all, and your crime lies stark upon the moor. Well, the thing to do is be right before you start. It isn't saying you can't recover from it, but it'd be upsetting if you had to – pc now feels all confused. Now, in listing, you probably will list against a low-sensitivity-set tone arm. In other words, you just turn the thing on barely and keep your needle more or less at set so as to get your relative tone arm read and position. Now, you get your relative action without having to madly shift the tone arm all the time to keep your needle on the dial. In other words, it can be neglected for periods while you're busy writing and the fur flying in all directions. Now, every fifth session you're going to prepcheck the whole subject of goals, listing, auditing and so forth, newly, just as you did in a Goals Assessment. And you're going to run the middle ruds, regardless of how often you prepcheck them, every time you stop running a list – regardless of whether it needs it or not. You're going to get the middle rudiments in every time you stop listing on a list."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"LISTING 5 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 201 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, you'll find that there's a periodic order of frequency of action for each list, which diminishes. (Boy, didn't that sound complicated? 'Tisn't. I'll say it in English.) It decreases: The length of time a list is active for one listing before you leave it to the next becomes pro-gressively shorter. You'll get good action on the TA on a list, and then the action will slow and become less impressive. Get your middle rudiments in, go to your next list and list that, and you'll find out you've got your TA action back again, and then that will diminish. So you re always running to diminish TA action. Now, I couldn't tell you, because we can't hazard a guess, where this prime postulate is going to sit on the pc's track. What GPM – what track, or rather what cycle GPM is this thing preceding. Well, we don't know that. So we don't know how much bank we're relieving and so forth. But ordinarily, I'd say a half hour of listing on a list seems overly long, but you proba-bly, you probably at the beginning, on a very mucked-up pc would only be able to list – if you're going to list all the TA action out, see, all the TA action is going to come out and so on – you'd probably find it a session – I just want to give you an example – a session per list. See, you'd list – list one for a session, list two for a session, list three for a session, list four for a session. You understand? I'm not recommending that. Don't put that down as recommended. I'm just giving you how long that list would remain active before the TA action went out of it. It is, however, very unbalancing and impractical to do anything like this. It's impractical. So, you just do – better do it by the count at first or by the minutes or any other way. But if you stop a pc in the middle of an automaticity, he gets a suppression. So, allow – allow-ing for automaticities, you more or less list an arbitrary number for each list, making perhaps fifteen minutes a list early on – something of this sort. You list maybe fifteen minutes on each list: list fifteen minutes, get your middle rudiments in; list your next list fifteen minutes, get your middle rudiments in; list your next list fifteen minutes, get your middle rudiments in; list your next list fifteen minutes and get your middle rudiments in; go back to your first list and list it. Now, of course, none of those lists were exhausted, so your TA action there is decep-tively high. Now, if a pc gets into an automaticity, for heaven's sakes don't stop him in his tracks – please. Please don't stop him in his tracks, because he'll do a suppress. So if a pc is listing rapidly and freely, let him go on listing, but that doesn't mean four sessions. You understand? Doesn't even mean one session, because none of these automaticities will run more than maybe 135, 150, 175 items. That's an awful lot. And that's an extreme automaticity. But they'll just start firing off, you know? \"Waterbuck, tiger, clock, policeman,\" you know? And you're having a hell of a time keeping up with him. Now, on listing it is very, very bad form to do either one of two things: to tell the pc to wait while you write the thing down and to fail to write it down. Either one of those things is a crime. You pays your money and you takes your chance! However, the pc will comm lag in the ordinary course of human existence, adequately as he runs along on a list line to give you lags, at which moment you can catch up. Of course, if you got into a 135-item automaticity that was firing off like a machine gun, you've practi-"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"LISTING 6 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 202 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR cally had it. Now, how you handle that, I don't know. As far as a solution to the thing is con-cerned, it's wrong to stop the pc and it's wrong to miss the items. Well, you say, \"Well, I guess I'll just have to write faster.\" Yeah, that's a good answer; that's a good answer. Another thing you could do, of course, is set a tape recorder going back of you – not advised. You won't find that you have too much trouble with this, but there is some little problem comes up in connection with it. Now, when you're so busy writing, how do you ever find time to keep your auditor's report? That's difficult, too. But actually, pcs can be encouraged to comm lag. [laughs] You say, \"Well, you think there's any more on that particular list, now? 'Who or what would not want to catch catfish?'\" You already knew he'd run out, see? That's not advised either, but I'm afraid I would subterfuge to it in more agonized moments of auditing. Now, your setup on listing is that your lists must be kept of parity length. Try to keep them somewhere on the equal number of pages. Don't let one list run madly ahead of others. And you will see this tendency before you have been listing on four lists very long. You will all of a sudden look over at list three: \"Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\" Ahumpf. It has twenty items on it and everything else has two hundred. Now you're up against the horrors of trying to catch that list up. Now, how do you do it? Well, you don't encourage any additionals on any of the other lists, that's all. You list some on \"Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\" You list quite a few, see? You list as many as you can possibly get listed and then you list briefly the other three lists, just almost as many as are volunteered. You just say the name of the list and the fellow gives you one item. And you say, \"Fine,\" and you say the name of the list and he gives you one item – that's the next list – and you say the name of the next list, and he gives you one item. And then, you of course have gotten your middle rudiments in very carefully when you left this other list. Do you see? Well, get them in again very carefully, you know, and then list eighty on it. You can bring a list back to bal-ance. But really it's quite wrong to get the list far out of balance. Now, in the first part of listing you list more or less arbitrarily, in other words. You list arbitrarily as in terms of time. You keep an arbitrary number increasing. That is to say, you – you're listing maybe twenty per each, and so forth, because it's not important early on. It's such a mass anyhow, that it doesn't make much difference as long as they all get listed. And then as long as there's some equality in the lengths of the lists, you're not going to get lost as you go along the line. But later on there's another factor enters into listing. As you come on down the home-stretch, you will find that you are up against the terrible thing called a free needle. Now, let me point out to you that it is an Auditor's Code break to list a line on which a free needle has appeared. Why is it a Code break? Because then you're running a process that is not produc-ing change. See that? So you come on down the line and you've listed six, eight – something like that – and all of a sudden the needle is floating and free. Well, don't sit there admiring it. A stage four needle can be mistaken, by the way, for a free, floating needle, but only by a very amateur amateur. Stage four is a repetitive sweep up and a stick and a fall, and so forth. Well, the free"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"LISTING 7 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 203 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR floating needle just drifts. It's a beautiful thing to see. You never make the mistake of reading one after you've seen one once – that is a free needle. Well, when you list down to a free needle, you're now going to upset the interesting pattern of your way, because you're only now going to list the next line that produces a needle reaction. So you list down to a free needle and then you read the next line to the pc with the forecast of \"This is a test,\" see? And if that free needle isn't upset – that is to say, if it doesn't stick or bop or do something – you don't list that line. You skip that line. You go on to the next line after that and test it. If it remained free, you go on to the next line and you test it and if it remained free, you go on to the first one and test it; and if it remained free and you could-n't get any of the four lines to react at all, you better find a new goal because that one is dead. But toward the end of listing you will discover that you had better list by test – you better list by test. In other words, line one all of a sudden has taken it into its head to float free and line two doesn't upset it, but line three does, so you'd better list line three to free needle. But if it doesn't go to free needle after a little while, you figure you're running on too far and too fast, you'd better go to line four. Do you see? What you're trying to achieve, there, is list-ing by test. You're only going to list against the needle in other words. If you don't get a nee-dle reaction when you read the line \"Who or what would want to catch catfish?\" then you don't list it. You'll find this way, at the end of the case, you catch up all the inequalities of lines. When those inequalities are all caught up... By the way, they're not numerical inequalities, they'll just be charge inequalities. Don't you see? Your lines now at the end, by doing this, might get quite uneven. They won't become double the length or anything like that, but they will become uneven just because you're listing against needle reaction. Now, I must caution you against the sins of overlisting. The sin of overlisting is of course an Auditor's Code break. The needle is free and it isn't upset by a line and it isn't upset by further items – you're, of course, listing a flat process. It is like running a process that no longer produces change on the case and it'll upset the pc. But that isn't why you mustn't overlist. You can fix up an upset; I'm sure you can keep in rudiments now, thank God. But your goal that you're operating with on this pc is not the prime postulate of his entrance into this universe. It is only the beginning of some cycle or another that you have laid your paws on through a Goals Assessment. And it might be no more ancient than a few centuries – might be that close to PT. Now look, this thing has some dim harmonic against some other goal earlier or something, because there's earlier material that can be pulled up. And you get too enthusiastic and you start yanking in earlier track, be-cause you're pressing the pc to give you items, and the pc obligingly starts picking up the wrong GPM. So you list just to free needle. You don't list beyond free needle on each one of the lists. My, you know, I'll tell you this on the side, it's a great relief to be able to talk to you about what you do with a free needle. [laughter]"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"LISTING 8 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 204 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR So anyway, it's a little merry-go-round and you keep going around: one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four – like a well-ordered engine. And it batters down the gates of Jericho like a bang so there's nothing much to handling it, providing you are listing the right lines and you kept your rudiments in when you did so. Now, toward the end, you will find that getting the middle rudiments in every time you list one item gets to be just a little bit of a strain, and more tends to throw the pc out of session than in. So I would only get them in as I went around each time there was a beefy line listing going on or you did fifteen items or you did ten items or you did something like that. Now get the middle rudiments in. And now you've got two and that only took one or two items each, and then the third one, it took ten items. Well, get your middle rudiments in against the ten. Do you see? And you'll find out you'll make more progress. Otherwise than that, early on in listing, you run it every time you have finished a list – see, every time you've stopped listing on this. Now, the reason a pc stops listing is because the pc has some middle rudiment out – just mark that up. That is the only reason a pc stops listing, whether he's listing a goal or he's listing any kind of a line proceeding from a goal – only one reason, is the middle rudiments are out. A pc, however, can accumulate sufficient residual charge on the subject between ses-sions, and so on, that the middle rudiments have to be prepchecked to get it all swept in. So you could perhaps find that the fourth session after your Prepcheck – your last Prepcheck of the middle ruds – ran more arduously than the one that ran immediately after the Prepcheck session. But listing stops, and – take it from me, it's absolutely true – it only stops when the middle rudiments are out. It does not stop because the pc is out of items. It doesn't stop for any other reason. You could probably force a pc with middle rudiments to list a thousand items on a single one of these lines. The fantastic imbalance which this would cause in a bank would be absolutely frightful. But you could use middle rudiments to make him list quite happily on all thousand before you touched the other three. If you did such a thing, you ought to be shot, but I'm just showing you the extent of the middle rudiments in assisting listing. Never get the idea that the pc has run out of items. Never get the idea that this is a \"Oh well, naturally, he can't think of any more,\" and so forth. This is not true. He hasn't thought of a single one since you started auditing him. He hasn't! He hasn't thought of a single item. Pcs don't think of items – they deal them off the bank. If he had no more items to deal off, he would have no GPM! So obviously, he stops listing only when the middle rudiments have gone out and he, therefore, can't get into communication. Do you see? Now, what do you do after you have brought one goal and four lists down to a free needle on each list? That is the end of your first stage. In earlier days you would have called this a Clear and gone around and patted everybody on the back. Well, we'll still call it a Clear, why not? Because we have – we can say a stable Clear; we can say a Theta Clear; we can say other states of case, don't you see? That guy is sure Clear. You can clear up his needle almost any time by cleaning up the middle ruds on the goal or something, see, or on lines or on life or something. You can always get your free needle back. He wakes up in the morning; he"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"LISTING 9 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 205 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR finds out that he's at 3.24 constantly. Oh, do a little Prepcheck, and you can get that out of the road, and he'll happily wake up every morning dead-on at 3. Do a fish and fumble for fifteen minutes – you could probably accomplish that, you see? Ten minutes, eight minutes. So your listing is auditing and is done as the sole operation of auditing. Now, you want to watch your acknowledgment in listing. This is another little tip. The fellow says, \"A grizzly bear, a lion, a wolf, a – something-other, so on.\" Well, now, of course, the fact you're writing these things down is an acknowledgment all by itself. That's quite an acknowledgment. But you keep up a little humming song of \"Mm-hm,\" and let me tell you, you will be a lot, lot better off than: He says, \"A lion,\" you say, \"Thank you!\" Well, that's the end of that, man. The guy – sits back and – what happened? You're not now going to get the next two items until you get the middle rudiments in. It's operated as an invalidation; you ended cycle. Of course, end of cycle is the end of the list. So listing is sort of on the basis of he says, \"A lion, a catfish, a grizzly bear, a wolf.\" And the auditor each time is saying – or as often as he gets around to it – saying, \"Mm-hm. Any more? All right.\" Say-ing, \"Mm-hm. Got that. All right. Thank you,\" and so on. He's just going on. Now, an auditor doing listing very often feels so much like a secretary obeying the boss that they lose control of the session. I've noticed this as a phenomenon. They get so will-ing to be inflowed on that they don't control the session and that is the first great auditing er-ror in listing. You just keep writing and you never do anything else and the next darn thing you know the pc is out from under, all the rudiments are out – not just the middle rudiments – and, you've got hell to pay. So, when you've stopped listing you give him a good acknowl-edgment – not to blow him out of the chair or something like that – but, you give him a good acknowledgment and say, \"Now we're going to do the middle rudiments.\" And you go ahead and do the middle rudiments in a very brisk fashion. Now, in listing, you peculiarly must look much more like an auditor at the time you are doing rudiments and middle rudiments than you would in a Prepcheck session. You must really look like an auditor when you were doing these things because you've so little looked like an auditor before then. There you are, scribbling away and saying, \"Mm-hm, mm-hm, yes, mm-hm, fine,\" and you write, and you write and paper and trying to catch up. And the pc sees he's got sweat streaming off your brow. He sort of slows down, and we see that we have two pages here now – we've listed two pages on everything else so that sounds good. So we say, \"All right. Now we're going to do some middle rudiments.\" And right about that moment, you fix him with your beady eye, you know? And man you really do those middle rudiments. Now, \"In this session is there anything you have suppressed? Invalidated? Failed to reveal? Yes? What have you failed to reveal? Hmmm. All right, good. I'll check that on the meter. In this session is there anything you have failed to reveal? Good.\" Get that clean – clean as a wolf's tooth – finish it up. You say, \"All right. Now we're going back to listing.\" Put in the R-factor and you read off your next line – read it off as a good auditing command. That's really the last auditing command you're going to give him till you've listed two pages. Don't you see? You're going to read it to him occasionally, going to remind him of it. Your first one is, \"Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\""},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"LISTING 10 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 206 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And he says, \"a grizzly bear,\" and so forth. And he – you go ahead and you write \"Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm, fine, fine, fine.\" Your actual acknowledgment is when you've finished listing for that list. Then you give him the cheery, \"Thank you\" and you've got to take over control of the session again. It's one of these awfully long auditing answers. You see, \"who or what\" are not singu-lar. You consider them as a plural auditing request. And if you consider it as a plurality of auditing request, then you're not always getting in his road by saying – he's saying, \"A grizzly bear, a lion, a – a – a – a wolf,\" and – and right about the time he said, \"a grizzly bear,\" you see, you said, \"Thank you. Now, who or what would not oppose catching catfish?\" What are you doing burning up time, man? He knows what he's talking about. He hasn't lost the audit-ing command, see? What are you doing getting in his road? Well, he sort of runs down and you know you got to make two pages on this sprint. See? He sort of runs down and you say, \"All right. Now, who or what would want – would not oppose catching catfish?\" See? \"Got some more there?\" See, and go on running, and he thinks about it and so forth, and he'll get some more. Now, supposing – supposing you had a goal set and you actually – yourself – and you had to get two pages out of this pc. How are you going to get the two pages out? Well, it's by throwing the middle rudiments in when he just refuses to go on. Well, he says, \"That's all I can think of.\" Well, you see he hasn't thought of any anyhow. So you get the – you get the middle rudiments in. And also get them in when you have finished the list. You see? So that's the additional use. You must get them in when you have stopped listing a list of any length, you see? You must get them in, but you coax him into additional listing by getting them in when he stops. He's sitting there and he's saying, \"Ah, mmmm, hrrrr, I just can't think of any more. I mean, it's all too dreadful.\" And you've got two pages to go and you've only done one. You see? So you better roll up your sleeve and you say, \"All right. Well, thank you.\" See? And, \"Now let's get some mid-dle rudiments in before we go on listing on this list.\" You get the reality factor in there, see? Never let him think you're going over to some other list. Get them in, square them up, find out what it was, and he'll come back up, pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa. You see? You got your two pages. You say, \"All right, that's it. We hit our quota here. Thank you very much. All right. We got that now – thank you. Good. Thank you. Thank you!\" He's now going to run four pages on you, don't you see? You say, \"All right. We're going to do some middle rudiments here before we go on to the next list. All right? Good! Good. All right.\" And go ahead and do so. Pc takes handling on lists. And you sit there as an animated wound-up stenographer, see, you're going to have a bad time. You've got to control that session. But the liability of a listing session is, you look like you're so little in control when you're writing the thing, but of course you, in resumption of control you have to do with a little more power than you would ordinarily do so. But it's all very delicate and it's very easy to smash these items down; it's very easy to glum it up one way or the other. Now, if you fake one item – just like listing a goals list – if you fake one, you know very well you may never null these things; you probably never will."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"LISTING 11 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 207 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And supposing you say, \"Because we're never going to null these things, it doesn't matter whether I understood did he say 'a wolf' or 'a wuff'?\" You've entered a missed withhold into the session and it's going to blow up. So you have to ask him right then when you missed it, \"I didn't get that. Did you say, 'a wolf'?\" \"No,\" he said, \"I said 'a wuff. '\" You say, \"A wuff? What's a wuff?\" See, remember. Remember – TR 2. \"What's a wuff?\" \"Well, a wuff's a wuff. Well, they're big, boundy things that – they're big, boundy things, you know, and they have hair all over them. And some – oh, they were on some other planet around here!\" \"Oh, a kind of animal on another planet. Is that it?\" \"Oh, yeah,\" he said. \"A wuff.\" \"Oh-ho!\" you say. \"Well, good. Good.\" And you write it down. [laughter] But you just let it go on the basis of \"Mm-hm, I'm just going to fake it in,\" you know? And the next thing you know he's slowing down and you're slowing down, and your auditing is tiring you out, and you don't know whether you're going or coming. Now, keep your R-factor in but also keep those missed withholds off the auditor, huh? TR 2 says that you understand. And he gives you a bunch of porridge and you don't know where to pour it. You better find out, man! He sounds quite – quite – quite raspy sometimes. He'll sound quite snarly to you sometime. \"What are you – idiot? What's the matter with you? You don't know what a wuff is? You know? A wuff! You know? A wuff! A wuff! A wuff! A wuff! A wuff!\" Well, the reason he's acting like this is because he thinks he – you have a missed with-hold. That's the only reason the asperity, and as soon as you eventually get it, if you really do get it – the apparency of the missed withhold disappears and that makes it all right, see? The thing to do wrong at that time is not to get it. You want to know what a wuff is; he can tell you what a wuff is. Of course, it really doesn't matter to a hill of beans whether – factually, whether you get that it's a wuff or a wolf or a what, because you're never going back over it again, except if you didn't understand it. And a falsity enters into the session there which can crash the whole session, you see? Next thing you know you don't like auditing this pc. Your hand gets so tired when you write. There'll be all kinds of things like this. It's just missed withholds; you didn't know what the hell the pc was talking about. You were missing them, then the pc gets sensitive to these things, you know? And then it enters into the tone of your voice. And next thing you know, his session is going out, and he doesn't feel like listing, and you can't keep the middle rudi-ments in, and God help us all. Keep your R-factor up and for God's sakes understand what the pc is saying before you go on. Very, very important. Now, you look over the lists quite routinely, count them up; make sure they're in par-ity; do good administration on the thing; make it so these things can be looked over and so on."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"LISTING 12 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 208 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR One of the things you do with a list or one of the things you will notice about a list, is when an actual goal is being listed out that the items will transfer over from list to list. And it al-most is a test that when an item has been on all four lists, why, that's about the way it is. It's very funny, but I mean, the item will transfer. \"Officer.\" \"An officer is something that would want to catch catfish,\" and then \"An of-ficer is something that would not want to catch catfish,\" and then \"An officer is something that would oppose catching catfish,\" and then \"An officer is something that would not oppose catching catfish.\" As idiotic as it may seem, he's even thinking of a game warden, you know? He would not oppose catching catfish. By this time, it's gone the full route, and all four flows are discharged off the item, and the item is fully discharged against other items and it lies null. So you find the whole list tears on through this. Pc is trying to do this or is trying to strain at it or something like that – he will soon fall wise to the whole thing. Well, now, that is listing. After listing is completed, find yourself a new goal. I wish I could tell you how many goals there should be on the new list for – to find the new goal. I can't at this particular time. However, I can make a very good forecast founded on very accu-rate information that the list would only be about half as long and that the length of time it would take to find it is briefer and the amount of items it would take to list it out are less and you get – as we already have had ample experience of in Routine 3s – you get a dwindling quantity of everything. And eventually you can't get anything and nothing will stay in and so forth, and you hit the pc on the rim and he rings for an hour. You should, with this particular thing, wind up at the other end of the line with a – with a Theta Clear. Now, it's also my guess that on most pcs you will eventually find a type of goal that you find in the basics of Scientology. These things will register – suddenly register. Why didn't they register before? Is there one basic goal for all pcs? Oh, yes! But they daren't reach it and it's not real. You want the goal that registers now – not the perfect goal – because they eventually get back earlier and earlier and earlier and earlier on the track and they will eventually run into prime, prime, prime (exclamation point) postulate, which sweeps all before it. You will see then that there's a broader generality going into this thing and its regular progress back on the track. Different areas are being tapped; different subject matter being hit. What happens to the GPM as it is being listed? Actually, the repetition of items gets the discharge off of the basic postulate which you call a goal. And the definition of a goal is: a basic postulate for whom the individual has taken full responsibility. Therefore, as that tends to be discharged – that is to say, the items (bricks built up on that postulate) – tend to not re-sist the postulate anymore, the postulate itself runs out. And because it is the only brick that is keeping the house built, you don't get the house falling down – this is not the result of it. You don't get the house being blown away and moved over into the next county; you don't get the house being disintegrated or sold as scrap. It's just, oddly enough, the house diminishes and diminishes, and the bricks get thinner and thinner, and you eventually have a no-brick, no-basement, no-first-floor, no-roof, no-chimney edifice. The pc is now sitting there with all the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"LISTING 13 SHSBC-175 – 14.6.62 LEVEL 3 209 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR experience accumulated on the line and none of the mass, because there's no alter-is con-nected with it. There's no way known to man or beast to get a prime postulate back earlier than his experience. So of course he's had it. You say, \"How stable is a Clear?\" A Clear is stable as you're unable to put a prime postulate ahead of the whole track again. See, that's how stable a Clear is. And of course you can't do it. Now, that doesn't say that you couldn't get the pc sitting there gritting his teeth making a new prime postulate and going out and fighting the whole world to make that postulate stick and not have him accumulate a GPM – in another two hundred million years he'd have some-thing to show for a GPM. He'd be in rather serious trouble, let us say, in fifteen or twenty tril-lion. He'd be having a rough time of it in another – another hundred trillion from now. And two hundred trillion, well, he'd be in the same condition you were when you came into Scien-tology. All right. Well, that is listing and that is what is done with it and I wanted you to get all the data I had on it. Probably more data will come up, but not all the mistakes have been made yet, so I can't settle them out. Thank you very much. Good night!"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 211 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS A lecture given on 17 July 1962 Thank you. All right. This is lecture two, July 17 AD 12, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course and this – easiest thing to do is to give you a lecture, but I might give you a question period. Which do you want? Audience: Lecture. You want a lecture? Audience: Yes. All right. I'll go on and give you a lecture on the subject of ARC breaks and their anatomy. The training of metering is probably the hardest hump to cross in the absence of proper educational aids. During World War II an enormous number of visual aids were devel-oped and the whole principle of visual aids sort of moved into view. And at one time or another in Scientology, we've had visual aids of one kind or an-other, but the biggest need at the present moment is a visual aid which parades out meter reads. And we're lucky here at Saint Hill having a TV closed circuit television. And this as-sists to a remarkable degree and of course, tomorrow night three luckless students whose names are not yet known will benefit us with some sessions. I wouldn't guarantee that they – that we won't get a repeat of one or two of last, you know. I saw they were – I just looked over and saw they were feeling comfortable. Now, because one television camera is posed on the meter which the auditor is using and another one on the session and because you have a picture of the thing going on, you have it pretty well taped. You can sit there and you can watch it and so forth. But of course, that's for a limited period of time. And although – to give you very sharp examples of how auditing is done, this is invaluable. We nevertheless need an extension of that particular type of training. We're working right now on stereo equipment whereby one side of the tape is used to duplicate a meter read and the other side of the tape gives you the vocal. And then you hook the meter, you see, onto the meter-read-stereo line and then you hook a speaker onto the verbal side and, of course, you get coordinated meter reading. Estimate was given me the last night that we'll probably have this in a couple of weeks, which is very, very rapid."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 2 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 212 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR This device of course, is exportable. By using the same stereo tape recorder and by copying the tapes on stereo recorders, we can actually put these tapes all over the world. In other words, we can put proper sessioning all over the world. Our sessioning now is very standardized in that it's a very smooth workout of repetitive commands and that sort of thing. And no great changes are expected in that, so the tapes will be valuable. But the idea is that you'd have a number of auditors sitting there each one – this is the ne plus ultra. I'll expand the idea a little bit for you. Of course, you could have one stereo tape recorder and one meter and one auditor be-ing trained. But last night we were going into it a little bit further here, the auditor could push a button and get some help and the guy who was monitoring all the co-audit sessions could throw a switch and read the meter on the session that was going forward and so forth. But a similar circuit to this probably will eventually be worked out whereby several meters can be plugged into a switchboard and will all read and where you either have a mi-crophone to each of these auditors sitting there holding one of these meters or you just have a central microphone in the room, whatever is simplest. And this thing of course, makes all the meters read, so you're not butchering up some pc. The problem is you got some pc who is sitting there and you're asking him questions; you're not clearing it up and all that sort of thing and the pc knows it's sort of a test and so on. Nevertheless, a little bit of strain goes on the thing and I imagine before now you've probably had to clean up some of these practice sessions when you're actually in the auditing section. I imagine you've picked a few of those things up. And that's rather hard. Particularly since TR 1 tends to be very poor at that particular stage because the auditor really doesn't want to know the answer. He's asking the guinea pig pc, you see, who is not a pc at all, various questions in order to get a meter read, not to get the answer from the pc. So this, of course, throws TR 1 and its basic fundamental completely out. It's – TR 1 is the desire to get a response from the pc. And you want a meter response from the pc, but you really don't want to know. You get the idea? So this really crosses up the wires on the poor pc. Nevertheless, I imagine this system of instruction will continue on to the end of time. Here and there you will still have nothing but that system of instruction, you see. You're going to teach fifteen auditors who are in lower south Pasadena and you're go-ing to train these guys up to a point where they can read a meter. And you haven't got any stereo and you have no tapes and you have no switchboard and that sort of thing, so how are you going to do it? Well, you're going to do it by butchering up pcs, see. It's more important that you learn than it is that some pcs get somewhat upset, because you can always straighten it out if the sessioning is good. But if an auditor, you see, doesn't ever learn how to do it, you'll never straighten out anything! So what takes priority? What takes priority is the auditor learning how to read a meter. And if you ever get too softheaded and you find yourself completely without equipment and too softhearted, you see, about the whole thing and decide this is too hard to do and decide to fake it up by lifting fingers on cans and doing other things of this particular character, my"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 3 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 213 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR advice to you is, don't, because the very pc who is sitting there serving as a guinea pig de-pends utterly, in nearly all cases, on auditors in his vicinity learning how to read a meter for his own solution of case and his eventual clearing. See. So it's sort of give a little, take a little and get a little back. And get an awful lot back, you see. But, I'll give you that as meter training. That is the most fundamental action then of meter training – is for this exact combination to exist. The auditor sitting there holding a me-ter. The (quote) \"pc\" sitting there holding the cans. The coach standing there back of the audi-tor correcting the auditor on the reads. The auditor asking questions – we don't care what he is using. It is perfectly all right to use somebody else's goals list. Don't read the pc's own goals list to him, by the way. That's verboten. You can always take somebody else's goals list. You'll get reads on it. They won't rerun out either. Very virtue – they don't flatten. I actually would – you'd need practice in asking rudiments questions or something like that. Well, that's a horse of another hue. You probably should use the right rudiments ques-tions because they'll be the most likely to get cleaned up in the long run. But the person who's doing the auditing is asking a question and getting a meter read and then calling it and getting an answer or not from the coach. In fact, he probably better not get an answer from the coach. It better be understood that nothing is to be answered. That makes it all missed withholds, but then it's understood and the reality of the situation is far better. And then you've got this coach standing back of the auditor looking at the meter and correcting whether or not the auditor read them right. All right. Let me show you the – at once the basic difficulty is we have no guarantee that the coach knows how to read an E-Meter. No guarantee whatsoever. So we just enter this fantastic piece of randomity that, for the purposes of the drill, the coach is right. That's fantas-tic randomity to enter into the situation, see. The immediate result of this is going to be in the initial stages of the drill, a fantastic confusion. And it'll get so confused that out of desperation everybody sooner or later is going to learn how to read the meter. [laughter] Now, as I say, that is the most fundamental and the crudest form of meter training. And yet I dare say in the year 2000 or 2050, why, there'll be somebody in upper Lower Slo-bovia having to train some auditors and that is exactly the way he will do it. It's inevitable because he hasn't got the rest of the equipment, don't you see. Now, out of this, believe it or not, comes learning. You eventually learn it, but the confusion that results – you see the needle fall off the pin, and the coach says – you say, \"That reads.\" And the coach says, \"That's null.\" The coach is forcing you to agree to a falsehood. So don't agree to it. Just let him say so. Nobody asked you to agree to it. He simply called it. Isn't that right? I used to get by in being audited – I could be audited by everybody or anybody for the simple reason that I'd always answer the auditing question. I only came a cropper when I was given four auditing questions and not told which one to answer. That fouled me up a little bit,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 4 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 214 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR but up to that time the stable datum I got by on, is somebody asked me to do something I did exactly what they asked me to do. You would be surprised how mild an approach that is to pc'ing. Just always do exactly what you're told and you don't get into any trouble, of course, because there's no alter-is in the situation. The auditor says, \"Do you have a present time problem?\" And you say, \"Yes.\" The auditor sits there alertly waiting for you to say something else. And of course, you don't say anything else because he hasn't asked you anything else. And finally the auditor says, \"Well, what was the problem?\" And you tell him, see. The auditor says, \"Take your right hand now and put it on the back of your right hand.\" Go ahead and try to do it. The auditor will wake up after a while that you can't and cancel the auditing command, you see. You can only get into trouble by saying, \"I can't do that. What are you doing tearing me to ribbons, see, by asking me to do things that are impossible? And why don't you go back to the Academy and learn how to audit,\" see. And you can get in trouble that way because you're protesting the alter-is. But don't worry about that. As pcs, you'll always protest the same way, so nobody's asking you to be a certain type of pc. I'm just giving you an example of the thing. So in these drills you will get a certain amount of alter-isness and confusion. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised but what somebody – could get away more or less with reading the meter, wouldn't pass into a stage of not knowing whether the meter was actually on his lap or not, much less what it was reading, you see. Falls off the pin, the coach says, \"That's null.\" And the thing is absolutely motionless. It hasn't moved for a minute or more. And the question is asked and the coach says, \"That's a read,\" see. Well, you get beyond your confusion by not getting into fights about it. Now that is very crude – a very crude drill and so on, but as I say, it'll be used for a long time. Now, as we improve on this drill with a stereo tape and other mechanisms, we of course, can play back play a tape and make maybe four or eight meters, something like that, in people's hands, read. And maybe, so we don't get any room lag, a microphone speaker around the neck of every auditor, so he hears the tape. And he hears the auditor say, \"Do you have a present time problem?\" Sees the read, you see. Then you have the coach who is work-ing off a mimeographed sheet, because the correctness of every read on that tape has been established. And it's marked by rudiments. The first question, \"Do you have a present time problem?\" is followed by a reaction and it says what it is on the tape. Now, these tapes are not perfect meter tapes. That is their main virtue. Some of them are early. Some of them are late. Some of them are on the button. And some of them are called reads when they are actually null. You know. There's a confusion involved with it. You see?"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 5 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 215 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And so it says, \"Do you have a present time problem?\" and then right under it in a long string, \"Right-right-wrong-right-wrong-wrong-right.\" See, that's all the coach calls. See, there are just that many reads and they are – that many were right and that many were wrong in that sequence and order. So it becomes very simple coaching. That's just one use of the situation. Now, your next action would be something like this. We put a whole bunch of audi-tors, about eight auditors in the room, with meters on pcs and we have them all onto a switchboard and that is – goes to one stereo recorder and in turn we take a section of each one's session. We got a microphone hanging on the chest of each one and the cans pass from the pc to the switchboard back to the auditor's meter. And then they bypass off that onto the Instruc-tor's meter, amplified and onto a stereo recorder. So at the end of the goldfish-bowling, all he has to do is start the tape again. Have some people coach this or inspect it or look it over. They will see how many reads they are missing. They'll see – they'll see everybody's auditing. They won't see all of their own auditing, but they'll see some of their auditing, don't you see. Take some of each session that was going on in the room and then play it back to all auditors. See how many types of arrangements that can be made on this. Well, you could make an endless number of tapes in that particular line, so that's what we're – particularly what we're trying to develop. Now, the difficulties of teaching an auditor to read a meter are enormously rewarded by the fact that you have productive sessions. And I assure you that there is no benefit in be-ing audited by an auditor who cannot read a meter. That's pretty ghastly because it leaves one out of session. One's statements are not being accepted. One's reads are not being accepted, see. One's no reads are not being accepted. And the net result is the pc is sitting there trying to keep his own rudiments in because, of course, the meter and the auditor have cancelled them-selves out by incorrect reads here and there. We can't have an occasional correct read, see. Actually, we can't even afford an occa-sional error. Well, a lot of sessions running along, early on in student auditing have an occa-sional correct read. And then they graduate up to only an occasional error. And then they would graduate on up to no errors. Actually, that tolerance can be attained. I don't have ARC breaky pcs. My pcs don't ARC break. Once in a blue moon I've chopped one or gotten mad at one, snarled, something like that along the line – even as thou. And of course, have gotten an ARC breaky pc. But then turned right around and pulled them right straight out of it so they were all smiles. But my expectancy of auditing is a no-ARC-break session. In fact I would be quite amazed to have an ARC breaky session. It would startle me no end. And that's with very rough pcs, you see, easy ones, rough ones and so forth. I have no expectancy of an ARC breaky session."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 6 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 216 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR I expect to get everything that the pc tells me. I expect to find out everything I'm sup-posed to find out about the pc. That's the expectancy. Now, I'm not talking about what a good auditor I am. I'm just talking to you about what my personal experience in sessions is. So you are fighting with a problem I don't have. So give me that, because it's taken me a long time to understand what you were doing, see. Any trouble you were having was rela-tively incomprehensible. I have – haven't got a reality on it as an auditor, but I do have a real-ity on it as a pc. And of course, as a pc I never knew what was going wrong on the other side of the meter because I wasn't reading the meter while I was being a pc, so that datum was barred to me, too. I would occasionally think that I was kind of in rough emotional condition or I must be tired or I must have too many present time problems or something like this. The pc actu-ally never assigns the right reason for his ARC break. That you can count on. The reason for the ARC break is almost never accurate. Even if it's on the same subject like, \"You missed a withhold on me\" the pc will give you the wrong missed withhold, see. The ordinary action is and what you can ordinarily expect, is that the pc is upset and that there is some truth in what the pc is saying, but that what the pc is calling the actual cause is not the actual cause, that the actual cause occurred earlier than the pc is telling you. That is routine. You could expect that just as much as you can expect darkness when the sun goes down. Even if he told you exactly what was wrong in the session, that you had missed a read, it will not be the read that he says you missed. It will be an earlier read whether by five min-utes or ten minutes or something like that. If he – if he calls you on the third rudiment which is now the \"PTP,\" see – if he calls you on that one, there's probably one in the first rudiment, you see. He says you missed the read on the PTP. You probably didn't miss the read on the PTP – you probably did, but the one that is upsetting him is the one on the auditor. See, you missed an earlier one than he says. That is invariable. There will always be that much alter-is in a pc's protest. It's always earlier than he says. But because the pc is in a state of alter-is anyhow – you touch a pc's bank, he's in a state of alter-is. You can count on that. Absolutely count on it. Touch a pc's bank, he's in a state of alter-is. That's one of these other – another invariable maxim or figure lines. You run – you run ARC Straightwire and the worst pc will never answer the auditing command at all. Will say he did, but he doesn't. Therefore, you must never run a, \"Yes\" re-sponse-type process without also asking, \"What was it?\" Otherwise, you never spot this alter-is. I'm now talking about the – well, this was given in the 3rd ACC. Alter-is. Pc always does something else. Or does something entirely different. You say, \"Recall a time you were in communication with someone.\" And the pc will actually sometimes think that he has done this when in actual fact he has recalled a time he was speaking not to anyone at all. Now, that is a very innocent pc error, see. That's a very mild one. In the pcs that are the worst that you will have to do with – your very neurotic institutional type – you know, I mean in that band, they never even answer it as a communication."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 7 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 217 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR You say, \"Recall a time when you were in communication with someone,\" you see. And they won't even go so alter-is as to recall a time they spat, see. They will alter-is completely over on to something else. They will mock up a dog. Not even that they ever communicated with dogs. These things are totally disconnected and disas-sociated. You say to them, \"Put your shoe on the window seat\" and they will throw their hat out through the area over the door. And here's the oddity. They think they're doing what you said. To look at them and to listen to them, they think you're doing what they said. But, if you let them get away with this you have stepped on this button of acknowledging a lie and will at that moment, by the missed command doingness, set up that alter-is in the session. So you've acknowledged a lie. Now, Mr. Pc, let's say this is institutional stuff and you say, \"Now put your shoe on the mantle\" and the pc takes his hat and throws it in through the port over the door. And if you say, \"Thank you very much. That's fine,\" you have ended the session right there because that pc becomes unauditable. Because the degree that they alter-is monitors the degree that they protest alter-is. These things are a constant. They are of the same order of magnitude. If a pc alter-ises, he screams like mad if any alter-is occurs. That is if you acknowledge the alter-is. See, he screams as hard as he alter-ises. Got the idea? So the worse off a pc is, is measured by the degree that the pc alter-ises in his think-ing. That is a direct index of bad off. But of course, it's bad off on certain subjects because one person will alter-is on one subject and one will alter-is on another. And it's only those pcs that alter-is on all subjects that are – fall into the neurotic and – oh, pardon me, pardon me, fall into the psychotic band. But, the worse they do it, the less they can tolerate it. So you mustn't say cheerfully, \"Oh, thank you\" and \"That's fine\" when the guy throws his hat out the door. You told him to put his shoe on the window. Now, of course, telling him to do something before you have some control of him, tell him to do some independent action that you aren't exactly monitor-ing before you have any control of him at all, is just asking for it. You should be walking into this by gradients. But about the only way to solve that situation is just skip what he did with the hat, take his hand, lay it on his shoe, take his shoe off, move him over to the window and put the – put the shoe via his hand on the window ledge and then say, \"Thank you very very much.\" And do you know, he's liable to scream at how terrible you are and what a bum you are, but auditing will continue. So you mustn't acknowledge the improperly done auditing command because you are okaying alter-is. And that renders you very suspect. And yet the pc acts as though he wants you to and acts as though the only thing that will please the pc is the same alter-is. This is what he wants you to do. That's why you never do what the pc tells you. It's fatal."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 8 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 218 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The pc acquires this alter-is. Oh, God. Talk about logic, man. They can back it up with ENIACs and Einsteins. Every reason under the sun why you ought to do exactly what they said just now. Truth of the matter is just before they started giving you orders they alter-ised some-thing. They flipped a command on you, they didn't do what you said, they – something went wrong in the session. Something went haywire. And then they started giving you orders be-cause they're trying to keep their own session in. You see what happens? They start giving you orders when they have ceased to accept you as an auditor. It's not actually something that you ought to pay any more than diagnostic attention to. You say this pc has some missed withholds. What's a missed withhold? Well, it's an unintentional withhold perhaps. The pc tried to tell you something and thought you didn't get it. See, that's the commonest one. The most fundamental, however, is the meter read missed withhold. Earlier than all of these difficulties existed, you read something wrong. And you told the pc he didn't have a present time problem when he did have. You told the pc that he did have a present time problem when he didn't. So you get – you've acknowledged something wrong in the session that is one of the deep fundamentals of the session, such as rudiments. You've acknowledged something wrong. You've done something reversewise and after that you can expect alteration, alteration. And alteration will exist up to the point where the pc started to give you orders. Now, how come the pc's giving you orders? Well, the pc's giving you orders because the pc has ceased to have an auditor. The gradual breakdown of a session passes through that as its low point on the totem pole. Pc suddenly tells me, \"Would you like to – you should really let me go to the bathroom and smoke a cigarette and that sort of thing.\" If I – got to that point – I don't get to this point in session, but if I got to that point in a session – I would not say, \"How am I going to ac-knowledge or handle this situation?\" see. I wouldn't waste any time on that. I would say, \"What was wrongly or not acknowledged, when, earlier in the session?\" That'd be my first mechanism, see. Just bang. What is it? See, back there. It would be something like this: \"When did you first feel I didn't hear you?\" With enough confidence in my meter to know that I didn't miss a meter read, I'd fall back on the other. I'd have to think that the pc said apples or peaches and then thought I didn't get this, see. Pc has got an inadvertent withhold, now there's no communication existing. But it would be earlier. I wouldn't take up the idea of the pc giving me orders. I'd trace this thing right back in the session to the first time the pc had gotten an inadvertent or actual withhold or didn't do the auditing command, which of course amounts then to a withhold. See. What – what happened? When? What happened back in the – early in the session? Let's put that area right. Let's not start to cope with the building falling down. Let's not worry about that because we got something wrong earlier."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 9 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 219 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Now, the reason some people wind up not understanding that a missed withhold is the cause of all ARC breaks is they don't look early enough and, therefore, don't cure it with a missed withhold. See, this pc says, \"Well, you better let me have a cigarette now and give me a break, because in actual fact I'm pretty tired and so forth.\" If your response is to find out what withhold you just missed you probably won't get it, because your pc has gone to that length, time has stretched out after the withhold and it's minutes, tens of minutes, earlier. When you've had a blow, the blow has actually begun an hour to an hour and a half before the blow occurred and it'd be a missed withhold of some kind or another. And you've tried to acknowledge something that you shouldn't have acknowledged or you've shoved off on the pc something – like you've got a present time problem when he did-n't have or something like that. Some fundamental alteration has taken place where you were acknowledging an untruth and ignoring a truth. And that situation has existed much earlier. And when that situation first started to ex-ist, you got the beginning of the deterioration of the session. And to trace it back, you've got to trace it back earlier in the session. Therefore, a very good way to handle this kind of a situation is to end the session and begin one. See, that's short sessioning. That, of course, gets you back to your beginning rudi-ments – is where you probably missed it. Now, regardless of the complications of what you do about it, let's handle instead the fundamentals of exactly what occurs. ARC – this is about September 1950, California lectures and I think it's contained in Notes on the Lectures and an axiom about 1952 contains the data that ARC is the equivalent of understanding. And the component parts of understanding are A, R and C. I won't bother to go into the dissertation by which this is evolved, but you frankly can mathematically evolve this fact. And it's quite fascinating. Affinity, reality and communication are interdependent upon one another. And the sum of affinity, reality and communication or the absence of affin-ity, reality and communication add up to understanding or misunderstanding. Low on the Tone Scale the ARC is, of course, nothing but a misunderstanding, see. You don't have any reality on Russia. Russia doesn't have any reality on you. Of course, you don't understand Russia. Russia doesn't understand you. Of course, there's no communication between you and Russia. See, it's as simple as that. Therefore, everything is misemotional from that point thereon. Now, when a pc gets going, you're liable to attribute the lack of comprehension in the session to anything except the mechanics. You're not interested in what's comprehensible or not comprehensible or sensible or not sensible. You just got to make sure that you understand what the pc said. When you fail to understand what the pc said, ARC breaks down, because understand-ing has broken down. And that is the anatomy of TR 4. TR 4 says that you comprehend what"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 10 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 220 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR the pc said. You understand what the pc said and you acknowledge what the pc said and you return the pc to session. And every time I turn around somebody's trying to give me the word that we need a new TR 4. I don't see what they need a new TR 4 for, they haven't used the one they got. Perfectly brand-new. I mean, why use a new one? They – you see that understand is the clue. That is the key to this. Now, in-sessioning is, of course, interested in own case and willing to talk to the audi-tor, of course, about one's own case. But interested in own case and willing to talk to the audi-tor. So if understanding drops out, willing to talk to the auditor drops out and then interest in own case tends to drop out because one feels one doesn't understand as much about one's own case as one just understood. Now, the greater the understanding the easier it is to blow things. In other words, you can start – if your understanding on something is high it goes out zip-zip-zip-zip-zip. And if your understanding on it is low you stand there and gaze at it stupidly. There it is. What are you going to do about it? Nothing. Huh, da. See? Yet all of a sudden you say, \"I know what that's all about.\" Zip-zip-zip. And that's – that's it. You've done an as-is. So, as-is-ness depends on understandingness. Alteration inevitably pursues lack of comprehension. Alteration pursues failure to un-derstand. You get an alter-is when you don't get an understand. You see? And not-is accompanies the notion of incomprehensibility. You can't understand it. It's not possible to understand it. Therefore, let's just shove it out of sight. That's what any non-sentient society or very unalert society does with its insane. Nobody can understand the in-sane, so you've got to put them out of sight. And the degree that they don't understand the insane or think they don't understand the insane so they hide them. They squash them out of existence and they actually try to kill them one way or the other. In this civilization today – very modern, very kind, very genteel and so forth – they sterilize them, they cut their brains out, they make idiots out of them, they subject them to tortures the like of which wouldn't have been tolerated from the barre noir in the middle of the Dark Ages, you see. Fantastic. You mean in this enlightened time all this is going on? Well, of course, they've alter-ised – they failed to understand the insane, then they alter-ised it. And now they've got it into place where they've even got psychiatrists in charge of them. You see how far you can get. And this is total alter-is. And they don't look at what's insane about the person, they give them classified labels. They label them. And the label actually, has nothing to do with the insanity. The label has to do with the insane asylum the person is in. Oh, you think I'm kidding you as usual. But that happens to be the truth. If a patient is moved from an area that has sex criminals, you know, he ceases to be a sex criminal and be-comes a schizophrenic if he goes to a hospital that specializes in schizophrenics. Patients are now classified after the hospital they attend. See how nutty you can get. But, of course, what"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 11 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 221 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR is comprehensible about this situation? Well, that people don't comprehend it. Don't you see? That itself is an understanding. All they had to do is say I don't understand it and they come off immediately off the high horse of pretending to understand the alter-is and of course that is the deepest lie of all. So you get this kind of a situation of pretended understandingness, followed by fantas-tic cruelty and downscale activities going in that particular cycle. So if you sit there complain-ing – I'm not putting you in the same category at all – but you will actually in some little vi-gnette run this cycle. You sit there and you pretend to understand the pc when you don't and you pretend to understand him when you don't and you pretend to understand him when you don't and the next confounded thing you'll be mad at the pc here. And you go out of session spitting your teeth out about this pc – the stupid jerk and yip-yap and snarl – and you're snarling about the pc. When you find yourself snarling about a pc, all you have to do is recall the first time you didn't understand what the pc was doing. Now, that is not as successful as treating the mechanics. You see, understanding is in the realm of knowingness and not-knowingness. That's a very very high echelon pair of postu-lates. That's right after Native State. And we're really in the esoteric wonder world. So those buttons don't operate very smoothly on people. To some degree they operate, but you'll find they occasionally lay an egg, too. They're too esoteric, see. They're way off, you see. That's really running the pc over his head. No, but a severed communication line is very comprehen-sible. That's very comprehensible. So the missed withhold, the intention to put a communication line through or the in-tention not to put a communication line through, each one treated in reverse to the way it ought to be treated, is the way the pc understands this. This is where understanding comes in with the pc, see. He sees that. He sees that and he reacts to that right now. Therefore, we talk about missed withholds, missed withholds. Actually we're talking about understanding and ARC on a very high echelon. But you can handle the mechanics of the missed withhold – bang, bang. Everybody understands that. Because it's the cure, because it's a sufficiently low-level concept that the pc understands it and you understand and his mind responds to it and everything is dandy and it all works out when we say, \"Missed withhold.\" Now, what actually could be a missed withhold? We have the communication in-tended and not received. See, that is truth unacknowledged – recalling you to the first lecture. Pc intends to communicate and it is never received. We express that as the inadvertent withhold. But that's unacknowledged truth, the very thing he has protested about since the beginning of the universe, see. And it sits on prime postulate and his own goal line and every-thing else. So he screams like a banshee when you run into this one. He says, \"It's hot in here.\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 12 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 222 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And the auditor says, \"Sh-nyaa.\" Or the auditor says nothing. You will then find the pc saying, \"It's hot in here.\" And if the auditor says nothing, watch the pc start to sweat. The pc will start to mani-fest it physiologically if he cannot put it across verbally. He's going to make this stick. Thetans are fantastic to this degree. They're always going to make it stick if they possibly can. And you're not now in a session. You've got somebody who's trying to set up a brand-new universe all based on the postulate that it's hot in here. And the session becomes a ball of uni-verse based on this, \"It's hot in here\" because it's an unacknowledged truth. You got that side of it? See, that's just 50 percent of it. Now, the other 50 percent is he tells you, \"No, I have never had anything to do with women.\" And you, you knucklehead, say, \"Good. Fine. Thank you very much. Here is the next (rudiment or question or Zero).\" Now what have you done? Understand it in terms of communication. He's put through a whopping big lie. This has no truth in it whatsoever. And you have said, \"Wonderful! Fine! Thank you! Oh, give me some more lies!\" In either case, your session will blow up. That's how you blow up a session, see. Now, there you can see it visibly on the communication line. As far as the reality of it is concerned, do you see that the reality also fits in there? The reality of it is the pc thinks it is hot in there. It doesn't even have to be hot for the pc to have a reality that it's hot. This is actu-ally the only thing he's trying to put across – that he thinks it is hot in there. His commentary. You see? And all you acknowledge is the fact that he thinks it is hot in there and everything is fine. As long as that truth is acknowledged, you don't leave him on a withhold of truth. Then everything goes along fine because the R stays up. And then, of course, perforce, the A stays up. Now, he put you through, \"I have never had anything to do with women in my whole life.\" Now, he has actually posed a very low R. It's a lousy lie. He can't think much of you if he thinks he – you know, if he's postulated the A of, \"You're a nut\" and he doesn't like you. You see that? Because he said already, \"I can't trust you with the truth,\" – not as a conse-quence to your having missed something else. This would be an entirely independent opera-tion, see. He says, \"Well, I can't trust you with the truth\" is what he's saying. He's saying you're not trustworthy. What is your A there? Your affinity's very poor. So now you say, \"Oh, fine! Thank you! Oh, good! Yeah! Three cheers, you know. Oh, fine!\" And he says, \"Well, if this is the kind of session we're going to have around here, we're going to have A of that character where I don't trust the auditor. We're going to have R"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 13 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 223 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR which is a cracking big lie like this and therefore this wasn't a C at all because there was no truth in it to be comprehended.\" And the funny part of it is, is you can reverse the whole triangle – flip – by making sure that you didn't buy that lie. Making sure what you bought. Your Zero Question of, \"Have you ever had anything to do with women?\" And your pc says to you, \"Ah, no, I've never had anything to do with women in my whole life.\" And the auditor says, \"All right. I'll check that on the meter. Have you ever had any-thing to do with women? That reads.\" And the pc says, \"Ho-oh-ha-ya. Ha-ha-ha-ha. I did have a little bit to do with women. When I was two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and twelve, there were incidents. And when I was thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen and twenty, there were incidents. And then we really got busy.\" And you get these all stretched out, why, you've bought nothing from him but the truth, man. The ARC is out of sight. You cannot create an ARC break by establishing truth. You can only create an ARC break by refusing truth and by accepting lies. And of course, the whole thing sums up under the heading of refusing truth. You refuse truth, you have an ARC break. You fail to establish truth as an auditor, you'll have an ARC break. You cease to handle truth, you'll have an ARC break. You cease to have as your primary stock in trade the ingredient known as truth and you, of course, have no more control in the session. Because you don't have a pc who is in-session. You sit there and handle anything but truth and you're in the soup. And a lot of you go on the basis and get into trouble, because you think it'd be terribly unkind to prick this guy's bubble. You say, \"Well, I don't know. I mean he says he's never had anything to do with women in his life. Well, it'd be awfully embarrassing ...\" I feel this on TV sometimes. I'm rather unwilling to expose all of the pc's overts, be re-sponsible for... I'm perfectly willing for the pc's overts to be exposed to me, but I am actually not willing to possibly damage the pc by exposing his overts elsewhere, don't you see. So, on TV I feel a little bit queasy like this. So I know how you feel sometimes. And this girl says, \"Oh, I'm a virgin.\" And you say, \"Well, that's nice. That's sweet.\" And you let it go by. And she's cutting your throat. And she's not in-session. What's going to happen? And you have this ... See? You're running something like old Formula – what was it – Thirty-three? \"What ques-tion shouldn't I ask you?\" And it's very very often you'll get this from a girl, \"Oh, you shouldn't ask if I'm a vir-gin.\""},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 14 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 224 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR \"All right. Are you a virgin?\" – see, it was just the old pattern response. And she says, \"Well, yes, I – I – I am a virgin.\" And you say, \"All right. Good. Fine. Thank you.\" Because you think it would be un-seemly or something to inquire further into this thing. You should ask yourself why the hell she mentioned it in the first place. How come she brought it up? See. So you got – that's what you got a meter for. And later on in this session, why, she's blowing her top and way out of session. You can't get the rudiments in and that sort of thing. Well, you departed from truth. You didn't follow it down and get at truth. That was all. There was a moment of untruth in the session. It is very unkind to leave one of those things in a ses-sion – to be so diffident that you don't want to establish truth because it might embarrass somebody or hurt somebody's feelings. That's never a good enough reason to ruin a human being. They don't suffer from having their feelings hurt, let me tell you. They only suffer from being permitted to depart from truth. That is all. And this E-Meter is not a lie detector. It's a truth verifier. The reason it's unpopular in the world is because the police started calling such ma-chines lie detectors. Actually, comparing this to a police lie detector is something like saying the 1886 Mercedes-Benz is as good as the modern Jaguar, you see. Because the sensitivity of the instruments is not even of the same order of magnitude. And that doesn't matter that the police lie detector costs $18,000. That has nothing to do with it. This is a truth verifier. An auditor is an establisher of truth. And if he can establish the truth of the situation and then acknowledge what he has established as the truth of the situation by accepting it and so forth and that he does not avoid the truthful statements of a pc and does not accept the un-truthful statements of the pc, of course, never after that does he have any ARC breaks. It re-quires something fundamental in the auditor. It requires that the auditor is not shy of estab-lishing the truth of a situation. A pc will actually protest very loudly sometimes when you're trying to establish the truth of a situation. But you notice they're also blushing at the same time. It's a – it's a confu-sion. If you're – if you get very clever and experienced, you will always know when you are establishing the falsity, you see, of the situation that has been uttered by the pc and that you're establishing the actual truth of it. The pc has attempted to establish falsity and you are at-tempting to establish truth. And it's a pretty weird look on the pc when you're doing this. I don't care how loud the pc sounds. He ordinarily won't, after a very short time, sound loud at all. The only way you ever come out the other end as a friend of the pc and he's a friend of yours, is if you've established the truth of the situation regardless of embarrassment and regardless of anything else. Those considerations are entered into the track to make you more reactive bank – that we must have social lies. Very often playwrights come along and they tell you, \"Well, if any-body told the truth for twenty-four hours without any difference whatsoever, he would lose all of his friends.\""},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 15 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 225 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And it's one of the old-time favorite themes in this universe, because they're trying to establish the validity of a lie. That will establish mass and get everybody in trouble and it's quite a – quite a black operation. Whereas it's not true at all. If you were to sit out from the human race's social lies for twenty-four hours and do nothing but tell the truth for twenty-four hours and insist on nothing but the truth for twenty-four hours, he would wind up top dog. He would not be in a mess at all. Do you see that a lie has been entered on to the track here that you could not tell the truth for twenty-four hours? Yeah, you'd wind up wonderful. In the first place, if you really insisted on the truth, you would wind up at the end of that twenty-four hours having some friends, where you only thought you had before. But it requires a very strong man to enter into the first part of that. Because it's repercussive. I've told the truth to somebody and had them scream enough to take the roof off. By the time you've told them again four or five times, they eventually listened. Then it didn't seem so much. It is stepping back from the establishment of truth that pitches one heels – one's heel over the edge of any grave he may fall into. That is the way down. Now, wherever an individual sits into an auditing session with social mores and kind-nesses in full play, he can wind up with the most confounded mess of junk you ever, as a ses-sion, you ever heard of. Pc wildly out of session and so forth. It would actually be unkind to ask this girl if she had ever stolen anything. So we will say, \"Have you ever stolen anything?\" And then we will just ignore that read on the meter because it isn't necessary to go into it. Actually, an auditor's mind doesn't really operate like this. He's just blind. He needs glasses or something. I'm just warning you that the wrong direction – just giving you this word of warning – a wrong direction is in the direction of buying lies or letting lies go by in a session. You're always in trouble. And what we call this, \"Letting the lie go by\" is the missed withhold. Remember, there can also be the inadvertent missed withhold of letting the truth go by, see. So, if you let a truth go by without acknowledging it and let a lie go by without challenging it, in either way you're in trouble. Because you just restimulated the guy's whole track. And of course, the ARC sinks, the corners of the triangle start to explode with small firecrackers and debris scatters around the scenery and there it is. You want ARC to drop out of the session, why, just follow this same basis. That is why your metering has to be 100 percent. And why, incidentally, in passing along, your TR 4 has got to be pretty good. But your TR 4 will be pretty good if you just remember to under-stand. All right. Let's all agree you're a complete knucklehead when pcs start muttering. Let's just, you know, take that as a basis: The pcs are rather incomprehensible and nuts on this line and that you are particularly knuckleheaded where what they're saying is concerned. You've got a perfectly safe basis. There's nothing wrong with the statement at all that prohibits audit-ing."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 16 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 226 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Well, you could accomplish auditing with that statement. But if you pride yourself that you always understand everything the pc says and never have to inquire into what the pc is saying and that it would look awfully stupid of you to have to inquire again about what the pc is saying, you've laid the basis to the damnedest messes you ever saw. They won't be sessions. I'm perfectly prepared to be stupid as far as a pc is concerned. Perfectly prepared to be stupid because that's the isness of the situation I'm handling is stupidity, aren't I? So the pc says – he says – he says, \"Yagayaga-plitzou.\" And ha-ha, I don't depend on my altitude for appearing bright. Why should you? No point in it. You say, \"What did you say?\" And the pc says, \"Wiggle-wiggle plitzboom.\" Well, don't show any misemotion. Say, \"Well, I'm just particularly stupid today. I did-n't get it. You'll have to say it in English. You'll have to drive it across this wagon one way or the other so I can see what it is.\" And he says, \"Oh, skip it.\" And I say, \"No, that one we're not going to skip. I'm just particularly stupid. What is this 'wiggle-wiggle plitzboom?' What is it? I mean what are you saying?\" And he says, \"Well, you wouldn't understand.\" And I say, \"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't understand what you're saying,\" and so forth. I'm perfectly willing to sit there for half an hour and go over this thing. And he finally says, \"Well, I mean that the chair leg has come down on the tip of my foot.\" And you say, \"Well, all right. Thank you very much. Slide it out. All right. Now, here we go.\" And you find out your session doesn't come to grief. The way to make a session come to grief is the pc says, \"Wiggle-wiggle plitzboom,\" and you say, \"Good. Fine. Thank you very much,\" and go on. You've had it. You've entered pretense into the session and it didn't live there. No, as long as an auditor considers himself an establisher of truth and as long as he re-fuses to do anything less than establish truth, he's all right. From then on, why, he can't have any real difficulties, because a pc will forgive an aw-ful lot of fumbling if, during the fumbling, an auditor has only one intention: is to establish the exact, \"What is it.\" See, if that intention is totally clear, the pc can forgive a lot of fum-bling. Don't ever try to look brighter than you are. And never be dumb enough to do other-wise than pursue truth and you'll have it. In essence, you'll build a whole universe out of bad auditing sessions simply because you've continued to alter-is the basic truth of the pc and the basic truth of the universe. And it'll all just mess up like fire drill."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ANATOMY OF ARC BREAKS 17 SHSBC-190 - 17.7.62 LEVEL 3 227 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR And of course, the meter is simply nothing more or less than establish a truth.

The most violent session ARC Brks occur because of list errors under the meaning of listing and nulling. Other session ARC Brks even under withholds are not as violent as those occurring because of listing errors.

The repair action is to assess the prepared list which corrects listing errors. This is L4BRA – HCOB 15 Dec 68 amended to 18 March 71. It is used \"On Dianetics lists\" as the start of each of its questions when employed for this purpose. When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be found the C/S should suspect some listing error and order an L4BRA to be done \"On Dianetic lists \" at the start of each question.

Such upsets also come from word clearing by incompetent persons. The C/S should look for these especially when such campaigns are in progress. He should suspect them as a possibility when a case bogs. A C/S must be sure all such papers and worksheets get into pc's folders. A common repair action is to 1.

The real item will BD F/N. One can establish what the situation is with a post purpose, a Why or a product or any other such item by doing an L4B. SELF AUDITING The commonest reason for self auditing is a wrong or unfound L&N item. People can go around and self list or self audit trying to get at the right Why or prod-uct or purpose after an error has been made. REACTION Nothing produces as much case upset as a wrong list item or a wrong list. Even, rarely, a Dianetic List can produce wrong list reactions. Ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy. Or blows. Or attacks the auditor. All of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists. Nothing else produces such a sharp deterioration in a case or even illness. OUT LISTS Therefore when one gets a sharp change in a case (like lowered tone, violence, blows, \"determination to go on in spite of the supervisor\", long notes from pcs, self C/Sing, etc, etc, the C/S suspects an out list. This outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to BD F/N. It can occur in \"Coffee shop\" (out of session auditing of someone), or by Est Os or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life. PTS When such actions as finding items by non-auditors are done on PTS people the situa-tion can be bad, so one also suspects the person to be PTS to someone or something. \"PTS\" does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says, \"Someone or something is hostile to you\" and \"You are connected to someone or something that doesn't agree with Dianetics or Scientology.\""},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"PRODUCT PURPOSE AND WHY AND WC 3 HCOB 20.4.72 ERROR CORRECTION LEVEL 3 233 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR REPAIRS The main things to know when doing such repairs are (a) that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and (b) that it is up to the C/S to suspect detect and get them handled in regular session.

It is a correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folder. One can also persuade the D of T or Qual to gen in the people doing such actions.

An L&N List is always done on a separate sheet. It's best to do an L&N List on faint-lined paper. The pc's name and date are put on the top of the sheet. The listing question is written out, usually before the start of session. When the listing question is checked the read is marked by the question (sF, F, LF, LFBD). If Suppress or Inval is used that is also noted. As each item is given by the pc the reads are marked – sF, F, LF, LFBD. This is done as you list. If the item does not read you mark it with an X. TA is noted periodically as the pc lists, and especially when the TA rises. The LFBD F/N item is circled. If indicated to the pc it is marked IND. When extending a list a line is drawn from where it has been extended with the date. Example: Item Joe X Shoes sF  Socks X _________________ Ext 24.2.72 Sky X Wax X Pigs etc etc."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 236 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR L&N Lists are never stapled to the W/S but are paper-clipped under the session re-ports. CORRECTING L&N LISTS Old lists are not to be copied. They are to be corrected in their original form but using a different coloured pen to show what has been done – always date new uses of these lists also using the same colour pen as used for renulling or addition to them. When a list is pulled forward to correct it, a sheet of paper is left at that date giving the data of the Listing Question and the date it is pulled forward to, so it can be easily located. The corrected lists are left with the session reports of the session in which they were corrected. A note in red is made in the F/S of this correction.

It really is simple if you know your Laws of L & N. VERIFYING A LIST The correct procedure for verifying/correcting past L & Ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct. Then do an L4BRA on each list where the item is found to be incorrect. You would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item. You do not direct the question to see if it read. And don't just do an L4BRA and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling (unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such). NULLING A LIST One nulls a list when he doesn't get a BD F/N item on listing. The Laws of L & N strictly apply. An L4BRA would be used if the action bogs with still no item found. One would also null lists the pc made where no item had been found such as a 2WC which turned into a listing action with the pc giving off items or a list the pc somehow made while not on a meter. In these cases there is no item to verify with the pc as correct. Just cull the items into a list, work out with the pc what the question was if it's not already noted, and null the list. RECONSTRUCTING A LIST Sometimes you just don't have the list and can't get it or it's an old Why Finding or PTS interview for which there are no worksheets. In this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"LIST ERRORS CORRECTION OF 2 HCOB 11.4.77 LEVEL 3 238 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR probably was already on the list and you don't want the pc to get into newly listing the ques-tion in PT and then getting into an overlisting situation. Just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get a BD F/N item. If you don't get the item that way then you can extend the list. SELF-LISTING Watch it on these as every random stray thought a person has about \"why this or that\" does not mean it's a self-list. But do look for it on a person who is manifesting the horrendous BPC an out list can generate, who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the Ethics Officer. Just don't get into trying to make a list out of some non-standard listing question that won't give you an item. And actually the usual reason for self-listing is a prior wrong L & N item or an item not found. People will self-list to try to find the right item. So find and correct the earlier out list. LIST CORRECTION BLOW-UP When you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get a big pc blow-up and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you proba-bly are not correcting the list that is out and you'd better find out which list it is. There is usually an earlier out list to be found, if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset. LISTS NOT READING When you start getting key lists such as Grades III and IV not reading and no items found it's time for that auditor to get a thorough overhaul on his metering, eyesight and to get off all his MUs on L & N. You also could be setting the pc up for a self-listing situation as he has been given the listing question but no item has been found. So be very sure the question did not read even with Suppress and Inval and TRs were in before getting off a key L & N process. USE OF L4BRA The prepared list L4BRA corrects L & N lists. It can be run on old lists, current lists, general listing. When a pc is ill after a listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after, always suspect that a listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected. Sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. For example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted. If this didn't go, then an L4BRA would be done on the list."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"LIST ERRORS CORRECTION OF 3 HCOB 11.4.77 LEVEL 3 239 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR HANDLING AN L4BRA You handle reading questions on the L4BRA by the directions under the question that read. You don't just 2WC these questions. For example say question 4 read on the L4BRA, \"Is a list incomplete? SF.\" You then ask the pc, \"What list is incomplete?\" Locate it and get it completed to a BD F/N item. You don't just 2WC \"incomplete lists\" to an F/N and leave it at that. By the way the L4BRA is missing a line which is \"Was it the first item on the list?\" This is being added as it's quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed. DO IT RIGHT An out list can create more concentrated hell with a pc than any other single auditing error. So it's imperative that listing errors get properly corrected. The best thing to do is to have the Laws of Listing and Nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place. Then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later. L.

Here they are given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved. (Note 2: These have not been written before because I had not deter-mined the results vital to each Level.) There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom of performing actions. A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how the auditor addresses his task. Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point. Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But an auditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Heal-ing but of any repetitive process. Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can do each one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way to handle the tools of auditing. LEVEL ZERO LISTEN STYLE At Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does is not a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is really listening. Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they did reach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this, evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the HAS student. Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this: Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 250 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Adding on higher skills like \"Is the pc talking interestingly?\" or even \"Is the pc talk-ing?\" is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won't talk or isn't interested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc. It really isn't \"Itsa\" to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, \"It's a this\" or \"It's a that.\" Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won't. It's the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa. The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. One doesn't cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that's at Level Zero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles. LEVEL ONE MUZZLED AUDITING This could also be called rote style auditing. Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and not anything else added. It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated, discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a \"muzzle was put on them\", figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack. Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completely muzzled. This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called \"Muzzled Style\" for the sake of brevity. It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn't make gains with the par-tially trained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment. At Level One we don't expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask the question) with no variation, acknowledge the pc's answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said. Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to \"Two-Way Comm\". Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One ses-sions don't disintegrate to Level Zero. Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out – not pc wanderings. A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditor will do. The pc is even put through a few \"do birds fly?\" cycles until the pc gets the idea. Then the processing works."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 3 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 251 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past \"ther-apy experience\", is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pc never got above Level Zero). It's the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains. To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short or-der, using the processes of this Level. To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles – Totally Permissive and To-tally Controlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It's been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are different enough – Listen Style and Muzzled Style – to set anybody straight. LEVEL TWO GUIDING STYLE AUDITING An old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing. We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing. One first guides the pc by \"two-way comm\" into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands. Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style and Muzzled Style Auditing well. Formerly the student who couldn't confront or duplicate a command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or \"Two-Way Comm\". The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa without chop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands. We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at this Level that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, the two things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can ob-serve the actual situation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.) Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what's what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy. Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To use those, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc's case ac-cordingly. The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 4 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 252 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers the pc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been re-vealed. One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc. One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needle except as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what's to be done by the action of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running what's being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numbered accordingly.) At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but not session ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by a higher classed auditor if they occur). To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must have a pc \"willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties\". That presupposes we have an auditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled. Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One under-stands, when one doesn't, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it. Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc's comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this is easy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimu-late the PTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn't being driven to do something about it) as the finite result. The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pc toward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA. The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style. One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commands with good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc's case. O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn't an overt and so eventually blow it. Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II – the ways of keeping a pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2. Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 5 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 253 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR LEVEL III ABRIDGED STYLE AUDITING By Abridged is meant \"abbreviated\", shorn of extras. Any not actually needful audit-ing command is deleted. For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, \"I will repeat the auditing command\" and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when it isn't necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it. In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. We still use repetitive commands expertly, but we don't use rote that is unnecessary to the situation. Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitive commands. At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc. But at the same time, one doesn't necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown. In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This is done more often by observation than command. Yet it is done. We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe. Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don't mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question. On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed. Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing. Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleaned up on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn't stop the pc from doing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a bigger auditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged. One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pc's relief. And one sees it isn't clean by the continued puzzle on the pc's face. There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesn't tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. And so doesn't check it again. Example: \"Has anything else been suppressed?\" One eye on pc, one on needle, needle didn't quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, \"All right, on \" and goes on to next question, eliminating a pc's possible protest read that can be mistaken for an-other \"suppress\"."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 6 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 254 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it im-pedes case advance. But that doesn't mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thorough with Abridged Style Auditing than in rote. One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected re-sult. By \"Abridged\" is meant getting the exact job done – the shortest way between two points – with no waste questions. By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time. The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions. The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes – CT Healing, Prepchecking, Auditing by List. Again it's the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result. LEVEL IV DIRECT STYLE AUDITING By direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner. We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it is direct. By direct, we don't mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc's attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct. It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear. Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed. At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes. These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at the Reactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner. In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a ses-sion to another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all. Thus we have another implication in the word \"direct\". The pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all. In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc's bank and wants no pc in front of it thinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action. All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It looks easy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 7 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 255 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The trick is to be direct in what's wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what's to be done, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, at-tentive, completely relaxed. In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks or assessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list. And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch. The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breaking the pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesn't understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARC Breaking the pc. You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a ses-sion of CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on. In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you'd see the auditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, \"Let's see that in Clay.\" Or the pc doesn't really give an ability he wants to improve and you'd hear a quiet persuasive auditor voice, \"Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Just something, some ability you know, you'd like to improve.\" You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after that it's all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruc-tion. When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assess-ment action hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used. This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward – direct. But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed, but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done. (Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.) LEVEL VI ALL STYLE So far, we have dealt with simple actions. Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa's and Cognites and gets PTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and who must be handled, handled, handled all the way. As auditing TA for a 2½ hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster. So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 8 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 256 HUBBARD PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs. It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding. Use the wrong style on a situation and you've had it. ARC Break! No progress! Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can't continue – or shouldn't. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. The auditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn't really know), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged and bothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress. The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles. Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit. So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can be co-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn't mastered one of the lower level styles. SUMMARY These are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are only variations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing. It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice. As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalize Styles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is. Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs. L.

The \"note\" in the introduction was inserted and process 7 Part C accordingly changed by adding brackets to F3. In process 4 Part A the commands were changed according to source materials. In process 8 a comment from the source HCOB was added. Re-revised 30 Oct 2008 to change process 7 Part C according to the source HCOB, that is, not as process with flows, but as bracket with 6 commands This BTB gives a checklist of the Expanded Quad Grade Process commands. It is not all the possible processes for this level. If more are needed to attain full EP for this level additional processes can be found in LRH Bulletins, Books, Tapes, PABs and other issues. Each process is run to its full end phenomena of F/N, Cog, VGIs. Any processes previously run are rehabbed or completed and any missing flows run. A copy of this checklist is placed in the folder of a pc being run on Expanded Grades and the processes checked off with the date each is run to EP. On any of these processes where the pc answers only yes or that he did it find out what it was by asking \"What was it?\" This keeps in the itsa line from the pc to auditor. (Ref: 30 June 62 HCOB) THIS BTB DOES NOT REPLACE THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MATERIALS. Note: where F2 and F3 of a process are identical except for changing the word \"another\" to \"others\" F3 is put in brackets. It is recommended to ask the pc for interest before taking the F3 up, as these are really not different flows and many pcs run the F2 with a concept that covers the singular as well as the plural; thus, running F3 without further notice could constitute an overrun and/or lead to pro-test. 1.
