Most of the auditing actions on this Level fall within one of 3 types of process: A. Repetitive Process B. Alternate/Repetitive Process C. Bracket Process – with 3 or more commands run consecutively, in sequence. In Section I of this bulletin, there is a simple drill pattern for each type of process. (When an action does not fall within one of these types of process, a separate drill is pro-vided.) There is also a Dynamic Assessment Drill in Section I. There is also a drill covering Listing and Nulling procedure which was taken from BTB 15 Dec 74 Auditor Expertise Drills Series 2, Basic Session Actions Drill. Section II of this bulletin lists the auditing drills for Level II. Every drill gives the LRH materials that describe the process, the commands used, and states how each process is drilled. The procedure is: 1. Study and understand the LRH data on the process. 2. With this understanding, drill the action using the drill indicated. 3. Drill each process with the auditing style that applies – see HCOB 6 Nov 64 STYLES OF AUDITING."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LEVEL III PROCESS DRILLS 2 ADS 5R – BTB 9.10.71R LEVEL 3 2 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Example on Level III: TR 300-3 Changing Minds Unbullbaited TR 300-4 Changing Minds Bullbaited LRH Ref: Book – CREATION OF HUMAN ABILITY R2-50 p. 128, 129 Commands: \"Walk over to this spot.\" \"Now decide you have to appear there.\" \"Now change your Mind and decide you have to disappear there.\" \"Now change your mind and decide you have to appear there.\" Drill per LRH instructions given in Creation of Human Ability R2-50.

Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed. In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the pc. (During the drill the coach is seated or standing beside the Auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.) Training Stress: This drill is coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheets as in a session – as follows: 1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills. 2. Set up shield (to prevent TA and admin from being seen by pc (doll)). 3.

FORMAT FOR BULLBAITED DRILLS Name: Auditing __________ Bullbaited. Commands: As for each separate auditing action. Purpose: To train the student to be able to co-ordinate and apply the commands and proce-dures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session and thereby become flawless in applying it. Position: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms, as needed. In the chair opposite the Auditor is a doll as pc. Coach sits beside doll and is the bullbaiter and gives an-swers as pc, not about his own case. Training Stress: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the \"pc\" coach bullbaits the student Auditor using \"fruit\", answers during the session in an attempt to throw the student off session. On any list, the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses \"fruit\" answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student Auditor reads off the list items he squeezes the cans for reads. When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should throw in various signs of pc out of sessionness. (Per HCOB 29 July 64 GOOD INDICATORS AT LOWER LEVELS and BTB 26 April 69 BAD INDICATORS.) The student. Auditor must: 1. Obnose the out of sessionness, 2. Align this to the process run, 3. Handle. An example is, on Listing and Nulling procedure an out of sessionness is observed, the Auditor queries and follows through with an L4BR at once, (L4BR is a Repair List.) The pc bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc. But he must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968 \"Coaching\", especially the second paragraph – \"Coach with reality\". Once the coach throws out a situation, etc., he must allow the student Auditor to carry it out, and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation. Stress is on training the student Auditor to have his TRs 0-4 in on the bullbaiter."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LEVEL III PROCESS DRILLS 4 ADS 5R – BTB 9.10.71R LEVEL 3 4 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The coach (bullbaiter) does the \"Start\", flunking or \"That's it\".

Here they are given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved. (Note 2: These have not been written before because I had not deter-mined the results vital to each Level.) There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom of performing actions. A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how the auditor addresses his task. Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point. Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But an auditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Heal-ing but of any repetitive process. Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can do each one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way to handle the tools of auditing. LEVEL ZERO LISTEN STYLE At Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does is not a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is really listening. Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they did reach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this, evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the HAS student. Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this: Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 16 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Adding on higher skills like \"Is the pc talking interestingly?\" or even \"Is the pc talk-ing?\" is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won't talk or isn't interested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc. It really isn't \"Itsa\" to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, \"It's a this\" or \"It's a that.\" Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won't. It's the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa. The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. One doesn't cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that's at Level Zero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles. LEVEL ONE MUZZLED AUDITING This could also be called rote style auditing. Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and not anything else added. It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated, discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a \"muzzle was put on them\", figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack. Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completely muzzled. This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called \"Muzzled Style\" for the sake of brevity. It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn't make gains with the par-tially trained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment. At Level One we don't expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask the question) with no variation, acknowledge the pc's answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said. Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to \"Two-Way Comm\". Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One ses-sions don't disintegrate to Level Zero. Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out – not pc wanderings. A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditor will do. The pc is even put through a few \"do birds fly?\" cycles until the pc gets the idea. Then the processing works."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 3 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 17 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past \"ther-apy experience\", is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pc never got above Level Zero). It's the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains. To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short or-der, using the processes of this Level. To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles – Totally Permissive and To-tally Controlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It's been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are different enough – Listen Style and Muzzled Style – to set anybody straight. LEVEL TWO GUIDING STYLE AUDITING An old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing. We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing. One first guides the pc by \"two-way comm\" into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands. Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style and Muzzled Style Auditing well. Formerly the student who couldn't confront or duplicate a command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or \"Two-Way Comm\". The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa without chop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands. We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at this Level that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, the two things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can ob-serve the actual situation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.) Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what's what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy. Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To use those, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc's case ac-cordingly. The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 4 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 18 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers the pc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been re-vealed. One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc. One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needle except as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what's to be done by the action of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running what's being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numbered accordingly.) At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but not session ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by a higher classed auditor if they occur). To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must have a pc \"willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties\". That presupposes we have an auditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled. Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One under-stands, when one doesn't, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it. Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc's comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this is easy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimu-late the PTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn't being driven to do something about it) as the finite result. The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pc toward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA. The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style. One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commands with good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc's case. O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn't an overt and so eventually blow it. Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II – the ways of keeping a pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2. Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 5 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 19 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES LEVEL III ABRIDGED STYLE AUDITING By Abridged is meant \"abbreviated\", shorn of extras. Any not actually needful audit-ing command is deleted. For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, \"I will repeat the auditing command\" and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when it isn't necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it. In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. We still use repetitive commands expertly, but we don't use rote that is unnecessary to the situation. Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitive commands. At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc. But at the same time, one doesn't necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown. In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This is done more often by observation than command. Yet it is done. We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe. Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don't mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question. On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed. Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing. Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleaned up on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn't stop the pc from doing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a bigger auditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged. One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pc's relief. And one sees it isn't clean by the continued puzzle on the pc's face. There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesn't tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. And so doesn't check it again. Example: \"Has anything else been suppressed?\" One eye on pc, one on needle, needle didn't quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, \"All right, on \" and goes on to next question, eliminating a pc's possible protest read that can be mistaken for an-other \"suppress\"."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 6 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 20 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it im-pedes case advance. But that doesn't mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thorough with Abridged Style Auditing than in rote. One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected re-sult. By \"Abridged\" is meant getting the exact job done – the shortest way between two points – with no waste questions. By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time. The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions. The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes – CT Healing, Prepchecking, Auditing by List. Again it's the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result. LEVEL IV DIRECT STYLE AUDITING By direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner. We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it is direct. By direct, we don't mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc's attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct. It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear. Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed. At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes. These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at the Reactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner. In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a ses-sion to another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all. Thus we have another implication in the word \"direct\". The pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all. In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc's bank and wants no pc in front of it thinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action. All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It looks easy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 7 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 21 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The trick is to be direct in what's wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what's to be done, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, at-tentive, completely relaxed. In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks or assessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list. And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch. The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breaking the pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesn't understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARC Breaking the pc. You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a ses-sion of CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on. In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you'd see the auditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, \"Let's see that in Clay.\" Or the pc doesn't really give an ability he wants to improve and you'd hear a quiet persuasive auditor voice, \"Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Just something, some ability you know, you'd like to improve.\" You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after that it's all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruc-tion. When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assess-ment action hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used. This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward – direct. But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed, but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done. (Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.) LEVEL VI ALL STYLE So far, we have dealt with simple actions. Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa's and Cognites and gets PTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and who must be handled, handled, handled all the way. As auditing TA for a 2½ hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster. So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"STYLES OF AUDITING 8 HCOB 6.11.64 LEVEL 3 22 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs. It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding. Use the wrong style on a situation and you've had it. ARC Break! No progress! Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can't continue – or shouldn't. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. The auditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn't really know), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged and bothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress. The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles. Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit. So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can be co-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn't mastered one of the lower level styles. SUMMARY These are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are only variations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing. It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice. As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalize Styles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is. Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs. L.

What are you doing there? COGNITION Cognition is awareness of awareness. Example: An individual has been studious since age five. Preclear is run on studiousness. Preclear says, \"Well, I'll be darned!\" Auditor says, \"What happened?\" Preclear says, \"I have been studious since I was five years of age! This is remarkable in view of the fact that until this very moment I never had the slightest notion that I was being studious. Remarkable.\" This is an example of cognition. The awareness of awareness of a condition permits the lessening or vanishment of that condition. The awareness of awareness of a scarcity per-mits the lessening or vanishment of that scarcity. Cognition is of the highest importance in processing. A process used, when it is the right process for the case, should normally bring about a cognition on the part of the preclear and when there has not been a cognition the process is not the correct process, or it has not been run fully. The most important communication lag is the cognition lag. A process should not be left for the next higher process until there has been a cognition on the process or the consid-erations addressed in the process. GRANTING OF BEINGNESS A process has not been the correct process or has not been run correctly, or has not been run long enough if there has not been in the preclear an increase in his ability to grant life to others and to his environment. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT A. The auditor must acknowledge every answer, every command carried out, every comment, every communication, every attempt to communicate on the part of the pc. He should further invite communication wherever the preclear desires or needs to communicate. B. The auditor must be willing to grant beingness (life) to the preclear. C. The auditor must be alert to the pc at all times. D. The auditor must be real to the pc at all times. E. Cognition (awareness of awareness) is the goal of any process. The pc must be invited to impart any new cognition which he has gained during a session, or between ses-sions. A major cognition resulting from any process is generally a flattening of that process.

Most thetans fall below the level of mechanics. They have to be brought up to a point where they are not being handled by mechanics before they can simply change their considerations. If changing minds worked on any thetan it would then be the only process in Scientology, but it does not work on thetans who are interiorized since they are being other things than themselves, and when they start to change their minds they are simply changing something else. When you have a thetan exteriorized, all you have to do is ask him to change his mind, and, unless he is still very badly burdened by mechanical considerations with which he has so thoroughly agreed that he cannot immediately change his mind, he will do so. This process can be used on a non-exteriorized thetan, however, and on those who are uneasily exteriorized, by having them stand in one place with an idea that they have to appear there, and then change their minds, and disappear there. Or simply have them stand in one place until they change their mind, and then go to another place and change their mind, and go to another place and change their mind. This is done, actually, by moving the body around, as most auditing these days is done. The auditing commands for this would be 'Walk over to this spot' (indicating a spot to the preclear), 'Now decide you have to appear there', 'Now change your mind and decide you have to disappear there', 'Now change your mind and decide you have to appear there', and so on. This can also be worked into opening procedures by having a preclear select a spot, then change his mind about the spot, select another spot, change his mind about that spot and select another spot, until he knows that he, himself, is changing his mind. When exteriorized, the thetan can change his mind very easily on any subject simply when told to do so. Very often he does not realize that he can change the factors of his life around simply by changing his mind, and so has to be asked to do so by the auditor. A note of warning: this does not work on interiorized preclears with any great value."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 35 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES R2-63: ACCEPT-REJECT From acceptance we get a ten-star process. Whatever else you may do with a Preclear, he must be brought to accept the physical universe and his own and other bodies, all in every kind of condition. The way out is the way through. In Eastern practices, the goal was aban-donment, desertion. Scientology's main difference from Eastern practices is this: it accepts to free. And it frees. That which one cannot accept chains one. For instance, revulsion to sex inclines at last to slavery to sex. A ruler's motto could be 'make them resist', and his people would become enslaved. In 1870 we find capitalists resisting Marx. In 1933 we find Marx the basic text of U. S. government. Resistance and restraint are the barbed-wire of this concentration camp. Ac-cept the barbed-wire and there is no camp. On test this process exteriorizes the worst case if run long enough. This process is important because it is one of the few (like R2-16) which does not have alter-isness as its operative factor. This is not, then, an altering practice, confirming somatics and aberrations, it is a freeing process. That which one cannot accept he cannot as-is. The commands of this process are as follows: 'Find something about yourself which you can accept', 'Something else', 'Find something else you can accept', etc., etc., until there is no comm-lag. Then: 'Find something about yourself you can reject', 'Find something else about yourself you can reject', etc., etc., until there is no comm-lag. Then: 'Find something in this room you can accept', 'Something else', 'Find something else in this room you can accept', etc., etc., 'Find something in this room you can reject', 'Find something else in this room you can reject', etc., etc. Then: 'Find something about this universe you can accept', until the comm-lag is flat. Then: 'Find something in this universe you can reject'. Remember, this is not an altering process. It is a high value escape process. If your preclear keeps putting conditions of change into everything before he can accept it, you must persuade him to find things he can accept without changing them."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 37 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES R2-65: ALTERATION As any energy or space condition survives only because it has been and is being al-tered, the primary unmotivated act would be changing the condition of energy, space, and objects. The mind can change without liability. When a mind changes energy or space we get a persistence of that energy or space. As persistence or survival is good and bad only to those who desire to succumb, we do not see in alteration of energy or space, any crime. But when we alter only 'bad' conditions of space and energy we make the 'bad conditions' persist. Hence it would be of value to a case to at least straight wire out some of the times when he attempted to alter energy, spaces, or bodies of people. (To an auditor who works to exteriorize a preclear and change his mind, there is small liability and great personal advance. To an auditor who works only to change the body, the ridges, the somatics, there is failure, fixation of condition in the preclear, and restimulation occurs. Successful auditing of the thetan actually improves the auditor.) Failure is the biggest lock on alter-isness of course. The preclear who is obsessively trying to change himself by self-auditing or whatever means, has failed many times to effect a change in the condition of this universe or in the bod-ies of others, or has the space and energy of this universe as a stable constant. The commands are: 'Can you recall a time when you failed to change some energy in this universe?' etc., etc. And when this is flat, 'Can you recall a time when you failed to change some space?' Then: 'Can you recall a time when you failed to change a body?' This last question is the one you stress. He may get nothing on the space question at all but such incidents are in his recall or space would not exist at all for him. Also, 'Can you recall a time when you failed to change a memory?' etc., etc. Wher-ever or however the preclear is stuck in tone or condition, there he has failed to change some-thing or somebody. This can also be run on the 'theta aide of the ledger' 'Can you recall a time when you successfully changed something?' until the lag is flat. Even more simply: 'Can you recall a time of change?'"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" LEVEL 3 39 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES R2-68: INCOMPREHENSIBILITY A thetan is understanding.

Poorest but easiest of these is plain Itsa. Itsa probably will not recover a floating nee-dle but will pull down the TA. When it's down, stop – don't press your luck too far. The real technical job (other than Itsa) requires expert metering and a thorough knowledge of dating on a meter and a smooth comm cycle. Best at it would be an auditor who himself was a Former Release and who had himself (or herself) recovered the state. The technically correct procedure is unfortunately a delicate one which requires good command of tech on the subject of the Time Track and perception of the pc and meter alert enough to stop exactly when Re-Release occurs and say \"That's It!\" (Never say \"End\" in such sessions.) Remember all recovery must be by Key-out, not erasure. Key-outs are done by finding Key-ins. It is de-stimulation, not re-stimulation. Therefore all must be smooth and jolly with no forcing or overrun. The exact tech follows: To regain a Former Release (or Thetan Exterior or Keyed-Out OT [Released OT]): 1. Loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred. 2. Get in Suppress, Invalidate buttons on the session or time. 3. Get in \"Unacknowledged\" or \"What was unacknowledged\". 4.

When this is found and recognized by the pc, the pc will then return to Release or Re-leased OT. 7. If this does not happen, find what keyed in that ended the state and repeat (1) to (6) on it. This is all rough to communicate to the pc who is not well trained. This datum will help (a standard datum of early Dianetics): The analytical mind when it becomes aware of a point in the Reactive Mind, makes it vanish. In other words one needs but become aware of the actual cause of an aberration to have it vanish. We see this mainly in Cognitions. But it is the backbone of all auditing. When the person was originally released he had become aware of something that caused the reactive mind to de-stimulate at that point or become weak. And so he Released. You have to find that point of sudden awareness again as in (1) to (6) above and if you miss it you can at least find (7). You could find both and in a lot of cases will probably do so. But if you win on (1) to (6), for heaven's sakes don't go on to (7). If you do (7) you may suddenly turn up with (5). When you've done it realize you've done it and come off of it. Don't overrun. When you have done it, tell the person to get trained so he or she can go on to actual Clear. LIABILITY The Liability in all this is finding the original thing that was keyed in (which when keyed out gave Release). If this happens you have a new key-in in the session you are running right now. It is a new key-in and is handled as one.

While there is considerably more data on these subjects in the Technical Volumes and on the Class VIII tapes, this issue sets forth the key data and presents the methods for rehab-bing in one consolidated issue for the first time. DEFINITIONS \"Rehab\" is a shortened version of \"rehabilitate\", which means: to restore to a former capacity or condition. \"Release\" is the term for what occurs when a person separates from his reactive mind or some part of it or when he separates from some mass. In Scientology we use the term \"rehabilitate\" most commonly to mean: restoring a state of release previously attained by the pc. RELEASES Scientology processes can be categorized as follows:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 2 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 50 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 1. Those processes which direct the preclear's attention to the mental masses in his reac-tive mind in order to enable him to separate out from them. 2. Those processes which are aimed at increasing the preclear's abilities. Both types of processes lead to release Both types of processes are necessary to bring a person up the levels of awareness and up each step of the Grade Chart to OT. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that's a release. When you erase the mass and leave the thetan there, that's an erasure. Erasure is a dif-ferent phenomenon from release. In auditing, when the pc spots something in the bank he disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. That is a release. Or, when the pc becomes free of a difficulty or per-sonal \"block\" or inability stemming from the mind, that is a release. A person can and does go release many times in the course of his auditing. He may go release many times while being run on the processes of a Grade before he attains the ability of that Grade. The Grades Releases are covered fully in HCOB 22 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, NEW LEVELS OP RELEASE, in HCOB 27 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, ADDITIONAL DATA, and on the Grade Chart itself. Further data can be found in HCO PL 23 OCT 80 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES. Oddly enough, the idea of release can translate through to the pc to include releases in life, too. For example, a person was in prison and they let him out. This might well read as a release on a pc being asked about former releases, and it would be okay. One sees how this can be in view of the basic concept of release, e.g. when you take a person out of a mass - any mass - that is a release. So \"release\" points in life such as the above are valid, and, though one doesn't ask for them specifically, should they come up during a former release rehab on a pc, they are to be handled. However, the auditor must understand that such a release in no way means that a per-son is a release on a process or on one of the Grades! Prison might be a problem to someone but getting out doesn't make him a Problems Release! Don't misconstrue one for the other and declare someone a Grades Release at some Level because he had a release in life. Actually one can go release on any subject and theoretically one could rehab any re-lease a pc had. The exact subjects a pc must be released on in order to make it up the Bridge are those listed on the Grade Chart. Occasionally it is necessary to rehab a win or state at-tained by the pc which is not specifically mentioned on the Grade Chart. But, again, one would not mistake it for a Grade Chart Release. (Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, \"STATES\", AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.) "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 3 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 51 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES OVERRUN Overrun occurs when the thetan considers that something has gone on too long or happened too often. When the person begins to feel this way about something, he begins to protest it and try to stop it. This tends to make things more solid and builds up mass in the mind. People who are very intent on stopping things in life appear solid and massy. In auditing, an overrun means the preclear came out of the bank and then went back into it again. For instance, the pc released on the process \"From where could you communi-cate to your dog?\" but the auditor continued the process after he should have indicated the F/N and gone on to something else. By continuing, the auditor throws the pc back into the bank again and wrecks the release state. An overrun in auditing can also mean that the pc gained an ability to do something and the auditor continued the process or grade past the point where the ability had been regained. By pushing on, the ability can get invalidated. In both cases the person's attention goes back onto his case and hangs up. The person can feel the mass of it again. In life when something is overrun, the person begins to accumulate protests and upsets about the thing or activity he feels overrun on. His attention tends to stick on it. This also builds up mass. An overrun, whether it occurred in auditing or in life, is handled in auditing using the tech of rehabbing. THEORY OF REHABBING The theory of rehabs is based on the following stable datum: This particular universe is built by twos. One cannot know a datum unless there is another datum to compare it to. This fact can also be seen to operate in the field of the mind. (Ref: Logic 8, SCIENTOLOGY 0-8, THE BOOK OF BASICS.) Thus, in rehabbing a release point one is getting the pc to view one datum (a time of release from a mass) as compared to another datum (a time he was stuck in the mass) and when this is done the pc moves out of the mass once again. That is the simplicity of what oc-curs. To expand on the mechanics involved, it can be described as follows: When a person has been overrun, he is trying to stop the mass or thing he has gone back into. The other side to that is the time or times he was released from it. These are oppo-sites: the \"plus\" of the mass and the \"minus\" of the time the mass wasn't there. This idea of opposites tends to hang things up. The idea then behind handling an overrun is to unstabilize this plus-minus pair by get-ting the pc to clearly spot the \"minus\" side of it. When this happens, the \"plus\" side goes."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 4 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 52 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES When the pc's attention is directed to the points when he was released from the mass he ceases to try and stop the mass and it goes. The release state then rehabilitates. So the mechanism being worked with here is that the mass connected with an overrun can be knocked out by spotting the release connected with it. It is a very simple principle which has important uses in auditing. TYPES OF REHABS There are three types of rehab procedures for use in rehabbing releases or states. The earliest is Rehab 1965 Style. This is followed by Rehab by Counting which I de-veloped in 1968. Later on, in 1971, I developed the Date/Locate procedure. Each of the three has its uses depending on what it is one is trying to rehab. One does a Rehab '65 Style when one is rehabbing a specific point, such as the point a specific former release was attained. A Rehab by Counting is done when, for instance, a process appears overrun in session, or when one is rehabbing \"releases\" such as on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, or at any time something is likely to have a number of releases connected with it. A Date/Locate is used when one wants to directly spot the exact time and location of a specific incident and thus blow the mass connected with it. (Date/Locate is used on the last step of the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive to determine the exact point a person went Clear. The Date/Locate procedure has many other uses in other types of auditing as well, but in re-habbing its most frequent use is on the DCSI, per the above.) INDOCTRINATING THE PC The procedure for doing a rehab is quite simple when one understands the theory of it and makes sure the pc does, too. Before doing any rehab or Date/Locate, clear the terms and procedure with the pc so that he understands. Use the data in this issue to clear the theory of release and rehabs, and to clear the procedure to be used – Rehab '65 Style or Rehab by Counting. Use data in HCOB 15 NOV 78, DATING AND LOCATING, in indoctrinating the pc to the Date/Locate theory and pro-cedure. All the terms and steps of the procedure are covered in that issue. The better the pc understands what is going on the smoother it will go. Do not skimp this indoctrination step. Any auditing efforts can go up in smoke if one tries to audit the pc over misunderstoods. 1. Clear the terms below with the pc, using demos and consulting the pc's understanding. A. Release: 1. A person who has been able to back out of his bank. The bank is still there but the person isn't sunk into it with all its somatics and depressions. 2.

When"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 5 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 53 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES this happens, the pc disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. 3. A person who has become free of a difficulty or personal \"block\" stemming from the mind. 4. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that is a release. B. Rehabilitate: to restore to a former capacity or condition. In auditing, this means to do the series of actions in session which result in regaining a state of release for the pc. Abbreviated \"Rehab\". C. Key-In: the action of some part of the reactive mind moving in on the person. A Key-in occurs when the environment around the awake but fatigued or dis-tressed individual is similar to some part of the reactive mind. Since the reac-tive mind operates on the equation A=A=A, the present time environment be-comes identified with the contents of a particular portion of the bank and so it activates and exerts its influence on the person. D. Key-Out: the action of the reactive mind or some portion of it dropping out of restimulation on the pc. E. Grade: a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. (See the Classification Gradation and Awareness Chart for the complete explanation of the different grades.) Auditing processes result in a release. The auditing processes of a Grade, when done, result in the pc attaining the specific ability of that Grade. 2. Clear \"overrun\" with the pc, using the section \"Overrun\" in this issue. Have the pc demo an overrun in auditing and in life. 3. Clear with the pc the stable datum on which rehabbing is based (under \"Theory of Re-habbing\" in this issue). Have him demo each (using a demo kit) as needed to ensure he's got it. 4. Using a demo kit, clear with the pc the simple mechanics of rehabbing (spotting the release connected with a mass). Ref: Section on \"Theory of Rehabbing\" in this issue. 5. Go over with the pc each step of the procedure to be used (Rehab '65 Style or Rehab by Counting or Date/Locate, if needed). Clear any words regarding these procedures, which have not previously been cleared in the pc's auditing. Use a demo kit as needed. 6. Cover meter dating with the pc so he understands its purpose and how it is done. Use E-Meter Drill 22 to explain it. Ensure the pc understands you don't want him depend-ent on the meter but that you will help him, using the meter, if necessary. (Ref: HCOB 4 AUG 63, ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR.) Be sure the pc understands the simple basics of rehabbing with no questions or confu-sions or misunderstood terms, before you begin any rehab. Additionally, when doing any type of rehab session it is important to ensure the pc's ruds are in before starting."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 6 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 54 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES REHAB PROCEDURES PROCEDURE FOR REHAB '65 STYLE I.

(Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, \"STATES\", AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.)

Rehabbing Former Releases: Data on using '65 Style to rehab former releases is cov-ered in the \"Rehabbing Former Releases\" section of this issue. II. When it has been determined that the pc was released on the process, the Ability Gained for a Grade had been attained or the state being rehabbed has been established, one pro-ceeds by first finding out when this occurred, per Step 1 below, and then continues with remainder of the rehab steps: 1. Loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred. (Note: This may have to be meter dated if the pc is unable to locate when it happened. For this reason, any auditor doing rehabs must be adept at E-Meter Drill 22, \"E-Meter Hidden Date, This Life\". Also, see HCOB 2 AUG 65, RELEASE GOOFS, Point 4, Meter Mis-use.) You simply want to determine when. The pc may give you the year, month and day of the release, he may describe it by significance (\"The moment I thought to myself,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 7 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 55 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 'That's why I wrecked the car!\"'), or he may spot when it occurred by location (\"It oc-curred when I was in session for the first time with Joe in his new auditing room.\"). The reference for this is: HCOB 8 JUN AD13, THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUN-NING BY CHAINS, BULLETIN 2, HANDLING THE TIME TRACK. Note: The indicators which tell you that the release or state is rehabilitated are an F/N on the meter and VGIs on the pc. If this occurs on any step of the rehab procedure, simply indi-cate the F/N and gently end off on that rehab action. 2. Get in Suppress, Invalidate buttons on the session or time. 3. Get in \"unacknowledged\" or \"what was unacknowledged\". 4. Indicate anything found to the pc as By-Passed Charge. 5. Find the Key-in that was Keyed-out in that time or session. (The person went release because something keyed out in that time or session.) 6. When this is found and recognized by the pc, the pc will recover the release and the process, Grade, state, etc. will be rehabilitated. 7. If this does not happen, find out what keyed in (at some point after the release) that ended the release state and get it loosely located as in Step 1. 8. Repeat Steps 2 to 6 on it.* 9. Conditional: If, when the above is done, the release still has not rehabbed, get the pc to Itsa alternately the point of key-out when the pc released and the point of key-in af-terwards, one after the other. (Use the meter to guide the pc, if necessary, by asking \"What's that?\" when you see a fall on the needle.) This isn't an alternate/repetitive question - \"What was keyed out then?\"/\"What was keyed in then?\" - but a use of these and any such wording, one after the other, as Itsa invitations until the release is re-gained and F/N, VGIs obtained. CHECKING FOR EPs If one wants to check if the pc has reached the EP of a process, or if one suspects that the EP may have been reached out of session, one can check \"Did anything occur?\" per HCOB 5 DEC 71 IMPORTANT END PHENOMENAS and if the EP has been reached it can be re-habbed using the Rehab '65 Style. One would never ask leading questions or feed the EP to the pc in such situations. Simply check if anything occurred. PROCEDURE FOR REHAB BY COUNTING 1. Establish there is something to be rehabbed.

If it looks (due to overrun phenomena) as though a process has been overrun in session, one could ask, \"Have we by-passed a release point on this process?\". b. For rehabbing releases on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, one would check, \"Did you go release on ______ (drug)?\" 2. If there is a release the question should read. If no read, check Suppress and Invali-date. There must be a read either on checking the question or on the pc's origination that there is a release there, before proceeding with the rehab. 3. If no read but the pc says he was released, check if the release has been Suppressed or Invalidated. If the pc is asserting release or being protesty about it, check Asserted and/or Protest. 4. Sometimes the pc will F/N simply on spotting he was released. This can be quite common especially when the pc's ruds are in and the auditor's TRs are smooth. An F/N with good indicators tells you that the rehab is complete and the mass has keyed out or the state has been rehabilitated. 5. If no F/N on spotting there was a release, ask the pc how many times he was released. Get him to count the number of times and when he gets it he will F/N. 6. Sometimes the pc can't get the number and the auditor can then use the meter to count how many times and get it that way. He can ask the pc if he has some idea of ap-proximate number of times and then use \"More than ______?\"/\"Less than _____?\". He uses the tech of E-Meter Drill 22 to establish the general range of number of times. He would then count to the pc. (\"Were you released on (______) 10 times? 11, 12?\", etc.) The correct number of times will read and, when indicated, will F/N. Rehab by counting is a simple procedure but it can get messed up by an uncertain atti-tude on the part of the auditor or by rough auditor TRs, so be sure you are confident and well drilled. BRIDGING FROM REHAB BY COUNTING TO '65 STYLE If, even with the ruds in, doing a Rehab by Counting doesn't F/N, one can bridge over into a Rehab '65 Style and rehab it that way. Doing a Rehab '65 Style will clean up any by-passed charge on the release and allow it to rehab. If on the Rehab by Counting the pc had said he was released several times, one would have to find the primary release point (the one \"that is most real to him,\" or when he \"had the biggest win,\" etc.) in order to do the Rehab '65 Style steps on that release point. Handled smoothly in this way, you will be able to rehabilitate the release, with F/N, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 9 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 57 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES DATE/LOCATE/ PROCEDURE The Date/Locate procedure is very thoroughly covered in HCOB 15 November 1978, DATING AND LOCATING, and thus is not repeated here. It is based upon the fundamentals principles of rehab tech, but the additional theory and full Date/Locate procedure contained in HCOB 15 Nov 78 must be understood and drilled well before it is done on any pc. ADDITIONAL DATA ON SPECIFIC USES OF REHAB PROCEDURES If one is to handle rehabs he must know the fine differences involved in the applica-tion of rehab tech to each type of thing to be rehabbed. For example, the rehabbing of Grades and the rehabbing of former releases differ from each other and they also differ slightly in some of their steps from the rehabbing of specific processes or states as covered earlier in this issue. For this reason each is taken up separately here in its own section. REHABBING GRADES The rehabilitation of any Grade is done on the basis of actual auditing having been done to the end product of the specific Ability Gained for the Grade on all flows. (Note: Pc's should be Quaded up by the time they receive their Grades.) One does not rehab a Grade by checking \"Did anything occur?\" or \"Were you released on Grade ______?\" Of course something would have occurred on the Grade and the pc would released each time a process or a flow on a process of the Grade F/Ned. This is not what you're looking for. The End Phenomena of a Grade is the attainment of an ability by the pc which he did not previously have. Each level of the Grade Chart results in a specific ability gained by the pc when he does that particular Grade. These are expressed on the Grade Chart in the \"Ability Gained\" column. The specific ability for each of the four flows of a Grade is listed in HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 ISSUE II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED GRADES. These are what you are interested in finding out and rehabbing, if they have been attained. You want to determine that the pc has gained the ability for each flow of the Grade when you are rehabbing. It's not: Did he get his Grade 0 ability? It's: Is he willing for others to communicate to him on any subject? Does he no longer resist communication from others on unpleasant or unwanted subjects? Yes? Good, he's made it on Flow 1 of Grade 0."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 10 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 58 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Does he have the ability to communicate freely with anyone on any subject? Is he free from or no longer bothered by communication difficulties, and no longer withdrawn or reti-cent? Does he like to outflow? If so, he's attained the ability on Flow 2 of Grade 0. One checks each flow of a Grade for the ability of that flow in this way. If the pc says he can't, or if he reads on the meter as being unable to communicate freely to others, for ex-ample, then you know he is not complete on that Grade. He would need to have an FES done at least as far back as the beginning of that Grade and any errors found corrected, and then more processes for that Grade run on all flows until the Ability Gained had been genuinely attained. Further data about handling the pc who hasn't made a Grade is contained in C/S Se-ries 4. A Dianetic pc who couldn't honestly say he was a well and happy human being would need more somatic items run out R3RA. One would never try to rehab a Grade the pc had never really been run on, or for in-stance, Q and A with a pc who asserted he was a Grade 2 Release because he went to confes-sion as a youth. The Abilities Gained of the Grades are attained only by auditing on the vari-ous processes of each Grade. The results of well-run Grades are light years above anything that other fields or practices can offer, so don't sell them short by omitting or quickying them. The procedure, then, for rehabbing a Grade is as follows: 1. Establish from folder study that the pc has run the processes of the Grade on all flows in the first place. There should be some evidence in the folder that the pc has attained the Grade, whether previously declared or not. He should have run enough processes for this to be evident. 2. Show the pc (with pc on the meter) the written statement of the Ability Gained for Flow 1 of the Grade, and have him read it. (Ref: HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES.) 3. Then check with the pc as to whether he has attained (or \"can do\") the ability for that flow of the Grade, as stated in HCOB/HCO PL 23 October 1980 II. 4. If he has attained it, rehab it by Rehab '65 Style. 5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the Ability Gained for each of the remaining flows (Flows 2, 3 and 0) of the Grade. 6. If the pc has attained the ability on each flow of the Grade, he is a valid release on that Grade. 7. If the pc doesn't have the Ability Gained for one or more of the flows of the Grade, he doesn't have the abilities of the Grade. The processes (and the flows) he ran on it would have to be FES'd to locate any errors. The errors found would have to be cor-rected and any unflat process flattened. Then additional processes for that Grade would need to be run until the pc really had the Ability Gained for each flow of the Grade."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 11 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 59 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES REHABBING FORMER RELEASES Rehabbing former releases came into being in 1965 and was done most frequently in that year and the years immediately following it, after the Grades had been established. At that time it was necessary to clear up and get acknowledged the former releases a pc may have had during his processing in the previous years, and to determine that he had been re-leased on each Grade before he went onto Power and Clearing. It is still a very valid tech that is used when needed. It may in some instances be done, at the adjudication of the C/S, where a case is hav-ing trouble or is bogged and the C/S suspects from folder study that the case may be hung up on former release points. In genning the pc in to this action ensure he understands what is being looked for. Al-though one uses Rehab '65 Style, the action is not the same as rehabbing a Grade or even ex-actly the same as rehabbing a process. Here you are looking for times in the pc's auditing his-tory, recent or distant, when he felt good in sessions. This would not necessarily have to be a specific EP of a process the pc ran or the EP of a particular Grade. Rehabbing former releases is not limited by reference to any specific process or Grade. Also, when the pc is asked about an earlier release he may offer up a time he felt released from something in life. If so, this would be checked and handled just as any other release point, as in this action you are going to rehab any and all validly reading release points the pc may offer. When a former release is found it is rehabbed by the '65 Style. The procedure for rehabbing former releases is: 1. Ensure the pc's ruds are in and that he has been through steps 1-6 of the section \"In-doctrinating the pc\", in this issue. 2. Have the pc demo the idea of former releases as it applies to auditing and to life until he's got it. 3. R-Factor the pc that you are going to rehab any former releases he may have had. 4. Clear the question: \"Have you been released earlier?\" Then check the question. 5. If you get a read on Clearing or checking the question, find out what the release was on. a. If no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress and Invali-date. b. If pc says he was released earlier but no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress or Invalidate. If the pc is assertive or protesty about hav-ing been released, check Asserted and/or Protest. 6. When it has been determined that the pc has been released earlier, one then proceeds per Step 1 of Rehab '65 Style instructions until one gets an F/N and rehabilitation of the former release."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 12 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 60 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES 7. One then checks for any other former releases by checking, \"Is there another time you were released earlier?\" and handles per Steps 5 and 6 above. 8. Repeat Step 7 as long as the pc has former releases to rehab 9. Conditional: If on Steps 5 a or b the meter doesn't read or ceases reading even after Suppress, Invalidate, Asserted and/or Protest are checked, or if an ARC Break needle turns on while doing the rehabs, one checks for and handles any ARC Breaks which may be present in the session or connected with the thing you are trying to rehab. After handling any ARC Breaks, recheck for former releases and handle until the Auditor, pc and meter are in agreement that any former releases have been rehabbed and that there are no ARC Breaks preventing any former release from reading. It may be necessary to also check and handle the other rudiments (PTP and Missed With-holds) to ensure there is nothing preventing any former release from reading. 10. Conditional: If the pc has a big win in rehabbing former releases, one would let him have his win and end the session. When sessions are resumed, one would then check for and handle any remaining former releases. When all the pc's former releases have been rehabbed, the action is complete. ADVICE TO AUDITORS AND C/SES ON REHABS Meter Dependence In using the meter on a rehab of any sort, one does not want to get into a situation where the pc is made dependent on the meter for obtaining data. One uses the meter in a rehab only when the pc is unable to come up with the data needed. In getting the number of times released on a process, for instance, the auditor would get the pc to establish the number of times released and only if the pc could not get it would the auditor use the meter to find the number of times released. This all comes under increasing the pc's certainty of his data and is best expressed in HCOB 4 AUGUST 1963 ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR. Out Ruds When a rehab is not going to an F/N, one usually finds that there is an out rud over which the rehab is being done. This can be: a. An out rud on the subject being rehabbed; b. An out rud on something before the release occurred; c. An out rud in the rehab session itself. One has to find out what the out rud is, handle it and then the rehab should go easily to F/N."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 13 HCOB 19.12.80 LEVEL 3 61 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES If at any time an ARC Break needle turns on during a rehab, immediately find what the ARC Break is on and handle fully. Then take the rehab to F/N. An ARC Break, particularly, may obscure a release and prevent it from reading. The remedy is to handle the ARC Break and then recheck for the release. Note: That one has F/Ned the ruds or handled session outnesses to F/N does not mean the rehab is finished, so complete the rehab if needed once the ruds are in. ____________________ Rehabs are very simple to do provided the auditor's comm cycle is not rough or dis-tracting and both he and the pc understand what is being done on a rehab and how the proce-dures go. The action is one of de-stimulation not re-stimulation. It is done with a light touch and is a smooth action. One doesn't get into forcing the pc on a rehab. Drilling the different rehab procedures must be a part of any High Crime checkout on this bulletin so that the auditor can confidently handle any situation that might arise during a rehab. The best way to run a session is to be so sharp as an auditor that you never let the pc overrun in the first place. But should this occur or should you inherit a pc that another auditor has overrun, or should life and livingness knock out a release state, this issue lays out the steps for restoring any type of release.

Tech Dir: Check out on HCO Secs and Assn Org Secs.) The successful handling of an ARC Break Assessment is a skilled activity which re-quires: 1. Skill in handling a Meter. 2. Skill in handling the Itsa Line of the Auditing Cycle. 3. Skill in Assessment. The lists given in HCO Bulletin of July 5, AD13 \"ARC BREAK ASSESSMENTS\", are used, either from that HCO Bulletin or amended. There are several uses for ARC Break Assessments. 1. Cleaning up a session ARC Break. 2. Cleaning up auditing in general. 3. Cleaning up a pc's or student's possible ARC Breaks. 4. Cleaning up a member of the public's possible or actual ARC Breaks. 5. Regular use on a weekly basis on staff or organization members. There are others. Those above are the chief uses. For long time periods the standard 18 button prepcheck is faster, but an ARC Break Assessment is still useful in conjunction with it. The drill is simple. If complicated by adding in R2H material, dating, and other addi-tives, the ARC Break Assessment ceases to work well and may even create more ARC Breaks. If used every time a pc gets in a little trouble in R3N or R3R the ARC Break Assess-ment is being used improperly. In R2H, R3N, R3R sessions it is used only when the pc shows definite signs of an ARC Break. To use it oftener constitutes no auditing."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 2 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 64 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Unnecessary use of an ARC Break Assessment may ARC Break the pc with the As-sessment. The ARC Break Assessment may be repaired by an 18 Button Prepcheck \"On ARC Break Assessments......\". ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT BY STEPS Step One: Select the proper list. This is done by establishing what the pc has been audited on. If more than one type of by-passed charge is suspected, do more than one list. If the ARC Break is not completely cured by one list, do another kind of list. (All lists have been in HCOBs as \"L\".) Step Two: Inform the pc that you are about to assess for any charge that might have been res-timulated or by-passed on his or her case. Do not heavily stress the ARC Break aspect. Right: \"I am going to assess a list to see if any charge has been by-passed on your case.\" Wrong: \"I'm going to try to cure (or assess) your ARC Break.\" Step Three: Without regard to pc's natter, but with quick attention for any cognition the pc may have during assessment as to by-passed charge, assess the list. Phrase the question in regard to the reason for the Assessment – \"In this session......\" \"During this week......\" \"In Scientology......\" etc. Call each line once to see if it gives an instant read. The moment a line gives a reaction, stop, and do Step Four. Step Four: When a line reacts on the needle, say to the pc, \"The line......reacts. What can you tell me about this?\" Step Five: Keep Itsa Line in. Do not cut the pc's line. Do not ask for more than pc has. Let pc flounder around until pc finds the charge asked for in Step Four or says there's no such charge. (If a line reacted because the pc did not understand it, or by protest or decide, make it right with the pc and continue assessing.) Step Six: In a session: If pc found the by-passed charge, ask pc \"How do you feel now?\" If pc says he or she feels OK, cease assessing for ARC Breaks and go back to session actions. If pc says there's no such charge or gets misemotional at Auditor, keep on assessing on down the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 3 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 65 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES list for another active line, or even on to another list until the charge is found which makes pc relax. In a routine ARC Break check (not a session but for a longer period), don't stop as-sessing but keep on going as in Step Five, unless pc's cognition is huge. End of Steps Please notice: This is not R2H. There is no dating. The auditor does not further assist the pc with the meter in any way. If the pc blows up in your face on being given a type of charge, keep going, as you have not yet found the charge. Typical response to wrong charge found: Pc: \"Well of course it's a cut communication! You've been cutting my communication the whole session. You ought to be retreaded... etc.\" Note here that pc's attention is still on auditor. Therefore the correct charge has not been found. If the by-passed charge has been found the pc will relax and look for it, attention on own case. Several by-passed charges can exist and be found on one list. Therefore in cleaning up a week or an intensive or a career (any long period) treat a list like rudiments, cleaning every-thing that reacts. Blow down of the Tone Arm is the meter reaction of having found the correct by-passed charge. Keep doing Steps One to Six until you get a blow down of the Tone Arm. The pc feeling better and being happy about the ARC Break will coincide almost always with a Tone Arm Blow Down. You can, however, undo a session ARC Break Assessment by continuing beyond the pc's cognition of what it is. Continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited, invalidates the pc's cognition and cuts the Itsa Line and may cause a new ARC Break. Rarely, but sometimes, the ARC Break is handled with no TA blow down. PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT The purpose of an ARC Break Assessment is to return the pc into session or into Sci-entology or into an Org or course. By-passed charge can cause the person to blow out of ses-sion, or out of an Org or a course or Scientology. With a session (formerly \"in\"): Is defined as \"interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor\".

With Organization: With organization can be defined as \"interested in org or post and willing to communicate with or about org\". Against organization: Against organiza-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 4 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 66 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES tionness is defined as \"against organization or posts and protesting at org behaviour or existence\". The data about ARC Breaks can be expanded to marriage, companies, jobs, etc. In-deed to all dynamics – With Dynamic, Against Dynamic. What it boils down to is this: There are only two conditions of living, but many shades of grey to each one. These conditions are: 1. Life: Not ARC Broken: Capable of some affinity for, some reality about and some communication with the environment; and 2. Death: ARC Broken: Incapable of affinity for, reality about and communication with the environment. Under One we have those who can disenturbulate themselves and make some progress in life. Under Two we have those who are in such protest that they are stopped and can make little or no progress in life. One, we consider to be in some ARC with existence. Two, we consider to be broken in ARC with existence. In a session or handling the living lightning we handle, people can be hit by a forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them. Their affinity, reality and communication (life force) is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an ARC Break or have an ARC Broken aspect. If they know what charge it is they do not ARC Break or they cease to be ARC Bro-ken. It is the unknown character of the charge that causes it to have such a violent effect on the person. People do not ARC Break on known charge. It is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the ARC Break. This makes life look different (and more understandable). People continuously explain so glibly why they are acting as badly as they are. Whereas, if they really knew, they would not act that way. When the true character of the charge (or many charges as in a full case) is known to the person the ARC Break ceases. How much by-passed charge does it take to make a case? The whole sum of past by-passed charge. This fortunately for the pc is not all of it in constant restimulation. Therefore the per-son stays somewhat in one piece but prey to any restimulation. Auditing selectively restimulates, locates the charge and discharges it (as seen on the action of a moving Tone Arm)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT 5 HCOB 19.08.63 LEVEL 3 67 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES However, accidental rekindlings of past charge unseen by pc or auditor occur and the pc \"mysteriously\" ARC Breaks. Similarly people in life get restimulated also, but with nobody to locate the charge. Thus Scientologists are lucky. In heavily restimulated circumstances the person goes out of. In such a condition peo-ple want to stop things, cease to act, halt life, and failing this they try to run away. As soon as the actual by-passed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person, up goes Affinity and Reality and Communication and life can be lived. Therefore ARC Breaks are definite, their symptoms are known, their cure is very easy with this understanding and technology. An ARC Break Assessment seeks to locate the charge that served, being hidden, as a whip-hand force on the person. When it is located life returns. Locating the actual by-passed charge is returning life to the person. Therefore, properly handling ARC Breaks can be called, with no exaggeration \"Re-turning Life to the person\". One further word of caution: As experience will quickly tell you, seeking to do any-thing at all with an earlier by-passed charge incident which led to the ARC Break immedi-ately the earlier incident is found will lead to a vast mess. Let the pc talk about it all the pc pleases. But don't otherwise try to run it, date it or seek to find what by-passed charge caused the earlier incident. In assessing for ARC Breaks, keep the Itsa Line in very well and keep the What's It out in every respect except as contained in the above Six Steps. SUMMARY An ARC Break Assessment is simple stuff, so simple people are almost certain to complicate it. It only works when kept simple. Old auditors will see a similarity in an ARC Break Assessment List and old end rudi-ments. They can be handled much the same but only when one is covering a long time period. Otherwise assess only to cognition and drop it. The trouble in ARC Break Assessments comes from additives by the auditor, failure to keep on with additional lists if the type of charge causing the ARC Break isn't found on the first list chosen, failure to read the meter, and failure to keep the Itsa Line in. Doing ARC Break Assessments to cure ARC Breaks is not the same drill as R2H and confusing the two leads to trouble. Handled skillfully as above, ARC Break Assessing cures the great majority of woes of auditing, registraring, training and handling organization.

Worry about being able to cure them with assessment until you have confidence you can. There's nothing so uplifting as that confidence, except perhaps the ability to make any case get TA motion. Don't ever be \"reasonable\" about an ARC Break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one \"because......\".

He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc's remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on the W/S. If the pc's answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accom-pany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, \"Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.\" Do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do not chop what he is saying.

BIG WIN If half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/S action or ending the session. There are two reasons for this – one, the F/N will usually just persist and can't be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. This is not true of any other list. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any ear-lier data contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change – we F/N everything that reads by E/S or a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an F/N) and we never tell the pc that it read or didn't read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are not used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up. The purpose of these lists is to clean up by-passed charge."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 4 HCOB 3.7.71 LEVEL 3 72 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES _____________________ An auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list.

Remimeo All Levels F/N EVERYTHING Whenever an auditor gets a read on an item from Ruds or a prepared list (L1B, L3A, L4B, etc., etc.) it must be carried to an F/N. To fail to do so is to leave the pc with by-passed charge. When a pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to F/N, it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason. As one has done the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong? The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not car-ried to F/N. This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it Flag Auditing. When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible. Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared list would F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn't F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning. So the rule: Never walk off from a reading item on a rudiment or a prepared repair list be-fore you carry it down (earlier similar) to an F/N. Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N, Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc. until he gets an F/N. Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns. Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there an earlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list. Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on it that read, by 2WC or other process, to an F/N. So there is a much more general rule:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 2 HCOB 14.3.71R LEVEL 3 74 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES Every item that reads must F/N. In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure, F/N, Cog, VGIs. In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N. On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N. On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N. On GF you get by whatever process an F/N. On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N. So another rule: Every major and minor action must be carried to an F/N. There are no exceptions. Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc. Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained. You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge (a withheld cognition). __________________ I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with a very shining, cool calm pc. So \"Have reading items been left charged?\" would be a key question on a case. __________________ Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will get you reading items that won't F/N. So, another rule: Never try to fly ruds or do lib on a high or low TA. One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down). Or one can assess L4B. About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71 and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other items that read. __________________ "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 3 HCOB 14.3.71R LEVEL 3 75 INTERNSHIP HIGH CRIME REFERENCES The most frequent errors in all this are: Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as \"clean\".

If after a session the TA is still high or goes up, a wrong item has been found. 5. If pc says it is a wrong item it is a wrong item. 6. The question must be checked and must read as a question before it is listed. An item listed from a non-reading question will give you a \"Dead Horse\" (no item). 7. If the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling, the item is suppressed or invali-dated. 8. On a suppressed list, it must be nulled with suppressed. \"On...has anything been sup-pressed.\" 9.

On occasion when you pass the item in nulling, all subsequent items will read to a point where everything on list will then read. In this case take the first which read on first nulling. 12. An underlisted and overlisted list will ARC break the pc and he may refuse to be au-dited until list is corrected, and may become furious with auditor and will remain so till it is corrected. 13. Listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an ARC Br without handling the ARC Break first such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put a pc into a \"sad effect\". 14. A pc whose attention is on something else won't list easily. (List and null only with the rudiments in on the pc.) 15. An auditor whose TRs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items. 16. Listing and nulling errors in presence of Auditor's Code violations can unstabilize a pc. 17. The lack of a specific listing question or an incorrect non-standard listing question which doesn't really call for item will give you more than one item reading on a list. 18. You cease listing and nulling actions when a floating needle appears. 19. Always give a pc his item and circle it plainly on the list. 20. Listing and nulling are highly precise auditing actions and if not done exactly by the laws may bring about a down tone and slow case gain, but if done correctly exactly by the laws and with good auditing in general will produce the highest gains attainable.

You may extend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling. In its finest form, Listing and Nulling is done to LFBD F/N. The Auditor says the listing question to the PC, checks whether it read and notes the reads per Number 6 of the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Ideally, the following would happens. The Auditor checks the question \"Who got shot?\" It gets a long fall, so it is reading well. Auditor writes the read beside the question. Then the Auditor gives the PC the question with good TR 8, and PC gives items. The Auditor writes the Pc's items down, noting whether the item read and the read as the PC gives it. The first reads therefore is always the read the item gave as the PC said it. \"Who got shot?\" LF Me X Joe X Bearers Elephants X Tigers The Buffalo X IND. The White Hunter LFBD F/N The list could be shorter or longer, but ideally, the above would happen – the item will give an LFBD F/N on listing, and that is the item. It is given to the pc.

The Auditor gives the item to the PC. The PC will have Cogs and VGIs. It might happen that the PC tells the Auditor that this is the item, at which point the Auditor would pleasantly say \"thank you. 'The White Hunter' is your item.\" Or he could just smile and say \"Thank you\", in acknowledgment. But the point is that he would never chop the pc's Cog or enforce his presence on the PC while this is happening. Good TRs are vital. And this is the way you do Listing and Nulling. You get an LFBD F/N while Listing or while Nulling, if you're a flubless Auditor. It is the finest hand that gets it while Listing and never has to get to the Nulling stage. However, both are excellent. A list that has to be nulled to cm LFBD item is acceptable, but not worthy of praise. There is of course one other place where you could get an LFBD F/N in Listing and Nulling - which is while checking the listing question for read before listing. You could get an F/N on checking the question, and the PC could start cogging and blow the whole subject. When that happens, the subject has blown. Don't do anything more with it. Indicate the F/N and let the PC have his Cog and VGIs. Listing and Nulling is so simple. Have perfect TRs, know the Laws of Listing and Nulling, and do it as shown above. Any Auditor who consistently cannot get an LFBD F/N while Listing and Nulling should retrain on Listing and Nulling. It is more than likely he'll find he has bought some one else's misunderstoods or considerations on the subject. As a matter of fact, Listing and Nulling is a breeze and don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise.

You cease listing and nulling actions when a floating needle appears. You don't cease auditing. Do you get the nuance of that? (laughter) It means what it says. Now, always give the pc hit item and circle it plainly on the list. Wait wait wait a min-ute! That's auditing past listing and... Boy, you'd better. his F/N will pack right up, pc go around what was my item what was my item, what was my item. See the bank freezes before the pc speaks, so it probably went F/N before he gave you the item. You tee, he thought rag-bags, F/N, and then he says ragbags and you write it down. See, there it is. Sometimes when you are nulling (snaps fingers) you get your F/N. Now if you just sit there blankly the pc is going to go into mystery. So you always give the pc his item.
