Any checksheet in use or in stock which carries on it any degrading statement must be destroyed and issued without qualifying statements. Example: Level 0 to IV Checksheets SH carry \"A. Background Material – This section is included as an historical background, but has much interest and value to the student. Most of the processes are no longer used, having been replaced by more modern technology. The student is only required to read this material and ensure he leaves no misunderstood.\" This heading covers such vital things as TRs, Op Pro by Dup! The statement is a falsehood. These checksheets were not approved by myself, all the material of the academy and SH courses is in use. Such actions as this gave us \"Quickie Grades\", ARC broke the field and downgraded the academy and SH courses. A condition of Treason or cancellation of certificates or dismissal and a full investiga-tion of the background of any person found guilty, will be activated in the case of anyone committing the following High Crimes. 1. Abbreviating an official course in Dianetics and Scientology so as to lose the full the-ory, processes and effectiveness of the subjects. 2. Adding comments to checksheets or instructions labeling any material \"background\" or \"not used now\" or \"old\" or any similar action which will result in the student not knowing, using, and applying the data in which he is being trained. 3. Employing after 1 Sept 1970 any checksheet for any course not authorized by myself and the SO Organizing Bureau Flag. 4. Failing to strike from any checksheet remaining in use meanwhile any such comments as \"historical\", \"background\", \"not used\", \"old\", etc. or verbally stating it to stu-dents."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"TECHNICAL DEGRADES 2 HCO PL 17.6.70R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 2 HPCS 5. Permitting a pc to attest to more than one grade at a time on the pc's own determinism without hint or evaluation. 6. Running only one process for a lower grade between 0 to IV, where the grade EP has not been attained. 7. Failing to use all processes for a level where the EP has not been attained. 8. Boasting as to speed of delivery in a session, such as \"I put in grade zero in three min-utes.\" etc. 9. Shortening time of application of auditing for financial or laborsaving considerations. 10. Acting in any way calculated to lose the technology of Dianetics and Scientology to use or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application. Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When the product vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet. L.

Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. \"Quickie grades\" entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not \"entirely a tech matter\" as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can't get the technology applied then you can't deliver what's promised. It's as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what's promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 4 HPCS So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 6 HPCS So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 7 HPCS still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 8 HPCS Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 9 HPCS But we won't have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance.

Remimeo All Hats BPI SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY For some years we have had a word \"squirreling\". It means altering Scientology, off-beat practices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why. Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or a perfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system. In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workable system. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another. Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of Scientology. Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact mark-ings in the tunnels. It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out. It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also a clear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth. Therefore it is a workable system, a route that can be traveled. What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy guide. What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure the su-pervisor knew worked. You'd think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor. What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You'd think he was a pretty heartless guide. You'd expect him to say at least, \"Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn't go that way.\" All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his pre-clear eventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition? People have following the route mixed up with \"the right to have their own ideas.\" Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions – so long as these do not bar the route out for self and others."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY 2 HCO PL 14.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 12 HPCS Scientology is a workable system.

Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess. So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. He isn't following the route. Scientology is a new thing – it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all the sales-manship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routes are being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery. Scientology is the only workable system Man has. It has already taken people toward higher IQ, better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor. Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now the route only needs to be walked. So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don't let them off of it no matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them.

To people who have no personal reality on the results of processing it is especially easy to be \"reasonable\" about no results. The public is not result conscious. This is proven by a century of botched up psychia-try and psychology. At no time in that century has a government or a society recognized or demanded results. The evidence that this is a fact is very plain. Psychiatry and psychology have never achieved a positive lasting result of any benefit but on the contrary downgrade, injure and kill. Yet they are still functioning as professions. Now this seems to be an invitation or justification for an org not to try for any results. But the truth is that the public is with you just so long as results are achieved. As soon as they aren't achieved, areas become upset. And as for psychiatry and psychology, they are functioning but resultless, are in seri-ous trouble and are despised. So there is no tradition of or any general belief in results in the society or its govern-ments. Thus an org can become sloppy as there is no visible demand for results. There is only an invisible hope. And a definite reaction when they don't occur. We can and do achieve results beyond anyone's hopes. So long as we continue to do this our area control will expand. When we don't it will contract. In view of the above lack of demand, it is up to us to hold up our own standards. Qual-ity is a matter we must give constant attention. We must produce: 1.

Example: The OCA graph of a pc \"completing\" his Dianetics is all below the line – unacceptable. We don't kid ourselves, pay a completion bonus to the auditor and let the pc go. We say, \"Sorry. You haven't made it. This takes more auditing.\" Example: A student \"graduates\" from the Academy yet doesn't audit. We call him back, find out why, word clear him, drill him, demand he interne. As long as a student or pc thinks his failure to make it is all right with you, you will have a bad repute in his area. Privately he will think the subject doesn't work and that you are frauds. The moment you say to somebody who hasn't made it, \"You have not met our stan-dards\" truth and respect go in. Reversely, the moment you say to somebody who has made it that he has, the truth of your skill is apparent to him.

Not apply what you studied. 3. Follow \"advice\" contrary to what you find on HCOBs and tapes. 4. Fail to obtain the HCOBs, books and tapes needed. There is no hidden data line. All of Dianetics and Scientology works. Some of it works faster. The only real error auditors made over the years was to fail to stop a process the mo-ment they saw a floating needle. Recently the felony has been compounded by disclosure of the facts that data and tapes have been deleted from checksheets, data has been \"relegated to background\" and grades have not been in use fully to complete end phenomena as per the process column on the classification and gradation chart. This caused an almost complete unmock of the subject and its use. I am counting on you to see it is not allowed to happen ever again. Any supervisor or executive who interprets, alters or cancels tech is liable to the as-signment of a condition of enemy. All the data is in HCOBs or policy letters or on tape.

This started me looking. For there is no such line. I wondered if it was a \"missed withhold of nothing\". There can be one of these, you know. There is nothing there, yet the auditor tries to get it and the pc ARC breaks. This is \"cleaning a clean\" with an E-Meter. One pc I cleaned up very nicely had been harassed for years about \"an incident that happened when she was five\". A lot of people had tried to \"get it\". The pc was in a pitiful condition. I found there was nothing there. No incident at all! The meter read came from the charge on previous auditing. I think probably she must have sneezed or her finger slipped on the cans when first asked about \"an incident when you were five\". An auditor who \"sees a read\" when there is no charge makes a \"missed withhold of nothing\". This is the other side of the ARC break – the gone something, the non-existence of something. No food. No money. These things ARC break people. So it is with a \"missed withhold of nothing\". Take Johannesburg. Some years ago the field there was upset by three rabble rousers who alleged all manner of wild things about the Scientology org there. They held wild field meetings and all that. Truth was these three people had done a vicious thing and screamed to high heaven when I sought to query them. They made a \"missed withhold of nothing\" in the field in that area! There was exactly nothing wrong with Scientology there or us. There was something wrong with those three people. They had been stealing from the org. The field kept looking for what was wrong with the org or us. Nothing was. So it couldn't be cleaned up because there was nothing to clean. There were three thieves who had run off with org property and defied orders to give it back. How this made something wrong with us is quite a puzzle. They are still \"cleaning up this ARC Break\" in Johannesburg! For it is not cleanable, not being there to be cleaned! Unless you realize there was nothing there at all! It's a missed withhold of nothing. The basic org and staff and we at Saint Hill were just doing our jobs in ordinary routine!"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE „HIDDEN DATA LINE“ 2 HCO PL 16.4.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 30 HPCS Governments looking for evil in Scientology orgs will go mad (I trust) as they are seeking a non-existent thing. They are easily defeated because their statements are so crazy even their own legal systems can't help but see it. So it's easily won. The only person who goes mad on a missed withhold of nothing is the person who thinks there is something there that isn't. So it is with the \"hidden data line\" students sometimes feel must exist on courses. There is no line. But in this case there is an apparency of a line. When instructors or seniors give out alter-ised technology or unusual solutions, the student feels they must have some inside track, some data line the student doesn't have. The student looks for it and starts alter-ising in his turn pretending to have it when they become instructors. It's a missed withhold of nothing. The whole of technology is released in HCO Bulletins and HCO Policy Letters and tapes I do and release. I don't tell people anything in some private way, not even instructors. For instance, all the instructors I taught to handle R6 we taught by my lecturing or writing bulletins for them. Every one of these tapes is used to teach GPM data and handling to students on the Saint Hill Course. Any new data I have given on it has been given to all these people. The instructor then knows only to the degree he has studied and used the very same HCOBs and HCO Pol Ltrs and tapes the student is now using. There is no \"hidden data line\". To believe there is makes an ARC Break. The apparency is somebody's pretence to know from me more than is on the tapes and in books and mimeos, or, brutally, somebody's alter-is of materials. This looks like a \"hidden data line\". It surely isn't. All the lower level materials are in the HCOBs, Pol Ltrs or on tapes. All the GPM materials released are here waiting for the student when he reaches that level. One could say there was one if one was way off the main data line. But it sure isn't hidden. It's on courses and in orgs. I laughed one time at the top flight US Government White House entrusted psycholo-gist. He looked over some startling IQ changes, said such a thing would revolutionize psy-chology overnight if known and added \"no wonder you keep your technology secret!\" That is very funny when you look at how hard you and I work to make it known to all! The data line isn't hidden. It's there for anyone to have. There's lots of it is possibly a source of trouble in releasing it. But it's all on courses in Academies or Saint Hill.

But even my closest staff and communicators when it hears of a new process or plan from me verbally, sees it in an HCOB or HCO Pol Ltr a few days later. Don't for heaven's sake mistake alter-is by somebody as evidence of a hidden line. In Scientology we say \"If it isn't written it isn't true\". That applies to orders. Some-body says \"Ron said to . . .\" and on a veteran staff you hear the rejoinder \"Let's see it\". I've had raw meat walk into an org and say \"Ron said I was to have 25 hours of auditing\". And in the raw meat days of orgs, they sometimes were given it. So we have learned the hard way – \"If it isn't written it wasn't said\". And that applies to anybody's orders, not just mine. And on tech and policy, it's equally true. If it isn't in an HCOB or an HCO Pol Ltr or recorded on a tape in my voice, it isn't tech or policy. Next time you hear a pretended order or a squirrel process attributed to me, say \"If it isn't written or recorded it isn't true\". And watch how tech results soar then in that area. LRH:ml.rd L.

Additives made things unworkable. After 1966 when I left the post of Executive Director WW, a new condition set in. Checksheets, processes, intensives, grades began to be cut down. This we can dub a cutative impulse to coin a word. So persuasive were its advocates that even I was persuaded to agree to some points of it so you need not feel bad if you were gulled into buying the idea of shortening things in or-der to produce a quicker result. No one really saw where the trend was going. In 1970 a survey I have just completed has shown that this effort was so complete that the following had been broadly accomplished: A. Training no longer included enough Scientology materials to make an effective Scientology auditor in many places. B. Grades had been shortened from 50 hours 0 to IV to 2½ minutes. C. The End Phenomena of grades and processes were discarded. The end result has been: 1. Few skilled auditors. 2. Shrunken and struggling Scn orgs. 3. A field that is disappointed in results – for they think they have had grades and haven't. 4. People coming into Advanced Orgs to be cleared who have NO lower grades ac-tually run and so they can't make any upper grades. In effect Scientology was thrown away. From total workability it was cut down to oc-casional result. I saw the first impulse of this in an executive long since dismissed from Saint Hill as a constant overt no-case gain case who agitated constantly to remove tapes from the Saint Hill Course. As 90% of the data on the SHSBC is on tape I merely thought he had gone over to the enemy and ignored him. Some others, however, had the same idea and started labeling basic books and bulletins \"Mere Background Data\" or saying \"We don't use that now\" or \"That's"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"CUTATIVES 2 HCO PL 30.5.70 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 34 HPCS old and you only look at it for interest\". Thus the laws of listing and other phenomena were thrown away. Recently I found the reason Case Supervisors failed is that they just don't know \"The Original Thesis\" and \"Evolution of a Science\" or \"Scn 8-80\" or \"Scn 8-8008\". When I de-manded they study these books they became capable of handling cases. They did not know what they were handling – the mind – and so how could they be sensible in ordering what was to be run on a case? Back in 1950 we used to have a small bunch of goony birds, ex-psychologists, ex-lunatics. They were constantly demanding a 2 second action that totally cleared someone. Behind this was an inability to concentrate attention or even to work. These were people striv-ing for total effect instantly. Yet they couldn't run with reality on any process heavier than \"How are you?\" and they never saw a wall – they saw a mock up of it! So the impulse of do it all now now that destroyed any sanity of psychiatry is always around. A student with a one item checksheet who does it in one minute is the ideal course to such. A preclear run for 2½ minutes to total top grades becomes an ideal auditing session to such. Such things just aren't real. And such unreality got into the lines too hard and is being escorted right back out right now. The following policies are in full force and are to be backed up fully. 1. Course checksheets may not be cut, edited or reduced after a fully approved checksheet is issued for use on any course. 2. No grade may be awarded for which all processes of that grade have not been run and where the end phenomena of that grade is not attested to singly and fully by the preclear before an examiner. 3. Anyone found relegating basic materials to unimportance, by reason of age or volume is to lose his post and certificates. 4. Any statistic claimed which is achieved by downgrading materials or grades or falsely pretending an end phenomena has been achieved for pcs, or skill by audi-tors shall result in the dismissal of the division head presenting it. 5. No suppressive person with a fat ethics file and no case gain may hold any execu-tive position in a Scientology org. ___________________ If you in any org or franchise are having any field or financial trouble you need not look further than errors pointed out in this Policy Letter. \"Dianetic Triples\" awarded after 1½ hours of processing, \"multiple declares\" after 10 minutes from 0 to IV, using checksheets from which all basic material has been cut, the fail-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"CUTATIVES 3 HCO PL 30.5.70 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 35 HPCS ure to realize gains and abilities and success have to be worked for to be true, are at the bot-tom of any trouble any org or franchise is having.

In Scientology a course consists of a checksheet with all the actions and material listed on it and all the materials on the checksheet available in the same order. \"Checksheet Material\" means the policy letters, bulletins, tapes, mimeo issues, any reference book or any books mentioned. \"Materials\" also include clay, furniture, tape players, bulletin boards, routing forms, supplies of pink sheets, roll book, student files, file cabinets and any other items that will be needed. If you look this over carefully, it does not say \"materials on order\" or \"except for those we haven't got\" or \"in different order\". It means what it says exactly. If a student is to have auditing or word clearing rundowns or must do auditing those are under actions and appear on the checksheet. A course must have a Supervisor. He may or may not be a graduate and experienced practitioner of the course he is supervising but he must be a trained Course Supervisor. He is not expected to teach. He is expected to get the students there, rolls called, checkouts properly done, misunderstoods handled by finding what the student doesn't dig and getting the student to dig it. The Supervisor who tells students answers is a waste of time and a course destroyer as he enters out-data into the scene even if trained and actually especially if trained in the subject. The Supervisor is not an \"instructor\", that's why he's called a \"Supervi-sor\". A Supervisor's skill is in spotting dope-off, glee and other manifestations of misun-derstoods, and getting it cleaned up, not in knowing the data so he can tell the student. A Supervisor should have an idea of what questions he will be asked and know where to direct the student for the answer. Student blows follow misunderstoods. A Supervisor who is on the ball never has blows as he caught them before they happened by observing the student's misunderstanding before the student does and getting it tracked down by the student."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE? 2 HCO PL 16.3.71R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 38 HPCS It is the Supervisor's job to get the student through the checksheet fully and swiftly with minimum lost time. The successful Supervisor is tough. He is not a kindly old fumbler. He sets high checksheet targets for each student for the day and forces them to be met or else. The Supervisor is spending Supervisor Minutes. He has just so many to spend. He IS spending Student Hours. He has just so many of these to spend so he gets them spent wisely and saves any waste of them. A Supervisor in a course of any size has a Course Administrator who has very exact duties in keeping up Course Admin and handing out and getting back materials and not losing any to damage or carelessness. If Paragraphs One to Three above are violated it is the Course Administrator who is at fault. He must have checksheets and the matching material in adequate quantity to serve the course. If he doesn't he has telexes flying and mimeo sweating. The Course Admin is in charge of routing lines and proper send-off and return of students to Cramming or Auditing or Ethics. The final and essential part of a course is students. If a course conforms with this P/L exactly with no quibbles, is tough, precisely time scheduled and run hard, it will be a full expanding course and very successful. If it varies from this P/L it will stack up bodies in the shop, get blows and incompetent graduates. The final valuable product of any course is graduates who can apply successfully the material they studied and be successful in the subject. This answers the question What is a Course? If any of these points are out it is NOT a Scientology Course and it will not be successful. Thus, the order \"Put a Course there!\" means this P/L in full force. So here's the order, when offering training put a course there. L.

A whole course can be wrecked by lack of study materials. Speed of Training was a major 1969 breakthrough. It takes only 2 weeks to a month to make a competent Dianetic auditor using Standard Dianetics. This can be greatly retarded by study material scarcity. The best way to handle this is to have plenty of study packs, books and clay. Another way to handle it is to break the checksheet down into parts A, B, C and D and issue different sections of it to a broad new course. It does not greatly matter which one the student does first. Material scarcity tends to equalize itself when a course enrolls every day. You gradu-ally get a spread-out of materials. In past years study materials have been a continuing problem. All possible is being done to make this easier. But as Dianetics expands it will probably never cease to be a prob-lem.

(Paragraph three under the ASSESSMENT section on page 4 of this HCOB has been revised to update and expand upon the use of Prepared Lists in handling cases.) Keeping Scientology Working Series 26 OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN The term \"Out Tech\" means that Scientology is not being applied or is not being cor-rectly applied. When Tech is in we mean that Scientology is being applied and is being cor-rectly applied. By Tech is meant technology, referring of course to the application of the pre-cise scientific drills and processes of Scientology. Technology means the methods of applica-tion of an art or science as opposed to mere knowledge of the science or art itself. One could know all about the theory of motor cars and the science of building them and the art of de-signing them and still not be able to build, plan or drive one. The practices of building, plan-ning or driving a motor car are quite distinct from the theory, science and art of motor cars. An auditor is not just a Scientologist. He or she is one who can apply it. Thus the tech-nology of Scientology is its actual application to oneself, a preclear or the situations one en-counters in life. Tech implies use. There is a wide gap between mere knowledge and the application of that knowledge. When we say tech is out, we might also say, \"While that unit or person may know all about Scientology, that person does not actually apply it.\" A skilled auditor knows not only Scientology but how to apply the technology to self, pcs and life. Many persons auditing have not yet crossed over from \"knowing about\" to \"applying\". Thus you see them fooling about with pcs. When a skilled auditor sees a critical pc he knows bang – pc has a withhold and pulls it. That's because this auditor's tech is in. Meaning he knows what to do with his data."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 2 HCOB 13.9.65R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 42 HPCS Some other person who knows a lot of Scientology, has had courses and all that, yet sees a critical pc and then tries to add up everything he knows about pcs and stumbles about and then decides on a Zero pc it's a new thing that's wrong that's never been seen before. What's the difference here? It's the difference between a person who knows but cannot apply and a skilled technician who can apply the knowledge. Most golfers know that you have to keep your eye on the ball just before, during and after you hit it. That's the basic datum of powerful, long drives down the fairway. So if this is so well known then why do so few golfers do it? They have arrived at a point of knowing they must. They have not yet arrived at a point of being able to. Then their heads get so scrambled, seeing all their bad drives which didn't go down the fairway, that they buy rabbits feet or new clubs or study ballistics. In short, not being able to do it, they disperse and do something else. All auditors go through this. All of them, once trained, know the right processes. Then they have to graduate up to doing the right processes. Observation plays an enormous role in this. The auditor is so all thumbs with his meter and unfamiliar tools he has no time or attention to see what goes on with the pc. So for 15 years lots of auditors made releases without ever noticing it. They were so involved in know-ing and so unskilled in applying, they never saw the ball go down the fairway for a 200 yard drive! So they began to do something else and squirrel. There was the pc going release, but the auditor, unskilled as a technician for all his knowledge of the science, never saw the audit-ing work even though even the auditing done that badly did work. Do you get the point? You have to know your tools very very well to see past them! An auditor who squir-rels, who fools about with a pc, who fumbles around and seldom gets results just isn't suffi-ciently familiar with a session, its patter, his meter and the mind to see past them to the pc. Drill overcomes this. The keynote of the skilled technician is that he is a product of practice. He has to know what he is trying to do and what elements he is handling. Then he can produce a result. I'll give you an example: I told an auditor to look over a past session of known date on a pc and find what was missed in that session. Something must have been missed as the pc's tone arm action collapsed in that session and ever afterwards was nil. So this auditor looked for a \"missed withhold from the auditor in that session\". The ordered repair was a complete dud. Why? This auditor did not know that anything could be missed except a withhold of the hidden overt type. He didn't know there could be an inadvertent withhold wherein the pc thinks he is withholding because the auditor didn't hear or acknowledge. This auditor didn't know that an item on a list could be missed and tie up TA. But if he did know these things he didn't know them well enough to do them. A second more skilled auditor took over and bang! the missed item on the list was quickly found. The more skilled auditor simply asked, \"In that session what was missed?\" and promptly got it. The former auditor had taken a simple order, \"Find what was missed in that session,\" and turned it into something else: \"What withhold was missed in that session?\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 3 HCOB 13.9.65R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 43 HPCS His skill did not include applying a simple direct order as auditing looked very com-plex to him as he had so much trouble with doing it. You can train somebody in all the data and not have an auditor. A real auditor has to be able to apply the data to the pc. Importances play a huge part in this. I had a newly graduated darkroom photographic technician at work. It was pathetic to see the inability to apply important data. The virtues of ancient equipment and strange tricks to get seldom required effects were all at his fingertips. But he did not know that you wiped developer off your hands before loading fresh film. Con-sequently he ruined every picture taken with any film he loaded. He did not know you washed chemicals out of bottles before you put different chemicals in them. Yet he could quote by the yard formulas not in use for 50 years! He knew photography. He could not apply what he knew. Soon he was straying all over the place trying to find new developers and papers and new methods. Whereas all he had to do was learn how to wash his hands and dry them before handling new film. I also recall a 90-day wonder in World War II who came aboard in fresh new gold braid and with popped eyes stared at the wheel and compass. He said he'd studied all about them but had never seen any before and had often wondered if they really were used. How he imagined ships were steered and guided beyond the sight of land is a mystery. Maybe he thought it was all done by telepathy or an order from the Bureau of Navigation! Alter-is and poor results do not really come from not-know. They come from can't-apply. Drills, drills, drills and the continual repetition of the important data handle this condi-tion of can't-apply. If you drill auditors hard and repeat often enough basic auditing facts, they eventually disentangle themselves and begin to do a job of application. IMPORTANT DATA The truly important data in an auditing session are so few that one could easily memo-rize them in a few minutes. From case supervisor or auditor viewpoint: 1. If an auditor isn't getting results either he or the pc is doing something else. 2. There is no substitute for knowing how to run and read a meter perfectly. 3. An auditor must be able to read, comprehend and apply HCO Bs and instructions. 4. An auditor must be familiar enough with what he's doing and the mechanics of the mind to be able to observe what is happening with the pc. 5. There is no substitute for perfect TRs. 6. An auditor must be able to duplicate the auditing command and observe what is hap-pening and continue or end processes according to their results on the pc."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 4 HCOB 13.9.65R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 44 HPCS 7. An auditor must be able to see when he's released the pc and end off quickly and eas-ily with no shock or overrun. 8. An auditor must have observed results of his standard auditing and have confidence in it. CASE REACTION The auditor and the Case Supervisor must know the only six reasons a case does not advance. They are: 1. Pc is Suppressive. 2. Pc is always a Potential Trouble Source if he Roller Coasters and only finding the right suppressive will clean it up. No other action will. There are no other reasons for a Roller Coaster (loss of gain obtained in auditing). 3. One must never audit an ARC Broken pc for a minute even but must locate and indi-cate the by-passed charge at once. To do otherwise will injure the pc's case. 4. A present time problem of long duration prevents good gain and sends the pc into the back track. 5. The only reasons a pc is critical are a withhold or a misunderstood word and there is NO reason other than those. And in trying to locate a withhold it is not a motivator done to the pc but something the pc has done. 6. Continuing overts hidden from view are the cause of no case gain (see number 1, Sup-pressive). The only other possible reason a pc does not gain on standard processing is the pc or the auditor failed to appear for the session. Now honestly, aren't those easy? But a trainee fumbling about with meter and what he learned in a bog of unfamiliarity will always tell you it is something else than the above. Such pull motivators, audit ARC Broken pcs who won't even look at them, think Roller Coaster is caused by eating the wrong cereal and remedy it all with some new wonderful action that collapses the lot. ASSESSMENT You could meter assess the first group 1 to 8 on an auditor and the right one would fall and you could fix it up. You could meter assess the second group 1 to 6 on a pc and get the right answer every time that would remedy the case.

Plus there are"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 5 HCOB 13.9.65R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 45 HPCS dozens of other Prepared Lists which are designed to handle various things that can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. HCOB 29 April 80 PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND PURPOSE, summarizes the various types of Prepared Lists and their use. When I tell you these are the answers, I mean it. I don't use anything else. And I catch my sinning auditor or bogged down pc every time. To give you an idea of the simplicity of it, a pc says she is \"tired\" and therefore has a somatic. Well, that can't be it because it's still there. So I ask for a problem and after a few given the pc hasn't changed so it's not a problem. I ask for an ARC Break and bang! I find one. Knowing the principles of the mind, and as I observe pcs, I see it's better but not gone and ask for a previous one like it. Bang! That's the one and it blows completely. I know that if the pc says it's A and it doesn't blow, it must be something else. I know that it's one of six things. I assess by starting down the list. I know when I've got it by looking at the pc's reac-tions (or the meter's). And I handle it accordingly. Also, quite vitally, I know it's a limited number of things. And even more vitally I know by long experience as a technician that I can handle it fully and proceed to do so. There is no \"magic\" touch in auditing like the psychiatrist believes. There is only skilled touch, using known data and applying it. Until you have an auditor familiar with his tools, cases and results you don't have an auditor. You have a collected confusion of hope and despair rampant amongst non-stable data. Study, drill and familiarity overcome these things. A skilled technician knows what gets results and gets them. So drill them. Drill into them the above data until they chant them in their sleep. And finally comes the dawn. They observe the pc before them, they apply standard tech. And wonderful to behold there are the results of Scientology, complete. Tech is in. L.

Excellent Auditor training is now in the reach of every Academy. And these are the only things in the long run that will count. When I see an Organization staff panting after newspaper publicity or going mad on the subject of dissemination, and at the same time turning in to me bad results and poor stu-dent quality, I know somebody has their targets mixed up. Quality is the only thing that counts. If quality in training and processing is not given first rank and constant priority by Secretaries or Executive Secretaries, then all the admini-stration in the world will not make the grade for any Central Org. Deliver the goods. That's a crude way to put it. But if you want a new and better civili-zation you won't get it by advertising or worrying what people think of you. You will get it only by releasing and clearing people and sending them out into the society to get the show on the road in all branches of human activity, including Scientology. I know we have been a long time without clearing people. But we're clearing them now. What does it take to clear people? It takes highly skilled and tightly supervised auditing. It takes good technology. It takes good technical application. If you'll forget about how easy it is to mob students all up in a class and actually con-front each student as an individual, make sure he knows every essential step he has to know, make sure all his questions get answered, you'll have auditors that can audit. Will you please put attention on raising technical skill in the HGC, releasing people, clearing people, and on the quality of training in the Academy to the end of getting every stu-dent capable of all the steps necessary to release people. I have made the grade technically in the field of research. Now it's time to drop all the booboo's and nonsense.

These are: 1. Providing valuable subject materials; 2. Organizing and codifying those materials so that they are highly effective and com-prehensible; and 3. Supervising the student in those materials to a point of high comprehension and com-petency. In Scientology (1) has been done, fully and completely. There are now no gaps or un-answered questions. In (2) the very best of Scientology has been selected out for supervision and is being written in such a way as to minimize any confusion and maximize the communication and practice of the data. In (3) we have our largest potential randomity. And it is this with which this Policy Letter is concerned. The Supervision of the student is a personalized matter. Students require answers to their own questions and clarification of their own understandings. The burden of this falls on the Supervisor. In auditing it has taken us a long time to learn that there are no bad preclears. There are only auditor errors. We have now learned a similar thing about Supervising. There are no slow students. There are only slow Supervisors. The length of time a student is on a course is a direct index of the quality of Supervi-sion on that course. A fast course is well supervised. A slow course is poorly supervised. A bad course gets bad enrolments. A good course gets good enrolments. If enrolment is down, the course is a poor course. That has been observed continually in Academies for years and has no variations. If you want a full course, provide a well-supervised course."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"SCIENTOLOGY COURSES 2 HCO PL 10.4.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 50 HPCS If course enrolments are down, don't ponder beyond this how to improve the course.

The purpose of these TRs is to train the student supervisor to carry out these basic actions of a supervisor so as to produce effectively trained people who can and will apply the data. Each TR should be done on a slight gradient first and then worked up to a good steep gradient where appropriate. All the TRs should be done over and over until they are all known cold. They must be drilled and drilled until the student supervisor can/will do these actions while he is supervising. During these TRs if a student laughs because of increased awareness or cognition he should not be flunked. If he wishes to originate about the win, fine. Then get back to the drill, or end off. The student supervisor must in all cases have with him a clip board and a stack of pink sheets. This is a standard tool of a supervisor. In many of the drills there is more than one coach. Only one coach should do the flunking and passing. Also the coach should not be more interested in being clever than in watching the student. The coach must make sure the student is doing the drill correctly and coach with a purpose. Give the student wins on a gradient. A lot of the drills call for very good intention.

The coach picks these objects out starting with the smaller ones first. The student confronts the object picked by the coach and the coach passes him when the Student is comfortable confronting the object or space and shows no reaction.

Training Stress: The student supervisor walks around the classroom with coach. He has a clip board and pen and paper. The student walks around the class and marks down bad and good indicators as he sees them. To name a few, this would include dope off, frowns, students be-ing noisy, tables out of line, no progress board, no demo kit, confusion caused by skipped gradient, a student's attention wandering, students not cogniting, students cogniting, students attentively at work, tables neat, progress board up and in PT, graphs up and in PT, lots of clay for the students, lots of packs, etc. These are just some of the bad and good indicators. The student merely marks these down on his paper on the clip board. Keep it simple. The stu-dent learns that there are indicators to be spotted and learns what they are. The student is passed when he can rapidly spot indicators and write them down quickly and neatly. You may have to repeat the drill a few times until the student is used to all the indicators that are pre-sent and can write them down quickly.

Dope off, talking, messy area, unstraight tables, loud voices etc. The supervisor must handle each until the entire area is quiet and orderly with in Tech. He must also decide which to handle first. For instance if one student is manifesting dope off and the other has a messy area, you would handle the dope off first. Then handle the messy area. Or if two students were being very noisy and another wasn't using a demo kit you might want to handle the noise level quickly and then handle the demo kit student as the high noise level might enturbulate the whole class.

A Checksheet is a form which sets out the exact sequence of items to be studied or done by a student, in order, item by item, on a course. It lists all the materials of the course in order to be studied with a place for the student (or the person checking the student out in the case of a Starrate Checkout) to put his initial and the date as each item on the Checksheet is studied, performed or checked out. The Checksheet is the programme that the student follows to complete that course. Every student is given a complete Checksheet at the start of a course. It is not added to after he has started working on it. It is in its final form when it is handed to him. It may be added to for those who enroll later but is not added to during the course. The data of the course are studied and its drills performed in the order on the check-sheet. The student does not \"jump around\" or study the material in some other order. The ma-terials are set out in the Checksheet in the best order for study by the student so that he covers all the material in logical sequence. Further, following the exact order of the Checksheet has a disciplinary function which assists the student to study. The student's initial beside an item is an attestation that he knows in detail AND can apply the material contained in that bulletin, Policy Letter or tape, or that he has done and can do that drill. The initial of the supervisor or another student against a starrated item is an at-testation by him that he has given the student a Starrate checkout on the item in accordance with HCO Policy Letter of 14 May 1969 Issue II \"How to do a Starrate Checkout\" and that the student has passed. The Course Supervisor must inspect students' checksheets daily to ensure that all stu-dents are following the checksheet in its correct set out order, and that the student is making good progress through it. \"Through a Checksheet\" means through the entire checksheet – theory, practical, all drills – and done in sequence. When a course consists of three times through the Checksheet, the student goes through three entire Checksheets once, theory, practical and all drills in se quence, completing that, and then goes through the entire next checksheet a second time, and then goes through a third checksheet fully a third time.

No short cuts or skimping is allowed on retraining, as a student who fails to apply one aspect of the course had a misun-derstood which would have prevented him from fully grasping and understanding the other material on previous times through the Checksheet.

HCO BULLETIN OF 29 SEPTEMBER 1958 VITAL TRAINING DATA (This Bulletin Changes the Character of Training) No instructor can train a student unless he follows the Instructor's Code. This code is learned by heart by an instructor, not read. Wherever we are making poor auditors, we have confused the role of the Academy with that of the HGC. The HGC processes, the Academy trains only. Tell every student, tell every class of students, tell every instructor many times, There are only auditors at the academy. There are no cases. Every time you as an instructor get interested in the student's case, you make him put up his engrams for your inspection. Every time you get interested in his auditing skill only, you make him put up auditing skill for your interest. From this date: Under no circumstances may an academy take up the personal or case problems of a student. We've got 2,500,000,000 preclears. We can somehow control ourselves long enough to make a few auditors. They are made by direct, blunt instruction, the tougher the better. They are unmade by a lot of super saccharine sympathy about their poor, hopeless little cases. So let's go, training units. No more clinics where there should be schools. You'll have nothing but cases forever if you don't make some auditors! The week's intensive formerly offered with courses is turned over herewith to HGCs. No further clinics as such may be run by Academies. Auditing may occur in Academies but there may not be preclear conferences, general or private, about the students' own cases. This works a hardship on HGCs to some degree but HGCs occasionally are victimized by having to train late students who were not trained but only processed through to HCA/HPA. Thus an HGC has an interest in training quality. Hereinafter all processing for keeps will be done in the HGC and all training will be done in the Academy."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"VITAL TRAINING DATA 2 HCOB 29.9.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 70 HPCS There is a standard toward which a student is trained. It includes two disciplines. For-mal Auditing and Tone 40 Auditing. Formal is taught in Comm Course, Tone 40 in Upper Indoc. Students must know their codes and must know how to follow them – no evaluation, no invalidation. All of Dianetics, the Anatomy branch of Scientology must be taught. The six simple types of processing are taught. The axioms are taught. Anatomy of the mind is taught, not just a lot of figure-figure theory. The student gets there by finding he can confront in a preclear locks, secondaries, engrams, chains, time track, circuits, machinery, valences, the parts of livingness. Manifestations of phenomena are taught, overt-act motivator sequences, problems, computations, cognitions, comm lags, introversion, extroversion, exteriorization, A-R-C. Scales are taught – ARC Scale, Effect Scale. The Academies must now undertake 3 separate courses and adhere to each. If an instructor won't confront students he starts a big theory course that avoids all anatomy, takes up the personal problems of the students, excuses every failure to teach by saying it was student case. If case gets in the road send the student to the HGC to pay for au-diting or not. If theory gets in the road of training auditors, teach anatomy only. Let's go on this. I am instructing all HCO Boards of Review to examine completely on the above out-lined items only and to flunk hard any student who doesn't know his subject. We care little for the synopses and the paper work. We want auditors who know their business, not a lot of squirrels. A pc gets well in direct ratio to his ability to confront the anatomy of life, the anatomy of mind and the physical universe. How do you suppose you'll ever get any auditing done if the student can't confront, via a pc yet, life, the anatomy of the mind and the physical universe. It's easier for a student to confront than a preclear to confront. I've got a big idea for training: to wit: Let's deliver the goods! L.

In event of a poor or difficult student, it must be demanded by supervisors that the matter be remedied by review or ethics. Students must be trained to resolve their problems with Scientology. Students must be trained to audit regardless of their own restimulation or case. When auditing, auditors do not have cases. Students must not be permitted to sag or slack or fall away in attendance and this can be done because all such attitudes result from a student's failure to obtain a reality early in training. We must train new Scientologists so that we can have pride and confidence in them as Scientologists, not from an examination of their record but from the sole fact that they have been Academy trained.

These categories contain all the students who disturb your course, are insolent to instructors, rant against rules, etc. You are under no orders from me that you must please them but you are under orders to report such cases to HCO. You only use difficult case or student in the Academy as an indicator of some-thing worse. You aren't a staff auditor but an instructor. You want proper auditor and case gain of course, and you'll get it (providing when some student says it didn't work to find out exactly what the student did that didn't work and you'll find it was never what was ordered). However, on cases that are very difficult, watch it! These difficult cases are more than cases. They mean trouble for you from that student and for your class in ways you wouldn't look for. By concentrating on \"tough cases\" you miss the fact that you have a whole class to handle. If you want it handled, look rather at what these tough cases do to your class and han-dle the \"tough case\" in a way to protect your course, not to make their cases move.

Instead, the justice codes are in. The students are Scientologists. Becoming students gives them no new rights. And it doesn't remove their justice rights either. I've been through all you go through and I have found, by comparing conduct on a course to conduct in the field afterwards, that the turbulent student is a pc, not a student. He or she makes trouble. On the course and afterwards. The total symptom that alerts you to such a person is \"tough case\". This is very easy to notice. Just look over the student case folders and note that one or another student doesn't seem to get going. Note the folder you have to work on. That's it. That's your trouble spot on the course. Don't judge students by \"conduct\" or speed of study. Judge on \"tough case\" only. Routine auditing is good unless it's been alter-ised. Routine processes work on good people. The no-case-gain case makes you hunt for magical processes and fatally leads to alter-is. Now hear this: The processes you have, even when only fair, are better than the processes that will be dreamed up by students or anyone around your course. The processes you use, if altered to \"fit\" some tough case will cease to work on stan-dard cases when so altered. The \"tough case\" (who is also the difficult student) is the sole reason one has an urge to alter a process. You must be sure to push routine processes done routinely. When you see a process being altered look for a \"tough case\" in the pc or the student and call HCO promptly if you find the poor TA type case, the \"no change\" response to routine processes. Your approach is to run the standard processes in the right grade in the right sequence. That's all you teach students to do and it's all you do in case supervision. When these \"don't work\" even when you force them to be correctly applied, you have a tough case there. Don't louse up Scientology technology to handle a \"tough case\". You don't have to invent the processes for it. They already exist in the HGC. When you see alter-is, look for the tough case and let HCO take it from there. We are, after all a team, and as a team we can handle our environment.Your job is just teach and get run the processes of the grade in the right sequence. Your job is to teach students to do just that. Your job is to force the stu-dent to run the process that should be run and run it right and to correct any alter-is savagely.

Either the student auditor or the student pc is a \"tough case\". Don't let anybody try to vary a process to fit a case. If you do your indicator is ob-scured in letting anybody fool about in \"trying to make a process work\" or trying to get inven-tive just to crack a \"tough case\". The majority of your course trouble and the tendency to alter-is material comes from trying to force a \"tough case\" to get gains. Should you alter or advise alteration of a process you are letting our side down. It leads you into teaching students to alter-is and there goes the balloon. It means they won't be able to run standard stuff successfully. And that means (let's be brutal) they will miss, by non-standard auditing, on 90% of their cases, the good people. They will slant all Scientology toward one nut and we'll be a failed mess like psychiatry with our clinics full of psychiatric cases not people. The HGC (and perhaps one course level) is taught to handle \"tough cases\". The proc-esses for them are standard, too. You must hold the line and answer a student's \"didn't work\" with \"Exactly what didn't work?\" and \"Exactly what did you do?\" and you'll find they didn't do it, or it's a tough case. Either way follow policy. You must report a tough case to HCO at once. For there sits a justice matter, not an Academy problem. It's not your hat. You see the no-gain-case, the \"withholdy case that ARC breaks easily\", \"the blowy student\", \"unstable gain student\" and your tendency may be to do something original or give the student some different process. If you do you are madly off-policy. In the ordinary Acad-emy Course you are not teaching a \"tough case\" course. You are teaching a nice fast, worka-ble course for decent average cases. Your majority is composed of good students. They de-serve your time. So this makes the \"tough case\" student the odd man (or woman) out. They make a lot of commotion so one may think they are \"everybody\" on a course. They're not. They are sel-dom higher than 10%. So you risk the 90% of your course and all Scientology just to handle 10%.

Leave them to the wolves while one ran off after one? No, please don't go the route by doing that. It's pretty awful. No, this \"tough case\" is for the HGC and HCO. And I'd darn well rather you didn't give the person the technology before he straightens out as he'll hurt people with it. Such \"tough cases\" are possible to salvage. They're just cases. But it takes an HGC to run them and it takes HCO to hold them still so they'll be audited. Remember, we're a team. HCO and HGC are part of the team. Don't steal their hats.

That's firm policy. The \"tough case\" is the only one you send. There are 3 categories of these \"tough cases\". 1. The Roller Coaster Case. The Potential Trouble Source. A suppressive person is on the other side of this one. The case will get a gain and slump, get a gain and slump over and over. It isn't a \"manic-depressive\" as the old 19th Century psycho-analyst thought. It's a guy whose marital partner or family is going into fits over this person's connection with Scientology. This is purely a justice matter and belongs to HCO. He either disconnects or acts to settle his or her situation. No halfway measures. But you can't do much about that in an Academy. If you did you'd leave your class to the wolves. Get on-line and route this mysterious fellow who can't get a gain without losing it the next day or week over to HCO with a \"Please investigate. Possible Potential Trouble Source.\" Don't even bother to question the student. HCO will find out. It's also illegal to audit them so HCO won't even route to the HGC but will act as per policy on such. Always err on the side of sending HCO too many students rather than risk keeping one who is a liability to us all. But never send merely a course \"cut-up\" or a lazy student whose case runs well. This policy is only faintly discipline. It is actually excellent technology to a recurring course problem. 2. The Withholdy Case. The withholdy case is routinely ARC breaking and having to be patched up, com-monly blows, has to have lots of hand-holding. As your course possibly isn't at that level it is too much to handle anyway and you're not equipped to handle. But even if your course is equipped to handle the right action is again HCO. Report this student to HCO with the label \"withholdy case that ARC breaks easily\" or \"Blow type case\". And get HCO over to the Academy. HCO may route to HGC at the student's own expense or get two tough staff mem-bers to stand by while the withholds are explored on a meter in case this is a real justice case or just a student lunch thief. The reason for all that weird behaviour is always a withhold con-dition. You can't be bothered. HCO, however, is interested in the No Report aspect of such a case. This person hasn't told all that's sure. HCO can send to HGC or refund or even Comm Ev. 3. The Suppressive Person. The suppressive person does turn up to get trained. And when you train them (a) their case doesn't change, (b) they cheer when their course pc loses and gloom when their course pc wins and (c) they chatter about the horrors of discipline and seek to lead student squirreling or revolt."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE NO-GAIN-CASE STUDENT 5 HCO PL 5.4.65 II PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 81 HPCS Their dream is a society wherein the criminal may do anything he pleases without any faintest restraint.

One can actually handle them if one knows this seemingly tiny fact. One finds of course the PTP, not the overts. For one has about as much chance pulling this fellow's overts as moving the Earth by pulling weeds. The suppressive acts this person does are solutions to solve some long long ago prob-lem in which the pc is stuck. To an HGC this is finding conditions of environment the pc has had and discovering how he or she handled them. But this is HCO-HGC business.

These persons can be grouped under \"sources of trouble\". They include: (a) Persons intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial ties) of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even when they approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong. They, by experience, produce a great deal of trouble in the long run as their own con-dition does not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism. Their present time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous, and so long as it remains so, they should not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor. (b) Criminals with proven criminal records often continue to commit so many undetected harmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should not be accepted for processing by organizations or auditors. (c) Persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publicly attacked Scientology or been a party to an attack and all their immediate families should never be accepted for processing by a Central Organization or auditor. They have a history of only serving other ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or audi-tor. They have already barred themselves out by their own overts against Scientology and are thereafter too difficult to help, since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"POLICIES ON „SOURCES OF TROUBLE“ 2 HCO PL 7.5.69 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 88 HPCS (d) Responsible-for-condition cases have been traced back to other causes for their condi-tion too often to be acceptable. By responsible-for-condition cases is meant the person who insists a book or some auditor is \"wholly responsible for the terrible condition I am in\". Such cases demand unusual favours, free auditing, tremendous effort on the part of auditors. Re-view of these cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing, that they are losing a planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing, that they are not as bad off as they claim, and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them, even their own families. Establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly. (e) Persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are a liability as they are forced into being processed by some other person and have no personal desire to become bet-ter. Quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrong and so do not get better. Until a personally determined goal to be processed occurs, the person will not benefit. (f) Persons who \"want to be processed to see if Scientology works\" as their only reason for being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate. News re-porters fall into this category. They should not be audited. (g) Persons who claim that \"if you help such and such a case\" (at great and your expense) because somebody is rich and influential or the neighbors would be electrified should be ig-nored. Processing is designed for bettering individuals, not progressing by stunts or giving cases undue importance. Process only at convenience and usual arrangements. Make no ex-traordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons. Not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal of notoriety, not betterment. (h) Persons who \"have an open mind\" but no personal hopes or desires for auditing of knowingness should be ignored, as they really don't have all open mind at all, but a lack of ability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyone's efforts \"to convince them\". (i) Persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better. They have a purpose far being audited entirely contrary to the auditor's and so in this conflict, do not benefit. When such persons are trained they use their training to degrade others. Thus they should not be accepted for training or auditing. (j) Persons attempting to sit in judgment on Scientology in hearings or attempting to in-vestigate Scientology should be given no undue importance. One should not seek to instruct or assist them in any way.

If a person can't see for himself or judge from the obvious, then he does not have sufficient powers of observation even to sort out actual evidence. In legal matters, only take the obvious effective steps – carry on no crusades in court. In the matter of reporters, etc., it is not worth while to give them any time contrary to popular belief. They are given their story before they leave their editorial rooms and you only strengthen what they have to say by saying anything. They are no public communication line that says much. Policy is very definite. Ignore. ____________________ To summarize troublesome persons, the policy in general is to cut communication as the longer it is extended the more trouble they are. I know of no instance where the types of persons listed above were handled by auditing or instruction. I know of many instances where they were handled by just ignoring them until they change their minds or just turning one's back. In applying a policy of cut-communication one must also use judgement as there are exceptions in all things and to fail to handle a person's momentary upset in life or with us can be quite fatal. So these policies refer to non-Scientology persons in the main or persons who appear on the outer fringes and push toward us. When such a person bears any of the above designations we and the many are better off to ignore them. Scientology works. You don't have to prove it to everyone. People don't deserve to have Scientology as a divine right, you know. They have to earn it. This has been true in every philosophy that sought to better man. All the above \"sources of trouble\" are also forbidden training and when a person being trained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings (a) to (j) he or she should be advised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanation should be given them at that time. Thus the few may not, in their own turmoil, impede service to and the advance of the many. And the less enturbulence you put on your lines, the better and the more people you will eventually help. L.

Send any enturbulative student either to review (the Qual examiner) for correction (but only if he says he wants a review) or to the ethics officer for ethics action.

When it is neglected the org will soon experience a technical dropped statistic and lose income and personnel. The most attacked area of an org is its Tech and Qual personnel as these produce the effective results which make Scientology seem deadly to suppressives. The suppressive is terrified of anyone getting better or more powerful as he is drama-tizing some long gone (but to him it is right now) combat or vengeance. He or she confuses the old enemies with anyone about and looks on anyone who tries to help as an insidious vil-lain who will strengthen these \"enemies\". Thus Tech and Qual personnel are peculiarly liable to covert, off line, off policy an-noyances which in time turn them into PTSs. Their cases will Roller Coaster and they begin to go off line, off policy and off origin (see Dev-T Pol Ltrs) themselves. This results in a technical breakdown and an apparency of busyness in these divisions which does not in fact produce anything, being Dev-T. The policy then is: No Tech or Qual personnel may omit giving Ethics Chits to Ethics on any incident or action covered in the Dev-t policy letters or which indicates SP or PTS activity. This means they may not \"be decent about it\" or \"reasonable\" and so refrain. This means they must know their ethics and Dev-T Pol Ltrs. This means they may not themselves act like ethics officers or steal the ethics hat. It means that they must chit students who bring a body and ask for unusual solutions; they must chit all discourteous conduct; they must chit all Roller Coaster cases; they must chit all suppressive actions observed; they must chit snide comments; they must chit alter-is and entheta; they must chit derogatory remarks; they must chit all Dev-T.

This fact routinely stuns Tech and Qual personnel when it is called to their attention – that only two or three are making their lives miserable. Ethics, seeing tech statistics drop, must investigate all this and when Ethics finds the Qual and Tech personnel have not been handing in ethics chits, the ethics officer must report them to the HCO Exec Sec for disciplinary action. NON ENTURBULATION ORDER What to do with the 2 or 3 students or pcs causing trouble? Ethics issues a Non Enturbulation Order. This states that those named in it (the SPs and PTSs who are students or preclears) are forbidden to enturbulate others and if one more report is received of their enturbulating anyone, an SP order will be issued forthwith. This will hold them in line until tech can be gotten in on them and takes them off the back of Tech and Qual personnel. NOT THEORETICAL This is not a theoretical situation or policy. It is issued directly after seeing tech results go down, Tech and Qual cases Roller Coaster and results drop. Ethics found that the entire situation came about through no chits from Tech and Qual personnel about troublesome people which resulted in no restraint and a collapse of Divisions 4 and 5 comm lines and results.

The Course Administrator's purpose is to help the course supervisor keep all bodies correctly arranged placed or routed and to keep all course materials folders records checksheets invoices and despatches handled, filled out and properly filed.  The essence, whether we have an Administrator or not is to:  Have adequate materials, packs, books and checksheets.  Issue what is needed promptly.  Demand what must be filled in promptly.  File precisely.  Keep the course comm lines (In and Out baskets) flowing.  Don't tolerate lack of materials, books, forms or make the students \"make do\" with less than needed.  Safeguard don't lose and keep neatly available all materials records and admin items. ____________________ The Invoice system of a course is an item that has to be kept in. If in an org you don't find it in, you force it in. The Course Supervisor receives a copy of the invoice enrolling the student. This is the student's \"pass\" to enter the course. It means he has paid and financial arrangements are final-ized. Without this you don't let the applicant on the course. This saves several things and prevents heavy upsets.

Also, you will find that those who don't contribute don't value the course and you get enturbulation. The Course Supervisor works hard, he suddenly finds he can't have materials or facili-ties or promotion because it isn't \"economical\". If he has his invoices he knows how much is being made and can demand some portion of it to keep his course going or to get help for it. The Course Supervisor can and should reject an N/C (No charge) Invoice or a \"cour-tesy\" invoice. If he gets an award invoice he must insist that the awarding org pay for it even to him-self. The \"withhold from salary\" invoices are often not deducted in fact and by keeping track of these, the Course Supervisor can demand evidence these sums have been paid in. Training makes the most profitable income of the org as it requires the least expendi-ture. An org can almost go broke doing only auditing. It's training that makes income for use. Auditing absorbs the income in overhead. Yet training gets the least facilities and supplies and help while being the most important income producer. Money made in training students must also cover supplies, study packs, books, suffi-cient help, quarters, uniforms for Course personnel, etc. Course income should result in heavy expenditure on course promotion. This is the way Dianetics and Scientology will spread-through training. A tightly scheduled, smartly run course is always full. It goes empty the moment it goes slack. This is a startling fact. People detest (by years of experience in orgs) a sloppy, permissive, badly disciplined Course run with inadequate materials and supplies. You can say with certainty loud and clear that an empty course has been badly sched-uled, the Supervisor not on deck on time, materials lacking. The moment these points get IN, the course fills up. Excellent, neat admin is all part of a well run course. Things filed, marked up, issued smoothly and promptly. Students routed quickly, gotten in action. NOTHING BACKLOGGED That is the motto of a good course. Handle everything that comes up NOW and com-pletely. Any backlog is death to smooth administration. Be precise and definite, don't fumble around. Absent students, late students, enturbulative students, you turn the matter over to Eth-ics at once.

The purpose of the board is to clearly indicate to supervisor and students the progress each student is making through the course, whether he or she is making expected progress and any students which may need to be sent to Qual for correction such as Remedy B. The board has a column for each major cycle of action of the course. For the HSDC this would be one for each time through theory and practical, one for the pre-auditing exam, one for Auditing and one for final exam. See sample Student Progress Board below. Each student's name is written on a small card, stuck in the Board with a thumb tack, and moved along to the next column as the student progresses through the course. If the student does not keep pace with expected completion's, such as he falls a week behind, a red slash mark is put on his card. If he falls two weeks behind schedule a second slash mark is placed on his card. The Course Administrator keeps the Student Progress Board and is responsible for its existence and condition. The Board must be posted conspicuously for all to see. The board must be kept up to date at all times. When a new student joins the course the Course Administrator immediately writes the student's name on small card and pins it up in the first column. The Administrator moves the students' cards along as they progress through the course and puts slashes on the card as war-ranted. The Administrator informs the Course Supervisor if the board is indicating a student is not making expected progress, but the Supervisor himself must also frequently check the board and take any appropriate actions. Students undergoing retraining are on the board with their names on a different col-oured card, such as green for second time through the course, blue for third time, red for fourth time, etc. ADMIN BASKETS As a double check on student progress, a stack of eight baskets is used.

A supervisor must never lose sight of the purpose of auditing. Auditing is for the pre-clear, is intended to improve the preclear's case Auditing is not just a matter of good form. The reason some students do not accomplish auditing is that they become so oriented on form alone that they forget the purpose of the form. Good auditing form and correct sessioning obtains many times the result of bad form and incorrect sessioning. But total form and no effort to do something for the pc results in no auditing. The result comes before the form in importance. Because students may use this idea to excuse lack of form, Q and A-ing, and to squirrel with their processes, the stable datum be-comes unpopular with supervisors. A student should first be held responsible for the state of the pc during and after ses-sions and made to know that as an auditor he is there to get a fast, good result The student should then be taught that he can get a better, faster result with better form. After that the stu-dent should be taught that Scientology results are only obtained by correct and exact duplica-tion of Scientology processes, not by off beat variations. The student wants to know how to do this or that. Refer him to his materials on how to do the most fundamental actions, but make him or her do it. And keep up a running refrain that you want results, results, results, on his pc. The student will be all thumbs and faint. The supervisor may be horrified by the goofs. But don't bother with the goofs. Just demand results on the pc, results on the pc, results on the pc.

But the gradient approach to auditing can be overdone to a point where the student completely loses sight of why he is auditing. 1. First and foremost the auditor accomplishes something for the pc and without that there is neither sense nor purpose to auditing; 2. Excellent form accomplishes more for the pc faster; and 3. Exact duplication of processes alone returns standard high level results on all pcs. The student thrown in over his head learns: A. Results in the PC depend on the auditor and auditing and that results are expected from auditing; B. That results can be obtained in auditing and the better the form and duplication, the better the results and C. That the student has more to learn about auditing and that the student doesn't yet know. Therefore the supervisor must teach the student: (a) That he or she is supposed to get results in auditing; (b) That Scientology can obtain results; and (c) That better form and duplication obtain better faster results. ___________________ I dare say many students learn things just because they are told to and find no relation-ship between form, duplication and the preclear. Let them fall on their heads and yet obtain results and this attitude will change-and you'll save us a lot of off beat nonsense and case fail-ures in orgs and the field. L.

It has been found that any time a supervisor broke one of the rules, to any degree, the course and training activities failed to function properly. Teaching Scientology is a very precise job, and a supervisor must maintain the preci-sion at all times to render the services he should to the students entrusted to his care. A supervisor cannot hope to gain the respect or willingness of the student to be taught by him sitting there, spouting words and being an \"authority\" on the subject. He must know his subject and follow the supervisor's code to the letter. It isn't a hard code to follow, and it is a very practical one. If you feel you cannot honestly follow all of it, you should receive more training, and, maybe, more processing until you can make the code your own before attempt-ing to train students in Scientology. We have had the rules of the game of Scientology a long time, and now we have the rules of the game called training. Have fun! 1. The supervisor must never neglect an opportunity to direct a student to the actual source of Scientology data. 2. The supervisor should invalidate a student's mistake ruthlessly and use good ARC while doing it. 3. The supervisor should remain in good ARC with his students at all times while they are performing training activities. 4. The supervisor at all times must have a high tolerance of stupidity in his students, and must be willing to repeat any datum not understood as many times as necessary for the student to understand and acquire reality on the datum. 5.

The supervisor should be able to answer any questions concerning Scientology by di-recting the student to the actual source of the data. If a supervisor cannot answer a par-ticular question, he should always say so, and the supervisor should always find the answer to the question from the source, and tell the student where the answer is to be found. 9.

The supervisor should at all times be perfectly willing and able to do anything he tells his students to do. 13. The supervisor must not become emotionally involved with students of either sex while they are under his or her training 14. When a supervisor makes any mistake, he is to inform the student that he has made one, and rectify it immediately.

Communication lines depend upon reality and communication and affinity and where an individual is too demanding the affinity tends to break down slightly. Processing goes in two stages. 1. To get into communication with that which you are trying to process. 2. Do something for him. There is many a pc who will go around raving about his auditor, whose auditor has not done anything for the pc. All that has happened is that a tremendous communication line has been established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that he then consid-ers that something miraculous has occurred. Something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has to-tally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place. He formed it in the first place to do something for the pc. He very often mistakes the fact that he has formed a communication line, and the reac-tion on the pc for his having formed one, with having done something for the pc. There are two stages. 1. Form a communication line. 2. Do something for the pc. Those are the two distinct stages. It is something like (1) Walking up to the bus, and (2) Driving off. If you don't drive off you never go anyplace."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE TWO PARTS OF AUDITING 2 BAS-02 – HCOB 23.5.71R II PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 120 HPCS It is a very tricky and no small thing to be able to communicate to a human being who has never been communicated to before. This is quite remarkable, and is such a remarkable feat that it appears to be an end-all of Scientology to some. But you see that's just walking up to the bus. Now you have got to go someplace. Any upset that the individual has is so poised, it is so delicately balanced, that it is dif-ficult to maintain. It is not difficult to get well. It is very hard to remain batty. A fellow has to work at it. If your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing disci-pline is perfect so you don't upset this communication line and if you just made a foray of no more importance than saying something like \"What are you doing that's sensible and why is it sensible?\" and kept your communication line up all the while and kept your affinity up with the pc all the while, did it with perfect discipline, you would see more aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist. Now that's what I mean when I say do something for the pc. You must audit well, get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in. Don't ARC Break the pc, let your cycles of action complete. All of that is simply an entrance. You see, the discipline of Scientology makes it pos-sible to do this, and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and could never get near anybody was because they couldn't communicate to anybody. So that discipline is important. That is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you can't get to the door you can't do anything. The perfect discipline of which we speak, the perfect communication cycle, the perfect auditor presence, perfect meter reading – all of these things are just to get you in a state where you can do something for somebody. So when you're real slow picking up the discipline, real slow picking up keeping in the communication cycle, when you're pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles from the ball. You're not even attending yet. What you want to be able to do is audit perfectly. By that we mean keep in a commu-nication cycle, be able to approach the pc, be able to talk to the pc, and be able to maintain the ARC. Get the pc to give you answers to your questions. Be able to read a meter and get the reactions. All of those things have to be awfully good because it's very difficult to get a commu-nication line in to somebody anyway. They all have to be present and they all have to be per-fect. If they are all present and they are all perfect, then we can start to process somebody. then we can start to process somebody.

It takes a process now. We used to have it all backwards. We used to try and teach people what they could do for somebody. But they could never get in communication with him to do it, so therefore you had failures in processing. The most elementary procedure would be – ''What do you think is sensible?'' – or anything of that sort. The pc says, \"Well, I think horses sleep in beds. That's sensible.'' The auditor says, ''Alright. Now why is that sensible?'' The pc says, \"Well ... ah .... Hey! ... That's not sensible. That's nuts!\" You actually wouldn't have to do anything more than that. He's cognited. You've flattened it. It's so easy to do, but you keep looking for some magic. Well, your magic is in getting into communication with the person. The rest is very easy to do, all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you are do-ing this, and realize that these huge aberrations he's got are poised with the most fantastic-ally delicate balance on little pinheads. All you have to do is to phooph and these things crash. Now if you're not in communication with this person he doesn't cognite. He takes it as an accusative action. He tries to justify thinking that way. He tries to make himself look good to you and tries to put on a public front of some kind or another. He tries to hold up his status. Anytime I see a bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something else be-cause sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else, and they never have to be run on the crazy one, I right away know their auditors are not in communication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himself and trying to uphold his own status. So he must be defending himself against the auditor. The auditor couldn't possibly be in communication with him. So we are right back to the fundamental of why didn't the auditor get into comm with the pc in the first place. You get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing proper Scientology discipline. That is not any trick. It goes off 1, 2, 3, 4. You sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and his problems and that sort of thing and you do it by completing your communication cycles and not cut-ting his communication – the very things you are taught in the TRs, and you find you are in communication with the person. Now you've got to do something for the person. Unless, having gotten into communication, you do something for the person, you lose your communication line because the R-Factor of why you're in communication with the pc breaks down. He doesn't think you're so good, and you go out of communication with him. That having happened, the person will be in a sort of status defensive and wonder why he is being processed. On the other hand, if you have done something for the pc and he has had his cogni-tion, and you try and go on and get more TA action out of the fact that \"all horses sleep in beds\" – you don't get there as you've already flattened the process. You can over-audit and you can under-audit."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE TWO PARTS OF AUDITING 4 BAS-02 – HCOB 23.5.71R II PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 122 HPCS If you don't notice that one answer come your way, that indicates you have done something for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing, your TA action will dis-appear, your pc will get resentful and you'll lose your communication line. He's already had the cognition you see. You are now restimulating the pc. You have gotten your key-out destimulation factor – it has occurred right before your eyes. You have done something for the pc. One more mention of the subject and you've had it. There are a lot of things you could do with the pc, without doing anything for him. You can turn on some very very handsome somatics on a pc at one time or another without turning them off either. You've got to do something for the pc, not to him. Now you can be doing something (A), and the pc is doing (B), and you go on doing (A), while the pc is doing (B) then somewhere on down the line you wind up in a hell of a mess and you wonder what happened. Well the pc never did what you said so you didn't do anything for the pc. There was in actual fact no barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been a tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on. That you could ask (A), while the pc answered (B), in itself showed the auditor obser-vation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasn't in communication with the pc. So again the communication factor was out and once more we weren't doing anything for the pc. It requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line. He has got to stay in communication with his pc. Those cycles have got to be perfect. He can't be distract-ing the pc's attention onto the TA, e.g. \"I'm not getting any TA action now.\" That's not staying in communication with the pc – has nothing to do with it. You're distracting the pc from his own zones and areas. Don't put the pc's attention out of session. Keep him going and keep that communica-tion line in.

We lost a key basic process! Two Way Comm is missing in today's line-up in Academies, on courses and in HGCs. It goes this way – to get volume auditing going, you need auditors. To make auditors you need fast training. The reason fast training isn't occurring is because two way comm seems to be out between course supervisors and students. Course supervisors in most instances are not asking students if anything is wrong or how to help them and then letting the students talk. While the supervisor listens. I am putting together new practical for course supervisors. But meanwhile it's very elementary. 1. Detect a student's concern. 2. Get the student to talk about his problems and troubles in study. 3. Listen. 4. Do what one can to help without evaluating. 5. Let the student get back to it. Students who drift off of courses or who are very slow lack somebody to talk to! Where a student's progress is slow or he or she appears to be troubled or struggling, a good supervisor notices it early. He gets the student to talk about it. He listens and acknowl-edges. He does what he can to help without evaluating and lets the student get back to study-ing.

QUAL In Qual there should also be a consultant service which uses a meter and two way comm to find out about cases before patch-up or review. The Qual Consultant should also handle students who are slow or dropped out. This letting the pc tell his side of it is very valuable. One can handle them much better. Analyzing what they say and how they say it helps the case supervisor also. I.e., Natter = ARC Breaks and overts. The pc's comm has been chopped.

It will speed training and add up eventually to volume auditing by making trained auditors available. This is the way to unlock that flow. In the HGC pcs can be two way commed by the Tech Sec.

Bill Foster 14 June 71) Two way comm where it has been described has been described for the use of an audi-tor, not a supervisor of a course. Supervisors not knowing this then run around itsa-ing students. They let the students itsa and they think they are going to get some place. It's the most incredible scene that you ever heard of and the boom could go bust only on this one point. I've got it narrowed down to this. Apparently no matter how many times the study tapes have been played, nobody has ever heard of them. I watched a recent course run to find out how deep they would let the students strug-gle – how long it would stay bogged – and it would have stayed bogged from here on out! And do you know what's out? It's the study data tapes just that – and that's all that's out on a course. So when they say \"two way comm the students\" you'll find the supervisors instantly start to itsa them and are using auditor two way comm on these courses. It doesn't belong on these courses. I'll give you now the total dialogue of a supervisor: The supervisor shows interest. There can be a little bit of chatter, like – \"I see you've just completed. Great!\" – something like that, or he shows interest – \"How are you doing?\" Student replies – \"Ah well, I'm doing all right.\""},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR 2WC AND THE 2 HCOB 26.06.71R MISUNDERSTOOD WORD PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 126 HPCS Supervisor – \"Now are there any words there in that, that you have misunderstood?\" Student – \"No ... no ....\" Supervisor – \"Well what is the word that you didn't quite understand?\" Student – \"Ah well . . . ah . . . this one.\" Supervisor – \"Good. Now look that word up.... Now what's the word in the paragraph above that, where's that? . . . Alright let's look that up. Now use it in a sentence a couple of times and I'll be back in a minute.\" He comes back, the student gives him the sentences for it and straightens it out and he sees the student's got it. That's the two way comm of a supervisor. If a Supervisor does any other thing you've got a wrecked course. I've got the proof of it. The way you teach a TR course is you give the student the bulletin and you have him read it. You don't check the guy out on the bulletin, he just reads it. When you come back you say, \"Alright, have you read it?\" \"Yeah. I've read it.\" \"What word don't you understand on it?\" You will find things like HCOB and TR, and you get those cleared up, etc. I am having some roaring success stories from FEBC students who are through this. One had gone through the bulletin 10 times and had found words he didn't know all 10 times, and he was all of a sudden finding new things on the bulletin that he'd never heard of before. Another student had gone through it 20 times with the same result and they were doing fine and getting down to TRs and passing them. On a TR course you give them the bulletin and let them read it and you find what word they didn't understand. That's the routine. Now that sounds so impossible – and it's been on the study tapes for so long – that you wouldn't believe that this thing is the key. Do you know there were students there for 15 or 20 days until we started doing this, then all of a sudden there was a breakthrough and their enthusiasm started coming up. They had been just going lose, lose, lose, out the bottom because supervisors were let-ting them itsa. Maybe supervisors thought they were auditors. They aren't. Neither are they supposed to give advice or tell students how – or ask them if they blinked or anything else."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR 2WC AND THE 3 HCOB 26.06.71R MISUNDERSTOOD WORD PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 127 HPCS The other thing they were doing was only emphasizing all the \"can'ts\". The students just went into despair. This was because the supervisors were inviting all kinds of itsa and criticizing and so forth. You may say, \"Gee! Everybody knows it's a misunderstood word.\" Yeh – but they don't use it. Now I'll give you another one. I set up a test so that each student was brought up to the D of T who had a meter on his desk and he'd ask them if they had anything they misunderstood – and see if they got a read on the meter. If it didn't clear up at once he'd send them back to get the definitions and look the thing up and of course use the word in a couple of sentences and then if it didn't clear up he'd send them to the word clearer and really let them get worked over because it goes way back. They even found a student who had a misunderstood word clear back into his last life. There wasn't any other two way comm and no other interest and they just about blew the roof off with student stat points. This is the action of a supervisor and that's ALL the action a supervisor does – and he can do that. The course has plenty of dictionaries and so on. But, the main point is, it is the misunderstood word. This has been proven again. On a TR practical course it's the misunderstood word and the misunderstood action. On other courses it's just misunderstood words and misunderstood words and misun-derstood words, one right after the other. As fast as they clear this up – up the student's production goes. It's painfully slow on some of them at first and I suppose the supervisors have so many misunderstood words of their own that they just won't key into doing this action and that's what's wrecking courses. It's elementary, and it's the wildest discovery of all time but they don't use it. If it is used, your courses start running fast, your students start learning quickly and all starts going well. Other course outnesses like supervisors not giving anybody a pack or no one to give checkouts are all administrative outnesses. As far as actual supervision is concerned it's this other line of handling misunderstood words. The second that line is in there are wins all over the place. The second that line is out there is no delivery."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR 2WC AND THE 4 HCOB 26.06.71R MISUNDERSTOOD WORD PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 128 HPCS If auditors are goofing, then in their training they have not been made to look up the misunderstood word and a lot of itsa has gone on and people have evaluated for them.

We are shooting for a target, using just this misunderstood word tech, of a reduction of time by about a third on all major courses. Just using this misunderstood word tech. That's all. If some student is a totally slow student, you can get him back to the first bulletin or book he ever read and make him get every word in it he didn't understand, and it will go up in a chain.

That's that Horner Group, with repointing and so forth. You get quite a bit of that. But here we're a bunch of things which foresaw, and was using background material of... Ethics as-pects. Now, what has happened at Saint Hill wasn't in here, because I never dreamed of it. But it will go in here, on a rewrite of this. By a system of saying \"It's all old, and we don't use that any more\", they knocked out the whole of the Saint Hill course. Then we started to make, quote, \"Eights\" who had never been Sixes. So, actually, I was given too much in this direction about wins and that sort of thing, and so on, and I hadn't actually caught up with the degree that this had gone out for about a year and a half or so. I was trying to find out who knocked out the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Because they were obviously missing.   4 Note of Editor: Title of the PL: OFFENSES & PENALTIES"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 2 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 130 HPCS Well, I kept investigating this. We eventually found it out. It was Horner Group, with repointing who took it off the course. But what I didn't investigate, and didn't find out, until the Spring of '70, was that they had thrown the whole subject away. Now one couldn't have possibly imagined anything this broad. And when I say something will be changed about this, it'll just be in that direction – just adding what we've experienced since. Which is quite remarkable. So actually, Saint Hill at this moment is guilty of not teaching a full – and maybe it's been remedied – not teaching a full course. See? London isn't even running an academy, or wasn't. And the errors which are going on now are in the errors of instruction. Now you haven't too much been studying instruction, but if you've got your HGG two-way comm on the use of students, pushing them on through, the second we started we re-moved all punishment on students, and the second we started using two-way comm on every student that bogged, then in one or two or three very difficult students, the learning drills of the late '50s, which Brian Livingston has down there – that's on very difficult students, that's not an ordinary action – why, he's brought some through that way – we've had a high atten-dance. We've had high attendance, and high points, here on the ship. And we learned that you cannot force people into study, you cannot discipline them during study, and you have to han-dle the whole thing with two-way comm, and that way you don't lose students. The main problem which you have right now is blown students. And the main omis-sions are, I can assure you from long experience, just these: inadequate or no materials, no supervisor, courses not starting on time, supervisor double- or triple-hatted, no administrator for a large course, no attention paid to the student, and two-way comm not used to straighten out his difficulties, and harsh ethics or duress being applied rather than do one's job. And I think you will find that that is a fairly complete list. Now, you notice each one of those are gross. On Saint Hill there was this additional one: they threw the whole subject away. The whole subject. Now I earlier caught up with this, that they weren't using Dianetics to cure guys that had bruises and illnesses and so forth... they just weren't using Dianetics, that was all. And I caught up with that, and in 1969 I got some old Dianetic auditors who were bored and we worked out a highly standard Dianetics course, and we got this whizzing, and then of course in 1970 in looking for the causes of downstats I tripped over this one where the subject itself, Scientology, had more or less disappeared. So we're getting that back in. Now, you're going back at a time when Full Grades are back in. And you're going to run into all kinds of randomity, and all kinds of legal questions, legal Eagle, you know, like what is and what is, and shouldn't you run this before you run that, and doesn't it go this way instead of that way, and is it true that this belongs to that level or this level, and all of that. Because that has not been well covered. We had to throw this together in a hurry. As a matter of fact, a Qual auditor on the ship went down and culled the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course for processes in an awful hurry, in order to put together the processes of the level. And we did a 40-page HCOB of processes of the level which was genned up, and some of them turned into triples and so forth – but there are more processes for the level. We"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 3 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 131 HPCS had not exhausted all the processes of the level, but where we've got them, they're pretty well placed. Now, we're so bad – well, it was very corny, actually – we had a guy here, of all places – what shame – who had a constant hidden standard, and he was so ignorant of the subject that he used to say \"I don't have a hidden standard. They say I've got a hidden standard. I just don't – won't – believe that Scientology works until it handles this somatic.\" (laughs.) There were two or three of them around like this, and they give you the exact defini-tion, don't you see? Well now, this guy had been put through almost everything and anything you could shake a stick at, see? He'd been put through the lot, and it just hadn't occurred to anybody just to use the technology that applies to hidden standards. And we brought him through the woods. Actually, he hasn't totally found out about it yet, but we brought him through the woods. He hasn't had that somatic any more, anyhow. So this has landed us in the interesting position of practically anybody who has en-tered Scientology since '67 – '66 or '67, mostly '67 on up – have never had their lower grades. So of course they're walking around with hidden standards, with chronic problems, with this, with that, with the other thing, and they haven't been made into the people that Scientology can make them into. So discarding of the subject also then discarded a high quality of staff member that we used to have. So you have the difficulty now, of working with the staff member, in a majority, who has never had his lower grades, who doesn't know Scientology exists really, and if any-body goes above Grade One, without having Grade One put in, you have exactly the same number of suppressives that you have on the street. Because it's Grade One that unmakes a suppressive. The problem. Of course. The guy's being audited with a problem, he gets no change. If he gets no change, that's the definition of a suppressive. You see what I mean. Well, so all you would have to do to remedy the Ethics situation is under Cases and Morale. The Cases and Morale PL, which was issued in late July, and that will hold the fort, to some degree, in orgs, and if that same thing is applied to the public, it will also hold the fort. If you just make it a rule that people don't walk out of the org unless they're F/N VGIs at the Exam-iner, why, you'll straighten the public out too. And meanwhile, get in the lower grades. And it's always one of these hellish things where you're catching up several years of work. Now they've hurt the reputation of Scientology in the field, and messed us up, and it hasn't done the Guardian's Office any good to have this much bum Scientology around – undone, I might say – and therefore some policy with regard to this is needful. Now, I can get a Policy Letter to back that up, but your concern in the Guardian's Of-fice is of course external. Now if this has gone one internally in orgs, why, the pcs that are in orgs, that is to say on staff, their reality isn't all that good. You've got people trained up to Eight who have never been Sixes, and it's one of these jolly old balled-up technical messes. Now, it is... look at the Ideal Scene: the Ideal Scene would be all these cats knew what they were doing. Well, in view of the fact they don't, you have to make a bit of make-do. Therefore you have to make retread rather inexpensive – retread of the SH course, don't you see, retread of Academy courses on the new checksheet – popularise that."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 4 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 132 HPCS But these are internal actions. Now your problem is actually: how are you going to now handle the public effect of all of this neglect? And the best way to do that is to check the downward spiral of lost tech and get it done internally just as a usual action. But the Guard-ian's Office is mainly interested in external. So a person, when he walks out – really just be-fore he walks in – and just as he walks out the door of the org, would of course be Guardian tech property. Now that means that your concentration will be on ARC break registry programmes, and seeing that an adequacy of promotion is done to continue to inform people that they should come in and get their full expanded lower grades. You'll probably be at that for the next year or two. It's one of these long, continuing programmes. Now, if that type of pro-gramming is done, and that promotion is kept in – I know it sounds like a Division 6 action. It isn't, see – why, you'll cut down the field enturbulances and difficulties. Do you see? That will be cut down so they don't accumulate further than they have gone. And then your ARC break registry is of course the hot one. You know that that's de-tected from accounts and detected from refunds and detected from various other sectors. And if you, and all Guardian's Office technical staff, rode down on that very hard, why, you would find yourself in very... you'd fine yourself winning. Now a blown student, as found by Craig Beeny out in the US, a blown student, that is a serious thing. What the hell do you mean, a blown student? It's almost impossible to blow a student. You'd have to never run the course, or never give him his materials, or come down on him with heavy this and that, never appear for this and that, have him go or schedule him un-really. Now, we might have blown a lot of students, just guessing, by making them come five nights a week instead of two nights a week and so on. Or in that sort of case, why, you'd han-dle them on an individual basis. But they had the whole grade slowed down on a two night a week Dianetics course. What the hell were they doing? Now, that could have hurt them, but I haven't heard that it did. We don't know the answer to this. Now this once more, because it has such a heavy effect upon the public. Now you get how this emphasis is. Because it has such a heavy emphasis on the public, it becomes an interest zone to the Guardian's Office. Now whereas you might find this was the case, and you might even find why, and you should yelp to straighten it out in the orgs for sure, but that actually goes on a different net-work. That actually swings back to a management network, stationship, Sea Org, and that sort of thing to straighten it out in the org. As long as we're advised... as long as we're advised as to what goes on, you see, you have your own authority, you could go in and tell them to do this and that and the other thing, it's perfectly all right, there's nothing wrong with that, but your main concern are those blown students. Now, because that will just go on and on and on, with more and more and more blown students, unless it were handled, you have interest in why students are blowing because you can't, in fact, return them to a course that is still sour. But your concern would be with the blown student. Now, the org will always ride with the new student, and try to patch it up. See? Patch up the course now. So they don't blow further students. The truth of the matter is they're not going to pay much attention to the students who have blown. Do you follow?"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 5 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 133 HPCS Now, there's where you can catch it up. And then catch that up, and you'll also catch up somebody who is upset, and so on... well there are ways and means that this can be han-dled. It is such a heavy, large problem at this particular moment that I can't give you any fast remedy how a few Guardian's Office personnel can remedy several thousand, maybe tens of thousands, of blown students and preclears and that sort of thing, but you have to make some service available ordinarily, and it's really the org's problem, so what you should do is force in the lines very very heavily in terms of the old ARC break registrar caper, see? Make them do the work. You spot them, you make the org do the work, see? Now, for instance, I spotted William Burroughs, and I got somebody to go see him, and he was already straightened out to some degree, cooled off, but they pulled his ARC break, and that was fine, but I don't think they ever finished up the job. I don't think they even finished up the job slightly. Because Burroughs was being audited in a period when Scientol-ogy tech wasn't even being used. So the thoroughness with which a celebrity is cleaned up would be of interest to you, so that all of these ARC break registry actions should be done by an org to clean up its area, and every blasted one of those sessions or notes concerning an action, even getting a student back, should, by routing, come straight into the hands of Guard-ian tech. In other words, you've got several technical pieces of paper which ought to come into your hands. Which is lists of blown people, lists of ARC breaks in areas, lists of celebrities policed up to make sure they're still in good shape, and all of the sessions run to patch them up, including a two-way comm session with a blown student. Those pieces of paper ought to come back through your hands. Now, with those pieces of paper, with those pieces of paper now, you have an oppor-tunity to catch a lot more crime, because in the two-way comm what happens will be in the text. And a lot of policing that we do here on Flag and so on comes through in this fashion. We maybe don't get the folder where we find a case that is bunged up and fallen on his head. And then we use two-way comm sessions to find out where, when and so on, and before we get through, we have the story. This is what's known as detection through worksheets. Now, there's a word of warning on this. Just because a pc said so in session, does not necessarily make it a fact. And the more guys you jump on when you have only session evi-dence, the sorrier you will be. See? So you're not in the business of slaughtering auditors par-ticularly, but you are in the business of putting them right. So I would invent another piece of admin here, and this piece of admin would be a did you. Now you can write up a mild, and I emphasise mild, interrogatory, and where you only have slender evidence with regard to something, which is two-way comm, a two-way comm session, and he says \"Jojo the dog-faced boy knocked him over the head with a club...\" and so forth, and did this, that and the other thing – without exposing your source to danger... That is another point: these pcs are sources, although I will sometimes give a PC, because it isn't all that desperate, you want an interrogatory which says \"Could you please give us the background data and the facts concerning certain sessions that you were running at such-and-such a date and time, and in these sessions did so-and-so occur?\" And leave a blank there to write in, the so-and-so that did occur, and let him have the benefit of his side of the story."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 6 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 134 HPCS For instance, we had one pc here, who was actually one of our top auditors who was being slammed around by this pc, who said the pc was doing wild things and so forth, and the truth of it is not so. I noticed that all that happened there is I think his frequency of... I think that auditor wouldn't audit him any more, I think that's all that happened in that. You don't punish the pc, of course, for telling you a fancy tale. But where you cannot get the folder, and you only use two-way comm, I again advise you to be very very cautious, and not accusative. Now when you have the folder of the pc, and a Folder Error Summary can be made of the thing, and these things are very time-consuming, and I developed the habit of drama-ing on to interns – I'd put it in the line-up that an intern is assigned for a short period of time to the Guardian's Office under training and get him to do Folder Error Summaries. And where you've got a folder, and you get an error summary in this folder, why, you'll very often find a lot of balderdash. And where it has resulted in a public upset of any kind whatsoever, you are particularly interested in it. And then you want to call names. And at that, the best you do on such a thing is you require the fellow to get a retread in the near fu-ture, and which arrangements can be made in order to do this. And he says yah yah yah, I don't need any retread, you've been very nice about the whole thing, and so forth, I want to call to your attention that under Crimes, on HCO Policy Letter 7 March, and so on, you can suspend certificates. And it's only under a High Crime that certificates can be cancelled. But this, of course, requires something that is very unpopular, which is a Comm-Ev. And you could even put out an interrogatory which, after the person has said yow yow yow, your next piece of administration on the thing would be \"Would it be convenient for you to attend a Comm-Ev regarding your certificates, such-and-such and so-and-so?\" But that's only after somebody's given you a hard time. I would normally try to persuade the man to get a retread, and the more auditors you can persuade to come in for a retread that have been trained in the last three years, the better off we're going to be. Of course, you know you can hold a Comm-Ev if a guy out there refuses to attend. Now that means that the whole roster of Saint Hill graduates from about 1965 on, or course attendees or course enrolments, and all other enrolments in academies which have been teaching subnormal courses, are naturally potential Guardian's Office territory. And one of your administrative actions should be to collect those enrolments. You'll probably find out they're difficult to get, but very often they can be culled out of invoices if they have not kept their roll books up to date. And then you want to get a broad mailing out, and not to give the org a black eye or something like that, you get a broad mailing out on such a thing that retreading on expanded lower grades is the stuff, and you send them a blank of intention. And they say they intend to get a retread, and a retrain, and this particularly applies to Academy in Saint Hill students, and they intend to get a retread or a retrain on this so they'll be qualified for expanded lower grades. And you can just invent this offhand, you see, that somebody has to be qualified to run expanded lower grades. You don't have to say that he does have to be, but you can infer it. And... because they aren't qualified to run expanded lower grades, don't you see?"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 7 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 135 HPCS So the net gain of all of this is that you would then have those full rosters and you would clean up the field, and there's an awful lot of cats out in the field right now who not having been taught how to audit, can't audit, and aren't auditing. And now after they haven't sent you in an intention, you see, if you've got a card file of this sort of thing, why, you can mark it down that this guy has given an intention depending on \"All right, let's mark it up\" – why, you've got some guys left who aren't intending to do anything, and you've got some guys who didn't answer you at all, and then you want to put some pressure on that particular line, of whatever kind of pressure you find it expedient to take at that time. In this way, you will have an opportunity to clean up all of this background of this mob of auditors, particularly in the last three years, and probably growingly in the last five, who can't audit, at Six, and you can clean that up. Some such programmes, programmes of this particular type, will bring you out in the open. And if you're carrying out programmes of that administrative nature, rather than programmes of particularity, Maisie-Ann Blutz's folder... actually, you know, I sit here and look at some of these folders that have come in in recent times and so on, and my hair stands on end. The last one that came across my desk, it's just the last one that came across my desk, the guy had a GF 40 assessed which was totally live – you just don't leave it with it reading all over the place – and he came and reported to the Examiner immediately afterwards that he had a headache! So the C/S was written to give him his Power. Now this happened a very short time ago. So somebody really, really was flubbing it even though he's had Eight training and everything else... he's really goofing it. Now the AOs, the AOs have a programme, or should have a programme of retreading Eights, but you see, an Eight who was never a Six is going to fall on his head anyhow. And that's what's the matter with these Eights. I finally traced this down, and it was of interest to trace it down. What the hell was going on here? Well, I remedied it to the degree that I forced Eights finally to get their Dianetics course so they could audit Dianetics, and you know, there's been a hell of a technical break-through: we have found out that a guy who can't audit Dianetics can't audit Scientology. But the complexities of Scientology mask the fact that he can't audit. Now, if we can get a guy to audit Dianetics, we can then teach him to audit Scientology. So we try to make it a prerequi-site. But we're not going to make it a prerequisite for a while. We're not going to tough it up all that way. We'll make it a prerequisite to the Saint Hill Course, we'll make it a prerequisite to Eight courses, but we won't make it a prerequisite to Academy courses, that he have a Dianet-ics course first. Because if they teach a lousy Dianetics course, don't you see, then he'll never get any training, and they actually will eventually go and study how to be a Dianetics auditor if you've made him into some kind of a Scientology auditor. So it's actually a better academy level to enroll in. And of course the stress right now is on enrolling auditors. So if you work on programmes, whatever they are, or whatever you evolve, which handle the blown student, and then make sure that the same faults won't go and blow them again, and some are persuaded to retread, or finish their course, and if you handle the... you have programmes which locate and straighten out the PCs where they need it, without making"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"A SHORT BRIEFING OF GUARDIAN’S OFFICE 8 2.08.70 TECHNICAL PERSONNEL PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 136 HPCS a huge hue and cry about the fact that their auditing's no good, you know that that's not true either, and then if you ensure that all of the auditors who have been trained during this slack period are retreaded, why, you've got the programmes, from my point of view that the Guard-ian's Office should be working on at this particular time. And if your administrative lines, as I gave them to you before, are in, and you've got the data with which to work, why, you're all set. I would try to prevent people from setting you up as a Czar in a technical line, \"Well, should we...?\" and so forth, I've given them \"Oh my God...\" (laughs...) \"Really, should we, should we actually finish our Dianetics before we go on with this, and what is your opinion of this particular preclear?\", or something and something and some-thing, your think should go immediately into the quality of training that this person has had, just as a public protection. The Guardian's Office is basically a public area action, and there isn't anyone now taking care of that sphere of technology. Now you will probably get technical applications of Scientology in other lines of country. They will probably also wander in to you. God knows there's enough of them. But I would tend to farm those out to FSMs. If you've got, for instance, \"How are we going to han-dle retarded children in England?\", that will of course roll straight into your lap in the field of tech, right? Well, you're putting your best foot forward if you give them this kind of an answer: \"We will appoint a committee of Scientologists who, in company with a doctor or two, will survey this field.\" And use your FM public technique which is so effective in Guardian lines. Let them go ahead and do something about it. Give them some regularization in the Guard-ian's Office. Pay some attention to what they've worked out. That's how you should handle it. You shouldn't be passing out an \"Ah Yes\", or \"No\" or upside down or otherwise – it's the committee, and these guys will probably turn up with some good stuff. Now maybe there are some other zones and areas which you will not... which I haven't covered, and I imagine that... I can only think of one of them, and that is the safeguard of the technology which is done on Guardian's personnel. And I would make it a High Crime or something like that to misaudit Guardian personnel. When I hear one of those squirreled up one way or the other, and so on, I would make it my business just the protection of Guardian personnel. Otherwise, I think that's about the zone and area which from my point of view would best be served by Guardian tech. Are there any questions?

Now before you left, I wanted to give you just a very short briefing. The facts of the case are—you probably haven't even had a chance to see them, but the International statistics are running a continuous Power each week and have now begun to do so in EU. Now, the US is absolutely out through the roof. Each week is going up as much as a fourth or a fifth of the total stat, and it has just been going on like this. Now, they're doing a great job, but one of the main things that they're selling, fortu-nately, is training. They're selling training. This means that the only thing that can break this Power wave—because this Power wave is running away with them now. They aren't just standing around and beating a drum and starting excitement. No, no. This excitement is run-ning in the public. We've got it here. There's only one thing that can break it down: auditors who can't audit. And that means the one thing that can break it down, particularly in United States, is failure to thoroughly train. Now, you're going out there to make Course Supervisors. And I just wanted to tell you that as far as the United States are concerned, it is hanging right straight on you two. Their training has not been very good in the past, and I don't mean to hang you with a superrespon-sibility, but I thought I had better tell you that this mission that you're on is probably the most important mission that we have launched yet. There hasn't been any other mission more im-portant than this one. Because what you've got to do is go out there and make Supervisors who will super-vise the like of which nobody ever heard of. You've got to bring them up from the most dis-gusting state of training to Flag-level training. You've got to teach them to be that good with-out any slightest question.

But it's all got to be very snap and pop. It's got to be very glossy because they will be looking at your course as the model on which they run courses. Do you follow me? Male voice: Yes. So therefore, you've got to use as your model this very, very successful FEBC—OEC, FEBC. And you've got to make it even look glossier than that. Now, as soon as you get out there, you've got to uniform yourselves up; you've got to accumulate some personnel in an area to handle your admin and so on, that is very scarce of personnel, so don't let anybody talk about that. Make up in additional personnel what you lack in other directions. You've got to make sure that your packs are there; you've got to make sure that your administration is good and so on.

We've got to get the Course Supervisors in the Sea Org and the other orgs—the Scientology orgs of the whole United States and Canadian area—and we have got to make those fellows as sharp in the field of training as the Xs are in the field of auditing. They've got to go back out there willing to train, willing to put in a scheduled course, willing to push the people through. And that's the product you've got to get out. Now, if you can do that, they will make it and they will extend and continue their Power trend. And every one of those guys that gets out of your course that can't train people will help break that Power trend of the whole continent. He's a pal of the enemy. So you've got to be sure that the guy can train people. Now, the funny part of it is, that a course which has a reputation as a very tough course is always a famous course. Now, you don't have to be savage with people. All you have to be is exacting. They don't get away with the \"I guess\"; they only get away with \"I know.\" They don't get away with \"maybe\"; they only get away with \"I can.\" And in the case of a Supervisor, his third dy-namic confront must be terrific. So, we add another one to it—is your other action is \"they will.\" And it's a sort of an attitude of \"If you guys let us down, you're really letting the team down. Now, it isn't hard to do, let's do it.\" You got it? Now, always early on a course you have a bunch of guys with a bunch of confusions and misunderstoods and so on and so on. And there's a great temptation to evaluate for them."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"TRAINING PEOPLE TO TRAIN 3 9.05.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 141 HPCS Now, you can refer them to bulletins, you can refer them to texts, but you start gratui-tously handing them out data and the next thing you know, your course will squirrel. It hap-pens almost any time. Just going over these points on an exact course. Now, there has been a breakthrough recently on the subject of what blows students. And it's the failure of the comm cycle of the Supervisor. The student originates something, he doesn't TR-4 it. It can actually get pretty bad. And it winds up in an ARC break and a blow. And we've got that; we know exactly how that works now. We actually got an insight into it when a professional teacher was put on training ca-dets. He blew them. He blew the whole class. And so we've made it our business to find out what blew that class. Now, of course, these kids are always willing to slope off, so they were rather easily blown. Now, it hasn't been taken up with each one of them and straightened out with each one. Instead of that, we started straightening out the guy's comm cycle. Now he has some stats. It's just that. It's just that—his comm cycle. He didn't have any comm cycle. He wasn't an HAS; he didn't know what an acknowl-edgment was. He didn't acknowledge. His TR 1 was horrible. In fact, he never gave them any-thing to do. His TR 2 didn't exist. His confront was a dispersal. So his TRs were also out. But underlying the TRs, he didn't understand a comm cycle. So I'm trying to put you right. You can say TRs—the straight TRs and the Admin TRs—all right; but we found that this fellow didn't have a comm cycle on which to build any TRs. He apparently didn't see any use whatsoever in acknowledging or talking to. Now, two-way comm is essentially the employment of the comm cycle, and there's the thing which you have just got to knock the living daylights out of when you're training these guys. Your answer to the fact the guy doesn't seem to make it and so forth, is a little HAS Course. In other words, they just do TRs, do TRs. Only they don't do TRs sitting in a chair—that's an auditor. You'll have to invent it, that one of them is sitting in their chair and the other is standing up because that's training them in the form that they will be working in. Whenever you see one of these guys who hasn't got a good comm cycle and so forth, you've just got to work it to death. And there you will be turning out fairly smooth Supervi-sors. Now, you can train the guy in total theory whose comm cycle is out, and he will go back and blow half his class. You got it? Actually, training people who train is no more difficult than that. See, you can teach them all the tricks, like they've got to check everything out and how to star-rate and how to do ... That was the other thing we found out: we found out that star-rating just was horrible, it was nonexistent. But they could go all the way through this, they could look fairly good to you in that they could pass a written examination or something like this, and they could go back and blow half their students. And there would go Power for their org. Do you see? I'm"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"TRAINING PEOPLE TO TRAIN 4 9.05.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 142 HPCS just pointing out to you this great big, wide tiger trap that lies in the middle of the road on training people who train. It's a very funny thing, but in an ACC, I would sometimes during the last week, be-coming impatient with five or six of the students out of the maybe half a hundred or some-thing like that—they just didn't seem to be able to learn anything. And I would (because I was basically teaching them how to audit, you see?)—and I would go in ... I never could figure this out, by the way. It was a total point of bafflement to me; it took me years to finally dig how simple it was. I've just told you how simple it was. I'm just giving you an example now. But I would go in and I would take this half a dozen, I'd make them sit down in the chair with the meter and actually give auditing commands and acknowledge them and actu-ally do what they were supposed to be doing and all of a sudden, mysteriously, why, the fel-low could turn out something that looked like a job of auditing. And I used to think, \"Now, look, all these Supervisors that we've had on this ACC have apparently been working over all these students, and how couldn't they train this final half dozen?\" The penny drops: My TRs weren't out. See? Simple. It's just as simple as that. They'd talk to me, I would talk to them. It's absolutely elementary, see? Because I would notice there was this fantastic brighten-up and so forth in these students and so on. It would just ride right over the top of maybe four or five weeks of ARC break, you see? Their Instructor couldn't possibly have been talking to them—couldn't have been talking with them and couldn't have been talking to them, never heard them. Do you see? Male voice: Yes. So what's the answer to this? That was obviously the answer. It looks very compli-cated; it looked like I had some fabulous knack. Actually, I used to scratch my head over this, and it didn't come to me till just the other day what this was. I would talk to them. Of course, you say, well, I was talking to them from a position of altitude, being me, or something like that. Had very little to do with it. It was just the fact that I would talk to them. The first element of the communication cycle is to give the guy some attention. See, there's attention on that comm cycle. It's just a comm cycle and so on. So there it was. I was, of course, you might say, interested in how they were getting along and that sort of thing, but that actually wasn't it to that degree. The answer is so simple that hardly anybody would even look at it. But remember, man has been plowing along now for an awful long time without even knowing that there was such a thing as a comm cycle. That in itself is quite a discovery. So it is these basics which you find have to be put in. You've got some kind of a test like this of your student. You couldn't set this up practically, but this is what you would ex-pect: You would expect this student to be able to walk into a disgruntled, untrained, flubbing class and go around and see each individual student and look over what he was doing, and all of a sudden have the whole thing going at a high roar. And all this would look very magical. So it's basically individual attention."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"TRAINING PEOPLE TO TRAIN 5 9.05.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 143 HPCS For instance, university education—a university is a howl, it's a complete belly laugh. They take about four hundred students these days and pack them into some kind of an audito-rium or something of the sort and they talk at them. And it's actually a self-study course. And the whole system is going more and more off into a thing called self- study. For instance, I can remember some of the early troubles I had in university work and so on, is nobody bothered to tell me I was supposed to put in three hours out of class for every hour in class. I had some dim idea that they taught something there. They didn't. They made the books available and sabotaged your time so you couldn't get at them. So America, peculiarly, has a self-study tradition. So you have to throw it overboard, and you will have to get your people to throw it overboard that you're training. The fact that somebody is twinned up breaks the self-study tradition at once. The other thing that sometimes you run into in training is a Supervisor can get so oc-cupied in his administrative actions ... We have a little course running right now which has got to be brought up with a sharp halt, right here on the ship. It only has five or six. It's the Tech class, HCI, where the Supervisor is spending the bulk of his time doing his own copy work and isn't working with the students. And as a result, two students that were put on full-time training and so forth, trying to get into the swing of it, trying to get over it, trying to find words, trying to do this and trying to do that—the two of them missed several days of their week and only made around five hundred points in the week. But that goes along with Super-visor inattention. So the answer—the answer in all cases—the answer in all cases to supervi-sion is supervise. And if the Supervisor is getting too overwhelmed with checkouts, he must have a checker-outer. If he's getting too overwhelmed with administration, he must have an administrator because basically he is there to give personal attention to the students. And if he's doing anything else, he's inviting blows, he's inviting down points. Now, it's these elements out of which a course is made, and you have the rather heroic action—and I do not underestimate it for one moment—of taking a bunch of students in a country which has a despicably bad educational background (more and more automatic, more and more self-study while going to school, more and more this, more and more that) and bring them up to personal interest, personal attention in the students, excellent comm cycle with the students and the fine points of putting a course together and actually being able to teach a course in such a way that they get zero blows, and then to teach a course that runs very, very fast. A Supervisor here has done a phenomenal job, and he conducted an experiment not very long ago. It wasn't actual as an experiment, but he heard that he was being too hard on the students, so he slacked it off and wasn't hard; he was—became nicer and nicer and more and more pleasant and his stats went further and further down. And he kept taking this advice about being nice to the students until he doggone near blew his course up. And then all of a sudden he said, \"To hell with all this advice,\" and he conducted a gruesome experiment of stepping up the expectancy, the sharpness of what he expected out of a student. He started really going in there harder and higher and more. And the morale of the class picked up—not just their points—the morale picked up."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"TRAINING PEOPLE TO TRAIN 6 9.05.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 144 HPCS \"So,\" he said, \"if I've gone this far, I'll do it again.\" See, at the risk of ARC breaking everybody and knocking them all off the lines and so forth, so he stepped it up again. He's been stepping it up regularly since. These guys are getting points per day the like of which hardly anybody ever heard of. He does a beautiful job; you have an excellent model there. You yourselves have done well; there is no reason why you can't do splendidly. I'm not trying to nerve you up, but it'd be something less than honest if I didn't call you up and tell you exactly what this means and what your mission means. We can send a lot of missions in a lot of places, and I don't have to brief them and so forth, but I wanted to talk to you because the Power condition of the United States, if it continues, will give us the country. It's going like wildfire. You see, when stats go up like that, it's a vote of public confidence, and they must be having terrific word of mouth. So it isn't that all the auditors are bad and that all the Supervisors are bad, for the ex-cellent reason that there must have been enough satisfaction on the lines to cause it to roar. Now, your Class Xs on board would not agree with you as to auditing quality. They hold their head in their hands over auditing quality and particularly in the United States. They think it's ghastly! They spend fifteen, twenty hours on these incoming cases doing the Folder Error Summaries. You probably didn't know it was that high, but it's just gruesome in their estima-tion. And yet, in spite of all that, there must be enough public satisfaction to carry the ball. Now, if you make Supervisors who can really supervise, all of a sudden the amount of error, the amount of question and amount of quibble that comes back on this flub-catch line will drop off. And so you are doing something else: You're trying to pick up this flub catch—which these Xs consider absolutely desperately necessary. But I say there must be enough public satisfaction out there. I hear from them every once in a while. We hear success stories. We hear of an Interiorization intensive success and we hear of a this and we hear of a that, that comes through the lines. And if that starts moving up toward a high, high percent—you know, the 98 percent—it will only be because they've been trained. Now, I have traced all this back, I've gone into every reason why and so forth, and it just is that: It's just lousy course supervision. That is the whole explanation. Along with that goes cramming. Cramming dropped out entirely, so course supervision was the totality. Now, we're putting in course supervision, and we will put in cramming actions and we will put in an Okay to Audit system. And we're putting these various systems in, and they're going in—orgs are actually buying these things—and you will all of a sudden see the techni-cal quality go right on up. Now, as soon as that goes up, why, then our worries are over. But it comes right back down to the Supervisor—that Supervisor in there supervising; making, actually, auditors who can audit; and in administrative lines, making administrators who can administer.

(3) Listen. (4) Do what one can to help without evaluating. (5) Let the student get back to it. Students who drift off of courses or who are very slow lack somebody to talk to! When a student's progress is slow or he or she appears to be troubled or struggling, a good Supervisor notices it early. He gets the student to talk about it. He listens and acknowl-edges.

Two Way Comm with students tended to vanish also. Giving a student off line data and letting the student discuss his troubles are two dif-ferent things. QUAL In Qual there should also be a Consultant Service which uses a meter and Two Way Comm to find out about cases before patch up or review. The Qual Consultant should also handle students who are slow or dropped out. This letting the pc tell his side of it is very valuable. One can handle them much better. By analysing what they say and how they say it helps the Case Supervisor also. I.E., Natter = ARC Brks and overts. The pc's comm has been chopped. An old old session evaluated for him. Etc. Etc. Etc.

Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit. 3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their sub-jects but TRs. 4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic proc-esses stem directly from inability to do the TRs. 5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further. 6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. The preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubs without ARC breaks. Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. Comm Courses are not a tea party. These TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy and HGC and in the future should never be relaxed.

PATTER: The coach uses \"Start\" and \"That's it\", as in earlier TRs. The coach is not bound after starting to answer the student's question but may comm lag or give a commenting type answer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer. Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the stu-dent. Example: Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Yes.\" Student: \"Good. \" Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Aren't you hungry?\" Student: \"Yes.\" Coach: \"Flunk.\" When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, \"I'll repeat the auditing ques-tion,\" and do so until he gets an answer.

The coach should not use introverted statements such as \"I just had a cognition.\" \"Coach divertive\" statements should all concern the student, and should be de-signed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing. The student's job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, using only command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or her hands to prevent a \"Blow\" (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than the above, it is a flunk and the coach must say so. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is no longer needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. This TR was redesigned to improve that frailty. NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961 NAME: Preclear Originations. PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination. COMMANDS: The student runs \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" on coach. Coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by Supervisor. Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1. Under-stand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student into better han-dling. PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concern the auditor. Otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier TRs. The student's patter is governed by: 1. Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving the repeat statement \"I'll repeat the auditing command,\" and then giving it. Anything else is a flunk. The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem that concerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3 Revised.) Flunks are given if the student does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session. Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student's failure to differentiate between these (by trying to handle them) and coach's remarks about self as \"pc\" is a flunk. Student's failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should not always read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. By Originate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. By Comment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations are handled, Comments are disregarded by the student."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS MODERNIZED 7 HCOB 16.8.71 II PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 157 HPCS HISTORY: Developed by L.

First half of coaching session, the student silently steers the coach's body around the room, not touching the walls, quietly start-ing, changing and stopping the coach's body. When the student has fully mastered non-verbal 8-C, the student may commence verbal 8-C. The commands to be used for 8-C are: \"Look at that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Walk over to that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Touch that wall.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Turn around.\" \"Thank you.\" Position: Student and coach walking side by side; student always on coach's right, except when turning. Purpose: First part: To accustom student to moving another body than his own without verbal communication. Second part: To accustom student to moving another body, by and while giv-ing commands, only, and to accustom student to proper commands of 8-C. Training Stress: Complete, crisp precision of movement and commands. Student, as in any other TR, is flunked for current and preceding TRs. Thus, in this case, the coach flunks the student for every hesitation or nervousness in moving body, for every flub of command, for poor confronting, for bad communication of command, for poor acknowledgement, for poor repetition of command, and for failing to handle origination by coach. Stress that student learns to lead slightly in all the motions of walking around the room or across the room. This will be found to have a great deal to do with confronting.

Ron Hubbard in Camden, New Jersey in October 1953, modified in July 1957 in Washington, D.C., and the commands were modified in HCO Bulletin of 16 No-vember 1965, Issue II. Number: TR 7 Name: High School Indoc. Commands: Same as 8-C (control) but with student in physical contact with coach. Student enforcing commands by manual guiding. Coach has only three statements to which student must listen: \"Start\" to begin coaching session, \"Flunk\" to call attention to student error, and \"That's it\" to end the coaching session. No other remarks by the coach are valid on student. Coach tries in all possible ways, verbal, covert and physical, to stop student from running control on him. If the student falters, comm lags, fumbles a command, or fails to get execu-tion on part of coach, coach says \"Flunk\" and they start at the beginning of the command cy-cle in which the error occurred. Coach falldown is not allowed. Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student handling coach physically. Purpose: To train student never to be stopped by a person when he gives a command. To train him to run fine control in any circumstances. To teach him to handle rebellious people. To bring about his willingness to handle other people. Training Stress: Stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence by student. Start gradually to toughen up resistance of student on a gradient. Don't kill him off all at once. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, England, in 1956. Number: TR 8 Name: Tone 40 on an Object. Commands: \"Stand up.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Sit down on that chair.\" \"Thank you.\" These are the only commands used. Position: Student sitting in chair facing chair which has on it an ashtray. Coach sitting in chair facing chair occupied by student and chair occupied by ashtray. Purpose: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 commands. To clarify intentions as differ-ent from words. To start student on road to handling objects and people with postulates. To obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands. Training Stress: TR 8 is begun with student holding the ashtray which he manually makes execute the commands he gives. Under the heading of training stress is included the various ways and means of getting the student to achieve the goals of this training step. During the early part of this drill, say in the first coaching session, the student should be coached in the basic parts of the drill, one at a time. First, locate the space which includes himself and the ashtray but not more than that much. Second, have him locate the object in that space. Third, have him command the object in the loudest possible voice he can muster. This is called"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 3 HCOB 7.5.68 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 163 HPCS shouting. The coach's patter would run something like this: \"Locate the space.\" \"Locate the object in that space.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" That would complete two cycles of action. When shouting is completed, then have student use a normal tone of voice with a lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object. Next, have the student do the drill while using the wrong commands – i.e., saying \"Thank you\" while placing in the object the intention to stand up, etc. Next, have the student do the drill silently, putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of the com-mand or the acknowledgement. The final step in this would be for the coach to say \"Start\" then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\". Here, the coach would attempt to distract the student, using any verbal means he could to knock the student off Tone 40. Physical heckling would not be greater than tapping the student on the knee or shoulder to get his attention. When the student can maintain Tone 40 and get a clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement, the drill is flat. There are other ways to help the student along. The coach occasionally asks, \"Are you willing to be in that ashtray?\" When the student has answered, then, \"Are you willing for a thought to be there instead of you?\" Then continue the drill. The answers are not so important on these two questions as is the fact that the idea is brought to the student's attention. Another question the coach asks the student is, \"Did you really expect that ashtray to comply with that com-mand?\" There is a drill which will greatly increase the student's reality on what an intention is. The coach can use this drill three or four times during the training on Tone 40 on an Object. As follows: \"Think the thought – I am a wild flower.\" \"Good.\" \"Think the thought that you are sitting in a chair.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that thought being in that ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that ashtray containing that thought in its substance.\" \"Good.\" \"Now get the ashtray thinking that it is an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to go on being an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" \"Have the ashtray end that cycle.\" \"Good.\" \"Put in the ashtray the intention to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" This also helps the student get a reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself. Stress that an intention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice, nor is it depend-ent upon thinking certain words. An intention must be clear and have no counter-intention in it. This training drill, Tone 40 on an Object, usually takes the most time of any drill in Upper Indoc, and time on it is well spent. Objects to be used are ashtrays, preferably heavy, coloured glass ashtrays. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1957 to train students to use intention when auditing. Number: TR 9 Name: Tone 40 on a Person. Commands: Same as 8-C (Control). Student runs fine, clear-cut intention and verbal orders on coach. Coach tries to break down Tone 40 of student. Coach commands that are valid are:"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 4 HCOB 7.5.68 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 164 HPCS \"Start\" to begin, \"Flunk\" to call attention to student error and that they must return to begin-ning of cycle, and \"That's it\" to take a break or to end the training session. No other statement by coach is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off Tone 40 or in gen-eral be stopped. Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student in manual contact with coach as needed. Purpose: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress or duress. Training Stress: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus a compel-ling, unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed, since each jerk is a stop. Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coach execute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone 40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too little force defi-nitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk. Here the coach should check very carefully on student's ability to place an intention in the coach. This can be checked by the coach since the coach will find himself doing the command almost whether or not he wants to if the stu-dent is really getting the intention across. After the coach is satisfied with the student's ability to get the intention across, the coach should then do all he can to break the student off Tone 40, mainly on the basis of surprise and change of pace. Thus the student will be brought to have a greater tolerance of surprise and a quick recovery from surprise. History: Developed in Washington, D.C., in 1957 by L. Ron Hubbard. Purpose of these four training drills, TR 6, 7, 8 and 9, is to bring about in the student the will-ingness and ability to handle and control other people's bodies, and to cheerfully confront another person while giving that person commands. Also, to maintain a high level of control in any circumstances. L.

It was published in 1957. OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE Somewhere in your possession, in your desk, or tucked into a bookcase, are two large pieces of paper. They are covered closely with data invaluable to an Auditor. You have pored over them, and quoted from them many, many times. They are, of course, the Chart of Human Evaluation and the Chart of Attitudes. The data in them is a large part of an Auditor's stock in trade, and every Auditor in the world is, in some degree, familiar with them. But how about getting the data off the charts and applying it to life, to some real per-son? It's not hard to do casually, for some acute tone. \"Joe was on a 1.5 kick last night.\" Sure, he turned red as a beet, and threw a book at your head. Simple. Mary breaks into sobs, and grabs for the Kleenex. Couple of Auditors on the scene exchange looks, nod sagely. \"Hmm. Grief!\" But how about chronic tone, with that thin, shiny veneer of social tone slicked over it? How sharp and how certain are you about that? Now, take a pc that you are familiar with. What, exactly, is his chronic tone? If you don't know, you had better read on. If you do, read on, and learn more about it. The title of this article starts with an odd word: obnosis. It's been put together from the phrase, \"observing the obvious\". The art of observing the obvious is strenuously neglected in our society at this time. Pity. It's the only way you ever see anything; you observe the obvi-ous. You look at the isness of something, at what is actually there. Fortunately for us, the abil-ity to obnose is not in any sense \"inborn\" or mystical. But it is being taught that way by peo-ple outside of Scientology. How do you teach somebody to see what is there? Well, you put up something for him to look at, and have him tell you what he sees. That is what is done in an ACC class, the ear-lier in the course, the better. A student is asked to stand up in the front of the classroom and be looked at by the rest of the students. An instructor stands by, and keeps asking, \"What do you see?\" The first responses run about like this: \"Well, I can see he's had a lot of experi-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE 2 HCOB 26.10.70 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 170 HPCS ence.\" \"Oh, can you? Can you really see his experience? What do you see there?\" \"Well, I can tell from the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth that he's had lots of experience.\" \"All right, but what do you see?\" \"Oh, I get you. I see wrinkles around his eyes and mouth.\" \"Good!\" The instructor accepts nothing that isn't plainly visible. A student starts to catch on and says, \"Well, I can really see he's got ears.\" \"All right, but from where you're sitting can you see both ears right now as you're looking at him?\" \"Well, no.\" \"Okay. What do you see?\" \"I see he's got a left ear.\" \"Fine!\" No conjectures, no tacit assumptions will do. Nor are the students permitted to wander in the bank. For example, \"He's got good posture.\" \"Good posture by comparison with what?\" \"Well, he's standing straighter than most people I've seen.\" \"Are they here now?\" \"Well, no, but I've got pictures of them.\" \"Come on. Good posture in relation to what, that you can see right now.\" \"Well, he's standing straighter than you are. You're a little slouched.\" \"Right this minute?\" \"Yes.\" \"Very good.\" You see what the goal of this is? It is to get a student to the point where he can look at another person, or an object, and see exactly what is there. Not a deduction of what might be there from what he does see there. Not some-thing the bank says ought to go in company with what is there. Just what is there, visible and plain to the eye. It's so simple, it hurts. Along with this practice in observing the obvious about people, the students receive a lot of information about particular physical and verbal indications of tone level. Things very easy to see and hear, by looking at a person's body and listening to his words. \"Thetan-watching\" has no part in obnosis. Look at the terminal, the body, and listen to what's coming out of it. You don't want to get mystical about this, and start relying on \"intuition\". Just look at what's there. As examples: You can get a good tip on chronic tone from what a person does with his eyes. At apathy, he will give the appearance of looking fixedly, for minutes on end, at a par-ticular object. Only thing is, he doesn't see it. He isn't aware of the object at all. If you dropped a bag over his head, the focus of his eyes would probably remain the same. Moving up to grief, the person does look \"downcast\". A person in chronic grief tends to focus his eyes down in the direction of the floor a good bit. In the lower ranges of grief, his attention will be fairly fixed, as in apathy. As he starts moving up into the fear band, you get the focus shifting around, but still directed downward. At fear itself, the very obvious characteristic is that the person can't look at you. Terminals are too dangerous to look at. He's supposedly talking to you, but he's looking over in left field. Then he glances at your feet briefly, then over your head (you get the impression a plane's passing over), but now he's looking back over his shoulder. Flick, flick, flick. In short, he'll look anywhere but at you. Then, in the lower band of anger, he will look away from you, deliberately. You know, he looks away from you; it's an overt communication break. A little further up the line, and he'll look directly at you all right, but not very pleasantly. He wants to locate you – as a target. Then, at boredom, you get the eyes wandering around again, but not frantically as in fear. Also, he won't be avoiding looking at you. He'll include you among the things he looks at. Equipped with data of this sort, and having gained some proficiency in looking at the isness of people, the ACC students are sent out into the public to talk to strangers and to spot them on the tone scale. Usually, but only as a slight crutch in approaching people, they are given a series of questions to ask each person, and a clipboard for jotting down the answers,"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE 3 HCOB 26.10.70 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 171 HPCS notes, etc. They are public-opinion poll-takers from the Hubbard Research Foundation. The real purpose of their talking to people at all is to spot them on the tone scale, chronic tone and social tone. They are given questions calculated to produce lags and break through social ma-chinery, so that the chronic tone juts out. Here are some sample questions, actually used: \"What's the most obvious thing about me?\" \"When was the last time you had your hair cut?\" \"Do you think people do as much work now as they did fifty years ago?\" At first, the students merely spot the tone of the person they are interviewing – and many and various are the ad-ventures they have while doing this! Later, as they gain some assurance about stopping strangers and plying them with questions, these instructions are added: \"Interview at least 15 people. With the first five, match their tone, as soon as you've spotted it. The next five, you drop below their chronic tone, and see what happens. For the last five, put on a higher tone than theirs.\" What does an ACC student gain from these exercises? A willingness to communicate with anyone, for one thing. To begin with, students are highly selective about the sort of peo-ple they stop. Only old ladies. No one who looks angry. Or only people who look clean. Fi-nally, they just stop the next person who comes along, even though he looks leprous and armed to the teeth. Confrontingness has come 'way up, and he's just somebody else to talk to. They become willing to pinpoint a person on the scale, without shilly-shallying. They say, \"He's a chronic 1.1. Social tone 3.5, but real phony.\" That's the way it is, and they can see it. They also become quite gifted and flexible at assuming tones at will, and putting them across convincingly. Very useful in many situations, and lots of fun to do. They grow adept at punching through a comm lag in an informal situation. At sorting out apparencies from reali-ties. The rise in certainty of communication, and in ease and relaxation of manner while han-dling people, in the students who have been run through this mill, is something which must be seen or experienced to be believed. The one most often repeated request in every ACC Unit is: \"Can't we please have some more obnosis this week? We haven't had enough of it yet.\" (This statement is very funny to the ACC instructors, because these same students said at the beginning, \"If you make me go out there, I'll walk out on the course.\") Obnosis is quite impor-tant, and should be learned as thoroughly as possible by all Scientologists.

How to use: These Drills are numbered as Expertise Drill 1 (ED-l), Expertise Drill-2 (ED-2) etc. The odd numbered Drills are unbullbaited. The even numbered Drills are bullbaited. If Coach upset occurs because of restimulation fruit words should be inserted in place of the process Key Words on bullbaited Drills. Simply start with the first actions and work through the Drills in the order given. If a student has trouble on a Drill locate whether the student has a misunderstood or has skipped gradient and handle either or both with standard study tech. This can lead back to outnesses on basics such as TRs, codes or scales. Whatever it is, find out why and handle. FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLS Name: Auditing on a doll unbullbaited.

ED-1 HOW TO GET A PC UNBULLBAITED ED-2 HOW TO GET A PC BULLBAITED Ref: HCOB 5 March 1971 C/S Series 25 THE FANTASTIC NEW HGC LINE. Purpose: To teach the student Auditor how to get a PC. The student Auditor must be able to get his own PC, on his own if necessary. Position: Student Auditor and Coach seated at a table. Training Stress: The Coach and student Auditor are seated opposite each other at a table. First the Coach has the student give him the steps in order until he thoroughly understands them and could use them. When the Coach calls off situations, for example, the D of P says he doesn't have any PCs. Or, all PCs on lines need actions you cannot audit, etc. How will you get a PC? Keep throwing situations at the student Auditor until you are confident he could get a PC no matter what barriers existed. Flunks are given for any mishandling, or failing to satis-factorily obtain a PC. The student is passed when he knows how to get a PC. Steps: 1. Inform the D of P that a PC is needed. 2. Hound the D of P to assign you a PC, if he hasn't. 3. Independently go through current PC folders looking for any ready for an action you can do, get their Auditor to complete them to where you can audit them, fast. 4. Hound the D of P if he won't prepare you a PC. 5. Study PC folders of PCs currently not on lines with your Org. Also study the person's CF folder, find out from the study: A. What hasn't been handled. B. What goals he has had for processing. C. What the person's own statement is of what is wrong with him or what he wants handled or improved. D. What person came into Dianetics/Scientology for. (Above are usually liberally stated through-out PC and CF file but almost always on first White form or letter Reg. questionnaire.) Get in comm with the person through a letter and get him in to see the Registrar. PC must sign up with the Registrar and pay the Cashier for processing. Reception pro-vides the routing form.

ED-3 OBSERVING THE OBVIOUS UNBULLBAITED ED-4 (No Bullbaiting on this Drill.) Ref: BTB 26 OCT 70 OBNOSIS AND THE TONE SCALE. Purpose: To train an Auditor to see what is there without additives or opinions. Position: Coach and student seated at table or ambulatory as required. Training Stress: To train an Auditor \"The art of observing the obvious. It's the only way you ever see anything. You look at the is-ness of something, at what is actually there.\" LRH Commands: \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"What do you see?\". Steps: 1. Coach and student may be seated or standing in the class room to start with and may move around to other areas. 2. Coach says \"Start\", \"What do you see?\". 3. The student Auditor tells the Coach what he observes that is plainly visible. 4. The Coach accepts nothing that isn't plainly visible to the student Auditor. Eg. The student is looking at another person in the room: Student: Well, I can really see he's got ears.\" Coach: All right, but from where you are sitting, can you see both ears right now as you are looking at him? Student: Well, no. Coach: Okay. What do you see? Student: I see he's got a left ear. Coach: Fine. 5. After the student has caught on to what observing the obvious is you flunk him for any tacit assumptions, conjectures, deductions of what might be there from what he does see there. (Something the bank says ought to go in company with what is there.) The Coach only accepts what is visible and plain to the eye. 6. The Student Auditor passes this Drill when he can obnose flawlessly. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1957 for the Advanced Clinical Course to help train students to observe the obvious.

This is cycled through several times until the student or group as a whole feels good about this step and is thoroughly familiar with the Tone levels. 6. In this step the coach points to the Tone level and says: \"What is this?\" Student(s): \"Total Failure.\" Coach(s): \"What is this?\" Student(s): \"Can't Hide.\" and so forth. Coach follows the Tone Scale from bottom up to the top of the scale until the student(s) is thoroughly familiar with it and can do it very fast. 7.

ADMIN TRs CORRECTION References: BTB 7 FEB 1971 ADMIN TRS  HCOB 24 MAY 1968 COACHING It has become apparent that coaching Admin TRs, especially the last few, can be very difficult if the coach is double hatted as a Bull-Baiter. If he becomes too involved with the Bull-Baiting he can easily miss flunks on the Student. Also, buttons are not easily duplicated, as the action which caused the Student to break his confront might not have been seen. This either hangs the Student with a loss or puts him into self-coaching. Therefore, on these TRs involving more than 2 people (specifically TR People BB 1, BB 2, BB 3, BB 4) the Coach does not Ball-Bait. He is an additional person to those doing the drills as laid out in the Admin TR BTB. He stands or sits close to the Student and simply ob-serves him. If the Bull-Baiters cause the Student to break his confront or flub in any way, the Coach flunks the Student and ensures that the Bull-Baiters flatten the exact button that caused the reaction. In short, he controls the Whole TR. It is up to him to see that the Student gets the gains that can be his from doing the TRs standardly. He coaches per the HCOB Coaching, seeing that the Student is given a series of wins on constantly toughening gradient.

This is best handled by getting the student to hunt up and define with the source of the definition (HCOB Date book name and page no.). This allows the stu-dent to grasp the meaning of the words used in the study of Scientology. Words other than Scientology or Dianetic words are also clarified. A real stopper can be the words Scientology or Dianetics. Consult the student's under-standing and not just accept what sounds like a definition of these two words. Simple points like \"why is level 0 level 0?\" can produce astonishing resurgences in study velocity. Using the questions \"where were you doing well\" and \"where did you notice you ceased doing well\" zeroes in on the point or word or principle misunderstood and sometimes just the first question blows the lot. On many occasions it's the first word on the material or the title of the HCOB so even check these. Sometimes tracing back where or when the student heard of Dianetics or Scientology blows the trouble. These points must be handled skillfully and rarely more than once on any occasion. Take it lightly and let the student win. L.

THREE VITAL DATA There are three vital data which make the difference between a successful course and one which fails utterly. They are: 1. Exact Scheduling. 2. Supervisor Presence. 3. Supervisor refusal to answer Tech Questions but only refers the student to the materials. Exact scheduling means just that. The course has a daily schedule, it is known to each student, and it is adhered to exactly. The course commences each day and after each break exactly on time, with a brisk, snappy rollcall. It is ended exactly on time by the supervisor. The supervisor must be present with the class at all times and ON TIME. Continuous inspection of what is going on, correction by referral to the right bulletin, and just being there as a supervisor will bring about trained students.

If a housewife said, \"I can't run my house because I have never taken a course on how to run my husband's business,\" you'd think she was crazy. A course super who does not respect, know and use study tech on his students is guilty of practicing Out Tech. If an auditor did not know how to start and stop a session, how to read a meter, his TRs, his processes or handle a session he would have nothing but failed preclears. In the same frame of reference, a course super who does not know how to start and stop a student, clear words, enforce demos and does not get study tech applied con-tinually will have failed students. A course super's primary tech is study tech and its application to a student. If he can keep that student on the rails and F/Ning and rapidly covering his materials he is doing the whole job of supervising. It is therefore a High Crime for a person to supervise a course who does not know, apply and continually use his study tech on every individual student. It is also a High Crime for a director of training or a tech Sec or an Est O to have anyone supervising without full use of Study Tech. Just as it's a High Crime to continue to use HGC auditors who smash up pcs through non-use of auditing tech, it is a High Crime to continue to use course supervisors who do not know that study tech exists, that it is a tech and that it is the \"tools of his trade\" and who does not use it and thus smashes up students. The society knows nothing about study tech. It thinks a teacher \"teaches the subject and must know the subject!\" Thus it alter-ises the subject, almost never makes a competent person and routine school teaching is looked upon by industry as a huge failure. All manner of unusual solutions are in progress in every country to remedy this inability of students to learn. We must not continue to inherit the idiocy that a teacher only has to know the subject and know nothing about study tech. It is study tech that gets the student of any subject through. The thing that breaks the super down is ignorance of just one point: A student with a misunderstood word will pour out a torrent of queries about the subject! The super is a complete ignorant fool if he answers one of these questions. The su-per's knowledge of the subject is not what is needed!

Just like an \"auditor\" is not an auditor who lets pcs blow without handling so is a su-per no super at all who cannot handle a student with study tech. So let's knock off the wog world inheritance and get on the ball and realize study tech is the tech a super knows and uses. Just because a super was himself mistaught by old Mrs. Zilch in the third grade—who knew arithmetic but not how to teach a subject – is no reason he has to go on laying an egg in a Scientology classroom. A course super is a technician, a specialist in study tech. And just to help it out, it is a high crime to fail to use study tech in a classroom. Any time a student blows or later fails to be able to apply his data, the super who taught him will be Comm Eved for Out Tech. We must have no blows and no failures. The product of a super is a graduate from his course who knows and can successfully apply the subject that was taught. This is his true stat. Points measure only quantity. The record of the individual student measures quality. The exchange value of the student after a course (not his fee) measures viability. It may be a crazy planet. Course supers don't have to teach crazy courses where study tech is not used.

Two way comm is actually a process. It is not just talking to someone. There is a two way comm checksheet. It can be done with or without a meter. When there is nothing wrong and the student is going along well, the course supervi-sor does not act to correct. The comparable action in auditing would be: when the pc is doing all right you let him carry on with regular auditing; when he isn't doing all right you take a corrective action such as a review. It is a serious error in auditing to correct a pc who needs no correction. In course supervision it is a serious error to correct a student who is doing all right. For example, one sees a student busily checking out another and they are both doing fine. To interrupt or correct these two students would be a supervision error. Reversely, to see a student frowning or a coaching session bugged and NOT get in and straighten it out would be a supervisor error.

This is a coined (invented) word meaning observing the obvious. There is no English or any other language precise equivalent for it. Man just does not seem to Observe the obvious. The reason for it is Misunderstood Words. Not understanding the symbol (word) the actual thing can become somewhat less visible. The real job of the Course Supervisor is to get the puzzled or doping or bogged stu-dent going. And to protect the student who is flying from interference including the Super's own. To do this the Course Supervisor has to observe the obvious. Is the student going okay? Is the student bogged? What is an F/Ning Student? Is he chortling and gurgling and slapping his knee? No. He is just calmly going right along. What is a bogged student? Is he stretched out on the floor snoring? No, he is groggy or puzzled or frowning or even emotionally upset by his mis-U words. When not caught and handled he will go to sleep or just stare into space. Should a student's fingers be wiggling? No, he should do demos fully and with full at-tention only when he has something to demo in order to grasp it. Should two students be chattering about a date they had? No. They are not F/Ning stu-dents even if they are F/Ning gossipers. When the Super does not know the key words of his post, his power of observation is low.

To keep from looking a Super can develop systems like \"Every 36 minutes I'll check up on every class member for it takes just 36 minutes to go around them all.\" When an F/Ning Student is interrupted by the Super he can be given a \"withhold of nothingness\". The student may say \"No, I've just been checked up\" and the Super goes away. But the student now wonders \"Am I trying to hide something?\" \"Am I really doing all right?\" Etc. A w/h of nothingness. To keep students from blowing, both these points have to be looked into. Obnosis is the drill required on the Super. And a Method 6 on the Key Words of his post.

On his order I piloted and wrote up the procedure on the original Saint Hill Special Briefing Course where most of today's training technology was developed. The original Pink Sheet Application was to the Saint Hill Co-Audit where all students audited in one big room. Later Pink Sheets were also issued to correct flubs in Coaching Ses-sions with great success as the supervision of coaching has always been one of the primary functions of a Course Supervisor. Later, as recently pointed out by Herbie Parkhouse, HCO Policy Letter of 20 Decem-ber 1970 was issued. This PL alter-ised Pink Sheet procedure to make it a 'quickie, outpoint-correct, outpoint-correct type of action. From Herbie's experience this does not get the basic why for student errors, tends to invalidate and cause student upsets. This later PL also substi-tuted Pink Sheets for Cramming Orders which are two distinct, separate functions. The 1970 Pink Sheet PL is therefore cancelled and the original reissued with a few minor revisions to bring it in line with current procedure and terminology. Its text follows: WHY PINK SHEET? All the study in the world isn't going to make an auditor or coach. Learning the data and the theory of auditing is vitally important. Perfecting your practical drills is essential. However, the final test lies with the question, \"Are you getting results with your pc?\" Whether you are getting results or not is totally dependent on whether or not you are actually"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 2 BPL 27.09.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 228 HPCS applying the data and theory you have learned, and are utilizing the practical skills you have developed. The bridge between the learning of data and development of practical skills and their actual application in the auditing or coaching session can be mightily bolstered by the Pink Sheet system of Training Supervision. A student's ability to apply Study Tech on himself and his twin can also be mightily bolstered by the Pink Sheet system of Training Supervision. HOW TO ISSUE PINK SHEETS 1. Put two sheets of pink foolscap size paper on a clipboard with a carbon between. 2. At the top of the sheet write the name of the student, student auditor or coach being observed, the date and the name of the observer. 3. Head a wide column on the right-hand side of the sheet with \"Observations\", a narrow column to the left of center with \"Theory and Practical Assignment\" and two more narrow columns on the left-hand side with \"Coach\" and \"Supervisor\". 4. Take the above with your ball-point into the vicinity of the student or the auditing or coaching session to be observed, close enough to hear and see what is going on with-out intruding. 5. Write in the wide column labelled \"Observations\" exactly what is happening in the session, coaching session, or while the student and his twin are studying. This is very difficult to do for most people (especially for someone at the case level of \"only able to confront own evaluations\"). Do not look for study, auditing and coaching errors. Just look and record what is happening. Do not write in evaluations. Do not write in invalidations. Do not attempt to correct or teach in the \"Observations\" col-umns. Simply observe the session and record what is happening. 6. After you have filled one or more pages of the \"Observations\" column, now is the time to evaluate. Study what you have observed taking place and see if anything actually diverges from the Standard use of Study Tech or the correct theory and practice of auditing or coaching. 7. Write in the column headed \"Theory and Practical Assignment\" the date and title of the exact bulletin or tape containing the correct data or the title of the exact practical drill which will correct the error recorded in the \"Observations\" column. If a session observed was a complete shambles, it means that some basic, basic fun-damental of auditing or coaching is absent in the student's repertory. Don't overload the student with tons of drills and theory assignments. Look over your \"Observations\" column carefully and it will suddenly dawn on you that this student hasn't a clue about the auditing cycle or doesn't note the difference between the needle and the TA on the meter. If you still can't find the main difficulty, you can always sit the student down and ask something like \"What happens when you sit down in front of a pc?\", or \"What's the meter for?\" You'll be surprised with some of the answers you'll get."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"TRAINING TECHNOLOGY PINK SHEETS 3 BPL 27.09.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 229 HPCS On the other hand, you might find that you'll fill up a couple of pages of Pink Sheet without recording any errors. The student didn't happen to goof, or the coaching drill is going well, or Standard Study Tech is being used. That's fine – send it to him without any assignment. It will still help him. 8. Send the top copy of the Pink Sheet to the student and file the carbon copy in the stu-dent's Pink Sheet folder. When the completed top copy is returned by the student, with all the necessary signatures, throw away the carbon copy and replace it with the com-pleted top copy.

HCO PL 7 Feb 65 \"Keeping Scientology Working\" In the above example the Supervisor has evaluated, invalidated and only made general comments.

He steps in and two-way comms with the coach to get more data and the why for the trouble becomes very apparent. It can then be cor-rected with an exact assignment of the correct material. He makes sure that the coach above has his own Missed Us cleaned up and the Supervisor may need to step in with some Method No. 4 Word Clearing to handle in the end. The full procedure is as follows: 1. Straight observation with 2WC, if needed, to gain data. 2. Find the why behind the misapplication or non-application of Study Tech, the goof or upset (if a goof or upset is actually present). 3.

Continue the above and you will have an F/Ning and rapidly progressing course room full of students. COACHING PINK SHEETS Pink Sheets should be coached in both Practical and Theory. The coach first reviews the observations thoroughly with the student, finds and clears up the misunderstood words, and goes over and over the bulletin or drill with the student until the correct data is com-pletely learned and understood or until the student can perfectly execute the drill. Once this is done, the coach signs his name opposite the assignment notation on the Pink Sheet in the coach's column. The student is then ready to have a checkout on the as-signed material. CHECKING OUT PINK SHEETS In checking out the assigned material on a student's Pink Sheet, the Supervisor should carefully go over the \"Observations\" with the student and have the student spot the specific errors he has made, then have the student give the correct data from the assigned bulletin or tape or show by doing the practical drill that he has now mastered the skill that was poorly applied while studying or in the auditing or coaching session. The whole bulletin or drill should be reviewed by the Supervisor but specific attention should be paid to points that the student was observed to be weak in applying to his study, auditing or coaching. Be doubly strict on these points to be sure the student doesn't continue to make the same errors again and again. If each Pink Sheet thoroughly corrects only one gross error, really knocks it out, the student's study, auditing or coaching ability will improve markedly in a very short time. CONCLUSION Pink Sheets are never used as punishment or to make the student wrong. They are used to improve the student's study, auditing or coaching ability by having him thoroughly learn data and practical skills he is weak in. A student's weakness in data and skills often will not show up under the normal condi-tions of theory and practical testing but it will stick out like a sore thumb when he has to ap-ply them in an actual auditing or coaching session or while actually studying. Therefore, a Pink Sheet Assignment does not mean that the student hasn't learned the material if he has already passed it in Theory or Practical. It does mean that he hasn't learned it well enough to utilize it while studying or under the duress of an actual Auditing or Coaching Session.

All Personnel of Tech Divisions are reminded that it has long been a function of this Division to promote itself. 2. Foremost and most obvious is the old dictum, that when Tech is in, bodies will come flooding in. Happy, satisfied preclears and students will not be quiet about Scientology wins. They will disseminate. Keeping the Promotional Points for their Departments in an alert and realistic way will do the rest. 3. Letters of Procurement by the Departments of Processing and Training are very effec-tive. Personnel of Tech do not sit back and expect Dissem to bring in all the students and preclears. They get busy themselves writing, telephoning, scheduling and Tech Services always gets advanced bookings in earlier. And they demand that Dissem get their enrolments up. 4. Directors of Processing get busy keeping Auditor Procurement going and work with Qual to get Training Programmes in for already Classified Auditors in the Org and in the area. And they demand that Personnel Procurement bring in auditors and train and recruit auditors in the Academy. No HGC should ever be short handed for auditors. Policy clearly allows for any qualified auditor in the Org to be used when necessary (P/L 28th April, 1965 \"Technical Personnel\"). But with good Auditor promotion and training this need not become necessary. 5. Tech Personnel, including Supervisors and Auditors take full responsibility to see that they themselves keep trained and checked out on all necessary material for their de-partments. They don't wait for Qual to remind them or for Ethics to take action first. They make sure that Qual does train them and that there is no violation of High Crimes Policy of star rated checkouts (P/L 8th March, 1966 \"High Crime\"). 6. Tech Services Personnel do not wait until Auditors or Students complain about lack of material-or wait for Boards of Investigation to do their job. They make certain that materials are provided and in good condition. They keep materials supplied to Audi-tors and Students and make certain that lines and routing is properly done. They are there to give swift happy-making service to Technical."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"TECHNICAL DIVISIONS PROMOTION 2 HCO PL 20.10.69 AND RESPONSIBILITY PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 236 HPCS 7. Technical Personnel do not natter, complain or go into apathy if their Pcs and Students are \"held up too long in Qualifications\". They see to it that HCO and Ethics speeds routing. 8. Technical Personnel do not sit and hope that Public Divs will arrange Public Lectures, HAS or other beginning Courses which will feed people into the Technical Division. The Technical Secretary has materials ready and personnel prepared to give these courses. 9. Technical Personnel realize that they are turning out the Product of the Organiza-tion-completed students and preclears who will bring about changed conditions on this planet, and that is what the Organization is all about. 10. So Technical Division Personnel do not sit around and wait for the rest of the organi-zation to do the job. They keep busy doing their own actions, keeping their Promo-tional Points in, and keeping Technical in on themselves ... and demand that the rest of the Organization help keep them supplied.

If you are not in terrific ARC with the people you have to get them to relax about the body of data you are teaching before the importance of data shows up. A person can be hung up on the all-importance and everything-ness of a subject. He is so nervous of dire consequences that he will eventually have an accident. People are often thoroughly educated into this attitude. It is all so important it will kill him if he doesn't know. This inhibits his power of choice and ability to evaluate data. Education today is taught by consequence, not by the fact it is a sensible thing to do. In the world importance essentially means punishment. To teach someone a subject just have him select out the un-importances of the subject. He will start to think everything is important but coax him on with ARC and 8C and he will eventually come up with something un-important, i.e., You are teaching him how to drive a tractor. He will find the coat of paint on the crank un-important. You acknowledge and ask him to find something else un-important. Keep at this repeating it and repeating it and eventu-ally \"all-ness\" will start to disintegrate. He will select down to the most important controls of the tractor and the next thing you know he can drive a tractor! He won't have a craving to know anxiety and won't be nervous at all. You are teaching by de-evaluation of importances. It is interesting that a person who never selected out the importances of Scientology or any subject, and believes every datum must be memorized, you will find, has a history of be-ing punished within an inch of their lives. There is a direct co-ordination here. Education is basically, fixing data, unfixing data, and changing existing data, either by making it more fixed or less fixed. This technology using importances can undo to a marked extent a very thorough edu-cation in some subject and return it to the power of choice of an individual.

A person could do a whole course and get good study stats yet not learn anything. He might even pass an exam yet not have learned the data so that it can be applied. The subject of Study has been researched and completed by L. Ron Hubbard who did the bulk of the work prior to 1964, The Study Technology has been in full use in Scientology Organizations for many years. The subject of Learning was started by L. Ron Hubbard in the early '50s and required only a small amount of research and correlation for the data to be issued in the final form. To evolve the most effective of the many Learning Drills which had been researched in previous years, a number of the most successful drills were used on a group of students of various levels of Training with \"before and after tests\" to determine which drill raised the stu-dent's ability to learn and apply data. The following drill was found to produce the best results on all levels of students in every instance. It was evolved from the LRH Tape Lecture of 24 January 1962, \"Training – Duplication\". We have named it simply – \"The Learning Drill\". The drill is not designed for use on study or course materials. It is used to improve the ability to study and increase the learning rate. The Learning Drill would be done at the beginning of courses, or as needed. Then the student would study his course materials or anything in the standard way with Study Technology applied, and with Twin Checkouts, Demos, Clay Demos, etc."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE LEARNING DRILL 2 BTB 10.12.70R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 240 HPCS THE LEARNING DRILL Position: Student and coach sit facing each other across a table. Purpose: To develop judgement by duplication and understanding. Training Stress: 1. The first step is duplication. The coach takes a sentence or phrase from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The line used is unimportant. The coach reads it to the student. TRs should be in, although not stressed. The student then repeats the line exactly as the coach read it. Coach merely tries to get the student to repeat a line of sounds. You don't need to call them words. It is not rote mem-ory. It is duplication. The coach repeats the line each time the student flubs until the student has duplicated it exactly. 2. The second step is understanding. After the student has correctly duplicated what the coach read, coach asks \"Give me an example of that.\" Student gives example or examples until both are satisfied. Coach then asks, \"How do you feel about that?\" and if OK they continue to next line. If the student has any uncertainties with examples the coach goes back to 1 and starts the drill from the beginning, using the same line. If the student still has trouble with examples, coach would ask \"Are there any misun-derstoods on this line?\" and any found cleared up. A dictionary should be used where re-quired. Remedy: If the student continues to have trouble with examples, the coach could say, \"Give me an example of how the datum isn't that way,\" and student gives examples until both are satisfied, then \"Give me an example of how it is,\" until both are satisfied. Always end off with how it is. The student should feel good about the datum after duplication and understanding and should start having realizations as he is further drilled. Eventually, using the two basic steps, the student will learn judgment. The drill should be coached on a gradient. It should be ended on a good win. Student should have VGIs. The end result on each student is the ability to rapidly and accurately learn data.

Well, I'm glad to see you, too. What's the time? [laughter] Female voice: June the 18th. I'm getting so I think in terms of broader periods of time. It's quite amusing to me, but I notice the 16th took two or three days to go by and the 17th has taken two or three days to go by, and now we're on the 18th, so this is 18 June AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The things are swinging along beautifully and it's quite a tribute – this is not germane to the lecture, the lecture is on something quite important, but – the lecture is about studying – but it's quite interesting that a very – a rather indirect tribute can be paid to the auditing of Saint Hill students who've been through their lower materials and come on up to the co-audit, and so forth. They have actually kept their pcs going, over a considerable quantity of by-passed charge. That isn't said as a gag, you see? It's the truth, see. Because the top of the reactive mind, you see, the top of a GPM, is the hardest thing to find out what's in it. You haven't been over this – these humps, and you probably won't have to be, but just let me give you this in passing. The hardest thing in the world to find are the top items of a GPM. I don't know how many potential oppterms and terminals were discarded before the actual ones were found, see. It's up – oh, I don't know, the arrangements of that bank are almost uncountable. You have, at the moment, a perfect line plot. That's why you're getting away with it. But the top of a bank, you see, the whole reactive mind would be equally hard to get to because the thetan is sitting on all that charge, you see? Similarly, the top of a series, you see, would be the hardest thing to find the root words of, don't you see? And that is the scramble which has been going on before the thing was finally taped. It's very funny. I've got the rest of the root words of the series, you see? They just run out like hot butter, there's nothing to those. But getting those exact top ones, that was the tough one. And in putting that material in exact lineup, of course, we had mo-mentary stumbles on the line of exactly what was this thing. Of course, you know, you could have laid off and knocked off and not done any auditing on this, you see, for a couple of years and let me have run the whole bank out, don't you see? But you were running this danger, is by the time I've run the whole bank out, I might not be interested. [laughter, laughs] Gag."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 2 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 244 HPCS But it was a considerable tribute to the fact that there was – there was some missing elements there, perfect line plot they started with – didn't start with a perfect one, but had one within 24 hours – and the materials pretty well lined up, exactly how they went, what the pat-terns were, and that sort of thing. This was pretty well ironed out, but nevertheless, neverthe-less, there were quantities of bypassed charge, huge quantities such as no co-audit will ever face again, you see? And the auditors in the co-audit actually were sufficiently smooth as auditors, and so forth, that their pcs just kept going along and they didn't have any big casual-ties or anything else. Now, in the clumsiest look, they would have killed somebody with that much charge, see – the clumsiest look. And if their auditing had been the least bit crude, and so on, why, those people would have just been flying apart at every joint, you know. There would have been ARC breaks and rabble rouses and so forth, and max – mass exoduses and people check-ing out and... [laughter] You know, I mean, it'd been – it'd been horrible. Because if you can see the amount of catastrophe caused by just missing one item, and so forth, well, here they had a whole series missing. And yet they were auditing over the top of this and actually were making very nice gains and gave me yesterday afternoon a very beautiful series of reports. Everything was going along fine. [laughter] Now, by George, that's pretty good auditing, that's pretty doggone good auditing. So I wish to give them a compliment right now, on the subject of their auditing. They must be aw-ful good. [applause] All that's straightened out now, and I imagine in today's sessions the cases just took off like rockets. They must have gotten into the top of that other series and so forth, and it just must have run swish! In fact, I never saw anything connect up with such reads as the – as connecting up the missing element with what had been bypassed. That really shot the lot, rerunning it and connecting it up. So the upshot of the situation was that I was very, very pleased with that. They're mak-ing terrific progress and everybody is very, very happy about this and very enthused about this. And I get a side note occasionally on letters going out of here and I'm not having to say, \"This is it,\" now. \"This is it\" is a very, very calm statement compared to some of the state-ments I've heard going out of here on various lines. And there isn't, I don't think, any doubt in anybody's mind who is in the co-audit, they'll eventually make it. They may make it with only one leg or something like that, they're figuring at the present moment, [laughter] but they'll make it, they're on their way and the door is open, wide open. All right, the situation with regard to auditing depends on another subject and that is a subject called study. If you can't learn anything, why, then you can't find out how to do any-thing. So just as I talked to you in the last lecture and told you that communication was not an end-all of processing but was absolutely vital if an auditor was ever going to get to a pc to do something for him, so it is true that study operates as the door, open or closed, to learning how to audit. If an auditor can't learn anything, then of course he won't be able to audit, regardless of the attitude he has towards the human race or his wish to do something for people or his desires in any way, shape or form. These all would be barriered by just this one point – he couldn't learn anything."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 3 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 245 HPCS So in order to teach somebody how to audit, it's necessary that they be able to learn. Now, this is terribly fundamental, awful. This is down there scraping the bottom of the barrel with regard to fundamentals, and yet all great successes are built on attention to fundamentals. Everything is built on a fundamental. Unless you can isolate these fundamentals, you of course leave your building with a – with an incomplete foundation. It's sort of sitting in the air ever afterwards unless you find the fundamental with which to proceed. You wouldn't build any skyscrapers if you didn't put down a foundation. Well, what is the foundation? That foundation in auditing is, of course, study – the ability to learn. And failing that, why, an auditor has an awful hard time. This next datum I am going to give you is something – is something I really don't want you to park behind the left lobe and skip, because this is going to make all the difference in the world to the future of Scientology. And that is a knowledge of this one point, this one point: That better than 50 percent of Scientology consists in the discipline of application, con-sists in the technology of application, consists in the know-how of application. And that's bet-ter than 50 percent of the subject – better than 50 percent. Now, perhaps that datum is not very impressive, but let me – let me amplify this and I think you will see how that datum is impressive. You could give the entirety of the processes which have produced results in Scientology – and there are a great, big, many of them – you could give these in their entirety to a field of mental practice, carte blanche – that's just the processes, you understand, just the commands – and they wouldn't be able to do a thing with them. They wouldn't be able to get any result with them of any kind whatsoever. They would turn out an asinine statement like the University of Chicago. It's a college. That's what we used to say about it at GW. We used to be tolerant about Chicago. Most of us wanted to go there because you only had to go a couple of years before they handed you a sheepskin and we were bored. But this outfit uttered this asinine statement: \"We have tested all the techniques of Dianetics and found out it didn't work.\" Well, in the first place it's asi-nine because all the techniques of Dianetics didn't exist in published form and were not avail-able to them to test, see? So right away, that was nonsense. For instance, I know of techniques that were released at the first Foundation in Elizabeth which have never seen the light of day; I have never seen them published or anything else. Matter of fact, I saw three or four splinter groups suddenly start up on stuff that was merely designed to take care of one pc or something like that, and then they decided that this would apply to all pcs and so forth. There are several brands of therapy which are adrift today which simply consist of one technique developed for one pc at Elizabeth. So for any outfit – for any outfit to grandly look down its nose and say, \"We have tested all the techniques of Dianetics,\" you know? Well, what a statement, see? They haven't got them to test. How would they even know if they had tested \"all the techniques\"? Right away they are irresponsible. And then to say they didn't work would also be asinine because if they had tested even slop-pily, they would have gotten some result someplace, unless they were simply uttering a pub-licity statement to protect the vested interest. But that is aside from the point. The point is simply this: Yes, they could have had all the techniques. They could have had them all. They didn't, but they could have. And they"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 4 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 246 HPCS could have, in their haphazard, bunged-up way, have tested these techniques and they would-n't have worked, because they didn't have a Dianeticist in the lot of them. There was nobody there trained in the basic disciplines of Dianetics. And that was 50 percent or better of the technology which they might have gathered. Quite important, don't you see? Now, give you another one: Reg and I, sailing around on the deep blue sea, invented a – dreamed up a course that was – had nothing to do with Scientology but had to do with business and commerce and nevertheless was a very broad application of Scientology to busi-ness and commerce. But the course was for another reason entirely and Reg thought this was a good idea, and he went ahead and he executed this course. And this course has been mar-velously successful. It's running, I think, at the present time and it's doing fine, you see? Only trouble is, everybody else is now trying to get into the act. It's a goodwill ges-ture. All this course is, is a nice goodwill gesture; it's trying to increase the salesmanship, and so forth, of retail merchants and their clerks, you see, so as to move more equipment and that sort of thing, see? That's what the course is designed to do. And everybody tried to get on the bandwagon, you see? There were other people started teaching this course, teaching their own courses to accomplish the same end, you see? And recently some company or another re-quested that Reg's course be taught to all of their staff and so forth. They get requests of this particular character. But Reg made the broad statement there that is particularly applicable to this lecture, and so on. He says, \"Well,\" he says, \"you don't have to worry about any competition or other people giving this course. They'll start and they'll fail, and so forth, but they won't be able to duplicate the course.\" Well, that's been the facts of the thing. This course could go on, they could (quote) \"teach similar courses,\" do this, do that, do the other thing, but of course, they are always aware, if only this, that they are teaching a substitute, that they are not teaching the real one. And people are always faintly aware of the fact that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship. Well, this in itself, you see, enters enough – even on the copyist – in the way of an overt or something like this, so that he then goes into an obsessive alter-is and the statement that Reg made was, \"They can't duplicate it,\" becomes completely true. They can't and they won't duplicate it and that is the end of that. And that – these other courses have probably risen – I don't know what the history of this – I haven't kept up with it too well, but I think there are other courses have risen up and faded away by this time and a lot of enthusiasm has been generated in this quarter or that on duplicating this course and I think this course is still going on. Very successful. Probably one of the more delicate goodwill gestures that's been entered into by a company for a long time. Well, of course, one of the reasons it's successful, it's somewhat oriented Scientologi-cally. But that course wouldn't be duplicated and therefore wouldn't be tremendously success-ful. Now, supposing they taught the exact same methods; that is, they used the technique or something on these other courses that are being taught which are copy courses of this course, you see? Supposing they did that, and so on. There would still be some element miss-"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 5 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 247 HPCS ing of some kind or another. That element would be the missing thing that would make the course that was being taught fail. I don't wish to belabor that particular simile, but it is merely interesting, it is merely interesting that even there, even there on such a thing as simply teaching some salesmen how to be nice to their customers and that sort of thing, that this thing, too, fails when you move it out of its own perimeter of discipline. So even on a thing as slight as that, you see, that one fails, too; and so it goes along the line. I don't know how much technology a university loses because every professor makes 90 percent of his salary by making the students buy his personal books. I think by the time you've rewritten James Watt, I think you've lost steam engines. And it's highly probable that there probably isn't a steam engineer in the world today that has really got the technology of steam. It has been perverted and twisted aside and misduplicated, and so on. And I go back to some of these old boys that knew their business, and so on. One time I was covering an air meet and there was a fellow standing there – it was a bright sunshiny day and he was standing there with rubbers on and an umbrella. The umbrella wasn't unfurled, but he had that umbrella handy. It was a beautiful midsummer day, you see, and I wondered what this character was doing at an air meet – all these daredevil racing pilots and that sort of thing around; and I was covering this thing for The Sportsman Pilot. But I thought this was good side color, so I surreptitiously took a shot at him with my press camera and got his name. His name was Young, and he was the second man in the world beyond the Wrights to fly. Ha-ha! He was probably one of the most famous early birds there was. My face was a little bit red, you see? He had become cautious in his old age, but in his day – I imagine his caution still didn't extend to flight – but in his day they used to fly a plane off the ground with an ambulance running along below it. [laughter] That's right! They saved more pilots that way. This was a man who was a wild man along this particular line. Well, I was very inter-ested in talking to him; I did an article on him eventually, and he showed me his scrapbooks, and so on. And I was particularly fascinated that there were 13 methods of flight, heavier-than-air methods of flight – 13 of them – of which the motionless wing was only one, and by the way, one of the less favored ones. And one of the reasons it was favored was because – at all or done at all is because it didn't take much mechanical ingenuity to build it. But there were twelve other methods of heavier-than-air flight-heavier-than-air; that's not ballooning or zep-pelins. There's all kinds of methods of keeping aircraft aloft. There's the principle of the rotating stick, that if you throw a stick in a certain way it'll hum – spinning, you know – it'll hum and you will see it curve straight up into the air. It'll do the darnedest ascendancy and that's just a rotating stick. There is method after method of flight of this particular character. Because they concentrated on the one wing, it won, see? And you now have aircraft all over the world which are going along with this stiff wing out there from the fuselage, mostly because the early birds didn't have any of the wherewithal or anything else to build something"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 6 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 248 HPCS a little more esoteric or different, so it got the concentration of research and that is what we now call an airplane. But it was interesting listening to old Mr. Young – who was designing these things back when – it was very interesting to listen to him on a tone of disappointment that they had chosen that particular one to push forward in research because it was one of the less workable and one of the less efficient. Here was this vast body of technology, see, which had never been developed and which is lost back there in the first ten years of this century. All kinds of methods of flight; none of them ever went forward. Well, this one that was easy to do did get developed. Well, it's very interesting that one of them emerged and went forward; that's probably the one thing one should look at. But it is customary almost in civilizations for a body of knowledge to come into being, then get grooved into a certain specialization – some piece of it, don't you see – then that piece of it poorly duplicated and the rest of the technology to be lost. Boy, would I like to talk to James Watt on the subject of steam engines. He probably could tell you all about high-pressure boilers. See, he just didn't have the time, money, mate-rials, to build one. But maybe there were dozens of methods of utilization of steam which have just been lost, you see? What you're studying now is lost technology, lost technology. \"Now,\" you say, \"the civilization goes forward and wins anyway.\" Well, may I invite you to go almost in any direc-tion from where you are at this moment at Saint Hill, for a distance of ten or twelve miles and try not to find the remains of civilizations which did not win. They are all over the place here – civilizations that are dead, civilizations that are missing, civilizations that no longer are with us. They are all on the basis of lost technology. They start specializing in one gimmick, there's nothing to amplify that gimmick, they finally lose the pieces of it and it vanishes. The civilization may be very well dependent upon that one gimmick; they have nothing to back it up. They lose it, in other words. Fascinating, the changes and turns and twists that these things take. Now, you could say a lot of other things about these civilizations, but the only thing I am pointing out at the moment is they're not here. See, they're not present. We don't have them with us. And they were good civilizations as they went: the Roman-Briton civilization, the Danish civilization that was here, the Saxon civilization here – all these things terribly different – the Norman civilization that was here. They're all over the shop. How about the Celtic civilization that existed before? Must have been quite a civiliza-tion. You read casually about wicker chariots charging through the Ashdown Forest. What's this – wicker chariots charging through the Ashdown Forest? Well, our good friend Caesar reports as such. Well, this civilization has went. We know nothing about this civilization. It must have been pretty well advanced. And yet the scene of this battle, and so forth, is within about ten miles of Saint Hill. Well, where did that civilization go? What was it all about? That's a pretty"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 7 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 249 HPCS esoteric civilization – wicker chariots, see? Maybe some somebody forgot how to weave wicker. Who knows what happened to that civilization, see? Now, the situation here is that technology gets lost and we have to study how it gets lost. And it's – gets lost because people can't study. That's really the only reason it gets lost. That's quite a – quite an interesting fundamental, to reduce everything down to that particular fundamental. We don't, then, go into the esoterics of \"They couldn't duplicate\" and \"They couldn't this,\" but that's only why they couldn't study. Civilizations tend to rise forward to a certain peak. And then under the stress of com-bat and the various elements and so forth, they start losing their technology. Well, they lose their technology simply because nobody studies the technology. How about this fellow, the silversmith of England? England's no longer today turning out the silver it once turned out. Its silver craftsmen used to be very, very famous. And then they got a Labour government, and it put the tax up on silver to a point where British silver no longer could be sold. They might as well have stood the British silversmith up against the wall and shot him because he drifted off then into other trades and the technology became lost; and it's practically a lost technology at this moment. Now, this has only been lost in the last decade or so. You'd have to talk hard to a – to jewelry store managers and that sort of thing before you understand why it is that you can't buy silver. You can buy antique silver, you can buy yesteryear's silver; there are two or three of them still in business, and so forth. Well, what about these fellows? There are fellows around who learned this and there are plenty of textbooks on this subject and that technology still exists but it's going to be lost. That's for sure, it's going to be lost. How about the one old craftsman who is left in the plant? You see, he knows all about that. He's surrounded by people, and all of a sudden there might be a resurgence in that. Well, everybody merely depends on him; they don't learn the craft. You see, they simply depend on him to know it. It all comes up against the dead end of not being able to learn, not being able to study. Well, I always prided myself in being a very quick study, so I, myself, can speak from fair expertness in this particular line. But I know my own history on this and I know my own blind spots on this. When you become less worried about your mental status or something like this in the world, you can actually look at it and find out if there is anything wrong with it and dare admit that it could stand a few improvements here and there. One of the things about study itself is that there are a great many things around that are false and you could study a lot of false things and therefore become disabused of studying because you had studied something false. This would be one of the reasons why you might cease to study. I really don't see that that has anything to do with it, except that it enters the idea of judgment of what you're studying. So if one studied without any judgment whatsoever of what he was studying or ability to evaluate what he was studying or know what he was studying, why, his ability to study would be very poor indeed. He'd just be Chinese in aspect. Nothing wrong with the Chinese, but I remember going to school, the eighth grade, I think. I spent some months going through grammar school, all on different stations and places. And the situation that arose in the eighth grade was that nobody could get an A mark"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 8 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 250 HPCS except two Chinese who were in the school. And they had – they had learned how to study but so have parrots learned how to study if that is their study. And they would get up and they would reel off the page number and the paragraph and everything else of the history book assignments, you see, and they'd give it to you verbatim. Most marvelous job of total duplication you ever heard of, but they would not be able to tell you what universe. And if you had – if you had varied one comma or asked for an opinion on that material studied in that way, they would have come a cropper at once, and very fre-quently did. They would have to remember whether it was in the middle of the book or the back of the book, as to what period that it applied to or something like this. Most marvelous job of carbon-copy duplication that I ever saw, and it used to irk the rest of us, you see, because they would always get A-plus, and it held up such a horrible ex-ample to the teacher that the teacher would, of course, then give nothing like an A-plus to any mere knowledge of the subject, you see? So our renditions of it were quite rapidly thrown away and we usually got D. I'll never forgive them. [laughter] But anyway, joking aside, these – this is – this is a case of perfect, perfect, complete perfect duplication without a grain of sense connected with it; and that's absolutely deadly, so that isn't how you study. Deadly! But perhaps you should be able to do that, but I would con-sider that a mental feat, and I don't think study has anything to do with mental feats. Study has to do with understanding. Study has to do, basic and most formally, with just really one thing: willingness to know. That's the first little gate that has to be opened to embark upon study: willingness to know. If that gate remains closed, then you're liable to get into such things as the total verba-tim, rote system; you are liable to get into all kinds of other systems, none of which will add up to any knowledge. Now, when you recognize that in Scientology we have one thing – one thing – which is not very easy to put into texts and which may never be put into texts: the discipline of how you do it. But when you recognize that that one thing actually is difficult to transmit in – by the written word – and is very easy to transmit by example. And when I call your attention to an earlier part of this lecture, when I said that it amounted to at least 50 percent of what we were doing, and I'll point out to you that there's a frailty involved in the relay of this informa-tion that's the future success of Scientology, and that frailty is right there. It could very easily, very easily become an unworkable subject. You could take all the GPMs in the world – what do you think would happen if you took all the GPMs and the total map of the bank and everything exactly right and gave it at this moment to psychiatry? I know what they'd do. They would immediately analyze Poe to see how many times one of these words had occurred in one of his books, and then get the fractional recurrence of and then try to explain why Poe was mad, or something like this, don't you see? This is probably what they'd do with this material. It'd be monkey tricks, you know? I even thought vengefully one day of sending all of the whole plot to the American Journal of Psychology – which, by the way, would absolutely fall on its face and bound its forehead to flinders if I were to give them an article. That's one of the reasons why they're a"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 9 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 251 HPCS little bit mad at us. I have been soundly berated by them for not publishing it with them at least one of our case histories, because it would revolutionize all... You see, it can't revolu-tionize anything unless published in their magazine. [laughter] I've been scolded by them for this but I thought vengefully of just giving them the whole plot and let them publish it, see? And that would eliminate that. [laughter] But the point, the point I'm making here, is that all of this technology that can be writ-ten down, and so forth, could be relayed with the same result of the University of Chicago: no result, see? Because it has this element missing from it: the discipline of how you do it. Now, when I tell you that an auditor can get so good that a gross bypassed charge ex-ists in a session and his auditing is sufficiently smooth that nowhere and on no student in that co-audit did it get keyed in – wow! See, this is an almost impossible auditing feat. That's walking around the edges of the lion's cage, you see, so neatly and adroitly that there didn't even have to be bars there. This is pretty terrific, see? Well, what did that? That's auditing discipline. That's the communication formula, that's this, this is handling the meter, this is what you do with a pc and what you don't do with a pc, and so forth. This is omitting from the auditing sessions the things that Mary Sue comes down as GAEs on, on Wednesdays, on TV demos; weeding these things out, keeping that line straight – over 50 percent of it. We must, at this particular time, then, do this rather superlatively well here at Saint Hill. Because if any serious goof existed on the part of any of those auditors in the co-audit, any such consistent GAE as we see when a person first arrives here, he would have just wound his pc up in a pile of junk because there was enough there to have jammed the pc into a pancake against the brick wall, see? There wasn't any slight bypassed charge to be triggered, see? They weren't even aware of the fact that it was there and they were auditing around it sufficiently smoothly that it didn't cave anybody in. Well now, on the reverse side of the coin, on the reverse side of the coin, if they had had all of their materials absolutely perfect right at the outset and if their auditing discipline – their ability to audit – had been as poor as it might have been, with all the materials and tech-nology perfect and the process being done, they would have turned their pc into a pale pink pancake up against the brick wall. Do you understand? That's the other side of the coin! Now, if you appreciate that, you can appreciate the remark I make when I tell you that the technique is one thing but the way it is applied is what makes the car go down the road. And that thing is the most likely thing to get lost. So therefore, we're in business as long as an auditor can learn how to audit. You see, you don't have to learn anything actually to run GPMs. You can be handed it on cards. Did you – you realize this? You could probably be handed it on cards and you could reel it off one way or the other in some kind of patter. You wouldn't even have to learn it, you know? You could just let it sort of go off water like the – goes off the ducks back, you see? You could parrot it, you see, from a – from a list or a card or something like this. You would-n't have to be learned. You're not up against learning in that burrow. In fact, if I ever hear of an Instructor making some new student memorize a line plot so that he can run it better, I'll give him a GAE with exclamation points – the Instructor, see? That would be the most grue-"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 10 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 252 HPCS some thing. So actually, in that particular case the technology is not something you would learn. You wouldn't even learn the – what's called the technique – you wouldn't dare! It'd just kill the student; that'd be it. If you ever have a – have a – find yourself, bird-dogged by a spy from the Federal – I don't want to be – pardon me, I'd – there are ladies present – why, just decide that he had bet-ter learn by heart – don't even pick out anything very rough, just give him one of the Helatro-bus line plots and tell him, well, he has to start in by learning that by heart. [laughter] So therefore, when I am talking to you about learning, we're practically not on the sub-ject of technology at all. We know what grade certain technology belongs in and so forth, but – I do it myself very often, write the process out rapidly below the meter, so that I can put my pencil – let's say it's a multiple question. I don't want to involve my wits, which should be involved with auditing, with remembering what question the pc is stumbling along on. I don't want to involve my wits with that, so I'll just write down the four or five commands, or what-ever the thing is in rotation, and just stab the one with my pencil that is currently in action, you know; and when I come to the next one, why, I see that all is well and I look down at the paper and refresh my memory of the thing and give it to him again, don't you see? Well, that leaves me free to audit; has nothing to do with that. In fact, there's tricks like you're running a multiple alternate question, and so forth; your positive is your index fin-ger and the negative is the middle finger, and so forth, and just touch them with your thumb. Touch the positive question – you're on the positive question. Well, your thumb is on your index finger; negative question, your thumb is on your middle finger, and so on. You don't get mixed up that way, and you don't mix up the pc either nor do you have to sit there saying, \"Now, let me see, what am I now...\" you know? That's for the birds. So frankly, aside from classifying and know where the technology goes, I wouldn't say there is anything to learn in that zone at all. You're not going to learn auditing commands. You know what type of command should be there, you're going to learn that but not the com-mand. You're not going to learn line plots or GPMs or something like that. Well, this changes the complete complexion of, \"What – what – what are we supposed to learn? Then what – what learning is he talking about?\" I'm talking now about learning how to do it, how to apply it. See? That's what I'm talking about. Well, it's quite fascinating that there's many a guy shows up, he just wants a couple of processes so that he can learn these processes, and so on, and then he thinks he's educated and he can go on his way because he knows he can apply those; and then somehow or another they never seem to work for him, and he's always missing as to why they're not working for him. Well, what he should be learning is the subject of auditing. Bulletins connected with good indicators, bulletins connected with comm cycles, and this type of thing. What are the tools of the trade here? Where – what's the categories of these tools, and so on, and how are they applied and what judgment do you use in connection with them? Learn those well enough so you're relaxed about them. Now, that's something to learn. And yet, I guarantee you, that that consistently will get brushed off lightly in comparison to some gimmick or trick"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 11 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 253 HPCS or process, see? The person, in other words, will be very happy to learn what are the auditing commands for something or other but have nothing whatsoever to do with a comm cycle. Now, a comm cycle takes some learning, man, as you know! You can't even glibly say, \"Well, it blah blah blah blah blah, and it starts and continues and it finishes, and – and that's all there is to a comm cycle and now we know all that. All right, now what's the auditing command, you see? That's what's important.\" No, that's not what's important. The auditing command won't work unless you arrive, unless it arrives with the pc. And it's got to arrive with the pc along with certain \"How do you do it? How do you act like an auditor? How do you sound like an auditor?\" That's the stuff, that's the stuff that gets it there. Now, I had a recent experience which is quite amusing. I have my lighter moments and I decided that I had better make an independent study. There's no sense in getting too concentrated on any one particular point, and I was going along like a shot rocket in the direc-tion of Class VI materials and working on them very hard and very concentrated and that sort of thing, but I didn't figure that was going to keep my mind that involved. I find – I felt I might as well take up another subject which was entirely independent, you know? Give me a nice shift of attention. So some years ago I had incautiously and in a moment of weakness bought a course of photography. Of course, I've been at photography since I was a kid; a nice hobby, and I have a lot of fun with it, and so forth. And at one time or another, why, I've sold pictures and so on. It's just one of these hobbyist things that you fool with. I'd probably classify as an advanced amateur; one time I classified as a pro, when I was in college. Used to make a lot of money, National Geographic and so forth. I think there's some geography books around that still carry pictures of mine in them. But the upshot of it is, that I decided that in view of the fact that my mind was very heavily in this direction, I might as well put it in another direction. So I took up this corre-spondence course in photography – the New York Institute of Photography, one of the best – and rolled up my sleeves, and found out I'd never gotten deeper than about the third lesson. So I decided I would learn a little bit about study and I would start and study this thing up and I would get myself pushed along the line and get all my lessons done like a good boy, and send it all in, lesson by lesson, you know? Well, what do you know? What do you know? First time in my life I learned some-thing about studying. I learned something very subjectively and very real about studying. The only reason I'm telling you this is not to amuse you particularly, but you might be able to use this. And it's just this: I began to wonder why I had stopped at the third lesson. I was toler-antly going on forward studying the remaining lessons, and so forth, but why had I stopped at the third lesson and why was I bogging here and there along the line? Because this was not going easy. Now, of course, this is a very, very wild, occasionally very dry, very often very stupid subject, the subject of photography, because it gets into optics. Well, you want to take a pic-ture, not study optics, you see? But optics are apparently something that people who want you"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 12 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 254 HPCS to know about photography hold very dear to their hearts and they nag you about, you see? [laughter] And then there's the subject of chemistry, and chemistry is very interesting. There are numbers of chemicals and they have something to do with the picture appearing on the thing, but that's something you really don't know too much about. If you can walk into a darkroom and turn yourself out a good negative and a good print, who the devil wants to know anything about chemistry, don't you see? This was more or less my attitude. But I went on studying like a good boy and passing my examinations at the end. Every booklet has an examination. And all of a sudden it dawned on me that although I'd been inter-ested in this since I was 12 years old, I didn't know anything about it! Horrible, dark thought. I've taken pictures, I've published pictures, people have paid me good cash money on the line, my pictures have been on covers of magazines, a very slick fellow. And I don't know anything about this subject! It struck me like a thunderbolt! This is a subject I had been at, if you please, since I was 12, in this lifetime. And I suddenly realized I didn't know anything about it. And it wasn't a case of sudden amnesia or something. It was just... [laughter] \"You what?\" you know, and \"It's – it's which?\" And I suddenly rapidly reviewed what my reactions had been and made a very careful analysis of the whole thing and exactly what had happened. I'd had a particularly great subjec-tive reality on this. I was studying an allied subject; I was forcing all of you to study; I should know something about the subject of study. And so I had, more or less, to some degree, started out to learn something about study and I learned something right then. The tolerance that I had toward them had brought me up to a point where I was per-fectly willing to learn a few gimmicks from them, and that was the state of mind I had entered that course upon. I was perfectly willing to learn a few gimmicks from them. I realized that my arrogance on the subject has absolutely – unprintably unspeakable. My arrogance was absolutely fantastic! But look, I've been at it since I was 12. I studied photography under some of the – some of the old boys that were kicking around at that time. Some of the government photog-raphers and scientists up in the National Museum were patient enough to teach me about pho-tography, I read books on the subject, read this and that, even worked in professional dark-rooms. And the evidence was right in front of my face. Good heavens! People pay you money for pictures. I used to take pictures for Underwood and Underwood. And I had always said that the trouble with my photography as I came on up the line – I had it all beautifully explained – the trouble with my photography as I came on up the line was they kept changing their methods. [comm lag, laughter] I had it beautifully explained. So therefore – well, actually, since I started photography, miniature cameras have come out, pan-chromatic film, different types of developers, flashbulbs have come out; they've changed all these things. As a matter of fact, they're changing one on me right now. I had one film made by Ilford so tame that I could turn out a fine grain negative on this stuff, and they went and changed the speed rating of the film. Now you can't get the old film, so I don't know how to do it now. I was – this was blame on my part, you see? They kept shifting materials on me."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 13 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 255 HPCS And what had dawned on me is, what I was being struck with in these texts – because this is a good professional course, see; this is nothing for any amateur – what I was being struck with in the text was known by Mathew Brady in the American Civil War. The basics and fundamentals that I didn't know had been present in that subject since 1860! Had nothing to do with changing materials. I didn't know the first fundamental of why the picture got took in the first place! And all of a sudden, at that moment, it dawned on me with a tremendous crash that I had been very arrogant and that I really didn't know all there was to know under the sun, moon and stars on the subject of photography; I really wasn't the world's past master on the subject of photography because I had gotten a few results in my day, but that there was some-thing there to learn. That's what I was struck with. And boy, I buckled down and started to study. Now, the speed of advance is very interesting: three books in three and a half years; eight books in two weeks. And one is prior to that realization and the other is post that reali-zation. I suddenly looked at it last night and realized I was halfway through the course. Three and a half years it took me to get the first three of the fifty-some books that comprise the course. Why was I unable to move through that? Well, I was studying something I knew all about. I could not bring myself into a relaxed frame of mind of \"Here is something to study. Let's study it.\" No, I was studying it through this screen: \"I know all about this. I know every-thing there is to know about it.\" Well, will you please tell me why the devil I was sitting there studying it, then? If I knew all about it, why was I sitting there studying it? And yet I was putting up this pretense of studying it. I was even pretending to myself I was studying it. I didn't realize that I was pretending. I thought I was really studying it, you see? I'd read it, you know, and so on. [laughter] But it was all from the viewpoint that I knew all about it. And my arrogance was such that I was perfectly willing to learn a few tricks from them, and I think that was very tolerant of me. Now, the funny part of that is, in subsequent study and so forth, my whole viewpoint has shifted on the subject, the whole viewpoint of what I'm willing to take a picture of; and my critical standards of what's a good picture have shifted utterly. I'm even criticizing their examples of perfect pictures, see? Very critical, but very well-founded criticism. I couldn't learn because I knew all – that I knew all about it, you see? Now, that passed from a realization that I didn't really know a thing about it; I had to get right back to funda-mentals and study those fundamentals. Once I got those fundamentals in and had those fun-damentals well studied, and so on, and moving along the line up there, then I got to a point where I was not only perfectly willing to learn, I was also perfectly willing to talk back. I wasn't in any slavish state about learning. I knew my fundamentals now. I could see where they applied, and so forth, and within the scope and limits of that educational course was able to talk up. In other words, I could have an opinion. I could now have an opinion, I could exert judgment. I had no judgment on the subject before. I merely had some fixed ideas, just fixed ideas, and these fixed ideas told me that I really knew all was to know about the subject."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 14 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 256 HPCS When I finally found out – the big breakthrough was I found out there was something there to learn – that I didn't know. It wasn't a matter of a few gimmicks. Then this reversed around the other way, and with hard study, all of a sudden made another breakthrough: I freed my own judgment. I'd talk to any of these birds now. [There are] texts there by some very famous photog-raphers. Good, hard, tough slugging this thing is, but one of those guys, I'd say, \"Ah, come off of it,\" you know? \"You're talking like this, but this picture here, man, I – how come? Look, you've burned out all of the...\" This would have been legitimate. He would have talked to me about it, too. I'd say, \"Look-a-there. You've burned out all of the highlights. You just burned them right straight through. Why? You might even have at least remedied it in the darkroom, for heaven's sakes.\" And he would have said, \"Well, I didn't think anybody would notice.\" I'd say, \"Well, I noticed.\" Critical. Not that criticism is bad, don't you see; but I developed a critical eye, did not have to slavishly say, \"This is a picture by Sam Falk, New York Times magazine, one of the greatest exhibition photographers of all time. Therefore it is holy.\" See? Gone completely through that and up to a point of where, \"That's an awful good picture. That guy really has a good sense of composition, terrific sense of composition. What the hell was he doing that day in the darkroom? Drunk?\" See what I mean? And I could have put my point – finger on a point which I'm sure that Sam Falk himself would have agreed with. He'd say, \"That's right. I didn't even hold back the enlarger light on that burned off highlight over at the side, and it completely washes out that bird's features over there. That's right, you're right. Attracts the eye over to the side of the picture, not to the principle subject. You're right, could have been improved, could have been improved in the darkroom.\" He wouldn't have argued about it. Or he could have said to me, \"You don't know how bad the negative is!\" [laughter, laughs] You see what I mean? Then this would have been a sensible discussion because in the meantime, by burning the midnight... dawn actually; I've been using this to go to sleep on. But the point had come up here, where one's fixed slavishness to something was there because one really didn't understand it in the first place, so he had to have fixed opinions to safeguard himself. \"Perspective: Perspective is handled by making something dwindle into the distance. Well, there is – if I don't have something go 'dwindle into the distance,' the picture won't have perspective.\" You know, this kind of a slavish fixed idea on the subject of perspective. Not \"There are a lot of ways to give pictures a three-dimensional effect.\" See, that'd do you a dif-ferent point of view, see. And \"Perspective is accomplished in several ways.\" A different viewpoint, see? Then, once you understand that, then you can look at a picture and say, \"Well, that photographer had a good command of perspective,\" or \"He didn't.\" See? You say, \"This guy had stepped over here another couple of feet to take his picture, he probably would have had a different depth, and it would have looked a lot better,\" see? Because, look, here's a couple of advantages he could have taken that he didn't take."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 15 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 257 HPCS In other words, you have a flexibility, you have a flexibility of route, so therefore you can have an opinion, not a fixed idea or a prejudice. There's a big difference between a preju-diced or a fixed idea and the ability to have an opinion. An opinion could be based on many things. But when an opinion is based on an inabil-ity to find out what it was all about in the first place, a man looks like a fool, and he suddenly looks like a fool even to himself when he makes a breakthrough. So that my ideas on the subject of photography were not resulting in a finished picture. That's one of the first things I suddenly recognized, you know? The lightning struck. That was not necessarily what broke me down on the line. I'd broke it down before that, but I recog-nized that afterwards. Well, a guy's as good as he can finish a picture. It doesn't have anything to do with anything else. It obviously can be done, so therefore, why, there it is. And this also included overshooting the mark, which you might find interesting. Pre-vious to this breakthrough I made and the realization that I didn't know what the devil I was doing when I took a camera. I know how to clean lenses and do all sorts of things, but I didn't know what I was doing when I picked up a camera. I mean it was just ridiculous to even think that I did. A few lucky breaks, you know, and you seem to be so hot, but what about this? It's a bum day and you want to get a picture and if you're real shaky and you don't know your business and so forth, you say, \"Well, it's a bum day. That's one day I don't get a picture.\" See? Well, if you really knew your camera, you wouldn't pay any attention to the fact that it was a bum day. You'd say, \"Oh, yeah. Well, all right.\" Bang-bang. \"What do we want the ef-fect here? Bright sunlight. Good.\" Bang, boom! You'd say, \"That's kind of interesting; awful foggy out there. Well, let's make the fog a little bit worse, and let's get it – real spooky-looking picture,\" see? If you knew your business, then you could turn the tool to your advantage, any which direction you could, see? You weren't the victim of everything that occurred. You weren't the victim of every little splinter on the road, see? \"Well, it's too bad a day. The sun's not out and – oh, we'll take that picture tomorrow or some other day when the weather is nicer,\" you know? Well, what's – what's this? You mean – this can – this can exist to such a big goof that you don't get a picture at all then? How do you like this? And yet a guy would not be able, who couldn't say, \"All right, let's see,\" pick up a camera and take a picture, see? He's supposed to get a picture. Well, he should know his sub-ject well enough that he can get a picture. That's fairly easy. All he's got to do is put himself in the vicinity of what he's trying to take a picture of; if he knew his tools real well, if he knew his darkroom technique real well, he'd p... he'd get a picture. See, he'd get a very ac-ceptable picture. Now, the degree of picture that you would get depends a lot on practice and that sort of thing. So, I learned that lesson, too, in a big way, that the conditions of the activity around me did not necessarily monitor whether or not I got a result or not. \"Pc nattery today, there-fore we couldn't get much auditing done.\""},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 16 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 258 HPCS What the hell!

So it takes you a little bit longer to get the session wheeling. Well, get it wheeling. That's the difference, don't you see? But these are the things I learned through this little side study, and it was – I found it, myself, very interesting to pick up a completely alien subject to what we are doing – it had been lying around for quite a while; it merely exists in the field of hobby – and find all kinds of applicable materials on the subject of study, and to find out that the first thing that barriers learning is the consideration that you know all about it. And if you want to build up a ridge on the subject of learning, man, that's it! Just consider you know all there is to know about it. And the next thing – the next thing is, don't let your idea of what you know – this is most amusing – don't let your idea of what you know get contaminated in any way by the fact that you're not producing. You're not getting any result, see? You're not getting any result and this is quite – rather obvious to you that you're not getting a result, but this doesn't challenge for a moment the idea that you know, see? Yeah, this never causes you to question it for an instant. See, you're not getting a result; you know that you know; and the fact that you're not getting a result doesn't challenge your conviction that you know. The other thing is the fixed – the idea of the fixed opinion. One has to have certain fixed opinions to protect the fact that he's stupid on the subject and that he can exercise no judgment of any kind whatsoever as long as he's mired down in a bunch of fixed opinions. And that afterwards, that judgment, then, depends on a freedom from fixed opinions and an actuality of a – of a good assessment. You know what you know, you know what you don't know, see? You know what you know, you know what you don't know. In other words, you're not fighting this chimerical thing. You're not protecting your nebulous reputation to yourself about how wise and how marvelous you are. You're relaxed on this subject, you see? You can say, \"Well, there's one section of this I don't know anything about. Have to look into it some day.\" But at the same time this doesn't bring you into a feeling that you don't know what you do know. Utilization of judgment, then, depends on a very thorough knowledge of a subject, and if you haven't got judgment on a subject, why, it's because you don't know the subject. That's just that. If you find your judgment is very often false or bad in some line, well, you must realize that this signals to you in some way or another that this – maybe you don't know all there is to know about this certain situation, see? If your judgment on it was bad, why, it must have been bad because of an absence of knowledge of the subject. So, what it boils down to, what it boils down to is an auditor's ability to learn depends not necessarily on his saying how stupid he is, but depends certainly on a willingness to learn – just a willingness to learn. He's willing to learn, and so forth. And the biggest single barrier is a preconception that he knows that is not attended by any singular result. For instance, let's hear a remark something like this: \"Well, I – I know Scientology. I've studied Scientology a long time and I know it very well. In fact, I audit very well. Of course, I don't get very good results.\" Well, this is that thing – same thing in a nutshell: this – the fact that he isn't getting results – results can be gotten; he's heard of these things, he's seen"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 17 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 259 HPCS them around, and so on; results can be gotten. But this fact does not at all challenge his im-plicit confidence that he knows all there is to know on the subject, you see? Doesn't challenge him for an instant. Well, of course, that's just a lack of perceptiveness. A fellow can't see. He's not capa-ble of judgment with regard to his own skill. His judgment, then, with regard to what he's do-ing is at fault to that gross error. He is uttering the fact that black is white. He can't do it, yet he knows all about it. He knows all there is to know about doing it, yet he can't do it. Well, that's a silly statement, and that is the lowest ebb of judgment on any one particular subject. You get into a – you can get into an area of examination of this sort of thing, you find out that nearly everyone is put up in some particular sectors to status. Status has an awful lot to do with this, you know? And he gets pushed up into a feeling like he has to protect his own status by a certain arrogance or pretense, even to himself He has to think well of himself, don't you see, by pretending that he knows something or appearing very clever to himself or so forth. He's really – really, you can head it under the heading of \"self-esteem,\" one of the methods of bolstering self-esteem. Nothing particular wrong with this. I'm pointing this out in a very mild way. It's necessary that an individual feel somewhat confident in some direction. But it's also very interesting that this need for status and self-esteem evaporates in the pres-ence of real knowledge and a real esteem takes its place. And it's that real esteem which is most impressive to self and to others because it's producing results. The – competence – there is no argument with competence, no argument with it at all. It doesn't then really come down to a test of \"What does a person know?\" but it comes down to a test of \"What can a person do?\" And if you just adjudicate this on the basis of it's not – well, psychiatry should serve as a wonderful example to you in this, man. I hate to run these boys down because they are being kicked to pieces anyhow, but let me tell you, I have never been as surprised over things as I have been by that particular crew. It's not that I'm even terribly fascinated with what they're doing. But do you know, I read one time what an examination for a diplomate in psychiatry consisted of, and do you know, it only consisted of the date and the context and title and the place of publication of Freud's lectures! Not what was in them! Not \"What could you do in the field of psychiatry?\" But it was just that: \"When was the lecture given? What was its title?\" don't you see, and \"What publication did it appear in?\" And that's an examination for a diplomate, the highest degree in psychiatry! Oh, some psychiatrist will come along because they're always trying to make a liar out of everybody, they come along and tell, \"Oh, that's not true, that's not true, that's not true.\" And you say – they're doing this down in Melbourne right now. \"Oh, that's not true, that's not true, that's not true. And well, he doesn't really know anything about psychoanalysis,\" and so forth. \"Well, does psychoanalysis assert that sex is the basic mainspring of life?\" \"Well, yes.\" \"Well, does the article say this?\" \"Yes.\""},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 18 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 260 HPCS \"Well, is that true about psychoanalysis?\" \"Well, yes; but, you see, Hubbard doesn't know anything about psychoanalysis.\" \"Well, what doesn't he know about psychoanalysis?\" See? \"Oh, well, he wouldn't know anything about it, because he just wouldn't know any-thing about it,\" and so forth. \"Well, what psychoanalysis are you talking...?\" \"Well, we don't know. There's various brands of psychoanalysis.\" [laughter] You always would get into this kind of an argument. It's something like walking into a swamp when you – when you try to talk on this particular subject, you see? So it's not very sensible. Well, I'm just pointing out to you that that is really pure idiocy – that's really pure idi-ocy. One, could you learn anything from that lecture? And two, how have you been able to apply it? And three, if the fellow really knew about it, he'd be able to answer the next ques-tion. If he really knew up to this point, he'd be able to answer the next question: Well, what opinion do you have of it? What opinion do you have of that subject matter? See? If he really – if he really knew the subject and he'd studied that, and he really knew that and he could apply that, and so forth, then he'd have a free opinion on it. He wouldn't have to be pro-tecting himself with his free opinions. See, it'd have nothing to do with esteem or anything else. He'd just have a free opinion on the subject, you see? In other words, he'd have judg-ment. But if you fix it on \"Give us the lecture and the date and where was it published and that's all you have to know about it,\" you know, you of course have taught the man nothing more than you could learn from a card-catalog system. Well, it doesn't have anything to do with doingness. Well, in photography – which I've just used as a somewhat amusing sidelight to this to you – the test, of course, is whether or not you can get a picture. That seems rather obvious, doesn't it? That would be – it's different than in – well, you conclude photography now is an art, which is interesting, because it's only graduated into that field very recently. Metropolitan Museum, and so forth, has exhibits on it now as a fine art, but – didn't used to be. Now, a critic could exist in the field of painting, merely through his knowledge of painters and paintings, and that sort of thing, and he could have opinions on the subject. These things would probably be very basic, and that's all very fine because here's a very wide, very complex field. And maybe you could have a critic in the field of photography who didn't really have to be able to produce a picture. Maybe he could just criticize pictures and maybe to a very good extent. But the odd part of it is as you enter into a technical subject out of a purely artistic subject, this burning question comes up: How the devil would he know whether or not that was a good darkroom piece of work? He would have to be able to know what can be done in a darkroom, so he'd have to answer the question, \"What is done in a darkroom? Is this better"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 19 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 261 HPCS than what is done in a darkroom or worse than what is done in a darkroom?\" because you're up against this technical fact. A technical fact intrudes here, unlike art. You can take a handful of mud and throw it at a rock and say, \"That's a great painting.\" See? Well, maybe it does have form and design. Who would know? Because there is no real technical backup with regard to art at large. It's great, great, wide, huge subject, you see? Depending on, mostly, on whether a person is pleased or displeased with some form, color, object or significance. It basically forms an opinion anyhow. But the second that you get into a technical fact, when you get into the technical line, well, you have to know what can be done, you have to know if it is done well, what is being done and what isn't being done, see? This, then, you would have to know pretty well before you could have much of an opinion on the subject. In other words, there could be an art critic quite legitimately, but I don't think there could actually be a photographic critic who didn't really know his photography. See, he'd have to know his photography to be a – be a critic of it, because he'd have to know what the devil to compare it to. And actually, there wouldn't be any auditing critic who couldn't audit. You couldn't criticize auditing if you couldn't audit. You'd have to know what could be done and what couldn't be done. I think anybody that's been over the jumps of the co-audit here recently, and so forth, he'd be quite a critic of auditing – not on a basis of my giving an examination and finding out what he knows about auditing but just on the basis of the trial and error of just the last two or three weeks. I give you that as a very broad test, man. I don't think there ever again will be such a test, never again. Probably won't be that much bypassed charge, you see? But that's a terrific test; wasn't given to them willingly or anything of that sort, it just occurred that way. What a fantastic test! Those people must really know how to audit, see? That's the test, be-cause under similar circumstances, you ARC break a pc on itsa – oh, you get the comparison; very simple. Ha-ha-ha, you see? Well, God, all you have to do is drop a toothpick in R6 and you ARC break one. That must be pretty smooth. Now, I don't think there's anybody – doubts in anybody's mind in R6 that they aren't going places and that the technology in running GPMs isn't doing some fantas-tic things, one way or the other, for pcs, and so forth. The result is being produced; the result is being produced smoothly. It'll of course be produced much more smoothly and much more rapidly, as a matter of fact, with the top of the bank being cut into, exactly correctly. But even with that, it's producing results, see? All right. Then that tells you that there must be an awful difference between a Level VI co-audit auditor and somebody who would ARC break a pc on itsa. But I'm willing to make you a bet that the auditor now in Level VI co-audit, asked for an opinion of auditing, would probably give you a very honest, offhand, very certain, very firm opinion – boppety, boppety, boppety, bop."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 20 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 262 HPCS You ask him something about, \"Well, is that person's auditing good or bad?\" or so forth. Or \"Was that a proper way to do it?\" and so forth. He'll give you quite an opinion, see? Boppety, boppety, bop. Wouldn't be any status connected with it, see? He'd just give you an honest opinion on the subject, you see? And you ask this person that can ARC break a pc on itsa for an opinion, he'd give you a couple of fixed data but he wouldn't be able to give you much of an honest opinion. Something else that would be different, something else that would be different: I'll just bet you that a person in the Level VI Co-audit at the present moment, you gave him some-thing to study and so forth, he could find out what was there and know what knowledge was there, without questioning whether or not it was good, bad or indifferent that he learn it or whether or not it was damaging for him to learn it or whether or not it was this or that or whether or not he knew all about it. You wouldn't run into much of that argument. But the person who would ARC break a person on itsa: Don't challenge that arrogance, man. He knows all there is to know about it; he has known all there is to know about it from the beginning; he will notice all – knows all there is that will ever be known about it; he knows all this perfectly, and he would be deeply insulted if you even inferred there was some-thing on the subject that he didn't know. Do you see? There would be this significant differ-ence. If you asked him at the same time if he was willing to learn about it, well, he'd hedge. Of course, he isn't. He isn't willing to learn about it. He's on the false premise that he knows all about it. Well, you want to ask him, \"Well, what are you there for? Why are you studying it then, if you know all about it?\" This might shake him up. But you only really have to shake up this point in that auditor. He isn't being bad, he's merely being arrogant. He lacks the humility of vast wisdom, and in its place he has the arro-gance of \"know it all,\" when he knows nothing. He doesn't even know what he doesn't know. And there's the gates of study; they're right there. That's the gate of study. That's the gate you got to crack, that's the one you got to kick down before you walk any road in toward any subject. And I don't care whether that subject is auditing or photography. I think you would hold – it would hold good uniformly and straight through, and so forth. So I've been over the jumps on a completely alien and different subject and I have found certain things held true and I compared them to the experiences I've had in trying to relay, interpret or teach Scientology, and so forth. And I've found that they held good. I've found out that they held good straight through. I can give you dozens of case histories and I can't really give you a lot of exceptions outside of this field, and I can even tell you – you say: \"Well, there's the case of the fellow who can't see, and doesn't know the language,\" and that sort of thing. I don't know, what's the matter with him that he can't see and doesn't know the language? He must be arrogant indeed! Very, very funny, but you'll find that that would hold good, too. If you don't believe it, talk to a field mouse some day. Talk to a field mouse about the ways of man. It might be a very entertaining conversation, if you could talk to him. And there, man, you would find arrogance. Electronics, nuclear physics – he's never heard of them but he knows all about them. [laughs]"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"STUDYING – INTRODUCTION 21 SHSBC-387 – 18.6.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 263 HPCS And there is the only place that we in Scientology are going to break down, if we break down at all. And there is about the only place where our technology will break down. It won't break down just on the basis of getting lost and drifting off and all that sort of thing. It won't get lost that way, because we'll take good pains that it doesn't. The only place it can get lost is an unwillingness to learn about it, and the only place that can get lost is just not know-ing it at all, and not knowing particularly that the reason why one can't learn is one thinks there is nothing there that he doesn't know, and he feels he knows it all, so he doesn't learn it. And that's a very silly fundamental, it's almost an idiotic fundamental. It's like \"The way to cross the river is cross the river,\" you know? I mean, it's one of those stupid data; but stupid data are the ones that have a habit of getting lost, and in the final analysis it's brightest to re-member. You will always have difficulty if you do not get down to the true fundamental and the true fundamental is always stupid and is always nonsensical and is not really worth knowing, which is why it remains un-as-ised till the end of time. So it itself stays in for the same rea-son: nobody bothers to know it. Trying to teach – trying to teach some savage how to tie his shoes will always be very upset, and be a very upsetting procedure, if he doesn't have any reason to wear shoes and doesn't know what they are, and so forth. So you go in it upstairs trying to teach him how to tie his shoes; you haven't taught him that if he wants to look civilized he should wear shoes. You see, you can always fail utterly in teaching somebody something by not cutting in at the lowest level of entrance and reality on the subject. There is always a first lesson to teach. And where you fail in instruction is you haven't isolated the first lesson to teach. There are numerous examples. I could give you tons of data on that subject, all by itself. Very inter-esting. But on the subject of learning itself, the first datum to teach is this little – and the first barrier to crack is this datum about \"Why are you studying it if you know all about it to begin with?\" This is your first datum, there is your fundamental, there's bedrock on the subject of learning a subject. And if you just remember that, you won't have any trouble trying to teach somebody. You realize he's having an awful time, it's taking him an awful long time to learn this; well, then, you'd better get right in at rock bottom on the subject of education, and the first thing you're going to find out is he knows all about it; and the next thing you've got to make him find out is, if he knows all about it, why is he studying it? And then somehow or another you've got to crack that door open. If you get that door cracked open, then he can learn anything from there on like a shot. Okay? I hope that will be of some help to you. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 265 HPCS STUDYING: DATA ASSIMILATION A lecture given on 9 July 1964 How are you today? Audience: Fine. What's the date? Audience: Nine July. Nine July. Nine July AD 14. All right. Now, what are you weakest in? Female voice: Auditing. Auditing. Yeah. Frankly, I haven't anything to talk to you about because you're all do-ing so well. It's I who am lagging, you see? But I've given you quite a few lectures about study and how to get through it and how to do this and how to do that and there's very little that can be added to what I have told you, but I better add that very little. In trying to – in trying to assimilate a piece of information, these are the points to watch and these are the points that trip you. Nomenclature. Nomenclature: what does a word mean? And that's what trips you basically, because then you cannot read a sentence with that word in it and know what the sentence says. So no-menclature is a major stumbling block in any study. Now, there are no vast, well worked-up glossaries in Scientology, but there is a glos-sary on Class VI material, and part of nomenclature is the recognition of what the definition is. It's one thing just to have the definition and it's another thing to have an idea of what the definition means. Now, you get yourself a thing like a GPM. All right, let's take that as nomenclature. \"GPM\" means Goals Problem Mass. Unless you combine such a thing with an observation and work on the clay table, and so forth, even the nomenclature is relatively meaningless. It is a thing, in other words. There is something called a GPM. It's not an idea. It is a GPM. Now, there are – there's one or two pcs around (not necessarily in the course) who are stumbling all over the place on a GPM, because they are in disagreement with that piece of nomenclature. And they are saying, \"Well, it doesn't have mass, it's just Ron's idea that it has mass, see, and it doesn't have mass. So therefore, of course, there is no such thing as a GPM.\""},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 2 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 266 HPCS Well now, trying to audit somebody on something of which there is no such thing as, is just a little bit difficult. Now, if you're running GPMs correctly, the mass simply expresses itself as heat and pressure. It does not express itself as a visio. You never see it unless you've made a mistake. When you've made a mistake you'll see it. You get an end word in the wrong situation and you can see this long parade of mass going out there. Well, there must be some-thing wrong with it to see the mass. So here is the oddity about this – the GPM. It's true it's a goal's matched items, one against the other, and very matched and held in midair, from which it gets problem, although that isn't too good a word because \"problem\" is an end word also and \"mass\" is also an end word. So, that nomenclature is adapted to the subject at a time when not all is known about it, so it can be described and worked with, don't you see? Now, we move on a little bit further and we find out there probably could have been better nomenclature, but by this time everybody knows this as a \"this\" and you would get a total catastrophe if you went and shifted the thing, and we can't go on referring to it as \"the thing.\" [laughter] So we go on calling it a GPM. Well now, of course, GPM means \"Goals Problem Mass,\" but that's not important. It's not important what the \"G\" means or the \"P\" means or the \"M\" means. This is a symbol that stands for something. Well, what is this thing So, if you're simply content to say, \"Well, a GPM is a thing and it has this form and construc-tion,\" and work with it on a clay table, all of a sudden you begin to understand what it is. Now, you're in a never-never land that has never been explored. There is no language to adequately represent any of these parts of the mind. If you used any terminology that is used by the psychiatrist, you don't know what you're getting into. You, frankly, have no clue what you're getting into because he's way out, man. And when he uses a word to describe something, there may be innuendoes in relationship to that word that would, if we then used it, would impart a totally incorrect zone or area and would make somebody think he knew what you were talking about, when you hadn't a – he hadn't a clue what you were talking about. So, you've crossed up your terminology with some other field that meant something else. Well, the reason you can't cross it up: it has a different purpose – that other field – it has a different target and it has an entirely different basis of operation. Their – well, their pur-pose is to make people quiet, to give you how wildly different this is. You want to get upset when you see a very quiet pc, man. His idea of treatment is based on the common denomina-tor, as far as he's concerned, that men are animals that rose spontaneously from a sea of am-monia and he wots not of and all thinking is done by the brain, and so forth. So, this is a different – completely different – zone or area. And it has not produced results, so we needn't pay any attention to it. We don't care how loudly somebody beats the drum and says, \"This is authority.\" Those people are the authorities who can get the results and those are the authorities. A painter is somebody who can paint a picture. An \"authority on painting\" has been Hobson-Jobsoned over into somebody who can criticize a picture. Well, anybody can criticize a picture, so I guess any child, then, is an authority on painting. So that the thing doesn't hold up when you take it from a critical viewpoint, you see?"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 3 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 267 HPCS No, an authority is the fellow who can do it. And the world in apathy and failure, driv-ing out in various lines and directions where they have been unable to do anything, have elected authorities on subjects that can't do them. So, therefore you would become all crossed up with fields that have failed. And that would enter, all by itself, an ingredient of failure into Scientology. So, we have to leave their technology alone. We have to leave their nomenclature strictly alone. We cannot talk about \"ids\" and \"egos.\" We can't really talk about the uncon-scious – which, by the way, is another end word in GPMs. [laughter] We can't discuss, in other words, what we are doing in terms of what they were doing, because they didn't do anything. And we would immediately come a cropper and we would be in very bad shape indeed. So we have to have technology named in a certain way as to convey a meaning. And we are the people who can get results in the field of the mind, so therefore we are the authorities. So therefore, we don't have to pay any attention to anybody else who sets himself up an authority, because any raving madman could go down here at the crossroads and say, \"I know all about grapes,\" see? \"I am the world's greatest authority on grapes.\" And any raving madman could do this, you see? He could just go on screaming, \"I am the world's greatest authority on grapes!\" Well, he could get a few other madmen who would come around and say, \"You're the world's greatest authority on grapes.\" Nobody ever would think of asking this madman, perhaps, the question, \"Have you ever eaten a grape, seen a grape, raised a grape, or done anything with a grape?\" and of course, if the answers were all \"No\" to those questions, then of course, it would be quite obvi-ous that he was a raving madman. And that's the psychiatrist, you see? He has never seen a mind, he never created one, he never changed one and he never brought about any results in this particular field. And the only thing he can brag about is being a bit destructive on the subject. And he's screaming that he's an authority, so therefore, somehow or another, you should borrow his nomenclature. Now, any one of you, sooner or later, is going to run into this down at some cross-roads, \"Why don't you use standard terminology?\" Well, the answer to it is, \"Whose standard terminology?\" It would have to be the ter-minology of a person who could produce a result, before it could be said to be even terminol-ogy. So man has had not much understanding of this particular field and has even gone into an inversion, where he has elected to have the nomenclature of the field standardized by peo-ple who know nothing about it. Now, that's a wildest inversion that anybody could ever dream of. Not only is there no terminology, but there is a great deal of false terminology. That termi-nology is false. And you start to lead down that line, you're going to be in trouble. Some-body's going to say to you sooner or later, \"Why don't you use standard nomenclature, why don't you do this and why don't you do that?\""},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 4 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 268 HPCS Well, my rebuttal on it, of course, is always very savage. When somebody starts in on me like this, I have no idea that they're trying to be helpful. I never make that mistake, so I just cut them up and serve them for dinner. And it's something on this particular – particular line, I would answer, \"Well, why haven't you developed anything that could be used?\" So Doctor Spinbin is standing there, \"Well, why don't you use standard terminology so that somebody can understand you?\" \"Why the hell haven't you invented any?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, why don't you know something about the mind? What do you stand around be-ing such a fake for?\" \"Well, really! I have a degree!\" \"I know that. That degree doesn't mean anything. Take one of these patients out of one of these rooms that you've got down here. Bring him out here and heal him. I want to see it!\" \"Well, you can't do anything like that.\" \"Therefore you're a fake. To hell with you!\" This is my idea of a polite conversation with one of those guys. [laughter] I hate fakes. And it's interesting that the only mud they can throw at us is that we're somehow fakes. See, \"The overt doth speak loudly in accusation.\" Shakespeare rewritten. [laughter] Now, therefore you can't help but have trouble with terminology – nomenclature. I've had trouble with it, don't think I haven't. How do I dream up some word that will describe something, that can be found, can be examined and does exist, that will not conflict with some other school of nomenclature, which has failed? How do I move into that perimeter? Oh, we could probably do a much better job, but part of the trouble is you. You accept certain lines and start using them in your common communication and then the last thing in the world that I could do is pull them away from you and say, \"Well, actually a better word is so-and-so, what little Scientology terminology you know, is now dead and nonexistent. We're going to substitute a brand-new terminology,\" and you would be upset. Right? So, terminology has to deal with this factor of evolution in use. We not only have evolved it and they've wobbled a little bit on their meanings occasionally, but then they get into use and they get fixed on the printed page. They get into bulletins and they get into your certificates, and so forth. Certify an HCA, well, he's supposed to know what a reactive mind is. Great. So the next day we're going to call it something else; we've immediately wiped out part of his education, haven't we? And we've made it hard for him to communicate with any-body who is trained later. If we want dissonance, why, we're going to get it in a very large cacophony if we go knocking apart the terminology we have developed. So we have to safe-guard the terminology we've developed. So therefore, when we learn more about the subject, you see, the word may become unreal, but we're still using it."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 5 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 269 HPCS So, the only thing we can do is actually elect those things which are the most impor-tant in the mind and keep that terminology as standard as possible. First try to evolve it as cleverly as possible, so that it won't conflict – first try to evolve it cleverly, so it won't conflict and bring about a misunderstanding in some older activity. And then we've got to carry it forward as a standardized item and then not go changing it all over the place just about the time everybody learns what it is. So, there's a certain necessity here to maintain a constant on nomenclature and terminology. And the word \"GPM\" will never, never be changed. It's in too much, too long, too often, don't you see? And even though \"Goals\" – end word; \"Problem\" – end word; \"Mass\" – end word. But it becomes just \"GPM.\" Well, it could become \"XYZ\" – it wouldn't matter much. Now, another responsibility is not develop too many of them, not to – not to go whole hog on the subject, not to try to name everything in sight some new peculiar name that no-body would ever get around the end of. The vocabulary of Scientology is probably about 472 major words, which is a small enough technical vocabulary. The medical vocabulary is some-thing on the order of 20 to 40 thousand, somewhere in that range – of very peculiar words that don't mean a thing. So, your task in learning \"Scientologese\" is relatively short, relatively brief compared to other technical fields. Now, you could complain about any technical field on the subject of its nomenclature and its nomenclature is just, very often, five times as silly, if you look at it that way, as Scien-tology is inapplicable. Some of these specialized fields are really marvelous. But if you have a bent for it, if you have a knack for it and are amused by these nomenclatures and terminol-ogies and special languages, you might say, you can have a lot of fun with some of these. I know I recently have been hobnobbing in the world of the circus. Well, fortunately I know a little of the circus terminology, but from an American circus viewpoint. And I don't know that this holds good in the English circus, you see? Well, you daren't use – I'll show you now the upper class of terminologies. They're all \"snob\": These languages are all snob languages, including Scientology, see? The boy that comes out of his HCA class, you see, and he throws off a couple of words; there's two or three who understand what he's talking about, and so forth, and they chin-chin together, see? They – it's like the lodge has just passed the password, see? Other people stand around with their jaws dropped and say they are listening to the upper elite. Well, to that de-gree they are, you see? Somebody has a superior understanding. But this is a signal system and actually, I couldn't take that away from the subject if I had to. If I didn't invent it, you would. Give you – in the circus world if you use carnival – the carnival, you see, is pretty downscale. To the circus, a carnival is almost beneath contempt. These things are quite defi-nitely fixed on the social strata. So you daren't use carnival terminology, of which I know of about four or five hundred words in carnivalese. You daren't use that in referring to the same identical objects and actions in the circus world and the circus world has maybe seven-eight hundred, a thousand words, you see, for these same things. It's – you've seen the same thing, there, you run into it in Low Dutch and High Dutch, in languages and so on."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 6 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 270 HPCS So you have to be very careful about some of these. But quite the reverse, you can tell a real organist – this is in the world of music. You can tell a great concert pianist by the awe with which he speaks the word \"Steinway\" and with which he speaks of his instrument and with which he speaks of his scores and so on. You can tell him. He acts the part of a snob in his longtailed coat and his flowing gestures and his poseurs with his hands over the keyboard and all that sort of thing. You know this boy for what he is, you see? He is a classical pianist, a classical concert pianist. Now, his terminology is quite staggering. If he and a symphony orchestra conductor were to start a conversation in your immediate vicinity you would be snowballed. You'd never know that many musical terms taken into or out of Italian and other – and German and that sort of thing, could exist. And it would, frankly, be over the head of most of the very men in the symphony orchestra. They would say, \"God, listen to that,\" you know? But the field of the organ does a complete reverse. Now an organ is an instrument which a piano is not. An organ is a percussion instrument, only to the degree that you turn on a percussion key and beyond that, you can get music out of it. But a piano, of course, is solely and only a percussion instrument. This is according to modern classification, see? They clas-sify it as a percussion instrument. Well, it's a pretty trick percussion instrument and you have to be very virtuosity on it, but an organ will also – you can throw a key on an organ and make it sound like a piano. You can also make it sound like a clavichord. You can make it sound like almost anything. And I've been hobnobbing recently with pro organists. Real pros, you know? Theater organists, circus organists, guys like this, you know? And I actually – my hair's been standing on end. These boys rank in their field just as high as the concert pianist ranks in his field – in fact a bit higher. Because you've got to grow – you've got to be like Vishnu, before you can play an organ, you know? Eight arms. And their terminology would absolutely bowl you over. There's two fields of terminology and when you get to be a real pro in the field of the organ, where you're an organ designer as well as performer, you know, real upscale, you actu-ally shift gears on terminology and the organ terminology with which you're familiar is the organ terminology which is referred to by the musician, the normal musician. But when you go up scale, you go into a new field of terminology. So there's two fields of terminology in the field of the organ. And the real pro and the real snob in that particular field does a volte-vis – complete volte-vis when he leaves the field of mere music into the field of playing an organ and design-ing them. Second we get into that field, we're in another pasture. It doesn't even look or smell the same thing. And that is so rarefied that when I first heard those boys talking, and so forth, I wotnotted anything they were saying, you know? It was just like listening to the Hottentots jabbering about the next feast of roebuck – I didn't have a clue. Well, I finally got hep to it, and did a bit of organ work and designing and that sort of thing and hobnobbing with these birds and I still don't have but a small edge on their termi-nology and they're always startling me. But I've gotten to a point now where I know what they're talking about, you know?"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 7 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 271 HPCS Well, for instance, the organist at Saint Paul's Cathedral who probably would be – probably the top-top-top amongst mere organists, you see, in England, refers to the \"pedal-board,\" see, those are that board that you walk on, you know? Well, he calls that a \"pedal-board.\" When you get into the real snobs that is no longer a pedal-board – that's \"firewood.\" [laughter] Now, the top organist at Saint Paul's undoubtedly refers to \"notes\" and \"pipes\" and \"footages\" and the real snob calls them \"noises.\" They're \"noises,\" and he says this with a complete – complete straight face. So, the first time I heard this I thought they were gagging, you see? And every time I've heard one of these things I've made the repeated mistake – which I am now beginning to recover from doing – of laughing like mad, you see, [laughter] thus displaying my great ignorance of the whole subject. I've gotten so I can chatter back and forth on it now. What the hell was it that I heard the other evening? I think it was a \"Blackpool snarl.\" \"This organ was capable of a – was capable of a good, solid 'Blackpool snarl.'\" I think I've probably got the word \"snarl\" wrong, but it was – it was capable of making a \"terrible, clash-ing dissonance which would reverberate,\" see, and that was the way it was described, see? You catch up with it after a while. I'm getting there though. I'm getting there, I'm getting there. I'm getting up to a point where I've now developed something that I don't think they've thought of yet with regard to firewood. And I can play a piece on firewood that they haven't thought could be played on firewood, so I'm practicing this very hard and the next time I'm going to get even – I'm going to throw them. [laughs] But the point is, as you enter into the inner sanctum of any profession, you quite nor-mally leave the purely snob language and get into a \"slanguage.\" Lord knows what a medical doctor calls tonsils while he is dining with other medical doctors, see? But he probably calls them something else. His terminology shifts, then, from the very formal with enormous, forced formality that almost has worship mixed up with it, you see, and shifts, then, as his familiarity increases with his subject into something that sounds more like slang. And we have not bothered, then, to go through the country of pomposity to reach the world of slang; we've just short-circuited the whole thing. This is true what I tell you about nomenclature; as nomenclature really gets up amongst the knowing, it is never serious. It is a very unserious subject. The things which great electronic engineers that can whip you out a rocket for the moon – wiring circuit or connection – probably what they call it is not what is taught in college, you see? They've got this stuff and it's a rattledybang, it's almost jive talk-ing moved upstairs into the profession, you know? It's pretty wild. Well, we've taken a straight road. Since none existed, we haven't really developed a secondary language. We're in our secondary language. So that is another way that the thing has been narrowed down. We could develop a highly pompous, formal nomenclature; a vo-cabulary, perhaps, of two or three thousand words, and expect you all to learn it verbatim and be able to discuss it with great solemnity – only to have you eventually evolve a much less lengthy vocabulary which is in the field of slang. We've taken the step at one jump. So, our"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 8 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 272 HPCS language does not sound dignified, see? Our nomenclature is not pompous since there was no reason to enter this other extraneous step into it. Now, anybody then who is talking to you about not using proper psychoanalytic no-menclature probably himself is the veriest tyro in the field of psychoanalysis, see? He – he's just a – well, if he graduated well and kept his nose clean he'd become a neophyte, you know, or he wouldn't be expressing this reverence for nomenclature, because it's symptomatic of the stage where you are simply memorizing without knowing. After a boy gets to know some-thing, and so forth, he normally shortens his nomenclature quite markedly and rapidly. And of course, what an organist has to know who is up in the field of engineering and design, and so forth – this circus organist, Kit Francis, for instance, hasn't any \"stop.\" Well, actually the stops on his organ do not agree, I'm sure, with what it says on the stops and he's pulled out most of the stops – he's thrown them away. When he had the organ rebuilt, he threw them away. What he did was just get the noise combinations from the generators and he put a stop on each variable noise combination of the generators, knowing how they hooked up and he knows that if he throws bing-bing – and why, he's got then these two noises come out of the generator. They will combine and they'll sound in a certain way. He's setting it up by electronic sound; electronic combinations of sound. So he's even done away with all of the izzards and piccolos and diapasons and nothing says anything, you know? There it is. It's just... As a matter of fact, the other day I saw him throw a 64-foot pipe together out of an upper scale. There weren't any even 32-foot pipes in the thing, but he just got a couple of things that would then sound like they built down and he threw those in. And the next thing you know, why, he had Saint Paul's Cathedral going at a very mad rate, but that organ doesn't happen to have any such stops. So, he doesn't even refer to noises by their traditional names anymore, see? In other words, when a guy gets to know his business he generally throws away – when he really knows his business – he throws away the nomenclature he doesn't need. He gives it the yo heave and he quite commonly, amongst his brethren who are in the know and part of a lodge, develops a short-circuited slang-type nomenclature to describe what he is. Well, knowing some of these things, and so forth, I've tried very hard to reduce the nomenclature of Scientology as far as possible and keep it only in the realm of slang where it would have evolved to anyhow. And that would save you a lot of trouble. But if you went back over the years and found the name of everything that had been named, you would probably arrive with a much larger vocabulary than 472. But a lot of those things have been given the yo heave. But a lot of old-time auditors would still know what they were. You talk about a DEDEX – most any Johnny-come-lately would look at you with his eyes \"What's that?\" you know? Well, actually it was a DEDEX, that's what it was. Now, the dependence of knowledge upon nomenclature is extraordinary, and as a mat-ter of fact, almost never appreciated by teachers or students. They are trying to talk and use a language they don't know. And this can get so bad that they think the subject is incomprehen-sible or that they are incapable of understanding it, when as a matter of fact this is not what is wrong at all. It's just that they haven't grasped the meaning of some of these symbols that are"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 9 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 273 HPCS being used to designate. And they haven't got an instantaneous grasp of these meanings. They've got a \"fumble grasp\" of them. That is, if they thought for a while they might possibly be able to remember what an engram is, see? Now that's the grasp of it. So they read a sentence and it says, \"Of course, there may be an engram in the middle of the GPM.\" That's not necessarily true, but it's certainly true of implant GPM. And they have to think, \"There might be an engram – an engram – an engram... I don't quite – know quite what that means, so I'll just learn this much of it. There might be something in the mid-dle of a GPM.\" And they go on into the next paragraph and this has made an impression on them, that there's something they don't know about a GPM and that's what carries on into the next paragraph. And as they go on studying past these points of uncomprehended nomenclature, they begin to stack up an opinion that they \"Don't know about it.\" And it isn't \"it\" that they don't know about. To get a persistent thing, you see, you'd have to have a lie, and the lie is that it isn't the subject they are having trouble with, it is simply the nomenclature they are having trouble with. They don't know about the nomenclature so they, however, wind up with an opinion that they don't know the subject or that there is something very incomprehensible about this subject. No, it isn't the subject at all, they just don't know their nomenclature. Now, it may start back someplace in HCA, see, or HPA class and one day, why, somebody jumped up and he said, \"Well, that's a lock,\" and the individual... you know, he said, \"Well, you see, that's not important, because it's just a lock, you see?\" And the person says, \"Just a lock – a – lock-lock-lock – what's a lock?\" And then he was interrupted before he could think the thought through and remember what a lock was. So this, in actual fact, stays there as a little basic incomprehension of nomenclature and that'll hang up on the track and he will develop an automatic comm lag around this word \"lock.\" He'll get up to a point where he's reading a sentence here at Saint Hill and it says, \"You want to check this out, because it might be just a lock.\" And again that hunted feeling comes over him, you see, and now he thinks he doesn't know much about checkouts because he will misassign, the other being out of sight. So, his opinion now is that he doesn't know much about checkouts. No, he didn't know a word in a sentence discussing checkouts. You see how important nomenclature is? But a comprehension of the nomenclature which is used is primary to the study of anything. Now, for instance, I'm studying a parallel course to get insights into study of Scientol-ogy. And a very, very smart thing – an extremely smart thing to do – is to take a page of ma-terial and look over it for words you don't know – words that don't instantly react to you. Circle each one of those words or make a list of each one of those words and look up and study their definitions or ask people and get definitions for them. Find out exactly what those words mean. Don't tackle the subject of the page. Just tackle the nomenclature of the page. Get that nomenclature slick as a whistle, tackle the subject, you'll find out the subject was very easy. All the thing was trying to tell you is that if you went ahead and ran a service facsimile which didn't give TA action on exploration, why, the pc would get loused up be-cause you were running without TA action. And this is all this whole thing is devoted to."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 10 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 274 HPCS But one runs across this thing: \"Service facsimile – ohhh! What's that?\" Another word: \"Ohhh! What's that?\" you see, and \"What's that?\" and \"What's that?\" Well, if you want to put yourself in a total mystery, go ahead and study pages you don't know the words on. Then you can put yourself into a gorgeous mystery. Now, this language is so common to your instructors, it's so common to people around here and their \"snob action\" – which we have – don't doubt about that, see, and will continue to have, because it is an index of status and competence, will cause them to explain these things to a student with a bit of a sneer. And they're liable to cure you of asking, \"What is a service facsimile?\" because you will hear in the answer that comes back to you at least the tone for, \"Well, you idiot! Why don't you look it up in your bulletin, you know? Fancy anybody not knowing that!\" see? This is sort of reflected in the atmosphere you get back when you ask these things. And that, again, makes you feel stupid for not knowing. Well, actually nothing can be done to minimize this latter. Why, I could say, \"Always answer a student's questions politely,\" and you'd probably only build up a covert hostility. [laughter] They'd answer the questions politely and flunk all tests for 24 hours, you see. Something wild is liable to go awry when you start to put the brakes on some natural action. So, the only point I'm making here is: Don't let yourself be put off because somebody thinks you're stupid because you don't know it. You're not stupid because you don't know it, you're simply uninformed. Well, if you're uninformed, don't get so status happy of thinking that you must appear bright in order to be thought well of, when it has nothing to do with it. You're here to learn and anybody is studying anything, is studying it, I suppose, to learn it, not to acquire – he may acquire status through having learned it, but he doesn't acquire status by pretending he knows it when he doesn't. As a matter of fact he acquires himself quite a headache. So, the point is, in spite of any rebuff that you get, or of difficulty digging into some book to find out what it means, you actually put yourself in a soup at once, the moment that you leave one word in a sentence behind you, you do not know the meaning of. One unknown piece of nomenclature left behind you can absolutely ruin your comprehension of the whole thing you're studying. Now, if you want to speed up your grasp of the situation, apparently do it the slow way. This obviously is a slow way to do it, isn't it? But it's not the slow way to do it because it snowballs. You'll get faster and faster and faster, whereas if you don't do it this way you will get slower and slower and slower. So, never leave a word behind you in a study that you don't know the meaning of. And when you hear me use a word in a lecture – and I try to minimize nomenclature, actually, in lectures – when you hear me use a word in a lecture that you don't know the meaning of, for God's sakes, write it down in your notes and right after the lecture find out what it is. \"What is that word?\" see? It's something that has passed you by. Well, it's that which you don't understand, not the mind, not Scientology, not the theo-ries and practice of Scientology. The stumbling block, first and foremost, is simply nomencla-ture."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 11 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 275 HPCS Now, nomenclature will be there regardless of any reform undertaken, because, in the first place, we are examining things which are not hitherto known. So they have to have a name. Now somebody uninformed may try to tell you that some of these things were known but that's merely his misinformation talking. He doesn't know what you were talking about so he thinks it was previously known. He will try, for instance, to compare an \"id\" and a \"thetan,\" see? And he says, \"Well, Freud described all that. He said, 'id,' and an id was – something, and...\" Well, probably a person saying this to you really doesn't know what Freud said was an \"id,\" see? His nomenclature failure is prior to his misunderstanding where you are, see? So, if you want to wind yourself up in a ball and become very confused and get a lot of slow passes and go slower and slower and slower and slower, just start leaving words behind you you don't know what they are. You get halfway down the page, all of a sudden there's a word you've never seen before. Just say, \"Well, I'll catch that later,\" and go on. Why don't you just say, \"Well, I'll cut my throat right now and add several weeks onto my course progress?\" Because that's just what that'll do. You cannot help but wind up at the end of that page. Now, the next thing is the subject matter itself, arrangement and understanding of Now, this is your second one. Now, it's all right to name something and get a definition for something, but what is being named? And if you were very, very clever, you would worry it and worry it and snarl at it and walk around the circles of any piece of subject matter; now we're talking about the – a thing, see? We're talking about – we're not talking about the name of the thing, we're talking about the thing. You'd walk around any one of those pieces of sub-ject matter until you had a good comprehension of what that was all about. \"What the devil are we talking about?\" see? I'll give you an idea: You say, \"Well, a person has a bad opinion of another person be-cause they have an overt against that person.\" All right, there is a thing, you see? That is the – a mechanism that surrounds the overt-motivator sequence. That's one of the phenomena. Joe is mad at Bill and if you search a little bit, you'll find out he's mad at Bill because he's done something to Bill. Joe has done something to Bill. Now this is contrary to the explanation everybody makes in life, so it is very easily read this way, see? Because life is that way you can get this thing – scoong! – wrong way to, in your skull, see? So \"'Joe is mad at Bill, because Bill has done something to Joe.' Yes, I understand that.\" Well, you missed the whole point. Thereafter, if you've done that, you will really never then understand how to pull an overt or why you must do so. See, that has just gone up in smoke, see? Very important mechanism! \"Joe is mad at Bill because Joe has done something to Bill.\" All right, that is the thing. Now, several things can get in the road of the acceptance of this thing and first and foremost is, it isn't usual or ordinarily thought of this way and that gets in your road by misin-terpretation. You think you've read something you haven't read, see? Because it's so usual for it to be the other way you think you've read it the other way. Or it is so widely accepted the other way that it is simply unbelievable. So there's the next thing that gets in your road, is the unbelievability of it. You say, \"Well, that couldn't possibly be true.\" Now, for heaven's sakes, make sure when you come to"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 12 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 276 HPCS the unbelievability of something that you know what you're unbelieving. Now, that's impor-tant – that's important. Let's know what we're unbelieving. Now, to know what we're unbelieving we have to take the first step again – the no-menclature, you see? Did I get the word right? Now, the thing, the mechanism – phenomenon here, have I got that right? And you'll find in about ninety percent of the cases that a reexami-nation at this \"unbelieve\" step – you are unbelieving the wrong thing. You weren't unbeliev-ing what was there. You were unbelieving something else, see? So, when you run into a total \"gawp,\" see – you know, you say, \"That couldn't be, you know? Wha-wha? I – that – that couldn't be. I – no, that couldn't be!\" see? And instead of go-ing out and jumping in the lake or something like this or taking cyanide, the thing to do is to check over nomenclature and the description of the thing itself. Now, if you check those two over, you'll find out you probably had something in crosswise and that this \"unbelievable\" was not unbelievable at all but is quite – quite easily seen. That's about ninety percent of the time. The other ten percent of the time you just can't see how that works that way. Go back and check your nomenclature, check what the thing was that you're not believing, and so forth. Get down to this other thing, you still can't see how it's that way – set yourself up some examples of how it's not that way and how it is that way. Now, this is the – really the first place where you really have to apply it to you and life, where it becomes an abs... a complete must. You must apply it to you, you must apply it to life. \"Does this thing exist in life or doesn't it? Has it existed in my life or has it existed in anybody else's life that I know of? Is there any incident here that demonstrates this phenom-ena?\" And you'll start looking at it and you'll find out that the reason it wouldn't go that way is normally a button got in its road or something like that. You know, you didn't dare believe that it was this way; something like that – just an examination of it, trying to, \"How does it apply to me? How does it apply to life? Has it ever applied to life? Did anybody ever see this thing?\", you see, and \"Do I know of any incident or anything of the sort which would exem-plify this thing?\" Why, the other ten percent that I've been talking about here, that will tend to evaporate, too and you'll say, \"Ah, yes, now we got it.\" Now, this procedure followed actually gives you a terribly firm grip on what you know. And careful study is not necessarily either thorough or brilliant or wise or anything else. It's merely careful. And if you work right along at it on the subject of being careful with it and what you're careful about is – as you're going down the page pocketa-pocketa-pocketa, you all of a sudden see this word \"boojum\" see? \"What the hell is that?\" Now, I'll show you how you can be stupid: that's to go on. Read the next word to it in the hopes that somehow or other the explanation will all drop out into your lap. Gloss over that word, you've done yourself in. \"What's this word 'boojum'?\" Boy, you better find out right now. You might glance at the rest of the sentence: \"Does there – a parenthetical descrip-tion what 'boojum' is in it as you sometimes – occur? Or a – there's nothing there.

And then you'll think you're mystified about the subject, you're mystified about anything – it's tracing back to this time you read this paragraph and you didn't understand a word in it so, of course, then it didn't communicate. By not understanding the word you inhibit any communication. You've inhibited communication between what you're studying and yourself You've also inhibited your com-munication between yourself and other auditors and you also, oddly enough, have inhibited your communication with yourself and a pc, because this is something in a pc that you will not thereafter recognize because you don't know what it is. Now, following down some sort of a – of a routine like this in study, you'll find out that you can study. It's all right for somebody to come around and say, \"Well, you can't study and you just don't apply yourself,\" and that sort of thing and they're – they've done this to people in school – they've done it to me; they used to do it to me in school; they used to say, \"You don't know how to study.\" And I used to say, \"Gee, that's very interesting, you – I don't know how to study,\" and I accepted this – that I didn't know how to study.

It's just that crude a gag. They say, \"You don't know how to study.\" Well, what pretentious people! They don't know how to study either, see? There is no – there's no subject called \"study.\" If there was a subject called \"study,\" they'd start teaching it to you in kindergarten. They would certainly start teaching it to you before you were into the – your high schools and that sort of thing. They'd say, \"This is how to study.\" I've run across various systems, but they're not in the formal textbooks. I've seen them in – remember the Pete Smith specialties from way back when that used to show on the screen, and so forth, gag, one-reel comedies and so forth? Well, I've seen methods of remem-bering things, and methods of knowing things, and so forth, come up in that form. But I've never seen it on a textbook basis. I myself developed a method – a (quote) \"a method of study\" in defense and I remem-ber vividly applying this in the field of history; it's just not going onto the next paragraph unless I could shut my eyes and rattle off the last paragraph, see? It didn't increase my knowl-edge of history. I actually get along better just by reading a history textbook. At the end of the line when I finish off the history textbook and somebody asks me for dates, I look in the book. I find that is the best method by which to do this."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 14 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 278 HPCS The only other method of study that I ever developed for myself in school might be of some interest and that was just to get every book on the subject I could get hold of and read all of them and not try to concentrate on any of them, you see? I think one of the most stellar grades I ever got and bragged about all over the place, and so forth, and called upon to give lectures on every hand, made me feel a little guilty. I was taking American history and I simply got hold of every textbook I could find on the sub-ject of American history and read them all, including Woodrow Wilson's five-volume history of the United States, you see? That's one of those things that you put on a bookshelf to hold it down in case of an earthquake. [laughter] And I read all these textbooks, but I don't think I ever told the professor that because I was allergic to its very, very bad prose, that I had never read that class's textbook. I'd never read the class's textbook. I'd read all the other textbooks I could lay my hands on, but I could-n't stand its prose. Its prose was horrible, and I – it was sort of socialistically weirdly put to-gether and it was pedantic in the extreme. It wasn't that it was full of difficult words. As a matter of fact the fellow was sort of underplaying – the places where he should have used a good, big, pompous word, you know, why, he'd put some offbeat word, and so forth. He didn't know how to write, see, and so I did-n't read the school's textbook, but I read all the other textbooks and I got – oh, I don't know – A pluses and gave lectures on history for them and got gold stars and silver cups and all this sort of thing as being a terrific student. Well, actually it was just to the degree that I just cov-ered everything in sight. And I find out that's fairly reliable as a method – fairly reliable when there isn't any training available, you know, like an American school. When there's absolutely no training available, why, what you want to do is just get ahold of every book on the subject in sight and then just read them all from cover to cover, see, making very sure – I would now and do and always did – that you didn't cross over words you didn't know. Get yourself a great big dictionary and get yourself some kind of an anthol-ogy or something that went along with it and look up a word you didn't know and find out what that was related to and then get that word real good and then go sailing on your way. It wouldn't matter if you read a book in five hours, you see. It wouldn't matter how fast you read the book or didn't read the book. That's in absence of formal knowable training on any subject. That's a very good method – excellent method as a matter of fact because you wind up at the end of the thing – you've seen this word so often, you've looked it up so often, you eventually know what it is, you know? You say, \"There again is the 'Rembrandt Profile.' Now, what the hell does it mean, a 'Rembrandt Profile'? Well, a 'Rembrandt Profile' is actually – well, I guess it must have been something painted by Rembrandt, but they must mean something here. I'll turn back over here – I saw a mention of it over here. Here's a description of the thing: Yeah, well, so on and so on and so on and so... Ohh, oh I get it! It's the main light is not showing on the front of the face. Oh, good. Yeah, it's just the fill shows on the thing. Ahh, that's good, yeah. I got that now. All right.\" Sail along the line, and so forth, and finally, why, forgot all about that, you see, but chapters later we run into a \"Rembrandt Profile,\" see? \"A what? Oh, something about a fill."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 15 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 279 HPCS Yes. Well, I know where I can find it. I'll go back – ah, yes, yes. Main light back of the per-son, fill in the front of the person. Yeah. Main – face mainly in shadow. Yeah, I got it. Noth-ing to it.\" All right, running down the line chapters later, in another textbook on the subject. \"'When shooting a Rembrandt Profile so on, so on, so on, so on...'Oh, that's how you do! You add a spotlight to it also. Okay.\" You see, the word no longer operated as an impasse to your study. Looking up words and meanings and so forth, is sort of the erosive course of the river and it eventually grinds away on the banks until it has a good, strong flowing stream, you see? Actually, I don't think there are bright students and dull students. I don't think this at all. I don't think so, because I've never seen any real coordination between knowledge of the subject and the brightness and dullness of a student. But there is a careful student and a care-less student. Now, a student can be very fast and still be very careful. It hasn't even too much to do with speed. But he knows when he's whipped. That's about the only thing he knows. He's reading down this paragraph and all of a sudden he wakes up to the fact he hasn't the foggiest clue what the devil he's talking about – what he's reading about so he goes back and finds out where he got tangled up. Ah, well, here was a word and here was a phenomenon he didn't know anything about. Now, if he's a careful student he puts it all away until he finds out what that word and what that phenomena is and exactly what that is and he gets that straight. He may cruise around in the thing just a little bit further to find out if it's defined in that particular publica-tion, see? But he's looking for the definition – he's not any longer doing it. Now, there's a careful student. And his brightness on the subject is dependent upon the degree he does this. It isn't dependent on any native talent or anything else. It isn't even de-pendent on his buttons. And in Scientology, because of the tremendous amount of breadth of study we are do-ing and because we are studying what we study with, why then, it's necessary to have some command of the subject of study. It becomes absolutely imperative in our field to know some-thing about how to study and it's no longer walking up to some poor luckless student and say-ing, \"Well, the trouble with you is, you don't know how to study,\" then walking off, you see? Or saying about some other student, \"Well, he's just stupid. That's all, you see? That explains it all, see?\" Frankly, it doesn't explain a doggone thing. We've talked – we hear about the lightning-quick student. We hear about the very, very fast, fast, fast student and we hear about the very, very, very, very slow student. And we hear about the grind and we hear about the brilliant student and honest, those classifications have no more validity than the field of psychiatry. Why? Because they have never produced uniform fast study. They're apparently merely excuses and justifications of something. They're an effort to classify on something nobody's cracked. So, why should we talk about dull students and slow students and brilliant students, and so forth? There are certain phenomena in study which are worth commenting upon and one of those is the oddball who can memorize almost at a glance and who can go back and spit out"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 16 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 280 HPCS the memorized words. I've known Chinese students that got anybody whipped I ever – in the Anglo-Saxon world or in the Western world – anything whipped on this line. I know Chinese students who could go ahead and give you pages of mathematical formulas and things of this character and descriptions of it, and so forth. About the wildest thing you ever listened to and they'd come to school the next morning with their lessons and ka-wow! You ask them, \"All right, now let's go into the slope formula.\" \"Well, the slope formula is so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so kow-kow, pow-pow, kow-wow.\" It's all there, see? You say, \"Wow!\" Don't say instantly, \"Well, then this is the very man we need to build the dam,\" because building dams has very little to do with study of that particular kind or character. We don't even know if he could solve the problems on the page, but he sure could remember them. Now, that's a test mainly of memory. Now, if you want to be sure of this person, in examining this person you'll find imme-diately what's going wrong here. Immediately you'll find what's going wrong. There's a way of examining this person that would only be fair to the instructor and to the student alike. Take any oddball word that occurred in the first paragraph you have just got back so glibbishly and ask for a definition of that word (the definition is not given on the subject mat-ter which the person is doing). And if you want to see a hunted, horrified look come into any-body's face – it's the perfect memory repeat, see? And you've thrown an ax into it because you've asked for something which isn't memory. You've asked for the definition of a certain word. And if this person – now look at this – if this person could give you this whole paragraph and tell you all about it but couldn't define a word in it, that person must be in total mystery about that. So the missing ingredient is understanding. And then naturally the missing ingredient, application, will show up soon afterwards. Do you see how that would work? In other words, this very, very fast study falls down exactly as the slow study would fall down. In other words, everybody caves in on this same point uniformly. Now, if some-body comes up and he takes this same thing and he stumbles all over the place and he tries to get it out and he spits it out, and so forth, the examiner could ask him, too, the same word. \"What's the definition of that word?\" And he'd say, \"...Well, I don't know.\" Puts him in the same boat as the fast study, doesn't it? So, the direction and end purpose of study is understanding and, of course, you – with an unknown word in the middle of it, and an unknown phenomenon in the middle of it – you're not going to get understanding at all. You're going to get disbelief, noncomprehension. You're going to get mystery. You're going to get, of course, also nonapplication. Now, if we examine study a little bit further, the main complaint about study is that it does not immediately and at once result in good, clean, clear application. This is one of the primary scolds about modern education – primary criticisms – is if you educate an engineer – or it was – you educate an engineer and you don't dare send him out to build a bridge, see?"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 17 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 281 HPCS Well, that's in the field of application or practice of application. But if this man can't go out and build a bridge after he's been taught to build a bridge, the familiarity ingredient, of course, is missing. But even so, if somebody had borne down on him like mad for the definition of every word that he was stumbling across in the direction of bridge building, he should be able to go out and unroll his sextant and transit and get to work. He should; he should. He's now got the horrible task of acquiring his familiarity, but he wouldn't be doing it across the barrier of a misunderstanding of his terminology and a misunderstanding of his tools and he theoretically could do it. I found myself doing it the other day. I just had a textbook command of a certain prob-lem on this line – parallel line – I'm studying. I just had a textbook command of the thing; nothing but and I saw it, saw it happened and applied the textbook and it resolved, bang! And I had about something on the order of maybe two or three seconds to do the whole thing. Be-cause something was happening and I had to straighten it out fast, see? Just textbook. It worked – it worked perfectly. So therefore, you could and should be able to take a purely textbook thing – if it was a valid textbook and a valid subject – and apply it directly without familiarity. Now, think of what a whiz you would be, however, if you also had the familiarity at the same time. And that's why we study auditing while auditing, see? But if this other ingredient of careful study is missing, the nomenclature is missing, you can't make the boat. It just won't make the boat. I studied – been studying this parallel subject very hard because it is a bearcat on the subject of terminology, too. It's terminology that you'd think anybody that had been around photography very long would be very familiar with. He couldn't help but be familiar with it – oh, no, no, no, no. Not when you're studying text after text after text after text after text! Well, if you were taking some little course that didn't have much to do with the price of fish, that didn't intend to make a pro out of you along any line and \"This is, see, this is how you develop pictures\" – the Eastman book for the home beginner, you know? I've read those by the ton. No, that hasn't got anything to do with it. It says, \"Hammer, pound, hit 'em with the grape, you know – no holds barred. Now we charge with the bayonets. You take the me-tabisulphite and pour it into the yattapin,\" and you say, \"You take the what?\" you know. And then you're busy in the very next lesson studying a completely disrelated field of the same subject, \"Make sure that you adjust the headscreen.\" \"The what? Where the hell did this come from? I've never met it before around here anyplace. A headscreen, a headscreen. Now, what is a headscreen?\" Scatter, scatter, flutter, flutter, look in the dictionary, and so forth. \"What do you know? It isn't in the dictionary. It's so common they don't have to define it. But I don't know it. No worry now about how stupid this makes me, you see? Flutter, flutter, bing-bang.

Obvious, isn't it? Headscreen! Who would have dreamed it, man?\" A nonsensical but very usual piece of equipment. The guy writing the textbook, being so familiar with his subject, would make the same statement that you would make, you see? You say, \"Well, you set your E-Meter down on the table first, of course.\" You have said it almost sarcastically, you see? \"Well, you set your E-Meter down on the table, of course, before you start auditing.\" If you want to be really sarcas-tic, you'd make such a remark, you see? This guy, this bloke, this expert on portraits to end all experts on portraits says, \"Well, of course, you adjust the headscreen to hold back that. That's the way you subdue the light.\" He just says this parenthetically, you see? \"This is how you make less prominent, undesirable features on a subject in portraiture. You hold back the light on them.\" \"What do you hold back the light with?\" Get the same answer out of the textbook. \"Oh, don't be an ass.\" \"Yeah, but what do you hold back the light with, you know?\" \"You hold it back with a headscreen, of course, you idiot!\" \"What's a headscreen? What is a headscreen? What is this thing? \"Put it over the piece... Put it over the lens of the camera so it doesn't show the fellow's head?\" So, this has been – it's been very amusing, because I can look at a subject, you see, from an oblique – look at the same study problems that you run into. And I've been analyzing these problems and putting them together. What I've been talking to you about and what I've talked to you about in recent things has been the views I've had on this as worked out and as I know they apply in our own field. And I think you've been making some progress as a result. But there are just these points about study and you expected there would be probably a lot more complex points about study, but there are no more complex points about study than I have just given you. Now, of course, if you didn't read or write English there would be a further study on nomenclature. But remember it would just be a further study on nomenclature. So, it even falls into that particular field. Now, the person who can't talk at all, or let us say, an animal trying to arrive at this particular line – he's totally out of communication, he hasn't got the vocal chords, he can't be educated in the first place. You say, \"Well, that's a totally lost field.\" Well, I'm – I'm not completely willing to lose that field utterly because I've already raised animals in tone to a remarkable degree and I've already met dogs that could talk, see? Yeah, I met a dog one time – he used to say \"Hungry\" every time he wanted chow. He managed it somehow. He used some Hollywood scheme of how you breathe from the dia-phragm, you know? But he could say it clear as could be – that he was hungry. Startled peo-ple almost to death because they'd say, \"Well, that's funny. The dog probably makes a grunt, you know? And this mistress that's taught him and so forth is just being too too for words.\" And then they'd hear this dog and this dog would say \"Hungry\" and they'd go \"Ahhhh!\" And I was talking to an elephant the other day that wanted his picture taken, as I told you and I've"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"STUDYING – DATA ASSIMILATION 19 SHSBC-391 – 9.7.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 283 HPCS run into animals that know their cues much better than their trainers and have to pull the trainer through the act somehow and make him look good. [laughter] So I don't know what the barriers to communication are. I have a greater insight into the fifth dynamic lately than I have had before and I have found that they're – you can go a lot deeper into the fifth dynamic. In fact, I've pretty well got an idea of what GPMs, and so forth, certain animals and insects and so forth get stuck in. And just about how they go into that particular zone or area and how they go out the bottom. I've had a little – quite a little bit more insight into this. But anyway, that being as it may, the point is that the communication of the nomencla-ture of the language – of the ability to talk or communicate – would be the first barrier, don't you see? And so it remains into – the fellow who does know English, who can read, who sits there and so forth – it's still his first barrier. But, of course, he is so high on this level of com-munication he is contemptuous of these little inabilities to communicate and so neglects them. And neglecting them, then of course, he comes an awful cropper when he gets into the field of study. And that is about the first place where he really falls down. There are many ways you could make a person fail in studying, but mostly it would be in denying them an insight into the necessity of understanding the communication symbols used. That would be a big failure in delivering the field of study. We never published a dictionary as such. There are several manuscripts of dictionaries around but they unfortunately all depend on my re-editing from beginning to end and they just go fantastic quantities of words and it is just those extra twelve hours on top of the forty-eight in the twenty-four – to get such a job completed. It's a very rough rough beef. And I particu-larly would not want to attempt the job until I felt it was pretty wrapped up, so it's just about now it would be wrapped up. But I did have definitions of the various words at Level VI, and so forth, codified which I'm sure has been issued and – so that you could look those things up and know what the score was on that. But despite the lack of a glossy dictionary, you nevertheless can look up these words and they are known and people all over the place know what they are here, and there really isn't much excuse going to one. So it takes you a half an hour to learn what this word is. Boy, that's a half an hour that won't get multiplied and added on to the end of your course, when you're busy floundering around wondering why you just can't seem to get to first base on that particular quarter. Well, I hope what I've told you today will be of some use to you.

Very memorable day. Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, August the 4th, AD 14. All right. You seem to have hit a few records here lately, in your examination grades. Your examination grades on lectures and so forth, are coming up, up, up, up and I'm very proud of you with this. Thank you very much. Aside from your own brightness on the subject, some of this is attributable to the fact that I've been talking about and teaching you something about study, and I think you have learned quite a bit about study in the last many weeks; and that is the subject of this lecture. I want to give you, in this lecture before it gets cold, a brief summary – no matter how rough and ragged and no matter how well worked out later – of the things I have learned about study. And I break my record by lecturing from a note. But I don't want this to go too far before I make it a matter of lecture and record because I found out it was already getting dim in me skull. And I keep very little information in my skull lately, and that I do put in sometimes tends to get dim because it gets lost. So I didn't want that to happen and I want to give you this information about study. Now, there's not been a technology of study or a technology of education. Now, that sounds like a very far-fetched, fantastic statement, but it's true – it's true. There was a school technology, and – sort of – but it didn't have too much to do with education. You see, there was the technology of how you go to school and how you get taught in school and how you teach children to go to school and how you go through grades and how you get examined and how you go through the college and so forth. There was an awful lot of this school technol-ogy. And you should differentiate between a school technology and an educational technol-ogy – it's the first thing I'd ask you to do – because education very seldom, in its final touches, has anything to do with a school. The engineer who goes out reports to the job and he's been beautifully taught along various ways on how to do the calculus curve of mensuration on how much gravel there is in an irregular pile. And by getting the calculus curve of several sections of this pile measured"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 2 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 286 HPCS and formulized very carefully, he is then able, in looking at this barge and measuring it up, to finally tell how much gravel there is in this barge. This actually happened – happened in Cavite before the war, many years before the war. This young engineer had just gotten out of school and he did just that. He went down and he calculated the amount of gravel in the barge by calculus. And it was very arduous. And he'd been sent down by the chief engineer of the yard to find out if they had enough gravel. And he didn't come back for most of the afternoon. So finally, the chief engi-neer got very, very curious about this and he went down there to find out where this young new engineer was and what he was doing and whether or not the sharks had gotten him or something. And he found him down there just putting the finishing touches on it, and he gave him – the young engineer gave the chief engineer – with great triumph, the fact that he had 150.7-9 cubic yards of gravel on hand. He had pages of calculations. And the yard foreman, a Filipino, standing near at hand, looked very sourly at the young engineer and he said, \"Is that what you were doing? \"And before the chief engineer could even get in there and find out what it was all about he said, \"You see those white paint marks on the front and the back of the barge? Well, they tell you how much gravel is in the barge!\" I've had a wonderful example of how pedantic schooling can be as opposed to educa-tion. I read a dissertation last night on the subject of slides. The preparation of lantern slides. And boy, this was the most intricate calculations of how close you had to be to a screen and how – the density of the lantern slide had to be in order for you to get a proper lecture hall projection. And these went on and on, and if I hadn't myself had experience in this particular line, I would have taken all this quite seriously. But it was somebody – I guess his pen just got to going and he couldn't stop it. Because what you do if you have dim lantern slides is get a brighter lamp. You don't move a projector backward and forward in the hall and calculate the superreflectiveness of the screen and all that sort of thing. Now, with great experience then – and it is considerable experience, you see, I know slides and densities and that sort of thing, by experience – I knew that this data I was being fed so laboriously had very, very little importance. See, it was interesting. You know, it was interesting that anybody would write that much on the subject. But Reg and I and Bonwick at a circus not too long ago, with a mismatched voltage line and common bed sheeting hung up between two circus poles, enlarged a picture four to five diameters above anything ever intended for either the picture or the projector. Everybody was delighted; they looked beautiful. We had a twelve-by-twelve screen of bed sheeting which even had puckers in it. There was only one slide that it made look odd – one slide out of about two hundred – and it just happened to fall, this pucker did, in a young man's face and it just fell wrong. Not a critical proposition at all. You take any old density of slide and show it in – throw it into a projector, then, with enough lamp – and you put up a sheet that will reflect and you've got yourself just about the finest lantern slide show you ever wanted to see and there isn't anybody going to say a word about it. Two pages of text out of how you calculate the density of a lantern slide – not a criti-cal problem. So, education would take into effect, as opposed to schooling, the relative importance of the data being taught. That's very, very important. The relative importance of the data be-"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 3 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 287 HPCS ing taught, by which, one would say, the relative applicability of the data being taught – the applicability. Now, schooling, as opposed to education, has in actual fact no thought, no real thought of applicability, no such thought. It is just as important to the pedantic or scholastic school of education, this technol-ogy, that \"Pliny, in the year umpty-ump-dash-ump, did hereinto aforesaid with semicolons, discover that there were sturgeons.\" Now, what you going to do with that datum? Yet a man's whole career could have been wiped out, you see, by an inability to have vociferated this fact. This is under \"fishing,\" heading of \"ichthyology,\" see; fishing, fishes. Guy goes down to the bureau of fisheries, see? On his final examination paper he was asked, \"Who and what and when discovered sturgeons?\" You can just see him now – young fellow in the bureau of fish-eries out there off the north coast of Norway, blowing about forty degrees below zero trying to count the number of herring boats out there he's going to have to rescue in the next twenty-four hours, using this datum about Pliny. You can just see this now. Inapplicable! So, there's a sort of a pomposity that goes along in the field of schooling that has no real basis in education. You'll find this in the arts. You will find people who really think they are artistic and really know something about art, who are simply capable of rattling off a number of pictures. \"There's this picture and that picture, and there's the other picture and so forth and it was painted – it was painted by Jules Drool, you know, and in 1710.\" See? You say, \"What did Jules Drool paint it with, bud? What did he use?\" \"Oh, uh – ha-ha. I think it's an oil.\" But he knows it's 1710, see? And he knows it was Jules Drool, and he knows the name of the painting is Shameful Morning or something. But you ask this bird – you ask this bird, you say, \"What did he paint it with?\" \"Oh, I think it was – uh, I think it's an oil. I-I think it's an oil. I-I-I think it's an oil. It's an oil.\" He ain't got the point. It's very valuable to know what they were painting with when. See? That's quite valuable. You can use that. Well, you'd – just a crudest possible use – you see something that is painted with ICI Best House Paint, as represented of having been painted in 1510, you know that's wrong, because they didn't make peanut-oil-emulsion paint in... I mean, that's crude, see? But you can see that it does have some applicability in the de-tection of authenticity. What did he paint it with? That's very – that's a good applicable datum, you see? I'll give you a parallel datum like this. I was tearing apart encyclopedias yesterday to find out if anybody else had ever mentioned a certain art form. I could find it no place but I did find in the dictionary that \"doré\" meant \"gold colored.\" I thought that was very interesting because the name I was looking for as an art form was a doré-type and so I didn't know which way I was going on this thing. I thought it was probably a man's name, probably interfered with – with Gustave Doré, you know, and his etchings. No, it wasn't after a man's name and so the thing has never survived as a name, because it wasn't a man, you see? It was simply a goldish form of art reproduction. So they called it a doré-type and the name is so esoteric that it has only survived in the super-super-professional lines. If a guy was really on the ball and he delved into everything, he'd know there had been such a thing as a doré-type, see? But oth-"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 4 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 288 HPCS erwise, he wouldn't know anything about it. Everybody knows what, for instance, a da-guerreotype is, see? Nothing like that. But what was a doré-type? Well, that becomes important in examining the development of picture display, the display of pictures and so forth. So there was a type which did a strange piece of picture dis-play. Well, you should be able to run such things back. Beyond that, in actual fact, whether it was Mr. Wall or Mr. Pall who invented it when – has nothing much to do with it. But how it was done, you see, at such and such a time – oh, that would have quite a bit to do with it, see? So, when you're dealing with education you have to be very careful not to lean over into the significance. Don't lean over into the significance exclusive of the mass. That is a very interesting datum. Now, when you get into significance versus mass, you get into action; and action could be defined as significance versus mass, of some kind or another. That's rather drawing a longbow, you understand, but the reason one engages in action or doingness and so forth, is he has some kind of an idea of accomplishing something or making something or avoiding something or... He has – there's a significance there, you know? There's an idea about it. Even though – even when we look at a lot of particles flying around in the air and we say: \"That's a confusion,\" we've added significance to the mass, don't you see? Do you see that? But in education when the significance is never added to the mass but stands in pris-tine purity all by itself, you tend to get a jammed curriculum – no doingness. Let's get down to earth about it, you see? I've just given you an example of it – I've just given you an exam-ple of it, of who – who invented what, see? And now we say, \"And there was a great deal of conflict between these two men at that particular time. One of them – one of them had a greater idea of the destiny of his development than the other one did.\" Oh, what's this got to do with anything? It's a disrelated datum, don't you see? It's just a significance. It hadn't any-thing to do with the doingness or the action, had nothing to do with the mass that you are now confronting. All it does is throw you a curve, you get the idea? So, school is expert at throwing curves until one begins to wonder whether or not school ever has education in mind. So, you could have a school technology which would teach, which would never really educate, never really train anyone. You see that? But it could be marvelous. You could fill your whole university through courses of The work of Thomas Hardy. You could have The Plight of Miners in Roman Times on the Cornwall Coast. You could have The Number of Synonyms and Antonyms used by Hunters and Huntresses in the 16th Century. You could have courses which flunk people because they referred to the wrong word, they used the wrong word in connection with the wrong group of animals, you see? You know, like you have \"a covey of quail,\" you see, and \"a covey of foxes,\" you know, that kind of thing, see? Very pedantic! But what is the basic error here? The basic error – I'll come back to it now – the basic error is simply failing to add the mass or doingness to the significance, see, failing to add the mass or the doingness to the significance. You say, \"This fellow was a good painter. He painted and he painted and he painted and he painted and he painted. Well, he painted a lot.\" You could say this in 90,000 different ways. \"He drove seven – his first seven wives batty by the fact he never paid any attention to anything but his painting.\" Well, it's good curiosa but it is not an educational datum. It's just curiosa. What did he paint, see?"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 5 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 289 HPCS Your student then must be taken into consideration. Your student is trying to get to be a painter. And I'm afraid they've spent so much time teaching them on how many wives the painters have had, or haven't had, that their idea of painting is to get married and divorced or to become a walking catalog. Well, of course, if you're a judge, if you're going to be a professional judge or a pro-fessional critic, not a painter but one of these birds, naturally you want to be practically a walking catalog, see? You want to overwhelm everybody. It's good one-upmanship, you know? You walk through looking at things this way – this way. \"Yes, this man over here, he's copied – he's copied Hans Verboten.\" [laughter] \"Yes, that's a very obscure painter of the 1416.\" See, you want to know things like that, you know, if you're going to be that. But to be a painter – and that's why you'd almost never turn a member of the arts out of a university. That is almost impossible. It's unheard of, and... to teach short story. They ruin more writers! Well, it's of interest how they do this, and they detach the significance and the action. They separate these two things so it becomes a pure significance without any action or mass connected with it. And when you have done this you have then sort of wound a guy up in a no-confront of the subject and you've introverted him. And the way a student becomes introverted is to give him too much significance and too little doingness and too little mass. That's still knocking you for a loop. You keep looking at me with your heads tipped over here and I want to know what's so incomprehensible about it? No, it's slipping some-where. I don't know how to state it, really, any more plainly than I'm stating it. If you're going to teach a fellow about roller balls, give him a roller ball! Is this – is this difficult, see? Don't teach him the history of roller balls! Am I making more sense? Audience: Yes. All right. Does it – does that make sense? It doesn't? Audience: Yes, yes. So, when you have detached the significance from the action and separated these two things apart, you can have schooling but you can't have education. And that's basically how it's done. If you want to wind up with a whole bunch of do-less graduates, if you want to wind up with a whole bunch of painters who can't paint, a whole bunch of doctors who can't doc, [laughter] engineers who can't eng, then by George, you're going to just – all you have to do is take the doingness and the mass connected with the subject and park that over here as some-thing you really don't want to have much to do with and go into the total significance of it all. And then you make a highly impractical person. And this is the only way it's done. There aren't a number of other ways to do this. You wind it up hard enough and he never does go out of school, he never does leave school; he becomes a professor. Now, I've learned that for a person to teach who cannot do, is a terrible mistake. Let's get right down to earth here, in Scientology. If our Instructors couldn't audit – guahhh! What goes on? If our Instructors couldn't audit, what catastrophe would we face in all educational lines? Supposing they all knew the history of auditing and then supposing they could give you"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 6 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 290 HPCS chapter and verse of everything ever written on the subject and tell you exactly where to find this and tell you how many pages it had; supposing they could do that – but they couldn't au-dit. This would be somewhat catastrophic. And any trouble that an Instructor has in teaching has a little bit of something to do with something he doesn't confront about the doingness or the mass of the subject. You got the idea? So, this Instructor finds that he really doesn't like to teach geometry or something like that. Well, he can't do anything with geometry. Do you see? He's got a blind spot in this par-ticular direction. Now, this became so notable from my inspection and study of study that I was practi-cally struck dumb on the subject. It goes to this degree: that a person who is simply writing the reports of people who can do is too far removed for the execution of a good textbook. A person writing reports of people who can do, no matter what people this person consulted, is too far removed from the doingness and mass to make a studiable, good textbook. That is remarkable. Now, you understand all this background I am giving you here on this particular sub-ject – came about when I realized that if we were going on upstairs and we knew something about the mind, that we had to wrap up another subject which is entirely separate to the sub-ject we were trying to wrap up. This is our inheriting the dropped balls of yesterday. They didn't wrap up the subject of education, so we have to wrap up the subject of education, you see, in order to educate; just for our own practical application, see? Well, they didn't do it. They got a lot of money for it, they were paid to do it and they didn't do it, see? So you feel the same crossness that you would feel at the switchman that you had down there on the rail-road tracks and he drew his pay to throw the switch and he didn't, you know? And the Twenti-eth Century Limited went off the rails, see? And you say, \"That blas, of blah, blah, blah, blah – that was his job and he didn't do it,\" see? Same way, same way. Here we are. We've got a difficult subject to confront because one is studying what one is, and we should have had the whole subject of education beautifully wrapped up. But instead of that, it's just mud-died up. There are many preconceptions in this line. So, I recognized that it was necessary – even though we had made great inroads on this – I recognized that it was necessary that I get a new viewpoint on this subject. Therefore I picked up an analogous, or a similar line of study, in that it's a practical subject – if you know certain things and you do certain things, you get a certain result, see? That type of a practical subject – and yet one that sort of borders over into the field of the arts, don't you see, so that you have to have some judgment and taste and so forth. And I picked up this subject – one, because it was available, two, because I had some interest in it – but basically because it did show a fairly decent pattern of what an auditor would do. In other words, he has certain theories and actions which he's supposed to perform which, when applied, will produce a certain result if he uses judgment and good taste. Now, you'd – it isn't the same thing: auditing and photography are very long from the same thing. But auditing does have this in common with photography, that when you do certain things, and you do them right, you then wind up with a result, with a certain result. But if you do these things a bit wrong, you don't wind up with a result, you see? But also, if you do these"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 7 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 291 HPCS things and you do them without using good sense, see, you also don't wind up with a result, see? It's a comparable action. So I picked up this particular field and took a full, blasting, exclamation point, profes-sional course on this from the word \"izzard\" straight on through. Now this was all sandwiched in during the last few months of everything else I've had to do. And I learned, however, a great deal about it just by experiencing subjectively something that was off the subject of what we are doing, something that I had a dilettante knowledge of and so forth. And as I showed you the other day, I think it was starting to come up with a professional result. So then therefore, the course was well studied and did lead to a finite result at the other end of things. I've gone past the point now of just studying it and I can actually develop those points and portions of it necessary to produce the better result, don't you see? It's gone over that bor-derline. For instance, it's all right to do this and that and the other thing and you do that ex-actly by the textbook. But if you're terribly good by the textbook, why, you can then give it that extra frill over here that makes it come out on top, don't you see? In other words, you can use the textbook so well that you can think while you're doing it. Do you see that? Now, that is what I have been going through. And I noticed a great many points very early that would never have struck me if I were not working in a completely new field of study. This is not a field, by the way, that I was ab-solutely new to. I've actually been trained in darkrooms and that sort of thing from a practical viewpoint. So, from another viewpoint here – that I got an idea of – that actually just practical training isn't enough. You can't just give the guy the tools and say, \"All right. Well, dabble around with it and go to work on the Daily Express and watch the birds rushing in and out of the darkroom at the Daily Express and if you do that long enough, why, you will become a good photographer.\" That's not true! I have fabulous evidence that this is not true. The evi-dence lies before you every morning when you glance at the paper. What they commonly call a news photograph is so bad and oddly enough most of those boys are untrained. The top-notchers that you see around, the real headliners and that sort of thing, oddly enough, are trained. It isn't, then, a gift that they suddenly pick up, see? It isn't this vast talent – fellow sees a camera – \"Oh!\" you see, and this huge streak of light goes through his skull of that brilliant inspiration and he clicks the shutter and then he has pictures all over the front of everything. It doesn't work that way. And he can go through all of the menial jobs he wants to in the field of photography, cleaning plates and all the rest of those things, through to the last bitter end of the thing and he will never become a top-notch photographer. They're doing it all the time because this is the way the newspapers get the young men to come in and work in their dark-rooms. They tell them this and that's not true. Top-notch photographers of England are most severely trained photographers you ever had anything to do with. They are just a little bit too severely trained, if anything. But they're hot. You get Tony Armstrong-Jones, my God! If you ever saw a man use standard photogra-phy, this guy uses it with a capital \"S\" with an exclamation point. He can't even take a picture of his own new baby without setting up the exact textbook lighting for a baby picture, see? He doesn't even get thrown by the event of being a father, you see? He goes and gets the exact"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 8 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 292 HPCS lamps and he sets them up at the exact angle and he fixes them up this way. He got a fluke picture by doing this – it's just one of those flukes. You run into them all the time – you take advantage of them. Nevertheless, his lighting was absolutely textbook. This guy is a head-liner, see? He's taken design photography now, and in the – in the big Sunday Times Maga-zine Section – he had an article in there a couple of Sundays ago and I know he just laughed like mad when he published that lead picture in there. He's standing outside of a building, he gets the perfect architectural texture – he's been elected to the Design Council and so forth – he takes – stands outside the building, he gets the perfect texture of the brick, perfect texture of glass, perfect texture of everything, and shoots the inside of the building like daylight. And I know what he did. He said, \"Nobody will notice it but a pro, but let them figure out how I did it,\" see? He knew the public would just be interested in it sort of as a picture and so forth. But I'm sure that it was in the back of his mind, \"Let somebody figure out how I did this,\" see? I don't know how he did it. I know how I would have done it but you don't shoot from the out-side of a building in glaring sunlight and get the total detail of the inside of the building with-out doing cutouts or something and this is no cutout. How did he do it, see? And I know he sort of laughed to himself because he's put together, of course, two brands of very standard lighting. Knows his subject cold, you see? So he – but he uses it in this peculiar way with color film to get this fantastic result. You never stand outside of a building, see it in perfect detail and look into the room inside and see it in perfect detail at the same level of light. And then you don't shoot this in color. No latitude to the film. But a pro can be counted on to do things like that. But when you break him right on down, why can he do things like that? He knows all the right ways to do it and therefore he knows how to fail at doing what he's doing and then he can think that extra step, see? He knows his equipment and so when he can think that one more step, that makes him a cham-pion. The leading glamour photographer of England is a fellow named Tom Hustler. They're always calling in Tom Hustler to shoot some star or something of the sort. They rave about his pictures. Well, it's quite amazing, because Tom Hustler never took anything in his life except a standard professional photograph. He never took anything. He doesn't even add that extra. He is so standard that he's painful to look at if you're a pro, see? The hair light is always exactly where the hair light is supposed to be – that light that you see in portraits that gives the little gleam to the person's hair, see? His main light, the big one, and the fill, they're al-ways in exactly the right position. His background is always exact. It's just a technically per-fect photograph, do you see? There isn't anybody else in England taking them. Lancere, the great theater photographer, I am told – I am told – their great theater pho-tographer. I saw some pictures by this character the other day, he's about as standard as a pig lost in the swamp, see? And the pictures look it – they're faulty. And his lighting is not stan-dard and he doesn't know what to do with the lighting. I think he's got baby picture lighting he's lighting stars with or something of the sort. He's just not a pro. You see? Shows up – bang! People look at the picture; and you show them one that is perfectly lighted, you say, \"How about this one,\" you see?"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 9 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 293 HPCS They say, \"Oh! That's a beautiful picture,\" you see? And you show the next one and it's got a technical imperfection in it and they, well, they don't like that so well. They can't tell you why, this is a common guy off the street, see? Now, photography has got the common denominator of the public taste. What does the public want to see and what does the public like to see? So now, we have a new subject in photography – this is another reason I chose it – brand new subject. Just a little over a century old. About 1810 – 1810 somebody said, \"You know, I get a poiple shadow on a piece of paper when I paint it with some funny chemicals\" and there it all began. Color photography is so far from new that they were actually projecting color photographs on the screen for the edification of audiences – not hand-colored or any-thing – as the same time as Mr. Brady. But, that's all new. That's a Johnny-come-lately sub-ject, isn't it? It's not really had time to pick up too much snob. It's not had time to get lost. So, to make my point, when you give it all mass and doingness and no significance, you also fail. In other words, you can send this fellow up as a darkroom assistant to the Daily Mail, have him packing cameras for somebody or other, and have him standing in there at Lancere's adjusting lights for half a lifetime without his ever really becoming a pro. So, professionalism has to do with the significance and the doingness and the mass. It has to do with all of those things. You can't have all doingness and no significance, and you can't have total significance and no doingness and wind up with a final result in the way of a student. Education, then, would consist of a balanced activity which would treat with equal importance the significance and the doingness of a subject. You would treat these things equally. Now, this is not a new thought – it's not a new thought. It's been with us for some time. But it was terribly confirmed to me on an inspection of what is standard photography today and having been over the jumps and being almost finished with this course and ready for my finals, I thought I had better just make all these notes of it and so forth. But one of the things that stuck me in the eye all the way through the line is the pro, the real pro, was the fellow who knew the significance and had experience in the doingness and the handling of the mass. And that was a real pro; a real professional. Now, you say, \"Well, what about this fellow who comes busting out of the middle of nowhere and he all of a sudden develops this whole fantastic panorama of new material?\" No, you were looking at a pro. You didn't look at anybody who suddenly busted out of nowhere uninformed and so forth. But his education might easily – because it wasn't being taught any-place – the significance was backed up by a great deal of additional hard study, see? You still had the study there, see? He studied like mad. Let's take somebody like the fellow who projected the first color pictures. I bet you he could have given you the number and book of practically every photograph that had been taken in the history of photography, which went back of him only about 20-30 years. He must have known them, see? He must have known them all. Then you go back into it a little bit further, you'll probably find out he was a chemist by training, see?"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 10 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 294 HPCS Professionalism, then, doesn't leap full-armed from the breath of somebody's hope. Professionalism is sweated for. And also, professionals are distinguished by the fact that they work hard. Dilettantism is supposed to mean \"good at many things,\" but actually I would rather extend its meaning a little bit to saying that \"unprofessional at everything,\" because part of professionalism is hard work. You, really – to pick up all the significance of a subject and to put that into a doingness action and so forth, rough, rough, rough. Now, that all sounds very interesting but there is another factor involved in it: Is, you don't have to have done everything that was done in order to be a pro and that is a very hope-ful thing. And I learned that the hard way. You don't have to have made a piece of photo-graphic film in order to become grounded in making photographic film, see? That's lucky for you, you don't have to make a human mind in order to fix one up. That's carrying the point a little broad but you actually don't have to have run Standard Operating Procedure of July of 1950, in order to call yourself a professional auditor. If you did that, why great – great, see? Fine. But you take someone who's being trained in 1964, to ask him to do that would be silly. Right now, to – this stage of study, for me to go and get some chemicals of some kind or another and some old horses' hooves and boil them up, and – so as to have some gelatin and put these things all together so as to make one of the original forms of wet plate, and ex-pose it wet in one of my cameras – which was the way they did it, you see and so forth, well, it'd just come out at the other end. I – what would I say out of this? \"Well, I've done it.\" So what? I'm not going to do it. Not again. That would wreck the camera, of course. Do you see what I mean? That can be overstressed. Now, we get to the overstresses. The doingness can be terribly overstressed. I've already showed you significance can be terribly overstressed. \"Pliny did write on the – ye old wax tablet, which he wrote on with a stylus, which that day had a dull point, because his slave had a headache, that sturgeons...\" See, you can go crazy on this subject, see, of significance. You can go nuts. You can wildly overestimate what a student has to know. You can also underestimate it. But the wildest shot, when they get to formal schooling, is to shoot the moon with this thing. Just go overboard with it, just go crazy with it – make – drive everybody around the bend with it, see? It's sort of a method of forbidding somebody the subject, see? See? \"If you can't tell us all the papers of Sigmund Freud, you can never be a diplomate in psychiatry.\" It's a fact, the total examination for the highest rank of psychiatry is simply the title, the date writ-ten and the place of publication of each one of Freud's papers. I know I exaggerate and a psy-chiatrist, if he were here right now, would say, \"Oh, how you – rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr-rowr,\" you know? He'd sound like Vixie out here when you kick her. [laughter] But he'd be lying in his teeth, because that's his diplomate examination. I know – I knew a psychiatrist, nursed him through a psychotic break, because he was taking it. [laughter] And I don't think you can get much closer to the examination without, in actual fact, taking it yourself. And that was what was driving him around the bend. He was preparing for that exam that way and he took the exam that way and that was it. It was very funny watching him prepare for the exam, he'd keep rolling up on a ball, sucking his thumb; rolling up in a ball, you know, in the fetal position on the couch so he could study this. It was very funny. I"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 11 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 295 HPCS never did tell him, \"You know, brother, I think you're keyed in.\" [laughter] But overweighted significance is a way of defeating a student, way overweighted. Now, you can err to the degree that you're giving him a subject which he's never going to do. Now, let's take it over into Scientology. You're giving him all the data, necessary to run Standard Operating Procedure of July, Elizabeth, New Jersey and so forth. And the mistake is to give him all of it. He's never going to use it. All you want to know, you – all you want to give him is enough so he can identify it. If he collides with this thing again, he said, \"Hey, that's Standard Operating Procedure of July,\" you know, \"back there, Elizabeth.\" \"Early days, Elizabeth,\" is about all you want to get through there. \"Yeah, that sort of thing. Finger snap, yeah.\" Something like that. \"Oh, yes. They did that, early days.\" Have some dim idea where this thing fits, you see? That's about all you want to get across to him. He's not going to do it, see? So therefore, if he's not going to do it, you've got to strip the significance off of it. You got the idea? That's the way these are kept in balance. If the guy isn't going to do it, take the significance off of it. See, you've got to keep these things in balance. If he's going to do it, pour it to him, man! Let's take an esoteric process like bromoil. Well, they didn't use to have panchromatic film, so it drove them mad. They didn't use to have a film that responded to color, so it drove them absolutely stark, staring mad trying to get a tree light enough so that it looked like a tree, you know? When they made a picture of a tree, they had an awful time with this sort of thing. So they did this fantastic process, like photolithography. I won't burden you with any of the details, because – ohh – horrible! It makes me shudder to remember it. Nobody's ever going to do a bromoil, unless he's a doodle-daddle type of darkroom bug, you know? See, he's got to be a real darkroom bug, because there's much simpler methods of producing the same result, do you see? Well, some old-time photographer that is a real purist and so forth, in New York, would listen to that statement and he'd say, \"I don't know that you'll never do a bromoil. You can't be sure, you know. I myself have done bromoils and so forth. Only took me thirty days one time to do one bromoil print.\" That's about the length of time, see? Oh! Cruel! And right when I was coming down the home stretch with my course I had a half a textbook on how you did bromoil prints. A half a textbook! It is there in its most painful excruciating detail, but not, incidentally, in such a way that you could really do one by referring to the text. It goes like this, the order of action, which is another point down here which I'll get to – the order of action is all wrong in it. That is to say, \"Now make sure that you lay this wet picture,\" you see, \"this wet print out on the back of the tray that will fit it, or glass, and make sure that you lay it out and pin it all down carefully. Now, before you do that, make sure that you have the other print ready, because you're going to need it in a second.\" Oh, no, see? You're on what I know as order of. You've got down to this line, and you're slavishly going down the line men-tally doing the action, you see, and then you find out you've made a mistake, see? He tells you now that there was another action you should have done before the action he tells you to do, see? Zzrrrrrrr! And you have a feeling like you've made a terrible mistake. But bromoil is there in its most excruciating detail and has not been done seriously for a number of years. You could probably win a salon exhibit with a bromoil print. You proba-bly could today. Judges would stand there and they'd look at it and they'd say, \"What's this?\""},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 12 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 296 HPCS They're quite beautiful. \"Uhh, what's this? My God! A bromoil, you know? Gee, you know? Give him first technical prize.\" That's about all you'd get for it, see? \"Somebody has actually done a bromoil print – wow!\" See? And they'd say, \"Gee,\" you know? They themselves would know what this involved – being trained people, see? Public would go by, look on down at the rest of the pictures; wouldn't stop any eyes. But it would have meant about thirty days, or something like that, of pure, dripping sweat. But to be taught how to do it, down to the last comma, down to the last bit of tempera-ture, down to every mistake that you could make in doing this thing which you're never going to do, absolutely takes the cake right off the top of the oven. Wow! See? There is all this do-ingness which is never going to be matched with a doingness, you see? So all this significance is then built up with an undone never-will-be-done doingness, so it all becomes significance. So, the doingness all but moves over here into the significance department, don't you see? And it doesn't just unbalance it; it winds you up with some ghastly headaches, I know. I say, \"Well, I've got to get through this to get to the end of this course or I don't get any di-ploma. Got to make it. 'So you take a stipple brush.' Now, let me read that again. 'You...'\" Ghastly, you know? You're never going to take a stipple brush. You couldn't care less. So they couldn't make prints in 1890! All right. Great! We don't happen to be having that trouble today. Like asking you to study the aspects – you are studying to some slight de-gree, but they are very useful – but studying some of the aspect of a \"pc lists that were made in 1950\" – they weren't published – but what could – you know, no meters, see – so what could the auditor detect without any meter? What would the pc do that would indicate this, see? And then giving it to you in total, painful detail. All you're going to do is read your tone arm, see? But giving you this other in total painful detail, \"You sit there and you audit with your fingers on their pulse,\" you see, and now give you the whole rundown of the Japanese or Chinese system of pulse counting by pressure because that's the more complex system. That was actually what I used, the Chinese system of pulse counting, trying to get up on it – how... oh, you'd be surprised, man – you sit there today – you were absolutely at the beginning of road nowhere in the – just about 14-15 years ago, there was no way to tell what the reaction of the pc was; there was no way to tell what a hot subject was; there was no way to look into anybody's mind; there was no way to record it, if you did. Just a nowhere view, see? Grim. But now, for you to be taught, who are never going to do it, how you detect a tone arm response without any meter because of the various physiological manifestations of the pc, the motion of the chest – very important, see, the change of breath, coloration; eye coloration. There is a whole subject of how do you know if a process is flat by the eye coloration. Very interesting subject! How would you like to learn the several thousand words that were written on this subject? All you have to know, if you were taught this, is that there was such a subject. You see? You could very easily learn there was such a subject and there is the subject, which is what makes the E-Meter important, see? This other subject is so complex that the E-Meter solves this other subject, which is \"How do you tell what's going on in the pc?\" And that sub-ject had many ramifications, see? And if a process is really getting to a pc, his eye color will"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 13 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 297 HPCS change, you see? Or his pulse will smooth out, you know? That's about all you have to know. The rest of this is bric-a-brac. All right, somebody can spend his whole life, whole life working in the field and realm of bric-a-brac and have a good time. There are fellows who study the history of bro-moil – not do it – study the history of it – as almost a full-time hobby or profession or some-thing, see? So, you can get these incredible significances built up in a subject which actually don't amplify the doingness or the expected action of the student. Then this is giving him do-ingness which becomes a significance. So we get to the next point of the line which is the conversion of doingnesses to only significances. And if a subject does very much of this, you've just about had it. If you convert all the doingnesses of a subject over into significance – that's how you do it, is you take some subject which is not going to be performed and you describe it far beyond any necessity. Then you've got a conversion, see? Now, if you can go the reverse, you can say the significance is convertible over to the doingness. And you have just had an example of that – the fellow is never going to make a bromoil, so you make him make a bromoil. See, it's properly merely a significance today; it's just properly a significance. There was a thing called a bromoil print. Fine, it existed, see? What it was, was it depended on the same principle now used in photo-lithography. Gelatin holds water and water repels oil, see? Uses these various principles. In-teresting to know, see? You can cover it in a paragraph or two, see? Now, if we go too far on this particular line, by making some person do some ancient, old act, which he is never again going to do, we've taken something that should have just re-mained there as a significance and we have pushed it over into a doingness action. And it again upsets the student most ghastly. I'm sure he would have – I'm sure it'd be cute to grind some wheat with a millstone, you see? It could be a hobby, don't you see? It could be very nice, but there would have to be some good reason why you were doing it. Do you see? A good reason why you were doing it, see? And if it's just that you want to see how they did it primitively, well, maybe that's a good enough reason, see? But that's if you want to do it. Did you notice the choice of words? To make a student do it is a fantastic error. Silly! And his reaction to your effort to teach him is an ARC break. He can't figure out why the devil he's doing this in the first place. So we come to the conclusion that the doingness and the mass of a subject are the cur-rent, applicable and useful doingnesses and masses of the subject and those are what should be taught – hard. They're applicable – the applicable doingnesses and masses. In other words, the student should be taught what the student is going to be doing. And the significances that should be taught to the student are – don't compare to what I just told you. The significances are enough background so as not to get – and this is something they've all missed, and this is how an engineer gets to be forty years old and goes old hat – is enough significance so that he doesn't get stuck in the mechanical doingness he's been taught – and you've got to give him enough significance. In other words, that's a little bit more significance than you would expect to give him. And that's why you give him the history of it, to show that it was developed and give him some sketch of its development. And that's why you show him how the thing evolved and what the doingnesses of it were."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 14 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 298 HPCS So you see, it becomes asinine to make him do these old things. You're just trying to show him that there were some other doingnesses, don't you see? And you're making him conversant with the principles with which he's operating and if he's sufficiently conversant with those, then the doingness and the other action which he is being taught don't become obsolete because he can think, see? And that's the difference between a pro – that's the differ-ence between a \"pro\" and a \"practical man.\" It shows up quite additionally, is a pro always does it by the textbook, with a difference; always does it by the textbook, a bit better. And when the thing shifts, it doesn't look like a shift to him, it looks like simply the same thing with its face slightly shifted. Do you see? It doesn't look all that brassy new. Now, you'll hear people around – you've just shifted how you do a repetitive com-mand – and you will have people around that tell you, \"We've changed all of Scientology.\" Well, they had learned the practical action – they'd learned the doingness of giving a practi... a repetitive command, but they had no theory over here of why they were doing this, or what was – what one was trying to accomplish with this, such as flatten the mental comm lag, do you see, that the guy's going through, or anything like that, flatten the process. They just knew this thing of a steady grind, so the second you changed one comma in it, they thought you'd changed all of Scientology, don't you see? But the guy who has grounding on the subject and who knows what processes are and what they're supposed to do, he would say, \"Yeah, well, that – that...\" He'd give it the proper significance, you see? He'd say, \"Well, ah – that's an out... slightly out of ARC, so it should be shifted slightly, see? That knocks the pc a little bit out of ARC. But this other wording, that's very clever. That doesn't knock the pc. See, that doesn't give him a 'no ARC,' you see?\" Yeah, nothing changed, see, to him. Everything looked calm, normal, so forth. Now, a professional then is able to advance and a practical man quite commonly can-not advance. A theoretician, then, would be well taught, but seldom educated. Somebody who is just dealing in theory and nothing but theory, and so forth, could be absolutely beautifully taught, he could be wonderfully schooled, but he would not be educated in that subject be-cause he would have had the doingness missing in that subject. His doingness would have been gone. He's just an expert on the painters of the nineteenth century, that's all. He knows the theory of all of their paintings – just the theory. It's not being done anymore, nobody ever expects to do it again. But you'll find odd bits of the society and culture get parked like this and he can be-come important, just because millionaires these days are trying madly to save their cash with art. Art and land increase in value. So, there's guys walking into salons today who know noth-ing about art, but have just got that 100,000 bucks that they want to get deposited fast before inflation eats it up and they feel if they bought a big, nice, good, solid piece of art, that would be known into the future, then of course, it's worth a 100,000 now, but when money inflates, it'll be worth 200,000. Like land, it would have increased its value with the inflation, so there-fore it's like gold, you see? So he walks into the gallery and he looks at this painting, \"Huh! It's a girl holding a what?\" That's the total knowledge he has of any of this, so he's got experts and the expert can't paint, but he can tell him the real from the false, something like that. But if that guy himself had no doingness of detection or doingness of anything else, his opinion wouldn't be worth"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 15 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 299 HPCS anything either. He wouldn't be able to see and he'd be able to palm off everything. But you've got quite a culture – winds up in some very odd spots and you occasionally look into some of these spots and you'll think you have a total theoretician or something like that, that you've got a totality and you may very well have. But there's nothing sadder than an expert on steam-driven road equipment. I imagine there is one in England today. He's an expert, the last practical expert on the subject of steam-driven road repair equipment. Did you ever see any of these things in textbooks? They're steam engines that have rollers, and they go up and down the roads and – in the days before the internal combustion engine. He's the last – he was the world's – he was a good practical man. He never had any theory of any kind on the subject of steam, or propulsion or anything else, but he's awful practical on the subject of these things, you see? He was all doingness and no thought. Well, he antiquated. He became antique. He became unemployable, actually. So, when you break up this balance in an education, then you haven't educated the bloke and you haven't safeguarded his future. A fellow is betrayed, then, to the degree that he is not educated and only schooled; and that is most of the protest of the young: that they are being schooled, not educated. They're not being fitted for life. I'll give you an idea how far adrift it can go. I asked my kids the other day to write something, write their names, sign their names. And boy! Of all the tongue-between-the-teeth actions, you know! Oh, that was grim! They had no signatures. I came down on their teacher like a ton of bricks, you see? They've done – do lots of – lots of exercises in the field of writ-ing, they couldn't sign their own name. Marvelous example, don't you see? Yet I'm sure that they've been very busy making circles and very busy making slant exercises and very busy doing other things and very busy doing everything but write. And somewhere or another, if you wanted to know what was wrong with that and why that occurred, somewhere or other the doingness moved into the field of theory or significance, see? The doingness moved, be-came just a significance. But it isn't a doingness, don't you see? I mean, writing words has very little to do with traveling ovals, as they call them and so forth, see? So, you can just go just so far with traveling ovals and you get no – there's no doingness there. So the guy is actually in motion, but it isn't an educational doingness. And that's where an Instructor could make his mistake, you see? Because people are busy or active or acting, then he thinks they are doing. It all depends on what they are doing. If they're not doing some-thing that is immediately going to add up to an action applicable by them in life to the accom-plishment of a result, they're in the field of significance. And they react like they are in the field of significance. They become very stultified and bored and protesting and annoyed. See, they themselves have recognized that they've exceeded the doingness, that this doingness has nothing whatsoever to do with what they'll be doing. So they fall back then, and they just treat it as a significance because it's purposeless. It doesn't go anyplace, you see? Nothing's hap-pening so it might as well just be a significance and therefore all the motion is no motion at all. So, all the motion being no motion, really, they get this funny, bored, you know, feeling, like, you know, they're not moving. Here they see all the motion, but they're not moving. And actually it's a significance, which has some motion in it and it doesn't have anything to do with going anywhere. And they get this funny sensation – it actually develops a physiological"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 16 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 300 HPCS sensation. It's being up against something, but not being able to move through it. Funny, funny sensation. It's identifiable. Well, those fundamentally are the basic balances of proper education. Whatever else you want to say about it, those are the basic balances. There are a lot of very specific things, there are a lot of odd and very sharp and very true and very positive and very practical aspects of all this. But education is the – should be the activity of relaying an idea or an action from one being to another, in such a way as not to stultify or inhibit the use thereof. And that's about all it is. You could add to it that it permits, then, the other fellow to think on this subject and develop. He should be able to think on the subject and develop on the subject. In other words, he takes this idea that you've given him, and it applies only to murals. You've given him enough background and so forth, and you've told him this applied to mu-rals. And one day he's looking at a miniature and he says, \"For heaven's sakes, that also ap-plies – for this particular job that I'm doing – that other principle applies to the miniature.\" I'll give you one, I can think of one right offhand. A photomural should never be painted until it is actually assembled on a wall, if you're going to paint a photomural, see? Well, I can think of an association that a guy would get in his skull, if he was having any trouble doing miniatures. Supposing for some wild reason or another somebody came up and wanted him to do a miniature on ivory. Well, this is feasible, you can do it. So, if he knew photomurals, and he knew a lot of other work, and he knew lantern slides and so forth and then also he knows how to go back and find how to make an emulsion (you know, one of the basic emulsions that – make it out of egg white or something) he knows what textbook to find it in. He'd probably whop all this together and then he would also know that you certainly better not paint it until you'd totally finished it, see, and in other words, the information is loose in the guy's head. It's flexible, he can use it, see? It isn't jammed into his head crosswise so that it just associates just with one thing, see? Don't give it – don't – education shouldn't give people the technology in such a way that the technology is not useful to them. They've got to be able to think with it. You've got to remember that when you teach this engineer in a university all there is to know about nuclear physics, that in just about a dozen years, through the investment of national governments and other things – and particularly since it's very destructive, we know that national governments will invest, very heavily. And we know that this field is going to change. And we're going to teach him all there is to know on the subject. Well, we could make just a technician out of him for common, ordinary, garden-variety actions of reading meters; or we could teach him current technology or current theory as a biblical fact; or we could teach him in such a way that he could think in the subject. And of them, the only fair thing to do is teach him in such a way as he could think in the subject because it's an advancing subject, and he won't become an antique in a dozen years, see? If we did anything else, he would become antique because this thing – after all, governments are in there shoveling the money into atomic development and so forth, left, right and center. They've got guys on pure mathematics and they've got guys on this and guys on that. And they're – I don't care how they say they're – but I always get suspicious. They say they're \"abandoning the production units of Uranium 235,\" and then the following sentence is added onto this. We take it – yes, they're abandoning the manufacture of 235, we'll buy that."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 17 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 301 HPCS Now, the \"because\" is what you – what you wince on. \"Because there's already sufficient quantities of it to answer all possible needs for the next 500 years,\" see? There's that \"be-cause.\" The first sentence, all right. All right. So they're going to abandon this development. But their \"because\"? Maybe so, but we don't really think so. They've discovered something else, brother. They've discovered something that makes U-235, you know, look like last sea-son's high-button shoes. And of course they're not about to let it out. Every time somebody discovers one of these secrets, or the secretary of state, or somebody like that, of the United States gets on a plane hurriedly in order to tell the last atomic secrets to Khrushchev. I don't think that's his job, but that's what he's been doing lately – this bird, he goes ramming across and around and about and screaming about this and screaming about that. No. There isn't any of these secrets that have been stolen such as the Fuchs and that sort of thing, as damaging as they were, that didn't excite the government into a fantastic internal convulsion on the subject of \"Develop something new, something better, something that hasn't been stolen yet.\" And their best prevention of espionage is not political because that they're sour at. Their best prevention of espionage is just being newer. So, I imagine the poor kid being educated right up now in Birmingham on the subject of atomic physics is probably already 10, 15 years behind the mark. He'll probably get out and he will look very bright and he will say, \"All right, now we take the riga-bongs,\" and so forth. And the fellows on the place say, \"The what? Oh yes, yes. We remember that. We – it's – we... that's historical.\" That was his last course, see, was in riga-bongs, you know? Oooh! \"Well, what are you fellows doing?\" \"Oh well, we haven't time now, but there's a pile of textbooks over in the corner. Those are our more recent notes.\" Well, education, then, to fit this fellow for life would have to fit him for this operating atmosphere. It would have to fit him to think. At the same time they'd have to teach him that disciplines are disciplines and actions are actions but at the same time they'd have to teach him to think with these actions and advance these actions and carry them out to a finite and final conclusion. They'd have to do these things. Well, that's quite a trick, to teach somebody, on the one hand, that this is an exacting discipline, and on the other hand that you should have a loose and flexible attitude toward it. Quite a trick, isn't it? Well, you recognize what the strain is. You're trying to make a practical person who applies it to a result, who can give it that extra fillip, you know, that extra little zing that pushes it on through. He can think on his feet, in other words, and – so that he won't anti-quate. Give him all this so he won't antiquate. Well, that's quite a trick. Actually, that is being demanded of Scientology as in nowhere else. And anybody studying in Scientology is under considerable stress and strain because of these various fac-tors. You have a madly advancing subject, which is advancing beyond the expectancy that it was – its expectancy keeps rising, don't you see? And which is already taking off from the – from the basis of having exceeded all former expectancies. See, and now it is still advancing and its expectancy level is rising, see, consistently. I mean, more and more is developed that broadens the view more and more, see?"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 18 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 302 HPCS And so therefore education in Scientology becomes a much touchier proposition than in any other analogous subject and it's very rough. It's very rough. That is why I undertook to find out what are these various balances and what do you do and so forth. And how do you bring somebody up to a point where he can study this thing without too much casualty and upset. And what are the touchy points, then, of education? And of course, education is a sub-ject that has not been worked out. By definition – there isn't even a definition, you see, such as I just gave you a moment ago. They don't operate in a school with a definition. Well, that's wonderful because what trouble do you get into if you read a paragraph beyond something that you haven't got the definition of? You get into trouble, promptly, instantly and immedi-ately, catastrophic trouble. Well, education's been in trouble ever since it started to do some-thing which it never defined. That's the basic thing wrong with education, see? Let's call somebody who is being educated different than somebody who is being taught. Let's make that shading of difference here. And then let's get the technology of school-ing and understand that the technology of schooling somebody does exist and that man has had that for quite a while, but it doesn't necessarily have too much to do with the technology of educating him, which has been relatively undeveloped. So just because one is going to school is no reason one is getting educated, see? But there's terrific technology wrapped up around school. And that the success of any taught subject is to the degree that it keeps its significance sensibly balanced with its action and the masses associated with it. And that's a sensibly balanced subject. And the odd whip-around can occur here that actually a person can think he's engaged in a doingness when actu-ally he's engaged in a significance because the doingness is never going to be applied, see? And he can actually be engaged in a significance which is really a doingness, on the other side of the fence, naturally. If it balances one way, it'll for sure balance the other way. He can be engaged in a – in a significance of the action of contemplation. And it's as silly as that, don't you see? It's too silly to require very much stress. What is the significance of an action? Well, if an individual was terribly significant about everything under the sun, moon and stars, you could, of course, work up significance into some kind of an educational subject. Don't you see? So the significance itself would lean over and become a doingness. Sounds silly, but it's true. I'm now talking about the \"expert on art of the nineteenth century,\" see? And there are fellows who make a terribly good living, which is the achievement of a final result of educa-tion. After all, I don't care how much communism we've got amongst us, you know? The guy is making a living by simply being a walking dictionary, see. Memory expert on something or other – he's somebody or other. He knows all the formulas there are to be known on the sub-ject of paint. He never mixed any paint, he wouldn't know what to do if you showed him a paint can, he actually abhors the smell of it – it makes him quite sick. But he can sit there in a little cubicle and be an expert on the subject of paint. So his, of course, has become – his sig-nificance has become his doingness. Perfectly allowable. The society has that."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 19 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 303 HPCS So, somebody writes him a letter and they say, \"Dear Expert Jones: We are working with the formula of rosin and – uh – su... and – uh – amber, and we are trying very hard to develop the – so on. Could you please give us the background music to this here paint?\" And he says, \"Well, that paint was originally used on the Tyrrhenian Sea and uh – so forth and their amber was different than anybody else's amber,\" and he goes on and on and on. At the other end of – the guy, the practical bird, takes a look. \"Hey, no wonder it won't paint! Their amber was different. There's a different type of amber – that's Russian amber and Russian amber, it has an awful lot of beeswax in it,\" or something, you know, whatever it is. \"Ha! This paint requires wax.\" So we dump some wax in. All right, now it paints things. See? But this bird didn't have any idea of applying this to anything. If he said enough on the subject then somebody who was doing the subject, you know, could make some sense out of it. So there are experts. There's guys like Einstein. He sat around and did a wonderful... he had a total doing-ness that was of significance. He figured and figured and figured and figured and figured and he figured everybody into a hole. But he sure stimulated guys. More mathematicians were made trying to understand Einstein than any other single man that ever worked. The joke of it is, there might be nothing in his work at all. It's sort of idiotic to say that – somebody comes along and tells you that the speed of light is c, and it's never any different. What's he talking about? What light? Well, now, I don't even think he says it's the light between 3,600 ang-stroms and 5,600 angstroms. I don't think he got that definite. He just said, \"The speed of light.\" Well, that's great. Does he mean light as we normally see light? Well, light, in actual fact is simply the light vibration that you see, don't you see? By definition, that's light. Well, then he must have meant that light, visible light. Well, great. I'm glad he did because when it goes through a prism, it no longer travels at c. Well, what do you say? It could no longer travel at c for this excellent reason: It emerges from the prism at different speeds. Otherwise you would never have a spectrum. Oh yes. But now, you're only talking about wavelength and you're only talking about the amplitude of the wavelength and that sort of thing and that's why it turns the corner. No, I'm afraid that that can't be true either. It must be at a different speed because if you've ever watched soldiers in an evolution, the fellow on the outside is going faster than the fellow on the inside. Have you ever noticed that? Well, light, to bend and fan into a dispersal when it goes through a prism, must be handling something that has to do with speed. But because everybody has gone stone-blind on this because Einstein has said quite the contrary, don't you see, now they've got to have some weird idea, and actually it might interest you to know that they have finally abolished light. I thought that was mighty nice of them. They've now got it worked out that color is only something that is manufactured by the eye to relay to the brain and doesn't exist in actual fact anywhere. That's actually told to you – that's being taught me right now. I think it's a wonderful idea. But if the guy hadn't read a psychology textbook before he wrote that textbook, I would be happier about it. There's something wrong with all of this, for this excellent reason, is, a vibration is a vibration. I don't know why you have to get psychology into it. That's the influence of Locke and Hume, you see? These old birds."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"SHSBC-396 A SUMMARY OF STUDY 20 4.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 304 HPCS \"If there was a sound...\" Descartes, yeah? \"If there – is there sound in the forest if there is nobody there to hear it?\" [laughter] Well, what do they want to chase themselves up those blind alleys for, man? Because they're very easily answered. They are confusing the role of a thetan because they haven't got him. And of course, he's the wild, missing variable in all of their equations. So, all right. So the thetan builds the universe. Now of course, he can experience it. You can experience what you can build, so therefore there would be such a thing as light. It all depends on how you're looking at it, and from what mental science you are looking at it, as to whether or not you make pronunciamentos concerning it one way or the other. But you might get an idiocy that would go something like this: \"Now, light doesn't exist because you aren't. Now, if you were, then light couldn't. Because, you see, if light really does come through the pupil of the eye and excite the brain into various sensations known as color and so forth – but if these things do not exist in actual fact, then of course nothing is behaving outside of your skull at all. Nothing is happening outside of your skull.\" You are saying such things as, \"A cook can never eat the cake he bakes.\" See, this is the plea for total introversion. You follow me, don't you? Therefore, if we've got to have an argument about \"If the tree falls, is there a sound if nobody's there?\" If we're going to have an argument of that character, then let's have some real arguments like \"Can a cook bake a cake and eat it?\" See? But you'd have to go upstairs into the role of a being in this universe, or a thetan. You'd have to come off the kick of the \"Big Thetan\" idea, see? You follow me? \"The Big Thetan built light, and you can only experience light and you don't have anything else to do with light except experiencing light, therefore you're a total effect, brother. Lie down.\" See? You get how these tricks are worked? Well, in education and so forth, you'll find out that it's very safe to advance from a ba-sic premise or a basic assumption, and to make it very clear what basic assumption you are advancing from, and then not try to spread this assumption over into a thousand different things. They have assumed, in physics, the conservation of energy. Well, let them talk about that loud and clear and then let them not talk about the organization of mass. Because they've merely started from the conservation of energy. They haven't said anything about mass. But now they try to drag in mass by saying mass is merely a bunch of energy. Why did they do that? Because their basic assumption is the conservation of energy. \"Energy can neither be made nor destroyed, by anybody, particularly you.\" See, that's the basic assumption of phys-ics. So this naturally is energy, see? Now, it's not the conservation of space, it's not the conservation of time and it's not the conservation of mass. So now everything, then, has to become energy because they've started out with their basic assumption. Therefore they themselves become blind to where their sub-ject took off, and therefore where it'll err. It's going to depart, see? The second something comes up which is not energy, it's going to exceed the basics of finite physics and that's all that's wrong with that because they didn't start with anything but energy, don't you see?

So you're not a body. That's very simple. We don't do this very often and don't require you to do it as one of your class exercises because it makes people sick and unhappy. But it does happen and it does work. All right, so we start out with the basic building block of the universe: a thetan. Now, we're on fairly solid ground there, but of course having done that we are now exceeding all former basic assumptions which start subjects. Now, in trying to communicate this idea, then, we collide with all preconceptions. We collide with everything in the background of people, we collide with all of their upsets in the past, with practically everything under the sun. We can only go, then, in the direction of proc-essing. We can't go in the direction much of the theory and philosophy of the universe be-cause the only way we will really win is in the direction of processing, handling and doing something with the unit because the unit is not educatable at a degraded state. See, that's ele-mentary. So, unfortunately then, we have to know about all there is to know and know it bet-ter than anybody has ever had to know anything before, particularly about education because we can't teach anybody to do it. You're tackling a very tough subject. It's a very easy subject. You're tackling essen-tially a very tough subject, in Scientology, which has been made as easy as possible. And my efforts have been devoted to, in the last few months, in studying study, to make it even easier. Now, I haven't told you very much in this lecture that you can use, but I've told you something that you might have some inspective relationships with, you know? Well let's say, a whole school system of a country miseducated all the youth of this country with malice aforethought. They would get to a point where they couldn't receive a datum. So, they're in a war, and, the enemy – the enemy sends them a despatch and says, \"We are going to attack tomorrow morning,\" but they can't receive a datum. They've got it that plain and clear, see, and they are all in bed, and they all get shot down in flames and that's the end of the country, see? It gets down to the reductio ad absurdum of not being able to observe anything, not be able to perceive anything, not be able to understand anything and have no ARC with anything, which looks to me like a sort of a \"thetan death\" situation. So, it looks to me like there is a great deal of comparison between miseducation and aberration. And it also looks to me that a great deal of work could be put in on this field from a standpoint of deaberrating people at the lower levels. I'll give you an example, just offhand: \"Tell me –\" this would not be a repetitive process – but, \"Tell me a word that you have not understood in this life.\" And then you make the guy go ahead and clarify it. I think you'd get some of the most interesting resurgences. I think some of the many of the personal problems of the individual would blow up in smoke. But here, just on this other subject of study – of studying the subject of study – one walks forth with a brand-new avenue of lower-level disentanglement and lower-level therapy lines which look quite promising; they look quite promising. But what I'm mainly interested in is you, a Scientology pro training people, have to know something about this subject.

We were testing out the walkie-talkies we will not use on London Airport. Imagine, using walkie-talkies on London Airport, you know, with the radio control tower. We have a rig up so that we can handle photographic flash lamps at a distance with a little walkie-talkie – very tricky. And we're getting very cunning. And the – I can just hear it now though: \"Impact pictures coming in for a landing on the north runway. What is our aperture, please?\" [laughter, laughs] Very funny. The difference between professional and amateur photography is a chasm wide and you have to go at it in particular wild ways on the professional front. It requires permission of nobody less than the Ministry of Aviation and that sort of thing, in order to move, practically, in the vicinity of aircraft in England, and so on. Have to produce credentials, you know, like a deck of cards and all that sort of thing, so forth. The ministry has granted us permission to go up and shoot the incoming landing of a hypothetical student, you see, so that all of your views of the airport and what you saw of England, and so forth, that's what I'm going up and shoot, in two or three weeks, just for fun. So those snapshots you took that didn't come out, I can give you some copies. [laughter] That's snide, you know? I'm showing you the proper Scien-tology attitude toward a learning or beginning Scientologist, you see? All right, what's the date? Audience: August 11th. August the 11th, AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Okay. And we're going to resume our lectures on the subject of study and the more I talk about study the better your grades get, and so this is very fine. This is one of the most successful lines of lectures I think I've ever engaged upon – most productive of cata... cata-clysmic and colossal results – really fabulous. So that I have not sweat through – \"You take the sodium bichloride and you put it into the bichromate and you get bisulfite, because it pre-cipitates negatives,\" you know, and so on... I remind you that about late spring I decided to study study and find out what study was all about and so on and go on along this particular line – and – now, talking about study, your grades keep going up the more I talk about study. Well, that's very interesting, because I'm not restimulating you; study doesn't happen to be an end word.

But it is not directly"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 2 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 308 HPCS connected with words and so forth, and isn't the basic reason why people have any difficulty at all with study. All right. There is no particular reason then that knowledge should get in your road because the casus belli (as the hootch dancer said) is a very, very deep-seated thing called \"words.\" Now, you may even think there is an end word called \"words,\" or something of the sort. But of course, all GPMs are composed of words. They're actually not composed of Eng-lish words; they're composed of significances which are connected to masses. These masses are very capable of pushing somebody's 'ead off. And where you have precise significances – and it's quite interesting how precise these significances are – where you have very precise significances, you don't get too much upset. In other words, don't look at it the other way to; don't look at it on the basis that if you avoid end words a hundred percent you will make it, see? That's actually the incorrect look; it's the locks which do you in. The offbeats, do you see? Now, you really shouldn't be terribly concerned of – about this as a Scientologist. The electrician gets used to handling 10,000 volts, the circus performer thinks that it's quite noth-ing to pat lions on the nose – I call to your attention that the public at large look at an electri-cian handling some voltage lines, or something like that, and they're horrified, see? And you look at a lion trainer in a cage – they hate to be called lion tamers because those lions are never tame; a tame lion is the last thing you want around, you see? So they want good, savage lions. Patting those on the nose and so forth, the public looks and they say 'Aaghhh!' But as a matter of fact, they would feel rather uncomfortable if they didn't have some big cats around to snap whips at, you know? I mean the lion trainer would. This is the life he lives. And the public at large, not being initiated into this, of course, is horrified and properly stunned by the lion trainer's association with the big cats in the cage. Clyde Beatty, for instance, used to fight forty lions and tigers simultaneously, mixed. And I should imagine that he lay off of that for a few days, why he would have felt very, very poor, you know, he would have felt bored and life would have seemed uninteresting to him. Now, there are many other professions and many other activities, and so forth. You wonder how in the name of God a dentist can stand there pulling teeth day after day after day after day. Fantastic, but he can. You wonder how a surgeon can stand there cutting out guts and throwing the offal in the garbage can hour after hour, you see? Year after year. How come? What are all these things? Well, these things are what is known as professional famili-arities. And if you get familiar enough with a particular subject, it may look terribly danger-ous and upsetting to somebody else, but is not really dangerous or upsetting to you. This is quite remarkable. In any particular field or activity one is apt to become quite superhuman. That is what's being demanded of you in Scientology. I'm not talking about whether you get better or whether you become Clear or OT or anything else; I'm just talking on a very down-to-earth, rock-bottom sort of an approach. GPM words are the lions, the high voltage, the various other professional danger points with which you live in Scientology: the words, the words of the GPMs and that sort of thing. Now, you take these words and you go out and throw them in the teeth of the public out here, see?

He wants to wrong things, and so forth. Just keep going at it, you know, you – \"Wrong this and wrong that\" and keep pounding it into him and all of a sudden he'll start \"Yeah-ah-ah.\" Well, he goes – walks out someplace and falls on his head – true! And he's liable to get quite ill and that sort of thing. All right, well, he's just not used to lions, do you see? He couldn't even trace it back to why he feels so ill; he knows nothing about this. Well, this is a rather happy area to be a pro-fessional in; because life is – consists of livingness, and livingness has a lot to do with the mind. In fact there wouldn't even be anything here to live in, or any living to do, unless a mind was around, you see? So the business – the business of being in the business of the mind, and so forth, has liabilities. But it has, of course, a great many things that are very good. And when you start fooling around with GPMs, you know very well you can knock your head off – you know very well that this is not something to lightly fool with. You know very well what they can do to somebody. You see somebody around on crutches gimping around, he's got arthritis – ar-thritis exclamation point, you see, and so on. What's the matter with him? Well, he's just all wound up in a GPM someplace; that's really all that is wrong with him. If even – even if it's an engram, why, it's held in place with a GPM. That's the way he lives, that's what's going on with... All right, why is this couple having an awful hard time maritally? Well, they've just got a couple of end words crossed up one way or the other; one is riding one hobby horse and one is riding the other one, you know, and that sort of thing. Well, if you tried to explain it to them that it was an end word that was doing this sort of thing – you could probably slip it off of them on a meter, if you didn't try to explain it to them. This – well, just let's take a couple of hypothetical end words: let's say that he was \"conservative,\" you see, and she had an end word \"wild.\" Now, these two end words won't mix and they are both in high-blown howl, you see, on this subject. So he's being conservative and she's being wild. All right, never the twain shall meet. So the upshot is that they're going to lead a very unhappy life. Now, you could probably, without their ever finding anything out about it really, pick up that it was \"conservative\" on the meter; probably get his considerations about being conservative, have this end word blow. You could take ahold of her, you could proba-bly pick up \"wild\" on the meter, particularly if you had the total prearranged list of end words, you could probably key it out, get her considerations on this, and so forth. They'd walk out of there perfectly happy with each other and a miracle would have been performed. They would never be able to trace it even back to a word. Their ability to recognize what has happened to them – even that is far below their familiarity level. They have no familiarity with this thing, you see? You've heard people go around and say: \"Well, it doesn't matter, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never...\" Oh yeah? [laughter] Now, the liability – the professional liability of the Scientologist – is the fact that he's dealing with significances and he's dealing with masses; and you connect the right or slightly"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 4 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 310 HPCS wrong mass with the right or slightly wrong significance and you get this mismatched one way or the other and you get catastrophe, and that's the way life – she is lived. And you want to know about \"What is human behavior? What are the basics – ele-ments of existence? What makes matter stay here?\" The con... physicist out there, he is busy studying conservation of matter – or conservation of energy rather – he's busy studying con-servation of energy – conservation of energy. He is just going on with this, on with this, on with this. Oh, he's just riding an end word, man. And he's riding himself into the ground. Sooner or later – why he's going to strike \"to kill all energy\" or something of this sort and – as his interpretation of a GPM and build an atom bomb – something like this. He's got to do something, you see, in this particular line. He gets – he becomes obsessed along the line. There are GPMs that have to do with pictures. I am very well aware of the fact that there's a whole series of GPMs that I haven't run, that have to do with pictures. And since I became aware of this, they don't have anything to do with me skull. You know, they don't knock my head off at all. Once in a while I find myself studying something and they have said \"pictures\" about five or six times too many in the paragraph and I find I have a tiny headache begin to grow on me, and I say \"Oh.\" Look at the paragraph: \"Oh!\" you know, gone. The – this – this situation, then, that could have wrecked empires – one end word crosswise, you see, could have wrecked an empire – to you becomes a minor discomfort. You find you have a bellyache and you – something like this – and you've been processing somebody or doing something – you find that you have a bit of a stomachache and you wonder what – \"What's the stomachache?\" you know? Afterwards you notice you got a stomachache. You suddenly realize you've been invalidating an end word. That's the quickest way in the world to get yourself a stomachache. You think, \"Maybe there is an end word 'women'?\" Well now, if you invalidate that you're probably all right because there isn't one; GPMs predate the idea of men and women, but there is one \"bodies.\" And supposing you've got one \"bodies,\" don't you see? And you invalidate the idea of bodies, well, you're going to have yourself a nice stomachache. You say there is no end word \"bodies,\" when there is an end word \"bodies,\" and of course, about that time – it sometimes takes minutes or even a half an hour or two, for this to begin to sneak up on you. \"What was going on, what was going on?\" you say to yourself. \"Well, let's see, about a half an hour ago I was studying about bodies, I said they didn't exist. Tuh-huh! Well, I now know there is one end word anyway called 'bodies'.\" Total reaction. Somebody else's reaction: \"Oh my God! Call Doctor Cutwin! Ohhh! I've got to have an operation on me esophagus or me stomach, or something of the sort. I've got to have some-thing drastic done to me, because look how drastic – in what drastic condition I am in!\" Don't you see? And an incomprehensibility way down below any level of knowingness on this thing, they become the total effect of these things. For instance, we just upset numerous Scientologists down in Australia because we had to fight back against the Laborite Party. The Laborite Party was the one who proposed the bill to outlaw Scientology in the state of Victoria. So I decided that they had lived too long and they don't come to the inquiry very much anymore. They as a matter of fact found out that Scientologists could cause them to come within an ace of losing all the seats they had. I wrote"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 5 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 311 HPCS out a little pamphlet and I've carefully put in it the exact proper end words. [laughter] This was circulated – this was circulated – they came within an ace of losing their lives in this election and that was it. But of course, some Scientologists down there who were afraid to shoot at somebody and who weren't in the know, and so forth, continued to write me on my Standing Order Number 1 line: \"That was a terrible thing to do.\" They didn't know anything about the end word, that was – see, they are not trained up to this – not oriented in this area yet, \"That was a terrible thing to do, because you really shouldn't put entheta, you see, on a theta line, like a nice Scientology magazine.\" And it's all – and they're sort of protesting, you know, that this pamphlet that came out and was generally issued in Australia against the La-borite Party – was issued at all. They don't realize what they're protesting against. Some of those end words hit them; they aren't trained, they aren't in the know, and so, of course, it made them feel kind of queasy and they want to know who wrote it. Well, I haven't told them yet, I wrote it. But it produced the exact effect that it was supposed to produce, which, \"to drive those dogs back in their kennels,\" and it did exactly that. They are much less enthusiastic these days. As a matter of fact, they are becoming sorrier and sorrier that they ever started this inquiry and that is the proper effect to produce on somebody who is attacking you is just make them very, very sorry that they attack you. That's the proper way to handle it in this universe, see? United States government is getting into that frame of mind now on the E-Meter case, see? They are beginning to sit around and wonder why in the name of God they ever lost their wits to such a degree as to start this thing in the first place, because they can't prepare a case, because none of their facts are correct and their charges are all wrong and they're silly, but if they let this case go to court, they let themselves in for a recovery of damages that may run into the millions. They're now in trouble. Well, how do you make people in trouble? Well, you just make them sorry they done it, that's all. Now, the psychiatrist and psychologist and so forth, are very busy in the world today on the field of motivational research, what they call motivational research; very interesting subject. I recommend to every Scientologist and particularly people who are engaged in pro-motion activities, something – in organizations, to read a book called Hidden Persuaders. Now, that is a very interesting book. Although it tries to make mock of the idea of \"hidden persuaders,\" and so forth, down in between the lines it gives you a very thorough dissertation on the techniques now being used by modern advertising agencies and other people engaged in reaching the public. And they hire these days psychiatrists and so forth, to do motivational research and find out a bunch of goofy facts. Well, most of their facts are goofy because they don't know why people are. They don't know what make people tick and that sort of thing. But if a Scientologist reads that, particularly a Saint Hiller and particularly somebody who is moving around in the vicinity of Class VI, see, he reads that – now just reinterpret that whole thing. They've laid a foundation, they've got a beautiful piece of music, they've got no words to the music, don't you see? They've got a marvelous idea that maybe they can influ-ence and affect people one way or the other but they don't know what words to put to the tune. They're still groping around in their Freudian analysis and trying to motivate soap by getting a libido complex going on the age of three, see? They're trying to restimulate some-thing one way or the other in order to sell their soap. And they haven't got the buttons, let me"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 6 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 312 HPCS put it this way, you see. They're playing a piano without any keys. They're still making noise on it. I don't know how they're managing it but one way or the other they're making noise on it. Now actually, that is one of the highest paid activities in the world today – is the world of advertising and merchandising. That is the high – one of the highest paid activities in the world today. They are pouring out a terrific avalanche of money into the pockets of psychia-trists and so forth these days in order to find out what makes people tick. Of course, they're not on basic – really basic research. They're still flying around in kindergarten stuff, don't you see? But here these fellows are, trying to reach the public, trying to sell products and so forth and they have turned to the psychiatrist and psychologist in order to give them the answers. Well, they turned the wrong way and like any other boot soldier in an awkward squad, why, they'll probably get booted for it. They lose money on this every once in a while and they make mistakes. But you start adding that up – if you really know the mind – and you wonder then that anybody would ever have any difficulty with dissemination. Now, this material, of course, is a debased – I mean, this type of use is a debased use of this information. It would debase your knowledge of the field of the mind just to use it to sell somebody some preserved piglets or something, see? This is silly, see? This is something like using a Mercedes car to crack walnuts. This situation, then, is not – not recommended to you as an activity. I'm simply pointing out some minor activity that's going on in the world today that is absorbing a great deal of money from the manufacturers – that has a bang – tremendous bang from each magazine. You turn on the TV set, you are looking at motivational research. You turn – open a magazine, you're looking at motivational research. You open up a newspaper and read its ads, you're looking at motivational research. You can look at an election, you realize those candidates in that election are running by motivational research. As a matter of fact, Eisenhower won the campaign in the United States when he was elected president be-cause of the work of an advertising agency in the field of motivational research and they found that the country was starved for a father image, so they set him up for a father image and of course he got elected. Actually he was a pretty good father image, if fathers do nothing but read Western stories. But they set this boy up in that fashion. Now, that's the way the world is moving. Now, if you want to know – if you want to know how to live calmly in the midst of a tremendous confusion all you really have to know is the answers – the basic answers; and if you know the basic answers, these things ninety percent of the time don't worry you and the other ten percent of the time you can do some-thing about them. Do you follow me? Knowledge is something that is achieved – end word or no end word – it is something achieved through study. Now, the whole subject of words booby-traps a person's effort to find out what's going on, to find out what the world consists of. Words – it's a boobytrapped line: significance. What is this? How do you find out about anything? Well, you're going to find out something about something these days with words. Information is going to be relayed with words; you're"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 7 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 313 HPCS going to find out about things with words and those words are booby-trapped. They match up the GPMs – the woof and warp of the mind. They've got the mind pushbuttoned. Now, the mind is terrifically push-buttoned so that if you are reading: \"The cat was black,\" and feel queer or feel repelled by this statement, \"The cat is black,\" if you don't know what you're doing, you simply are repelled by the subject of studying \"cats,\" or of studying or acquiring knowledge about \"cats,\" or anything of that sort of thing, see? In other words, you've got a barriered line, because you read the statement, \"The cat is black,\" you feel odd, therefore you say, \"I mustn't study about cats,\" see? Actually, it has nothing to do with cats; it's the word \"black\" happens to be an end word. You nearly always find yourself assigning to the wrong part of a sentence or the wrong part of the study material the reason why you can't study it, because the other is some-thing one isn't confronting and one doesn't feel he can confront, so therefore he disperses and confronts something else. Now, that is the basic principle you should know about knowledge and study: One, that even if you are simply looking at a tree to find out something about the tree, you are studying a tree. I don't care how briefly this is done, study isn't something being used here in connection with being very, very thoughtful and thorough, and so forth. You look over this tree to see what kind of a tree it is. Well, in that brief instance you've studied the tree, don't you see? In other words, you observed it to find something else out about it. Now, you can pick up observation from the printed page; that's a secondhand observa-tion but it nevertheless is the route on which almost all knowledge travels, since if you, indi-vidually, were called upon to re-evolve all the knowledge there was from the beginning of the world until now, all by your little ol' lonesome, you'd wind up stupid in this lifetime. I don't mean to be harsh, that's true. If you were called upon personally and individually to evolve all knowledge there was about anything, in one lifetime, you would get so little way upon that route – you understand, that's without having any other person relay anything to you, without having at your fingertips any works, texts, any reference books of any kind. That you were just going to have to do it all on your little ol' lonesome by thinking it up and evolving it, and so forth, and you were going to evolve all the knowledge and you weren't going to have any receipt of information from any other secondhand observation. In other words, you want to learn about volcanoes, well, you have to go and find a volcano. You would get so little done on this project that you would die stupid, I can assure you of that. Or you would be a ruddy fool and believe that you knew everything there was to know about the one room that you had been in that whole lifetime. Do you follow me? So there is a value to secondhand knowledge. Now, firsthand knowledge, of course, is acquired by direct observation and experience. But even to achieve direct observation and experience, it is really much better to have the fruits of other observations and experience with which to profit and only in that way can you maintain and carry forward a culture of any magnitude. Illiterate cultures do not survive and they are not very high. The natives of the tribe of the Bugga-Bugga Booga-Boogas down in Lower Bugga-Wugga Booga-Woog are mostly no longer with us or they are around waving red flags today and revolting against their central"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 8 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 314 HPCS government. They're having a bad time. Well, the British Tommy that went down there with his Snider or his Lee-Enfield and brought them higher education in the first place – was only occasionally followed by anybody who taught them anything. And they didn't learn fast. Their literacy was not up to absorbing culture rapidly. So, of course, they can be victimized by any-body who comes along. Once the line is open, if literacy doesn't follow and if secondhand observation is not available to a people, they stultify, they die, they go to pieces, they degrade. They are struck by this tremendous volume of exterior culture. They've been very happily down amongst the bong-bong trees, you know, dancing up and down amongst the bong-bong trees and the high-est level of their interest, and so forth, was their own back yard. They could tell you all about bong-bong trees and they could tell you all about you mustn't step in bug-bug bushes, because you step on a thump-thump snake and this was their direct observation. The second they're hit with things – particularly the abstract ideas of organization – the abstract ideas of political philosophy – the abstract ideas of, really, engineering – things of this material nature where knowledge is moving in close to the MEST, you see, where the significance is immediately, directly applicable to the manipulation of matter – when they move in on that, of course, their culture fails. They are not able to turn out Lee-Enfield rifles. They are not able to organize themselves into a proper democratic civilization, no matter how many lend-lease payments are thrust into the paws of their greedy politicians. They can be victimized, they can be turned into slaves and they can be degraded. What's happened? Well, they've been overwhelmed and presented with this tremen-dous cultural image. Here's this great, shiny civilization, you see? It's full of Cadillac cars and jet planes and electric razors and all kinds of wild things; and they look at this material ani-mated world; they see people have conquered their environment to the point where they can live at leisure and where they can do various things and where some girl can – with a few push buttons can control 125 horses as the most usual thing that she ever did in her life. You understand? In other words, she can drive a car. All right, all of these miracles all of a sudden hit these illiterate fellows, see, all these things! They don't know the words, see? They see the tune, but they can't sing it. And they go into just overwhelm – boom! They just cave right in, see? They just back right up. Somebody who is fully trained in Moscow has also been trained: \"Your brethren at home are pretty uneducated and if you push this button and that button and that button, they will respond and all of a sudden bring down the house and then we will be able to seize the whole place and get all the jute we need.\" I mean, the ethical and spiritual nature of communism is very interesting, you know? They're out of jute, so they put their political mechanisms into – run to get them some jute. Their interest in South Africa is simply and entirely the fact that they need diamonds and they want gold. I mean it's very spiritual. They love mankind for what they can get out of him and the way they play their violin is just about as cold-blooded as anybody ever did, see?

Boy, they know how to talk to this one, they know how to talk to that one and they know how to argue with some-body else and they know how to put together this and they know the parliamentary control of a small meeting. And they're taught to do this and they're taught to do that and they know how to shuffle the motion down to the bottom of the pile so it never gets heard and only the motion which they want heard is heard. They're just taught this very carefully, you see? Technology – technology – they're all taught this with words. They weren't in on the 1917 Revolution. They got the whole technology right straight on up the line by being taught it, by it being relayed to them with words, much as I'm relaying to you information and ideas with words. But it's all secondhand, it's all hearsay and for those boys it really works. They are taking the world. I see people standing around with their hands in their pockets in these Western gov-ernments, and so forth, not knowing what is going on, and it's something like a big, strong bull being chewed to pieces by a pack of small dogs. And this bull – he knows that a small dog can't do anything to him and so he's tried to ignore him – he tries to go on – he tries to do this. The next thing you know, he's going to be down with his throat cut. Well, he doesn't un-derstand what they're up to and he's above knowing. Something like this, you see? All kinds of attitudes mix into this. He's deficient in knowledge of communist technology, so therefore he is being defeated by communist technology. It's very, very interesting that this technology is relayed by word of mouth. It's taught. It's not by direct observation, but it's material that can be put into direct observation by the communist – trained communist here and there. The world today is being overwhelmed on the basis of illiteracy; the illiterate people of the world are being overwhelmed. It's always this, see? It's the fellow who doesn't know, it's those who do not understand, it's those who haven't got it taped who get knocked into the wastebasket. The death of a civilization is based upon its accumulated not-understandings – not-knowings – its ignorings – its failure to grasp the situation. It can also drift back into too many yesterday's clichés like: \"Well, the barbarians always come down on the northern fron-tier and go home at harvest time,\" you know? And one time they didn't go home at harvest time and that was the end of Rome, see? Rome at that time was illiterate on the subject of illiteracy: the barbarian. They didn't realize that their people had become very effete. Part of their information was missing: that a people who wishes to be free must not just know about the latest wine. They've got to know pretty well across the boards about most everything in sight. They've got to keep on the ball, they've got to keep on the qui vive, they've got to be right up there and alert. The day that marks your death is the day that you sit back and decide you know every-thing there is to know about everything there is around you, so there is no reason for you to observe anything anymore. Now, between the two points then of \"no observation necessary because I know every-thing,\" you see, and \"no observation possible because I don't know any of the words,\" there is a mean which makes life livable. You get what these two extremes are now? One is: \"I know there is everything to know. I know everything there is to know – I needn't observe anything. I needn't really experience or do or look at anything because I know all there is to know.\" Now, that would be the end product of a dying civilization or a dying individual. And on the"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 10 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 316 HPCS other extreme we have the: \"Don't know any of the words, don't know anything, don't under-stand anything that's happening in my vicinity,\" and so forth, and that's a very fast route to death, demise and decay, see? So the thing to do is to know the words and to stay alert. That's the motto one reads out of this thing. And you'll find out there's always some new technology being boiled up someplace. Well, be curious enough to find out about it, see? Stay alert. Never become com-placent about what you know and you'll go right on surviving very nicely. Now, this is particularly true of somebody who gets up to a point of eminence or prominence, somebody who moves up to a point where he is superior to the ordinary or more average individual in his vicinity – he tends to become very complacent. A fellow is living in the vicinity of the natives of Ugga-Bugga and he can read and they can't. Well, he feels very superior, so he really doesn't even bother to read. Do you see? Now, if Scientology faces any danger, it is that danger of stultifying because they no longer believe they have to observe, no longer have to apply, no longer have to get on the ball. Now, you want to know what's the difference between the successful individual and the unsuccessful individual: It is just that one can understand and do and the other one doesn't understand or doesn't... There are two ways of not understanding, as I've just told you. One is to suppose you know all about it so you don't have to observe; that's one method of not under-standing. And the other is just not know the words, you see? Those two extremes are there. So, the individual doesn't understand and he goes off into a – in other words, he doesn't un-derstand, so he quits trying – or he understands all there is, he thinks, and so doesn't bother to observe. Now, those two actions there amalgamate into a fellow who – either one of them – who is going to fail. This individual is going to go by the boards. Now, who won't go by the boards, then? Well, it's somebody who can observe and un-derstand and do – a person who can observe and understand and do. Now, in view of the fact that the greatest body of observation is actually secondhand observation, realize that that is perfectly valid observation, when coupled with understand-ing – but that is particularly and peculiarly liable to having to be understood. Now, the less direct the observation then, the greater the understanding has to be. In other words, your un-derstanding has to increase to the degree that you're not directly observing. Understanding has to increase in the degree that the observation is indirect. If your observation of a tree is indi-rect, you'd better jolly well understand about that tree, pretty confounded well. As a matter of fact, much better, oddly enough, than if you were standing there looking at it. Now, understanding then is a substitute for mass and you have the answer to under-standing in ARC. Understanding adds up to ARC. In study, understanding is a substitute for mass. Now, let's go over that again: If you haven't got a tree to observe and you are being told about a tree, then you'd better jolly well understand what you're being told, otherwise you're going to misobserve the tree. Now, if you don't understand what you are being told about the tree or you don't understand how the information is being relayed to you about the tree, you will wind up not understanding a tree and have been denied that mass, because the informa-tion received on a via. Do you follow this?"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 11 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 317 HPCS This is very complex material I'm giving you here, but is quite useful. If you can't – if you haven't got a tree to look at, then you jolly well – if you are trying to study about trees on a second relay, then you damn well better understand that second relay. Now, there are two things to understand about what you're being told or what you are reading or what your secondhand observation is. See, secondhand observation can be after the fact because of time, too, you understand that? You say: \"There must have been a tree here, because here is a stump,\" you know? \"And there's going to be a tree here, because here is a sprout.\" Do you see that? That your understanding also can go forward and backward in time and it can be direct or indirect in terms of view. So understanding can be direct or indirect in terms of view. You can be there looking at the tree or somebody can be telling you about the tree. So there's two – there's actually several different understandings all in a packet. Now, that's not to our purpose, right now, to examine how many types and brands of understanding there are, but I'm just warning you on this fact with regard to study and this is the only point I'm really trying to make to you. The other is just window dressing and cake frosting. It's interesting, the whole subject is very interesting, but it's this: If you are not ob-serving something directly, if you are reading about trees – you got that? – you're not observ-ing it directly, then your understanding has to be superior to the understanding which would be required in a direct observation. You've got to be more – you've got to understand it better, otherwise you're going to lose yourself a tree. Now, this is quite interesting, because the difficulties of secondhand information are innumerable. You've got four men trying to describe an elephant, four blindfolded men that have felt all over an elephant and they're trying to describe this elephant or whatever that old saw was, don't you see? And the wise men that give you all the dope of what an elephant is all about, you know? And they didn't observe the elephant because they were blindfolded and they gave the most wild dissertations on what this elephant was. So now, let's realize that part of our understanding when we are engaged in secondhand observation – which is to say study on a via or something – we are engaged upon this – then our understanding must include an evaluation of the reliability of the information we are being given. You follow that? Our un-derstanding must include the understanding of whether this is good dope or bad dope, whether this is the straight data or this is – got a – data with a curve. In other words, we have to be capable of evaluating the truth of the relayed observation. Understanding then, must include that. And there is where the bulk of sentient beings – I won't just say man, because there are other sentient beings – fall down, and there is where they get crosswise, there is where they really have a time. Well, I'll give you a marvelous example: There are people walking all over the place today and so on and so on and they think that everything in the field of the mind is all cared for. \"See, when a little child is three years old, why he got – he got excited about something or other, he's been sick and that's why he's in the insane asylum and doctors understand all about this and everybody understands it and so forth and yah, yah, yah, the problem's all cared for.\" Well, we're in that state of the civilization where they say they're not only saying, \"we know,\" they're also saying, \"somebody else knows, and we don't have to know.\" Hey-"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 12 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 318 HPCS hey, what's this? What's – what kind of apathy is this? \"We don't even have to know anymore. It's all right that somebody else someplace knows, that there are some authorities someplace on this subject.\" I quote Eisenhower. He always depended on having an authority. The best source of information was always an authority on the subject and he never did anything without – he consulted an authority and it went along with this that he didn't have to know a blessed thing about anything. There was never even a communication signal corps unit to keep him advised on mo-ments of national crisis or anything else, when he was out playing golf or anything. There was no information lines ever run through this man. He got his national policies out of Newsweek. He did! He'd gotten to a point of where the expert was a newspaper reporter. Well, I admit newspaper reporters are pretty good and they all think that if left up to them, they can straighten everything out in a minute, but it seems rather interesting to have newspaper re-porter policy being the dominant policy of a nation. They might really be trying to sell soap, you see? It might be motivational research entering in here, you know. You couldn't really trust that piece of information. So, part of your understanding is what you're understanding – the falsity or correctness of your data sources – or what you're trying to understand. So, study has as part of it, comprehension of the accuracy of your source of informa-tion and you've got to have some idea of that. And that's an experiential line itself. You say, \"Well, this fellow tells me what he believes to be true and if he no longer believes it to be true or if he finds something else is true, why, he will tell me.\" Something like that. You say, \"All right. Well, that's that source of information and that's a good source of information. There's this other source of information, if he tells me something, why, he's just confoundedly certain that he's got to shove it down my throat in some particular line. It might be right and it might be wrong, but he will continue to tell me just because he has to be right.\" Something like this, you see? Since I've just gotten through three textbooks – three textbooks written by a professor at Columbia University who never had color film in his hands in his life, I'm sure, who was writing on color photography... I had to study these and I had to know my business. I was going to be examined on this. I shot more color film than this man ever heard of. But here was a case where I had to study something to get a grade. I understood that. See, I understood the fact that I had to study this in order to get a grade. You get the subtlety then of the study that went on. Also began to be understood this guy loved to show off. He loved to show off; he would introduce some ninety-dollar word of a technical nature, which wasn't included in any dictionary, into the middle of a sentence where it didn't have to be. Oh, boy, if that doesn't throw you. Now, right in the middle of that sentence you've got a word like \"colored cou-plers.\" He says, I quote, \"We are now going to introduce a new term, 'colored couplers,' which I will explain later.\" He never explained it. You look up in the photographic dictionary. \"What is this thing: a 'colored coupler'?\" And you can't find it. It's not in there. You look eve-rywhere and you can't find it. What are you supposed to do? Just lie down and die at this"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 13 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 319 HPCS point? No, your understanding has to embrace the fact that the silly ass didn't know what he was talking about, if nobody can define it. Well, maybe someplace somebody's going to de-fine it but it includes you don't have to know what it is in order to continue. Now, that is also a very interesting thing to do, because you go past one of these points of understanding and you know you're going to have trouble; but part of study is to know the technology of study and to know if you start developing a headache in the next half page it's because you didn't understand that word. Do you understand? In other words, your understanding of understanding can get very subtle indeed. You can get very, very tricky. You are reading about the engineering works of the early Egyptians, which have been written by a modern engineer who is also a lecturer at Massachusetts Insti-tute of Technology and should have been flunked for English. He can't write – maybe he can build bridges, but he can't write. (If he's teaching at MIT, he probably can't build bridges ei-ther.) But anyhow, there he is and you want to learn something about the bridge building of the early Egyptians, see, and this thing is strewn with words that have to do with stresses and strains of various kind and torsional – gahhh! And then when he really wishes to be clear, he all of a sudden gives you four paragraphs of solid integral calculus, without giving you what any of the letters he's using in the integral calculus refer to. I've got a book on color reproduction upstairs, written by some Englishman that did this. It's marvelous. You get simultaneous equations, of all things in calculus, and this is sup-posed to explain something. Of course, what I did was not worry about the fact that I didn't understand it. I just laughed in his face via his textbook. In other words, I wasn't so obsessed on the line that I couldn't skip it and I was sufficiently informed on the subject of study that I knew if I ran into a liability of having skipped it, I knew what the liability would be, see, so I could go back and run it out if it got in my road. In other words, I could walk through this bunch of bayonets. Do you understand? Audience: Yeah. Well, you could get that clever about study, see? All right, well, that's actually going to high school before you get to kindergarten, really, on the subject of study, but I'm showing you about where it extends to. You can get clever enough to read an MIT lecturer's dissertation in full panoply of engineering terms on the bridges of the ancient Egyptians without actually looking up a single blasted one of his confounded technical terms and survive right on to the end of the dissertation and, what do you know? Know something about the bridges! Now you're clever. The latest editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica require this as a fine art, because all they're doing is showing off to the people of the profession. They've been so criticized by landscape architects for their articles on landscape architecture, that they now have written a professional piece on landscape architecture. Nobody can understand it but a landscape archi-tect. Well, a landscape architect isn't ever going to look it up in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. [laughter] And that applies to nearly all of their very professional dissertations. That's why I... They've changed their style."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 14 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 320 HPCS The modern style is to become incomprehensible and to say, \"Somebody else knows about it,\" and then try to impress it and leave it all skipped and then, you know, say, \"Well, if you're not an expert you're nothing – and there are experts around, so we're all perfectly...\" It's all kind of a mishmash – decadence is what you're really looking at. Now, I use an old 1890 edition. You read about landscape architecture in the old 1890 edition and it knew it was written for some fool that didn't know their nomenclature, see? You can find out what you want to know; but later editions, you can't. Soon that 1890 edition will become so antique, why, it won't be of any use anymore and then I won't have any encyclope-dia left, see? I'll have to do something desperate by that time, by – I don't know, substitute for it with some vast library of stuff. Oh – oh, yes. I know. Quentin's getting a whole bunch of text-books and I'll keep collecting those. I've just solved it. He's getting all kinds of textbooks: The Boy's Book of Electronics, you know? The Boy's Book of something or other. You open these things up, it's actually \"Integral Calculus Made Easy for 6-Year-Olds,\" you know. [laughter] Actually, they're way over his head. I don't know how anybody did that, but he does all right with these things. Crazy business! Yes, they're – they've got a penchant going that it's all right to make it easy for children to understand it, so I can collect a child's library and I'll be all set. That's what I'll do. Maybe the children can't understand it, but I will be able to. Anyway, sources of information all add up, then, to comprehensibility and words form the woof and warp of any professional or technical area. Specialized words are used for spe-cialized observations. Now, we move off into the field of specialized observations, as a spe-cialist, which is perfectly fine. But where you are lightly tapping some field for just a mo-ment's understanding and you collide with specialist vocabulary, you are lost at once. Now, it gives you an idea at once of the very unserious student of Scientology. One of the first things he does is complain about the nomenclature. Well frankly, we have less no-menclature than we're entitled to as a specialized field. Because nobody understood anything about the mind, how could they have any vocabulary about it? And they didn't have any vo-cabulary about it and if we'd used their lousy vocabulary, we would have misunderstood eve-rything, because those words meant other things. So actually, this bird stands around and starts complaining about our vocabulary. Now we know at once that he's not a serious student of Scientology. That's the first thing we know about this person: he's not a serious student of it. He's a dilettante; he wants to hang around the edges and pick up a few scraps. You recognize the brute now? He wants a few scraps. He really doesn't want it, because you've got to sweat for nomenclature, because the nomencla-ture is carrying with it a specialized understanding and unless you've got that specialized un-derstanding, you will never get the technology. Now, there's the difference between knowing about something and being a pro. There's a vast difference. And there's many a chap today walking around who is pretending to know a great deal about something who oddly enough isn't even vaguely educated in that par-ticular field, and so forth. But it's sort of a \"thing\" to be a sort of a dilettante – that's a modern trend."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 15 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 321 HPCS For instance, what's a medical doctor but a dilettante in the field of the mind? Really very much so! He's just – he's superficial – nobody. The effrontery of them! Six hours of lec-ture, they get up here on some hospital alongside of the Thames, as I have mentioned before; and this is their entire education on the field of the mind. But because they have a general practitioner's license it gives them carte blanche in the field of the mind. It sounds crazy, but it is true. That's what it is. So, the society at large is not – has gotten so dispersed that it does-n't mind calling somebody an authority who doesn't know anything about it at all. Because that is the authority on the field of the mind – he was taught for six hours. This is their skeleton in their closet, by the way. This is why they raised the devil with us for so many years about how well we were trained, and so forth, and we actually – in any given week an Academy student anywhere in the world was learning more about the mind, in that week per hours of invested time, than a medical doctor got in his entire career. In one week! Now, the effrontery of these boobs in trying to tell us that we were untrained in the field of the mind and so forth. No, no, we are not untrained in the field of the mind, we are practically the only people who are trained in the field of the mind. Now, there are other fields that are trained in the field of meat or neurones or something like this, as in psychology or brain surgery or something. But they are trained in the field of meat, they are not trained in the field of the mind. I'll give them that they are specialists on meat, all right! Somebody gets a bullet in his skull and so forth, they can probably do something about it. Well, all right, don't – let's not though pretend, because we can take a bullet out of somebody's skull, that we now know about the mind, because in the first place it didn't go into his mind – it went into his skull. Now, this was a slight difference, you see, in nomenclature. Now, what I'm trying to bring home to you here, is there are various grades at which a subject can be approached. You can approach it as a dilettante: \"Oh well, I know all about painting. Yes, yes, I had a course in art appreciation in junior high school, one whole semes-ter. And the teacher stood up and showed us pieces of lithography on a piece of cardboard and – I got so I could call Rembrandt nearly every time. I got very clever at art appreciation, so I know a great deal about art.\" Well, that must have consisted of what? One or two or three hours a week, for maybe – I don't know – what's a semester? Sixteen weeks, something like that. Which made a total – he looked at pictures for fifty or sixty hours and now he's an art specialist. Well, of course, that's better than somebody out in the street that never heard of them; not much, but it's better. But it gives somebody the interesting idea that he now knows something about it, when he doesn't know a ruddy thing about it. It gives him a curious and very dangerous attitude to his own future knowledge. It gives him a false understanding. He now thinks he knows something about it. No, he knows the nomenclature of pictures. He doesn't know anything about art, he's never been taught anything about art. Nomenclature of pictures was what he would know. It isn't really the amount of time invested that gives you this, although I've been men-tioning time. It is more the seriousness with which it is approached. How much do you want to know about this? Do you want to know enough about this so you can talk about it? As would be very common on a Park Avenue debutante, don't you see? She could discuss art – how cute! At her coming-out party, if somebody happened to say, \"You look like a"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 16 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 322 HPCS Madonna,\" why she would know they weren't necessarily talking religion, you see? [laughter] See, art, see? All right, now let's move a little bit further into the field of art. Now, how seriously do they wish to approach this subject? Do they wish to understand something about this subject so that they just won't appear to be a dummy or do they want to understand enough about it so as to do something with it? Do they want to know how to use art to decorate a home? That is to say, how do you choose and match and hang pictures, and – you know, what do you do with these pictures, you know? We could go, not necessarily further in that direction, but along another path: A guy wants to know about art because of the threatened inflation of the world, see? Threatened in-flation. You can buy land and you can – which isn't very movable – and you can buy gold, if you can get your hands on it and you're not an American citizen, and it will grow in price as the money of the community inflates. Or you can buy art. And art today is big business amongst people who know nothing about it as an artistic activity but as a financial invest-ment. And you would be amazed how big this business is. Well, does he want to know enough about art so that he knows whether or not the experts are cheating him? That's how far that fellow would want to go, see? He'd have to know enough about art to know who knew about art, so that he couldn't be tripped up in the field of art. Otherwise he'd lose his shirt, you see? Or do you want to know enough about art to move over into the field and maybe teach people art appreciation. Let's go a little bit further; we'd have to know a little bit more about art, wouldn't we? Now we're getting the lower grade instructional levels. Or do we want to know enough about art so that maybe, if we were very good, we could sit down with a piece of charcoal and a piece of paper and draw a vase with a narcissus in it? Now, we say, \"We've started back at the beginning again,\" because any kid in kindergarten is trying to draw a vase with a narcissus in it. We're back to the area of doingness. I'll call to your attention that that little kid in kindergarten almost never connects. It's wildly wonderful what comes up that is supposed to be a vase and so forth, but they have what is called an \"artistic talent\" or they have this or they have that and nothing is more easily destroyed because it isn't based on knowledge or understanding. This knack will leave him. It will fly out from underneath his fingers if he does happen to draw something. Very easy to trip him up. A thetan is very naturally creative, but he's actually handling certain media that he doesn't know much about. Now, you go into this again; you take yourself up a piece of black charcoal; you take yourself a white piece of paper and you set yourself down to draw a vase. Now your educa-tion begins. You know that if you change the position of your paper and the position of your head while you are doing that, you have changed the proportion of the vase. Well, now that takes some knowing, doesn't it? In other words, if you look at a vase close and then draw it for a while, you'll be drawing a big top, let us say, and then you sit back to relax and do the bottom and you've now got a small bottom; big top and a small bottom and it doesn't look right. But it looked all right to you. Well, your education on the subject of art began at that point: \"You 'old your 'ead still. That something has to do with the point I view from and the"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 17 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 323 HPCS distance I view to, has something to do with what I'm doing over here on this sheet of paper.\" Yeah, all right. Now you are heading for the long run, and you actually at that moment have begun the path of becoming a pro. Now, even if you did it for fun, you would still be on the path of becoming a pro. What's the next thing you're liable to learn on the thing? Well, you're liable to learn that if you draw one for one, it's dead easy, but if you try a reduction or an increase in size, that is if you draw size for size, if you draw the vase on your piece of paper the same size as the vase you see on the table, this is pretty lousy easy. But how do you make a one for one? Well, you mustn't change the relationship of the paper or tablet to the table. It's easy as that, you see? Now, most people can't draw still lifes for very interesting technical reasons: they are trying to do a reduction. They are trying to draw a big vase while looking at a little one, or draw a little vase while looking at a big one; and as they shift, they swivel their eyeball from the big vase to the drawn vase, they don't get a one for one size. See, they look at a big vase and try to do a little vase and of course they can't get the proportion because the size is al-ready wrong and this throws them. They don't know the easy route out, they don't know that, \"My God! That requires all kinds of wild mechanical and mathematical actions to take a big vase and to do a little miniature vase of this big – oh man!\" Now, you are getting \"creak, creak,\" see? Ah, dead easy. You set a vase over there and you get your paper here, and you get – so the paper looks now the same size as the vase – and you take out your charcoal and you draw the vase lines which you see there, the same size as you see here, you keep your 'ead where it belongs and you keep your tablet where it belongs and you keep your vase where it belongs and you go scroomp-scroomp, put in a couple of highlights, scroomp. And if you're not shaking with palsy, you will wind up with a nice sketch of a vase. I'm just showing you, there's these little pieces of technology, don't you see? Well, you're now on the route to being a pro. So, you might say that study which winds up only in understanding is not without value and is a large part of the cultural pattern which a society has. Study with no activity, let me put it that way. You don't intend to do anything about it, you're not going to do anything about it, that's just cute, that's interesting, isn't that nice? A tremendous quantity of the culture in which you live is understood to that degree and it's nice to know those things – if you've got to know a lot of those things. For instance, you don't know how to – have to know how to prepare or do the action of preparing an automobile, in order to know about automobiles, see? But you jolly well better know something about the action of repairing automobiles before you start paying somebody to repair the automobiles. In other words, you're at a point of regulated doingness, don't you see? Your understanding of it is sufficient so that you won't get gypped buying a \"Mona Lisa,\" because Joe just bought it yesterday, see? Now, therefore – therefore, your understanding – widely in life can embrace a great many things which you never intend to do. There's nothing wrong with that. But don't make a habit of that, see? Don't make a habit of that. If you're going down some line, go down some line, see? Don't stand around, for instance... Don't let some student – let me talk about Scien-tology for a minute – don't let somebody who walks into your PE, and so forth, keep standing around the edges of it.

They couldn't define an engram if you held a pistol on them, but they'll talk endlessly about Scientology, see? In fact, there are groups all over the place that do pract... that do nothing else. They never audit, they never go into action of any kind what-soever. Their command of the subject is merely an interest. Now, this is perfectly all right, perfectly all right, but don't leave them in a state of believing that they now know the subject. That would be the cruel thing to do to them. They don't. They don't and they get con-fused to the degree that they think, now, if they do so-and-so and such-and-such, why, then this somehow or another fixes them all up, so they know all about it. Now, it's at that point that a person's education starts to break down, because these people have dropped into what trap? It's just that one trap: \"They know all about it, see, so life can go on.\" Well, they don't know all about it, they don't know your level of understanding of it. My God! You've been grinding away at it and slamming away at it and delving in it and getting comprehensions of it, and so forth, and you know how much there is there to know, man! This character is saying, \"Well, I...\" so on. Well, if you followed through some of his logic, you would be fascinated. See, if you followed through some of his think and some of his statements and some of his doingnesses on this subject, if he did do anything on this sub-ject, you would practically cave in with laughter at times, because it's so far away from any-thing you could imagine anybody interpreting anything like that as. It's just a gone proposi-tion. Somebody will say, \"Well, I settled the dog, and I was using Scientology processing, and so forth. You know, I beat him.\" How the hell did we get over there, see? It's that goofy. But to let that person go on believing now, that he knows all about it, so therefore does not have to address it directly and seriously in order to achieve any doingness level in it, would be a very, very cruel thing to do to this person because he'd just have nothing but a failure. Here's this broad subject which is there, which if he did it at all properly, would give him results and he could go someplace and he could do something with this, do you see? But to have him sit there and think he knows all about it when he doesn't know anything about it, of course, is letting him fall into this other category. Also, to put him in the position where he thinks he can't know anything about it be-cause it's so vast and so difficult and – also is equally cruel, because you've artificially created the two reasons for the demise of an individual or a civilization. You've put him into a state of \"He is not only illiterate, but he is going to go right on being illiterate.\" \"Well, of course only a specialist could know that and so forth. And I don't see why you're asking for the definition of a word like that, because it really doesn't apply to what you are doing anyway. This is all pretty difficult, you know.\" I never follow such an approach. Some guy – if some guy comes up and asks me hos-tilely about something or other, I can't guarantee what he'll get back. I'm – it all depends on how I felt right at that moment. If I felt puckish about it, he's liable to go off packing a head-ache. But if he – if somebody asked me and they really want to know something – of course, you know me – I tell them, bang! like that, the best I could. Even though I didn't have any hope of their really understanding what I was talking about, I would still give them anything I"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 19 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 325 HPCS could tell them that I hope might assist their information or understanding of it. I always do something for them this way and usually, if somebody's just asking for information, why I let it go at that. But if they're asking for help and so forth, I always give them something to do, not only give them a piece of information, or an insight into it, if I possibly can, but I always give them something to do, too. You know? And you'd be surprised how workable this type of an approach is. Of course, if they ask you something hostilely or be nasty, or something like that, why just pull the trap, you know? I don't care what you do to them. Nobody de-mands of you that you be polite. Don't compromise your own communication lines. The only time I ever get embarrassed or anybody get embarrassed, is this person was asking me a silly question which sounded like a hostile question, but they really meant it and they were quite serious about it and then you find yourself immediately in the position of hav-ing been very nasty and very mean back, don't you see, when they didn't intend to be. You sometimes can get that one crossed up. That's rather easy to do. But doingness requires, of course, much, much, much more understanding than just lookingness. Doingness requires an awful lot of added understanding and when you go into doing a subject, it is sometimes very, very disappointing. Your first results – very disappoint-ing. Your understanding wasn't up to match the doingness that you were doing, you see, and so forth. And what you learn out of this is – what you should learn out of this is that you should understand more about it, in order to do it, you see? That's the lesson you should learn; and the lesson you shouldn't learn out of it is: \"It's just too difficult.\" But on some subject lines there is another lesson you could learn, is that \"It never worked anyway.\" Oddly enough, I don't think that is applicable except in the upper levels of supereducation and in the upper levels of supereducation, they've got a lot of stuff that doesn't work but is just hoped for, you know, which they're putting straight across the line. It was never intended to work – it leads to no final result at all. I mean, that sounds rather peculiar, but it is true. It's like doing the equations of aircraft propellers – or buggy whips, about the same category today, propeller aircraft and the buggy whip – with integral calculus and pain-fully sketching out all of the various contours and curvatures of aircraft propeller blades or buggy whip curvatures, with integral calculus. Why would you do such a stupid thing? Why, for instance, learn the tremendous complications of some very esoteric activity on a doingness basis which hasn't been used for three centuries, just to do it? Well, it sometimes doesn't work at all. Sometimes nobody ever did it. That must enter into your calculations, too, when you're going up at that level of thing. Maybe nobody ever did it, see? Maybe it's too tough. Maybe it isn't too tough – maybe it just isn't, see? Maybe there is no integral calculus curve to a buggy whip, you know? I mean, you can go that far, that silly about it, you see? This sort of thing is all part of your understanding of the subject of study. Where are you going with this study? But if you're going up the line with any study on a basis of doing-ness you should go up the line on a basis of gradients. And my first lecture to you on this sub-ject had to do with gradients. And you will find the first time the individual's doingness caved in was right after, right after he had hit too steep a gradient. He didn't cave in on the steep"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 20 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 326 HPCS gradient, he caved in instantly before he hit the steep gradient. I'll talk to you more in a later lecture about processing people using this exact principle of too steep a gradient. It's quite interesting, but it'll be the gradient that he failed on, was the gradient which came after the gradient he hadn't understood. He's one step late in recognizing this thing, see? Now, what you want to do is give somebody a series of doingnesses on a gradient that they can do and that they can achieve. And in Scientology you have a rather marvelous thing called a \"Touch Assist,\" and it is so workable that some people sort of park right there with the Touch Assist and that's only one little level of doingness which if they do, why, it gives them some confidence and they can go on to higher levels of doingness, you see? But it's something like having invented too good a kiddie-car. You know, this is too good a kiddie-car; and you'll find it sometimes hard to move people off on to the next step. But a confidence and understanding goes along with the doingness, so a doingness is just another method of achieving understanding. In addition to accomplishing something with it, and so forth, it's also a method of getting understanding. Doingness is a method of achieving understanding. And if you find yourself too bogged and so forth, well, you want to go do some of it and that sounds rather interesting. Now, I know myself, I have just gotten through three books of archaic yesteryear's color films. I'm studying color photography on textbooks, that even though they are written by this institution, and so forth, have long since antiquated. They are dead and there is very little left of the actual materials they are talking about. And it's writ... was written by a profes-sor at Columbia University who probably had never done any. And the directions, and so forth, were mostly taken out of the literature released by the companies that manufactured the stuff at the time. And they intended just a happy result which they didn't ever think anybody would have any trouble with. The net result of this amounted to a tremendously interesting, basic theoretical approach which was absolutely vital to an understanding of the subject which departed wildly on to a series of doingnesses which were no longer of use and were completely disrelated. So if this wasn't the world's worst mish-mash I ever had anything to do with, I'd like to know about it. They... a real mishmash. Here's vital basic technology, basic historical technology, basic put-together, basic chemical technology, all of this stuff is not only true now, it's going to hold true from here on out in this particular field, don't you see? Basics, fundamentals, and so forth. Well, I got those down with spikes in spite of learning them from a professor. And the next thing, all of a sudden you collide with films you will never shoot and which you have to know all of the literature concerning. Oh, that's pretty grim, because in the first place, I have already learned that a manufacturer's table of use on the subject of any piece of film, much less color film, is something that you carefully don't litter the street with. You put it in the garbage can. See? Useless! Forget it! He isn't the user of the film in the first place. He's the seller of the film, not just its manufacturer, but he's selling this stuff, so he wants to put a very happy face on it. So he says its speed rating is up in the stars – when it isn't. And he says it won't do this, when it does. And all of this stuff, and how this stuff is handled and all of this – not even germane."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 21 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 327 HPCS Why would anybody have even included it in the text in the first place? He already knew that color was an advancing field. It was advancing so rapidly that to expect of the indi-vidual, without modernizing the text, that he would have to know all about autochrome – ha-ven't had any autochrome since 1920 – it didn't even take a picture then. Whoever heard of this stuff? Well, it's nice to know that they had some film like this and what its basic theory is, but now go and get the lens stops and settings for autochrome – oh come now! Well, what lens stops and settings for autochrome? In a camera system, perhaps, that isn't even used anymore. That's just gobbledygook then, isn't it? Well, your understanding has to embrace this fact and you somehow or another have to survive through the subject and still retain intact the basic technology and the vital fundamentals of the subject which you have learned without being so upset about the later enturbulences which you got into because that's now been over-ridden and developed. Now, you are all faced with that merely because of the advancing line of Scientology. I've just experienced it in the wildest way possible. The third book was totally devoted to printing methods and I wouldn't be seen dead in a color darkroom anyway. See, I – bluh! Who wants to doodle-daddle like that? See? Well, there are lots of guys around that like to doodle-daddle like that and I'm happy there are, because they're going to do all of my doodle-daddling! [laughter] All I have to know in that is also an understanding of what I have to know. I haven't got the time or the inclination to spend forty or fifty hours on a salon exhibi-tion print to get it registered properly. I haven't got the time or the inclination. Who would – who'd do such a thing? One of these doodle-daddlers. They work happily. Marvelous! Could-n't live without it! Don't you see? Well, I have to know enough to know whether or not they know what they are doing. That's, once more, an understanding of what I need the information for, an understand-ing of what I'm going to use this information and, an understanding of its value and precision; understanding of what I have to have out of it. It's an understanding of what do I want; it's an understanding of the proper practical use or application of this information; and if it's for drawing room conversation, you would study it entirely differently. If you were studying art for drawing room conversation but not commercially, I assure you, the thing to do is to get ahold of a catalog that was published at some outrageous long date ago that lists all sorts of painters of the period of van Eyck or something like this and get all the contemporaries, see, get all of those and what they were noted for, you see, and memorize – just grind, grind, grind like you're memorizing this – an amateur play script, all of this stuff, you see, and so forth – drawing room conversation: kill everybody dead! They can't open their heads about – they say something about seventeenth century painters, you know, and you say, \"Like Van der Dobin.\" And they say, \"What?\" You say, \"Yes, Van der Dobin.\" In other words, you can play \"one-upmanship\" with this thing, see?

He's in the know.\" [laughs]"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"STUDY – EVALUATION OF INFORMATION 22 SHSBC-398 – 11.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 328 HPCS So anyway, the nonsense that you could run that one into and the various lines is still included under the heading of \"What are you going to use this information for? What degree do you have to know even inside one single subject?\" Now of course, some of the teachers I had on the subject of antisubmarine warfare, were busy teaching me how to build – how to build, if you please – there was a war going on. I didn't have any time to build anything. I tried to explain it to them – \"a QCB-1 antisubmarine electronic echo device, an ASDIC QCB-1. This is the way it is built.\" Fortunately, it was a lovely, lovely warm classroom and I was shipped for a very short time down into the south of Florida to learn about this sort of thing and that's one of the things they taught me, and boy, was I able to catch up on my sleep, be-cause I just knew somehow, that out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with my hands full of Jap submarines, I was not going to have to build one of these things. I was merely going to have to know how to use it and at most repair it and to know when it was in operation, when it was out of operation. I figured that would be about all, in the middle of action, that I would be able to need. That's all I would need to know about that equipment, so I had myself a nice sleep. But the evaluation of what you want it for – how are you studying it – which direction it's going, and so forth, is all part and parcel to the whole subject of study. And if it is not in-cluded in the field of study, why, your use of the information is minimal and you can become very stultified and you can become very horrified and you can hang up on a lot of words and things that are getting in your road and upsetting you and that you don't understand, and you get into an obsessive \"I've got to understand everything I read perfectly or I will hang up,\" and this is taught to you by the fact that if you don't understand what you read, a half a page later you're going to get a headache. Well, you also must include the idea that after you've read that half a page more and gotten a headache, that you've now got to be smart enough to know there was something back of you, find out what it was, spot it, get it out of the road. Say, \"Yeah, that's a word I don't know,\" and go on reading. In other words, in order to study, you've got to have a lot of the technology of study or the use of the information which you are getting is going to be minimal. Now, I've given you a lot of stuff in this lecture today that is largely theoretical and that sort of thing – All of this, however, has very practical applications and it has a practical application to what you are doing right now. So having increased your grades very, very nicely after every one of these, why, please increase your grade again. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 329 HPCS A REVIEW OF STUDY A lecture given on 22 September 1964 Thank you. All right, I like you, too. Thank you very much. And this is the what of what? Audience: 22nd of September. Twenty-second of September AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Is that cor-rect? Audience: Right. All right, today's lecture is a review lecture on the subject of study – a very rapid re-view lecture – and it doesn't mean that if you hear this lecture, why, none of the other lectures need be listened to or something like that because this lecture doesn't necessarily contain all that they contain; but I want to give you a fast review of this subject called study. I've been meaning to write a textbook about it and I will do so in the very near future, but the textbook for this is not the type of text that you just dash off, because if I do a good job of writing this textbook on this material we now have here, you recognize that it goes into an area where there is no textbook or data or technology of any kind, which is study – how to study. Now, you can look in vain up and down the corridors of the libraries at big universities and so forth for a book which simply tells the student how to study. I know that sounds, sounds fantastic, but that's all they teach, basically and foremost in a whole course on educa-tion, but they haven't got any book on it that says how to study. Not even in their – than their major courses of education do they have this textbook. But here are all these poor blokes sitting around in a university being told at every hand that they don't know how to study, but there is no textbook on the subject. Now, what do you suppose is going to happen with a textbook like that? If that just – textbook just sits down very calmly and goes about the business of what study and education are all about and how to study and how to approach this subject and what the bear traps are in it and what to avoid and what a good textbook is and what a bad textbook is and all this sort of thing, and if it just took this thing up, chapter by chapter, and shook it all out very nicely with no fancy terms and said, incidentally, as it went along, that this was data derived from the subject called Scientology, where do you think that book would land? Probably land in the hands of every student who enters a university anyplace. Courses of education would have to be pulled down and thrown away, because they haven't got a course of education. One of the things wrong with education of children in the United States right now is there's nobody has any technology of education. It's something on"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 2 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 330 HPCS the order of trying to fix radios when you have no instruction book of any kind and you don't even know what it is. And trying to fix a radio in that state of mind would be a rather exasper-ating situation since you wouldn't even know what the radio was supposed to do if you did fix it. To show you that the technology is out in schools and universities, a series of tests were given to children over a number of grades in school. This happened in Johannesburg, accidentally, and it – children in one grade and in the next grade and the next grade and the next grade, in various groups, were given graphs, and it was very apparent that the longer they went to school, the dumber they got. Now, I couldn't figure out why that was, except I could figure out there must be some-thing unknown about all this, if this could happen and nobody was doing anything about it. And sure enough, that was – that was the data that emerged from it. In other words, the longer they went to school the stupider they got. Well, what's this about \"education is supposed to make bright people\"? Well, there was obvious stuff there that it wasn't true. Here was the grade for the eight-year-olds and they got a certain IQ and a certain graph, and here was the grade for the nine-year-olds and they got a certain IQ and a graph, and the grade for the ten-year-olds and a certain IQ and a graph, and the eleven-year-olds, they had a certain IQ and a graph. And after these things were al-ready graphed out and the factor was added that some of them didn't know as much language as another and that sort of thing, it made a terribly steep curve. Their IQ was going downhill. The highest IQ that we have ever registered on any student was on a schoolboy in Jo-hannesburg who was twelve years old. It was not on Oppenheimer or Einstein, see? It was a twelve-year-old kid – highest IQ ever registered. Well, that's an optimum age. He knows enough language so that he can read the test and he doesn't know so much language that he can't understand it. So this showed me clearly that there was something amiss in the field of education if the longer you studied something the more stupid you got. Well of course, the longer you study something, we know now, the more chance and opportunity you have to run into words you don't know and there we go. Now, in the field of the arts it is peculiar – well, it's just the longer you study the more chance you have of running into words that you aren't acquainted with and can't get defined. So in the fields of the arts – since it is just misunderstood words which bring about this condition – in the field of arts particularly – and this is a field with which I'm very, very well acquainted – the working, workaday artist, the boy who's out there making his coffee and cakes with the drawn line or the airbrush or the paintbrush or something of the sort, you know? And whether he's selling it to Mr. and Mrs. Gotbucks or whether he's selling it to the local studio or he's making a sidewalk exhibit someplace or another, that's immaterial. The point is this boy is in the workaday world; with the writer, similarly; with the – oh, heavens! – poets; even – you could even include various of the fine arts: architecture and that sort of thing. All of these boys have certain peculiarities which I never quite understood."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 3 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 331 HPCS Peculiarities were these: When you reviewed a tremendous number of writers who were pros and who were good, and who were landing on the mark every time, you found no-body who had graduated from a course in writing. But nobody! I mean, this isn't – this isn't even the exception that makes the rule. He just wasn't present. I remember sitting up in Riverside Drive at one time – sitting in a big, swanky apart-ment – Riverside Drive, New York – and the whole place, the whole salon of this apartment was jampacked with some of the best stellar names in the field of American fiction. There they were – all of them, practically. And scattered in amongst them were some of their agents, you know, sort of keeping to the background and trying to look like the radiator or something. And this subject came up, not just the subject of writing but the subject of education in gen-eral. And a census was taken on the spot and noses were counted on the thing and nobody there had ever finished the university amongst those writers – much less writing. They had never finished the university. They had all been kicked out – almost uniformly had been ex-pelled – or they'd never gone near the place. And that was it, and then a check-over demon-strated, clearly and conclusively, that not one of them had ever taken a course in writing, from anyplace, from anybody about anything. Well, this was also quite startling, too, and it's not something that you would write in a writers' magazine about, because it would be very unpopular with the magazine because of its advertisers and their fond ideas they have and their advertisers who sell courses in story writ-ing and that sort of thing. So it isn't the kind of thing you have written up. And I was about ready to dismiss the whole subject, you know, and say, \"Well, that's it,\" because I had been sitting there keeping the notes for two or three other eager beavers who had been taking this over. And I was saying, \"Well, I guess we've just about got that taped\" or something like this you know, and everybody was laughing about it. And all of a sudden here was a very faint voice over in the corner that said, \"Well, your figures are not quite correct.\" \"What?\" you know? \"Wha-wha-what? Who was that?\" And \"Well, I – I have a P – PHD in literature, and a – a couple of other degrees, and finished – fini – finished the university and several other universities, and I've taken a lot of courses in writing, and – and so forth, so it's not true of everybody in the room.\" And everybody turned around looking at this guy trying to find out who it was. And of course, it was a literary agent! [laughter] He wasn't a writer. He'd never published a line in his life. All he did was sit around and tell other people what was wrong with their stories. But he had tried to be a writer and he'd failed. So about this point I said, \"There's something very peculiar going on here. There's a bunch of swindlers selling courses in writing that don't teach people how to write. Won't name any names because you don't have to. It's every big, brassy university in the United States. What's going on here?\" Well, could have been a lot of things, could have been a lot of things going on."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 4 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 332 HPCS But in the years following I ran the subject down. I got that interested in it that I ran it down a bit further, and I found out that no writing course teaches writing. They don't teach writing. I'm not sure what they teach but none of the technology which they employ and say is a writers technology, is the writer's technology. You get the point? See, they say there is this piece of technology but it isn't that piece of technology, you see? Writers don't use this tech-nology, period! If any of you have ever taken a writing course, I'm sure you heard about foreshadow-ing? And I'm sure you've heard about other writing gimmicks of one kind or another? And writers don't use them, and when they do use them, they don't call them that. Do you see here? There is a technology, then, which writers use but it is not taught in universities and it's not taught in courses in writing. I remember with a horrible start one time, getting up to make a talk to a short story group, and I was about ready to draw a long breath and say, \"Well, ladies and gentlemen, how are you this evening? Is there anything I can tell you about?\" So I was just – and right in front of the desk, lying there, was one of my stories, wide-open, which they had been using as a text. And every paragraph of it had some weird symbol or word written opposite it to show what I was doing at each one of these points. [laughter] Why, I would have wrapped myself around four telegraph poles if I'd ever tried to think of all that at the same time. This area was a foreshadow and this was a characterization and this was a this and that was a that, you see, and it was a tzsa-tzsa-tzsa and it was all sup-posed to have been laid out. It just stopped me cold, see? And I found myself looking at a piece of technology which I never used. And this was the pretense, you see? And here were these poor blokes trying to study writing, you see? Well now, there is a subject called \"writing.\" There is such a subject. The trouble is writers are professional liars and when they start telling people how they write they just go on and create. [laughter] The most weird dissertation I ever read in my life, I think, is by Edgar Allen Poe on the subject and it's used in every textbook, I think, in short story writing I have ever collided with, and I think it's Poe writing about how you write. Why, I think it's the most marvelous piece of stuff you ever read in your life. If you want to read that – I did one time, just for kicks. And you don't find anything in his stories that agree with what he said. They either want to be the only ones and cut down the competition or do something, but they never really say what they do. So no technology is – exists in this particular area, but there are a lot of pretended technologies in this area. I'm just talking to you about a field which is offbeat which I happen to know well and which is a noncodified field which is one of the arts. And there's that field, completely uncodified. Only when it starts to descend into technical application, like the graphic arts; the graphic arts are just a cut down from the arts, you see? They're the mechanical representation of the arts. They're \"How do you take a painting and how do you handle this painting in order to reproduce it in a magazine?\" It's not a creative art, in other words; it's a graphic art."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 5 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 333 HPCS Now, that technology – boy, boy! You start doing something a little bit haywire with that one or you start doing something a little bit offbeat in the way you take your separation negatives – you know, the red negative, the green negative and the yellow negative that you've got to take of this thing in order to get three printing plates to run through the presses, you know, so that each one superimposed on the other one and – ooooooh, boy! You've got to have the patch of gray that can match from each negative. It's got to be on every negative, and it's got to be at least a quarter-of-an-inch square, and it's got to match exactly on a densitometer. Boy! There's technology there, man. Wow! There's technology. There's exactly what is the factors involved in this: there's the various types of ink, there's the various types of pigments, there's various color charts, there's various systems which are em-ployed. There's all types of reproduction equipment on the subject of fine lines and dots and – oh, my, my, my, my, my! Wow! There's a terrific, terrific technology – the technology of the printer. The technology of – well, you take retouching. Bears about the same resemblance into photography. There's somebody who can take a picture and he can take a various type of ink or sauce or something and he can take this photograph and he can alter the features of the per-son in it. He can do this, he can do that. Terrific technology involved. Applied art, but very applied. Big technology. Well, how come you have to know this when right next door to it, the thing it's a cousin to, which is the original writer, doesn't have any codified technology. Has actually a false technology. And the second that this thing that is written or the thing that is painted moves over into reproduction, moves into the high channels of communication, moves over into that field at all, drops into one of the most complex and exacting of technologies. It gives one to wonder how these things are even cousins. Here's this whole area of writing; there is no technology. Everybody pr... it's worse than that. Everybody pretends there's a technology, that if you just studied it real hard, why, you, too, could starve to death in a garret, see? So – and right next door to it, here's this other. Well, it bears some kind of a resemblance between – I mentioned retouching. You take any photograph that is a portrait of anyone, I don't care where or who or how or why. The number of times you get a perfect negative that you can print and make a copy of, you know, and frame it or enlarge it or do something with it and enlarge it and give it to somebody so they'll say, \"How nice Izzybelle looks these days.\" You have to retouch it and all your big studios retouch. Sometimes they over-retouch. Sometimes they practically take out all the features in their excess of enthusiasm to make somebody look good. But any picture you've ever had taken in a studio which was ever framed and enlarged and presented to you as a presentation piece, it had to be retouched. Well, this retoucher is not the photographer. They bear the same resemblance as the duke and a steward, see? The photographer's definitely the duke, you know? He's the boy who goes through all the stuff that gets the picture and so forth, and nobody much pays much attention to the retoucher. The retoucher is rather heavily paid, but he sits there quietly drawing his heavy pay, you see, with his very exacting work. Well, the number of tricks you can do in retouching are absolutely almost unlimited. You can do one of the wildest things with retouching. You take this negative, you know, and"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 6 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 334 HPCS you take a fellow who, or a girl – girl doesn't like to be plump, you know – and you can take this thing and you can thin her down, man. And this fellow doesn't like to look so old. Well, you can't take too many lines out, because his character disappears, but you can take a few lines out if you're very good – and boy, you can take about fifteen years off his age, you see? Thud! And he thinks that picture's beautiful, because he's – of course, the people who are buy-ing these pictures are the people who are having them taken and naturally they only buy something that flatters them. So the whole world of photography is – in portraiture – is bent in the direction of making somebody look better – not more dramatic, but better – and... because people don't like dramatic photographs, really; they like pretty ones. I read a dissertation of why they don't let the public judge an art exhibit the other day. It's because the only paintings or the only photographs or anything else exhibited would have to do with cute little kittens falling out of baskets or wearing babies' clothes or little children with jam all over their faces and those would be the only pictures that would ever get a win-ning award. And they have another penchant: If it's not sharp – the public at large has an in-dex by which they judge a photograph – if it's not sharp, why, it's no good. Well, think if you took an expert picture of a mist, a very misty morning. Of course, it's not sharp but it's a beau-tiful picture, and the public would turn it down. So judging has been taken completely out of the public hands for these particular rea-sons, you see? But portraiture is never taken out of the public hands, see? So it's got to be retouched within an inch of its life. Everybody's really got to look prettied up, you know? Tsk! It's wild! Some of those pictures don't any more look like the people they're taking a pic-ture of, you know, than the man in the moon. Well, what about this? What's this relationship? How come? Well actually, the re-toucher steps in when the photographer fails. You can do everything the retoucher does with your camera and the lights. You can do the whole lot with the camera and the lights. But when the photographer falls down, the retoucher picks it up. Well, they have various things – not to give you a whole bunch of nomenclature; don't pay much attention to this nomenclature. It's just, it's just words. They've got things like barn doors – very expressive, beautiful word. They put them on the sides of a spotlight and – so the spotlight won't shine into the lens or so that you can flap them over and keep the light from hitting somebody in certain portions. And then they have things called headscreens which stand up here on a big – like a square cardboard – and that restrains the light from hitting somebody's ear, see? You can tip the edge of this board in so that this person's ear is not well lighted. You see, his ears are too big, let us say, see? Well, you can take that shadow and throw it just exactly across his ear, see? And his ear looks smaller. Any part you want to emphasize, you put light on, the formula is. The parts you don't want to emphasize, why, you just let it drift away, and the parts you want to practically take out of the picture, well, you just hold the light off of them and there they go. And because photography, of course: photo –, light; – graphy, writing – it's just writ-ing with light. And when you've written well with light you get a perfectly retouched picture. You can turn people in certain ways that make them much thinner. You can make their noses longer and you can make their forehead shallower and their chins stop jutting and so forth. Of"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 7 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 335 HPCS course, you can just easily make a strong-jawed person into a weak-chinned person and so forth. You can do all kinds of wild things. But when the photographer doesn't do his job, why then, somebody's got to step in and straighten it all out. And there's where the technology builds up. And the technology builds up in the area of correction. So I think you'll find in the field – this is a broad statement and might be subject to a great deal of modification – in any heavy, heavy technical subject, but if very, very, very technical, I think the technology is built up around an area of correction. It's dissatisfaction with something and the correction of that dissatisfaction. Do you follow this now? All right, the photographer doesn't do his job. He doesn't put the head screen over right so this guy's ears look like a pair of donkey's ears, See? Well, all right, nobody's going to buy that picture, so when the thing is all finished and so forth, well – I mean it's been developed rather, not completely finished – and it's in its proof sheets, and so forth; they don't even show him the proofs. They won't even show the customer the proofs. Retoucher takes ahold of that thing and he cuts those ears down and he subdues those ears and he makes that look better and they reproof it. Then they show it to the customer and the customer's very happy with it. Correction. Correction. Now, you can say when it isn't done right in the first place it's got to be corrected. And where it is going to be corrected a great deal of technology will arise. You follow this? Audience: Mm – hm. Yes. All right, if it was done right now, then there would have been no further technology. But where it's done right you would then have something moving along the line very smoothly and very easy to get along with indeed, if it was being done right. If you had the technology of how to do it in the first place, in other words, everything would move smoothly from that point there on. But let us say there's a bunch of technology missing at this point or it is not known or it's not practiced. Now we're going to get a very heavy complicated technology arising just on the other side of this thing which we're going to call a lower-scale subject and it will simply be totally corrective of the upper-scale subject. Where you – ever you have tremendously heavy technology, then that is all of a corrective basis. In other words, it was based on a cor-rection. There had to be something corrected at this point. It wasn't running right in the first place. Now, let's get on this subject of bodies. Let's take it a – a finite line. All right, the pho-tographer didn't do his job well and so therefore we had to pass it over into the hands of the retoucher. And the retoucher had to go all over this negative and take out pieces of it and do this and that before he printed it, and so forth. Well, let's not stop there. Let's move over just a little bit further, and how about building these bodies? Well, somebody didn't build them right if people are that dissatisfied with them. There's something going wrong over there. And I'm merely pointing this out to you – there's no technology known there. There's geneticists, there's all kinds of \"Eat Wheaties,\" there's various types of"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 8 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 336 HPCS false technologies. But they frankly – there's a second dynamic, Freudianism, and so forth, but they really have nothing to do with making bodies. I don't know what the second dynamic has to do with making bodies. It's just because they get connected and they are inevitable in sequence, but they do not necessarily proceed from one, two, see? Now, what's all this? And we're into a totally unknown body of knowledge, aren't we? And there's a lot of false superstition and other things connected with it, so there's some bird down in Vienna in 1894 could say, \"The whole trouble with the human race is they have no technology of building bodies,\" or \"They've got it all in backwards,\" or something like this, you know? There's something wrong, see? Freud, he builds up then psychoanalysis which has proven very popular. It isn't effec-tive, it's popular. See, it depended upon the communication cycle of the analyst whether it was good or bad, not on Freud's theory. Surprise? If you had a good analyst that knew how to communicate with the patient and so forth, why, somebody would get better. Accidental though – they never studied the technology of communication. They didn't know anything about that and they thought they were dealing with the second dynamic. And they weren't. Funny, you can read over Freud's records and you find out every time the guy got off an overt, he recovered. And you know, Freud never noticed it. You know, that's so remark-able. It will be buried somewhere in the notes, because it's not emphasized, and then he's – you're given the wrong reason for the recovery and that makes it very hard to relocate what was going on in this particular thing, and we're not riding a hobbyhorse trying to apply Scien-tology to it. It's one of the wo... it's one of the places we got the overt. And there seemed to be one present in every recovery; a disclosed overt and a recovery. They seem to go hand in glove, so a further study of this particular zone and area brought about a resurgence of tech-nology in that particular field. And the importance of this thing was able to take place. All right, but look-a-here, look-a-here. Here is the only thing I'm leading up to, rather circuitously, but to give it to you – more thud, to show you there's some background to it, with the idea of you understanding it a little bit better. Do you realize that all of education as it is practiced today is a complicated corrective technology? It's a corrective technology. It isn't education at all. See, there's no effort to relay an idea from point A to point B or mind A to mind B. See? There's an effort, however, to keep the fellow from or to keep him at it in some way or to do this or to do that. In other words, the educational system is built around the fact that education has already failed. So you have this fantastic technology and some poor bloke could go to school for many, many years learning how to be a teacher and all he would ever learn is how to correct the corrections. Now, it isn't that that data is un... is useless. Let me tell you, when an engine has gone into the ditch it's a very good thing to know how to operate a wrecking train to get it back on the rails again – very complicated technology, but it's a very good thing to know. But this doesn't make all of railroading lifting trains back on rails that have gone into a ditch, because railroading done right has the train on the rails all the time! It's only when railroading doesn't go right."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 9 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 337 HPCS Well, so how about education where the students are committing suicide all over the place the way they do in France, and so forth? I don't – I don't know what this has to do with – education's somehow or another linked up with something or other and survival or something and they got it all in backwards and crosswise. And the poor students over there in France come up for an examination, you just start reading the roll call: \"Pierre,\" you know? \"Oh, he's dead,\" and so forth. [laughter] \"He took cyanide last night. He couldn't con-front it any longer.\" And they have a heavy, heavy suicide rate, because apparently in France if you don't get through this particular type of examination, or something like this, they execute you any-way. I think you're executed socially or something, and France hasn't any colonies anymore to ship anybody off to so you just have to stay home, in total disgrace or something. Corrective. Well, look at the amount of force and duress which must have been on this student. Terrific force, terrific discipline, heavy! To what? Well, to keep him at it and make him study his examinations. Well, I don't know, I never had any trouble getting anybody to study some-thing they were interested in. So I think that if this much duress can exist in a field to drive students to suicide – and very often in England and the United States they go off their rockers, and so forth – if there's this much duress to get them to learn, then I would say it must be some kind of a corrective technology that moves over into this field so hard only because – it moves over into this field – only because the students missed it all in the first place. Now, what kind of duress do you think it would take to get Johnny to learn what B was when he'd already missed what A was? Now, you're getting accustomed to this in han-dling it with definitions and that sort of thing and I'm talking to a rather informed group here. Supposing, supposing somebody came up to take his examination to you and you were check-ing him off and so forth and you stuck in on the second paragraph. You couldn't get past sec-ond paragraph, he couldn't seem to remember anything in the second paragraph or so forth. Well, your technology now says that you should go back up and look just a little bit earlier to find the word he didn't understand. And sure enough, you'll find one just before he went blank, in other words – just before he went blank, there was a word he didn't understand. When we trace this back we find this word; we get this word defined and straightened out. All of a sudden, magically, he understands that paragraph. Well now, supposing we didn't straighten out the word and supposing we told him that he was going to be expelled if he didn't learn the paragraph. Now, supposing we compound this with about ten – somewhere between ten and fifty thousand instances and texts and we did this every time. I would say we'd have an adequate explanation of why the child at nine was dumber than the child at eight, the child at ten was more stupid than the child of nine, the child of eleven was more stupid... See? In other words, this amount of duress became necessary because nobody would ever have understood anything, they wouldn't have been educated at all and perhaps better than nothing – perhaps. I don't think so, myself, but you could add it up this way. And if every time this fellow hit a rough spot on the road you simply applied the lead boot or the pincers or the brass basket full of rats or some other interesting medieval torture and said, \"Now, if you"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 10 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 338 HPCS don't get that next paragraph, you're going to have had it, bud.\" Now, what do – what do you think he would finally wind up? Well, he'd be in – he'd be in an interesting state, wouldn't he? He'd be far removed from any idea of what he was doing. He'd be far removed from the subject and he would be treating the subject as something entirely different than the sub-ject, certainly. He – you know, well, he'd say: \"Well, there's this thing called physics, and I'm just trying to fix these weights here, and of course that physics, it doesn't have anything to do with these couple of weights I'm trying to fix on the counter here.\" It'd wind up in a nonappli-cation. There'd be a – he'd have to short-circuit. He'd have to get all that duress out of his pe-rimeter. He'd have to get all this stuff out of his circle of understanding. He'd have to move it all over here someplace and just squash it and suppress it and say, \"Well, the devil with it. I'll have to make up my own mind about this,\" or \"I'll have to try to walk my own way through all this,\" don't you see? You would leave him on a total only-one basis with regard to his subject matter and his information. And instead of helping him you would have taken away all the information that could have helped him. So I would say modern education was making it im-possible for a person to utilize his training. Well, this then should indicate to you that a decline of IQ could be expected to follow a misunderstood word. That sounds absolutely wild, but the longer you went past that and the more you had to know that, the stupider you could be expected to get. Do you see? Of course, we have all the corrections for this, and so forth. We've got clay table and clearing and definitions and all that sort of thing now. So we're talking from a point of view of considerable savvy. But I'm just trying to show you what the world must look like. Here you got engineers out here putting up skyscrapers. Man, I'm – after I've learned this about education and so forth, I hope they were put up by the foreman who was never near the college because otherwise I'd expect them to fall down on me head, I would. I don't think I'd trust one very good. I've noticed a peculiarity in this particular field to get unreal or kind of revengeful toward the subject or to do weird things or to slough off when they got near their trained area. Now, here is another datum: How does the state suffer in various terms from misedu-cation? How does the state suffer from miseducation? Well, there's a country, you might not have heard of it, called Russia and it went by the boards a number of years ago and it im-ported a German philosophy called communism and it had a ball, and it nevertheless is trying to go forward and make something out of itself, and so forth. It probably would have gone forward as fast as the Western world if it hadn't adopted a squirrel, offbeat philosophy. The Western world has advanced exactly the same distance and further during the same period of time. See, they were not mechanized either back in 1917. They were pretty bum. If you don't believe it, one of these museums, go into one of these motor museums and so forth; look at a 1917 model – stuff. Well, that's a modern Russian car. I don't mean to be catty; they did copy a jeep. They got a lot of jeeps in there during the war and they copied them."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 11 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 339 HPCS But they're pretty corny; and what they're trying to do, over there in Russia, is spread a civilization out into a very, very, very backward Asian world. Russia is basically Asian, it's not Western. And I will say that with all their handicaps – political and otherwise – they are making some progress of one kind or another and they've got an awful lot of virgin territory to spread all of this into. They've got the whole of Siberia to spread stuff into it, see, and they're really in a state of a sort of a pioneer country. And people have said, \"Well, they're really en-tering their Victorian Age,\" and I imagine that they are. They're way behind. They're almost a century back of anybody else. Oh, just because Great Britain sells them some machinery and they change the labels on it and export it to Japan as Russian field tools or something is no reason why they're good in this department. They're not. These boys are up against a tremendous frontier, and they have the frontier of igno-rance and the frontier of this and that. They've got a vast wilderness. They have millions and millions of uneducated, backward people to try to do something with, you see? Their prob-lems are fantastic! They're trying to solve them with education, and here's the outcome of their solutions with education. Of course, you can imagine a Russian commissar operating over a Russian student. This would be pretty grim. And the figures are these: That on-the-job training of a great number of students who were trained at the full expense of the government and the industry which was training them to take future key posts in there left it one hundred percent at the end of their on-the-job train-ing period, which was a two or three year period. One hundred percent took no further activ-ity in that plant or that line of work. In another plant and an area – this is one specific plant – another plant, two out of several thousand did stay with the plant. And these are not just se-lected figures. These are the broad coverage estimates for the whole of Russia. These are young people who have been educated under communist duress and have been moved out into a plant to be given on-the-job training to take over future posts in that plant. And at the end of that time, because things are milder over there now, they had some power of choice as to what they did now. And they all left. That was the exercise of power of choice. Now, if you know education – and you know our technology of education now – you will see at once exactly what must have happened. Way back here in kindergarten or some-place the communist love of the reevaluation of words caught him. The favorite trick of the communist is not to change anybody's vocabulary but to make it mean something else. They change the meaning of words so therefore everything sounds familiar. The next thing you know a person finds that the word means something else entirely different. I'll give you in lump example of this: Orwell's 1984, wonderful changes of semantics, the change of mean-ings, of words which went through 1984. \"Freedom is slavery,\" you know? Well, even Roosevelt was at it. We had freedom for a long time. Everybody knew what \"freedom\" meant. Roosevelt, he made it \"freedom from.\" You had to be freedom from something. That was what – the freedom we were now fighting for, we were fighting for \"freedoms from.\" Well, that's an interesting way of looking at it. \"Freedom from.\" Well, that means you must be fighting it so you couldn't possibly be free of it. \"Freedom\" means \"free-dom.\" It doesn't mean standing up against something and pushing it away from you or worry-"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 12 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 340 HPCS ing about will it catch up to you again, or something like this, or working day and night so that it won't happen to you. That's not freedom. So, here's a change of semantics. Now, the Russian, of course had this entire Asian population, this huge mass of people, 200 million – one of the bigger populations of Earth in one country, all divided up into different lingual groups and different customs and so forth – and he moved in on them and then he had to change everything in order to get it all lined up and get them to work together at all and he had to reevaluate all their words. So that in 1964 we find he's lost his revolution. How did he lose his revolution? Well, he trains several thou-sand young people to take over the Pujas River Project and they're going to be the executives and the big shots on the project and they're go – they too are going to be able to drive around in Model T Fords. And at the end of the on-the-job training they all leave the Pujas River Pro-ject. That means he's going to run out of people to run things. Material which we've got right now in Scientology, oddly enough, was of great inter-est to the old man Stalin himself because he smelled that it might exist in the studies which I was doing and was – I was in contact with Amtorg in 1938. And the whole line of – is, \"How do you evaluate the relative ability of a person to work? How can you find out which person will produce more than which person?\" And I was engaged in a study of that at that time and had some rather revelatory information regarding it. I was extremely pleased with this infor-mation and it got noised about the Explorers Club. The next thing you know, I was backing up at a mile a minute trying to keep my foot off that boat of going to Russia and talk to Stalin about it. He had problems. He had worries in 1938 – plenty of worries. He was looking for help from anyplace. But where was his missing technology? The missing technology was \"How do you get people to understand something and how do you get people to do things?\" Those were his areas of no comprehension. How do you get people to understand things, how do you get people to do things? Well, he thought he had solved \"How do you get people to do things.\" \"You set up enough machine guns in front of enough walls and give them enough examples, they will work.\" Only you can't keep it – keep at it forever that way. That'll play out sooner or later. Now, when you start working that along an educational line, you run out of educated people fast. They just get stupider and stupider and stupider and stupider. So that I think that the way the leisure class and the upper class was wiped out in England and suborned was not through any political revolution. I just think they educated them to death. [laughter] I think actually they got too stupid to hold their position. Something to think about, huh? I mean, as a class they were just educated to death. Everybody had to go to college. Of course, what did this leave? This left a bunch of commoners around who didn't have to go to college, so it didn't matter about birth or anything else. It left these boys who were on the outside smarter than the guys who were on the inside so the guys who were on the inside lost. I mean, it doesn't take much to understand that. That must have been what happened."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 13 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 341 HPCS So we can make a further point; we can make a further point here. We could say, then, that the continuation of a culture is entirely dependent upon possessing a technology of study. Russia is going to lose hers! We have an example of the upper class of England having gone through Oxford into oblivion. We have examples of – all around us – of changing face of Earth and so forth and that hinges basically on people; the future of the human race hinges oddly enough on people. And if you don't make people who are good people, you're going to have trouble. And in the field of study if you don't have any technology of study, then the poor little bloke who goes into kindergarten and who starts running into incomprehensibles and who then is threatened with being flunked or shot or whatever they do to children in kindergarten if they don't get their blocks piled up in the right pile, moves on into the first grade and here he is shown a word which is cat and he says it's tac and everybody looks sad; the teacher paces up and down, writes notes to the parents, the father goes into a decline, holds his head in his hands for a half an hour, you see? This is the standard accepted procedure, you see? \"What is going to come of you?\" you know? That is the question which is left burning in the middle of the air, you see? \"You will never succeed in life,\" and all that sort of thing. Why do they have to put this much du-ress on? Well, it's because they don't know how to teach the kid to read cat instead of tac. So you get this terrific cultural pressure. You get a bunch of cultural technology on \"How do you keep a kid in line?\" Then you hire a whole police force all over the nation to try to sit on him when he becomes a teenager. And then you have a real ball, now. You get the Mods and Rockers and so forth and your this and that. Well of course, these people by now have been taught thoroughly that they're no part of anything and that's the way they act. They act as though they're no part of anything, they don't own anything and that's it. It's quite interesting to watch some young boy and so forth who's been catapulted out into the responsibility of the care of a family or something like that at ten or eleven, twelve years of age. It's very interesting to find. Today you can – in spite of child labor laws – occa-sionally find such a specimen. And he bears no more resemblance to the modern teenager, and he won't because he's already had to wrap his hands around this thing called life, you see, and carry on somehow and he hasn't had time – all the time necessary to sit in school and be made stupid and he's liable to become quite a success in life or something weird like this is liable to happen to him, unlooked for. They're trying to bring in law and order while operating in the schools to create illegal activities and disorder. They're operating in schools to create it. And the last person in the world that would stand up and take any responsibility for it is Miss Prince-Nez, there at the – Public Local Number 18: \"Well, we just try our best,\" you can see her now, you know? \"We just try our best.\" [laughter] Christ! Why don't they hang a sign across the door and say, \"Ju-venile Delinquent Factory – \" Well, all right. So once more we have this experience in Dianetics and Scientology in this line of work. Once more we have this experience of colliding with a zone or area of the society in which there's a pretended technology where actually there is none. It's not only that – it's absence, it's – there's a pretended technology sitting in its place."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 14 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 342 HPCS Now, I don't think, however, you're going to have too much collision with it. I don't think there's going to be too much upset, but I could foresee there's going to be some upset about it. Anything we write on this subject is sooner or later going to be challenged in some quarter or another. But this isn't a codified field that is returning a great deal of money. Teach-ing is not really a vested interest because it doesn't make enough money and that's about the only reason why. Medicine, however, is a vested interest and drugs are a vested interest because some-body is making money out of it. The multibillion-dollar drug empire and healing empire and so forth will be defended to the last stethoscope, see? Those guys will be standing around there – you'll still – I mean, twenty, thirty years from now there'll still be some bloke down here trying to cause trouble, you know? He says, \"Rowr-rowr-rowr.\" And you say, \"Well, you don't understand some word in healing.\" \"Yeah, I understand all the words in healing.\" \"Well, you don't understand some word in Dianetics and Scien...\" \"Oh, yeah, I understand all the words in Dianetics...\" \"What the hell's the matter with you?\" \"I'm broke!\" Well now, the teacher doesn't make any money and the school contractor doesn't care what's built in those buildings that he's contracted to build and the state doesn't really like to shell out this much money, because kids don't vote. It's not an area where you can buy many votes. You can buy them – buy the votes of their parents somewhat but people really never connect the school to the administration. They're always somewhat disconnected. So you have no active vested interest there to go up against and I believe the whole area can just be gob-bled up because nobody has ever seen it as a profitable area. We're not looking at it as a profitable area, but they won't defend it because they don't see it in a profitable area. If medicine were a lot less profitable today, we would have no trou-ble taking over the field of healing. It's just the self-interest in the thing which keeps the op-position raving. I don't say that bitterly. I mean that's just a completely considered statement. There isn't such an area in the field of education, so therefore I think a proper textbook which just goes down the line rat-a-tat-tat and doesn't find any fault with anybody and does-n't shoot anybody down in flames, you know, but just goes right down the line and takes up the whole subject from the word scat and carries it on through – why, it's pretty hard to get over the chapter of how you can reduce IQ in a person because somebody would take that as accusative, but I imagine that that can be – not glossed over, because it's a piece of the tech-nology that'll have to be presented. But it'd be presented gently enough so that it won't have people fighting that point. And the next thing you know, why, you'll be in another business. But it's not in an-other business that you've ever been absent from. Your part of the business is making people brighter, you see? Processing people, clearing people, that sort of thing. Well, that fits hand in glove with this particular type of activity. Then you have Scientologists to teach so you need"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 15 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 343 HPCS the technology and that was the only reason the technology was developed in the first place – just to make it easier to teach more Scientologists – that was why it was developed. But it's going to go further than that, you watch it. Now, if we don't take some responsibility for how far it'll go, we're liable to be in more trouble than if we just released it and forgot about it. Therefore, I'm not releasing any small book on the subject. I have to release a definite text. And I think you will find out that gradu-ally, as this starts to roll, that it will be necessary for you in your area to make it possible for teachers, on a Saturday and a Sunday or something of that sort, to drop around and have some lectures on this subject. And I think that you'll find that it sort of will tend to stand separate and distinct from anything else which you're doing, and you will say, rather faintly, \"Well, you know, we can raise people's IQ.\" \"Oh, yes, yes. Now what did you say about...?\" and some educational question will come up, you see? And you say, \"Well, you see, you can process somebody in order to...\" They'll say, \"Well yes, but now in teaching a child, do you.... And you'll say, \"What the hell, which way is this cat jumping.\" Well, I think you'll eventually see which way the cat jumps, and the way the cat jumps is the fact that they want to know all about education. And you better let them walk all the way through education be-fore you start showing them that they actually have entered the field of philosophy. And I don't think they'll route any other way because in education what you're actually studying is the difference between a Level 0 and a Level 1. And what sits there is this band called \"education.\" And that's what's been established here is – that's of importance to us in-timately and immediately. All these other ramifications, all these other complexities of educa-tion are not terribly important to us. So the society of Russia will not be able to perpetuate itself. I'm afraid that would cause me to yawn almost wide enough to dislocate me jaw. So it won't be able to perpetuate itself in history. Too bad! Oh, that's terrible! The various other political regimes and so forth won't be with it. I'm afraid I just – that the state of mind I'm in with regard to these blokes, I'm afraid that I wouldn't even pick up a shadow for them if they dropped it. They're just not im-portant. But people are important and their systems are not important. Now, when their sys-tems are built on lies, those systems must therefore be destructive. And the whole educational system as I see it of total duress, of total squash on the individual, in view of the fact that it's a system that's full of lies, I think it's about the most destructive thing you could have around at all. I think it would be very rough to have to live with this kind of a thing. It's definitely incor-rect – wrong. But you're going to find yourself in this business and the only real point I'm trying to make to you here is: don't then consider – because you can't talk to them about processing when they're busy studying study – don't then consider that you have moved them over into some other field. Recognize that you're moving them up through the top of Zero into the bot-tom of One. Recognize that this is a necessary step.

So you come in and talk to a group of them and you say, \"Well, study is so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so – and the IQ of your child could be increased by study, not de-creased. And you could have a brighter child,\" or something like this or, \"Your school could run with less upset,\" or to a group of police, \"Juvenile delinquency is caused by miseducation. Proper education would reduce juvenile delinquency.\" This will all sound to them like good roads and good weather. And they'll be very happy to cooperate upon this particular line and so forth. And you don't have to say anything else. And they won't really ever wonder, \"Now, how the devil does this person know all this? Yeah, where is this information from? What's this all about?\" Unless, of course, they're totally ARC broke and then that's out the other end. But it never really occurs to them to ask intelli-gently, \"Ah, what part of the information and so forth? It says throughout this textbook that this is part of a body of information called Scientology. But then it just says 'Scientology' and everybody knows what Scientology is. It's a study of science, of course, naturally. Truth, and that sort of thing. And it's so on and so on and so on and...\" See, they wouldn't even think about it. And why wouldn't they think about it? I want you to get so you can see this one little point. They can't think about anything! See? You're wondering why a fellow with blinders on can't see. See? What you haven't recognized about this individual is the most fundamental thing about this individual, and that is he can't see at all. So you ask yourself, \"Why can't Joe and Pete see this and this and this?\" You see, you're asking yourself too complex a question. See, you're asking yourself, \"Why can't Joe and Bill see that so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so? And why do they always argue, and so forth and so forth?\" Well, you yourself are just being too complex with your question. Your question is based on the fact that you haven't recognized that they can't see! Do you follow this? You're trying to stretch it out into, \"Why can't they see something?\" see? Well, your basic thing is, is just, \"Why can't they see at all?\" Well, they can't see at all because they've never been – they've been trained into stupidity. And you're talking to blind men, that's all. Well, how do you talk to a blind man? Well, you talk to him damn carefully! You get smart about it. You know this guy's blind, so you – naturally he's sitting there, he can't see at all, and you're trying to talk to him about the rose garden, which you can see right outside the win-dow. Well, you say – you wouldn't say to him, \"Well, you silly ass! Why don't you look out-side the window and look at the rose garden?\" Well, you wouldn't say that to a fellow who couldn't see at all. See, you wouldn't. You'd say, \"Well, over there to your...\" You'd have to think it over, you see? You'd have to say, \"Well, over there to your right there are a certain number of windows. You pos-sibly can feel a cold draft coming in on you occasionally. Well, that's windows over there and there's light which makes things visible and show up so that you can see things back of things.

Now, you can hold those up and you can feel it that way,\" and you gradually infiltrate it into his experience, don't you see? And you'd have to sit there and figure for a while on \"How am I going to give this guy some dope so that he can get some idea of there's a flower garden outside the window,\" see? And you gradually build it up, and you'd say, \"Well, outside the window there's a lot of space. You know, the last time you went out of the room, why, you walked for quite a ways before you got into another door. Well, that was all space and that's the outdoors. And you've noticed sometimes that you've gotten rained on and so forth while you were in under some spaces, but not into other spaces, see?\" You know? And you take it up like this, \"Now, there's a big wide space outside the windows.\" And then you'd probably recognize, \"Good God! The next thing I'm going to have to explain to a blind man is the aesthetics of color. Ooh! Well, let's see. How can I do this,\" see? \"Well, all right. Be brave. Let's do this. Let's attempt it.\" You get the idea? And you eventually find yourself – and the guy would be sitting there saying, \"Yeah, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, well I now know what a flower garden is,\" see, something like that. You really would have communicated something because you recognized in the first place you were talking to a blind man. But when you fail to communicate, you do so for one big, awful reason. You don't recognize that you're talking to a blind man. And when you start talking to people about Scientology, you are actually talking to them above the strata where you should be talking to them to. Somebody says, \"Well, on this new PE Course, how do we get in ARC?\" Well, you don't! ARC is too high. That's very ad-vanced data; you've got to undercut this. You've got to give them the idea of a datum and you've got to give them the idea of the comprehension of a datum and you've got to give them the idea that there are data in exis-tence. You've got to give them the idea that they can learn something. Sounds incredible but this is your leg up, this is your edge in. Then you can give them the idea that there is knowledge, because 99 percent of the people you're talking to have had the experience of \"The technology taught did not operate.\" Most of them do not expect anything to happen even if they know the technology. So they're not able to give that extra little push that makes it work. When you run into these failures it's because of this, see? It's that little extra thing. They don't expect – what I'm trying to tell you is they don't expect anything to work because nothing ever has. So they really – don't really know what knowledge is. Knowledge is some sort of a fakery that people think is, see? If you gave them the task of describing what is knowledge, you're liable to run into something like that. Well, these people don't know there's anything to know. Look at the arrogance of the medical profession. They don't think there's anything to know about the subject of the mind or the spirit or healing. They brush all this off, they – wow! You know? The arrogance of these fellows! They're not producing any results, yet they think they've got it all wrapped up. Well, where do you suppose that comes from but Latin?

Well, he wouldn't ever do anything else, don't you see? You've said, \"This is the tibia,\" and you've looked for where the tibia is. It's this word in the book: tibia. Actually, education is getting worse and worse. In desperation recently, Great Britain has taken a fantastic turn in the field of education, about which you're not reading any articles and with which you're – probably aren't getting much data. You've probably heard something of this, but I've just been getting it hot and heavy over the lines because I was working out to find out where Quentin could go to school and what he had to do to figure out some various things, so of course, typically me, I just got in touch with everybody on this subject and got the gen down. A lot of interesting data is pouring in on the lines. The British college does not expect, within four years, to teach any degree course which goes consecutively to school. They want nothing to do with it. They consider this is a total failure and they want nothing more to do with it. And they tell you consistently, \"You want to know what the expectancy of enrollment is in 1968. I wish we knew, but one thing...\" one or several have said, \"...that we can tell you for sure is the courses which are now available to enroll in will no longer be enrolled in.\" \"Sandwich training\" is what they're using today in all technical fields. They say, \"The arts – who cares? Any of these old, dead-language subjects, and so forth, and dead degrees and so forth, who cares about those? But we have found out that our engineers can't build bridges and we're jolly well doing something about it. And we're upset in the field of educa-tion, and we're just tearing it to pieces.\" So all the big companies and the governments and the local councils and everybody else who can put his shoulder to the wheel is knocking out anything that has resembled engi-neering education in the past here in Great Britain. They are just knocking it in the head left and right. They found the school room was no place to make any engineer, and the future of this culture depends completely upon the quality of their engineers. They have recognized that entirely. So they're just reforming the whole thing. And by 1968 it won't even look the same. They'll go six months to school and they'll work for six months. That's what's going to happen to the student, and he's going to go six months to school and he's going to work for six months. And he jolly well, damned better be working in the subject he's studying or he can't enroll in it. A whole new face has been given to the field of education. Well, that is a corrective measure which is a recognition of the fact that educational methods have failed. But it's a cor-rective measure in the right direction and we may even have had something to do with it be-cause, remember, we've been teaching an – we used to teach an awful lot of teachers up in London, and it was our idea of the familiarity of things and so forth. We may have more to do with the evolution of the culture than we believe. Perhaps we could overestimate it, but I think we commonly underestimate it. I see a lot of things happening. I noticed the other day something or other happening. It was straight out of our textbooks."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 19 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 347 HPCS Oh, yes. There's somebody drew up the profiles of Home and Heath and whatever its name is – Mr. George something – anyway, drew him up and printed our personality analysis in The Guardian, and plotted these boys on our personality analysis, somewhat alter-ised. But they never took one of these things down and gave it to somebody – typically the psycholo-gist at work – never gave it to poor Home or Heath or Wilson or any of the boys, see, but went around and asked some students what they thought of these fellows and put that down as the results, and then advertised this as the actual graph of these people. I think it's very inter-esting. It's only something that they would do in the field of psychology. You understand what I mean? They just asked some people their opinions of whether these fellows were, you know, this or that or up and down, you see? And then they put down whatever anybody said and then released to the public that this was the personality of these blokes. I thought it was fascinating. But nevertheless, that was our graph sitting there staring us in the face. We've already infiltrated this field to the degree that they're already out the backdoor and playing in the yard and don't even realize that we're sitting in the parlor twiddling our thumbs. That's about the way the situation is as far as command and knowledge and technol-ogy is concerned. But we are at a very – we're a very unreal group to these people and we're unreal because any further knowledge is unreal to them, don't you see? They recognize in-stinctively that there is knowledge somewhere, and when we talk to them they recognize that we are talking that way, but it's all on a sort of an unconscious basis. And then they don't really connect this up and they're sort of hunted about the whole thing, and we make them nervous. But frankly, our command value over such a person is rather fantastic. It's almost an hypnotic command value which is sort of interesting. They recognize that you're talking the truth but they are not quite able to add you up to it, so the words which you're saying as you speak to them are engramic, almost, as you speak them. It's all very interesting. Scientology could be in this state and simply put the whole society into some kind of an obedience basis without even trying. But that isn't what we're trying to do. The way that you would follow this through – you'd have to get somebody into a state where he could learn. This is the way you'd bring somebody into Scientology, see? You'd get him into a state where he could learn and you'd show him there was something to be studied and then you would show him that there was a body of information about study and then you would show him that there was a body of information to study. And it's about in those – in that sequence that you would make a big win. And you have never really tried to approach it from this particular angle. Your normal approach to the individual is, \"We can help you, we can make you smarter, we can do this for you, we can do that for you, we can make you well.\" We have tried to talk to him and so forth and we're talking to somebody who can't learn. All right, if this individual can't learn, why, then of course he can't learn even the words we're saying to him. So he's in a nonreceipt. It isn't that we're even talking dully or un-cleverly. He's simply not receiving. See, if he can't learn in general, why, he couldn't receive your – even your sentence."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 20 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 348 HPCS So your approach isn't failing, it just isn't reaching. Big difference between those two points. So all you have to do is move the person up to where it reaches. See, you take your first step first. You pull him up to where it'd reach him. Well, so he'd be very happy to learn that there was ways of studying. He'd be very happy to learn this. He'd be very happy to learn there was ways of broadening his information about the world, about things. But right away, of course, you recognize you're dealing with a present time problem. He has a lot of things that he is having problems with, that, if he could learn more about, he would be able to handle his problems. So you must be at that point colliding with a present time problem on the part of the person you're talking to. Do you see that? His basic present time problems have to do with not knowing. See, if he could just learn more about women, he wouldn't have so much trouble with his wife. I mean, let's get it down to that simple an index, see? But of course, it never occurs to him that there's any way to go about learning that he isn't going about. So if he were just to know that there is some way you could learn more about women or learn more about anything or if there was some way of approaching this field of gathering data or becoming more learned on certain subjects and so forth, why, boy, he'd be on your side right now because he would be applying them to his present time problems, not on a direct processing basis but on just a direct indoctrination basis. You say, \"Well, there's something you can do about your life. There is some hope for it.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, you can find out more about it.\" \"Is that so?\" See, not that you become clever or anything else, but \"You can just find out more about what's going on around you.\" \"Oh, I can? Isn't that interesting? Hey! How do you do that?\" \"Well, there's techniques, various techniques of learning more about things that are quite surprising, quite surprising, and so forth. And one of them is to observe.\" \"Is that so?\" Well, you get how fundamental this gets? You observe. You think you have to be clever to teach somebody something like this. No, just be obvious; observe. \"Now, you – you say you want to know more about your wife? All right. Now, there's a good example. All right. Now, has it ever occurred to you to observe your wife?\" \"No.\" [laughter] \"All right. Now, I'll tell you what you do.

How do you look at something? Hell, you look at it! That's the answer. And that's the answer he'd finally come up with. But how does he look at something? Well, he looks at it, see? And that would be his problem for the day, you see? He'd think there were trick ways of looking at things. Do you look at them through various colored glasses, you know? Do you look at them cross-eyed? Do you use eyeballs? All kinds of things, see? Let him solve that one. How do you – how do you observe something? Well, let him draw up systems of observation. If he wants to know more and have less trouble with his wife, well, he'd better learn how to observe his wife. Now, that would be a primary method, then, of handling his personal affairs and his personal life. That would be right there or right down the middle of Main Street. He'd learn all kinds of things that just never occurred to him before. He's taken it for granted that observa-tion is going on, don't you see? You've taken it for granted. You say, \"Two people are living together, they both look at each other.\" The only time a wife ever looks at him is when he comes home with a smear of lip-stick. She can see lipstick. She puts it on her mouth all the time. In fact, she put that lipstick on him that morning when he left for work, but she's for-gotten that so now she has grounds for divorce: He came home with lipstick on his face. All day long nobody happened to tell him he had some lipstick on his face, see? But she can ob-serve – lipstick on his face. End product. You talk about observation. In any very big city – in any big city you can pull some of the wildest tricks to demonstrate nonobservation you ever cared to have anything to do with. The wildest things go unobserved in large cities. You wouldn't believe it. I, myself, used to make a gag out of this. I used to make a very amusing gag out of this; it paid off in many ways. Why, I used to tell some girl – if I were ever walking down Broadway in the vicinity of 42nd Street, you could always count on me to tell the girl I was walking with, you see, \"Do you know that New Yorkers never see anything?\" \"Oh? No!\" \"Oh yes, you can do almost anything. I mean a fellow could drop dead out here, some-body could pull a gun out of his pocket and shoot somebody dead and the passerbys wouldn't even pause in their stride. You'd have to actually actively block the pavement. If there was a fight in progress, they would only stop if the pavement got blocked so they couldn't go by and then they'd stop and eventually watch the fight. You can excite curiosity by blocking the pavement and looking up, but you have to block the pavement before you look up and then they will also look up. But it's very, very funny but they never see anything. They don't pay any attention to you and if you don't actively block the pavement, why, they never notice.\" \"Oh, I don't believe you!\" You see, you get some girl from the Corn Belt or something like this. \"Do you know that I could stand right here on the corner of 42nd and Broadway and kiss you and there isn't one single person would even glance in your direction.\" \"I don't believe it!\""},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 22 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 350 HPCS \"All right, I'll show you!\" [laughter] Yeah!

[laughter] Anyway, the score is that you take such – take such very unexciting words as \"obser-vation\" or \"inspection\" or \"familiarity,\" you see, the very unexciting words. You can actually build them up into mountains. They become very, very startling indeed! And when you're teaching somebody about this, what you want to do is take the obvious and expand it. Don't go going overboard to give them all – well, we're sitting in the driver's seat now. We've got the technology of education, do you see. It's contained in these lectures and so forth. There hasn't been very much to add to it, either. It appears to be quite complete. Now, you're going to say, \"Well, am I supposed to teach somebody education, huh?\" Oh, no, no, brother. You're not supposed to teach anybody your technology of education. Let's teach them the introductory aspect of education. Which is what? How do you learn about things? Well, you could sit down and ask yourself that. Well, how do you learn about things? Well, you learn about things by looking at them, by feeling them, by hearing about them, by reading books about them, by seeing what they relate to. You could lay all this down very easily, but of course you get out of it such things as \"feel\" and \"observe\" and so forth. Now, if that's the breakdown that you make on your very, very introductory and ele-mentary approach to learning, you see, if that's the breakdown which you make, realize that all of these things can be applied to all of the problems which any person at Level 0 or Level I has. You could give all kinds of gratuitous information about all kinds of gratuitous things which are being brought up with regard to this. Let's look at that. So, it isn't for you, then, to say, \"Well, let's see. I'm going to teach this fellow about Scientology. Well, there's such a thing as ARC. That's affinity, reality and communication and they form a triangle and so forth, and so on...\" \"Where am I at? What – what's going on?\" see. Well, he doesn't know there's any knowledge in existence anyplace that he doesn't know. That's one of the first things he doesn't know. He thinks everything in the world has already been found out. He doesn't know that the society is in any way deficient. Look at the way somebody out in the street will complain about a past life or complain about a something or other. You can take some bird who's howling like mad about the fact that there's no such things as implants and start to say, \"Well, say this word,\" give him an item in a Helatrobus line plot, and the meter goes bluu, and he goes bluu, and give him the next item, \"Say that word.\" Bluu, bluu. Well, if there's no such thing as an implant where's all that coming from? Meters don't run for the fun of it, see? But to teach him something like this? So what you in Scientology are up against is actually not the meanness of the society or the cussedness of the society nor the unwillingness of the society to be helped or any of those things.

A technology that stultifies the intellect, that freezes the individual into a noncompre-hension of anything, which puts him into a woodenheadedness the like of which nobody ought to be put into. In other words, you're talking to a stultified even ossified individual who has been carefully and systematically – but accidentally and unintentionally – destroyed since the first day he set his foot on his mother's knee and said, \"Mama, what's a cat?\" And then she said, \"Don't bother me now.\" \"Let's see. Cats are 'don't bother me nows.

Everything has militated – everything has operated against this individual ever becom-ing brighter or more educated. And now you expect to come forth with a great body of knowledge that this individual would welcome with open arms. Well, in the first place, he's been shot down in flames on the subject of study to begin with and this would just mean more study to him. Furthermore, you couldn't possibly exist because all study materials are bad because you get shot if you don't know them or something weird like this will be going on in his head. In other words, the communication line is jammed. What's the communication line jammed on? The communication line is jammed on study. So this is study in dissemination. And do you see that the study itself is an excellent dissemination tool and would work like a shot and I'm sure that you will find yourself, if you start to use this, being pulled in faster than you know. And I will only give you one little caution with regard to it, is don't get too studious about study in your address to the subject. Just pick the very obvious points of study and make them very studious points because it doesn't matter how studious you get about the ob-vious. A person can still see it. Do you see? So that you say – you – some person, he wants to get things built up into some tre-mendous tower of complexity on this subject. Well, you just let him build it up on the subject of observation until it likes to reach the sky. He isn't going to get anyplace but observation, is he? He's going to get, in the final analysis, the fact that you observe by observing. This is what final conclusion he will have to reach. No matter how many systems he develops in or-der to do the observation, he will eventually reach that point. He can't help but learn things and learn things about learning if he observes things. So you've got any broad, fabulously simple point of this character which, if you put across and got it across, you would all of a sudden get tremendous agreement with. And you'd get that little \"Hey! What do you know?\" you know? \"What's – yeah! Yeah! If I observed my wife – ah, yes! What is she doing? How does she look when I'm talking to her? Why, I have to check up on that.\" [laughter] And by the very familiarity of reach and withdraw by observation of his wife, he'd have less trouble with her. He'd become more familiar with her, he'd understand her better. You're talking to people who have withdrawn totally from life."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"A REVIEW OF STUDY 24 SHSBC-403 – 22.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 352 HPCS Study, of course, is one of the best methods in the world of bringing them out of it.

If you, as I did after the last lecture, go and look up Dharma (D-H-A-R-M-A) to find out what has been preserved of all that, why, save yourself the trouble. Dharma is anything from \"supreme law\" to \"the total caste system of India\" to \"fate\" and respelled \"love\" and rephrased some other way, it is something else some other way, and so forth. And in no authoritative refer-ence book that I've looked at to date that I have around at this particular time, is there any correct definition for Dharma. Boy, that is really great, you know, it's really great! And in Buddhism it means \"the way,\" see."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 2 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 354 HPCS Now, I tell you, you go around getting your name synonymous with things, you know, and then your name becomes the thing, you know. If you make very good Frigidaires, why, eventually all iceboxes are known as Frigidaires, you see. But it's worse than that, it's worse than that. The name becomes identified with the product rather than the source of the product, which I think is very fascinating. I just thought I would give you that as a little side note on the last lecture, because I thought, \"I wonder what they're saying about that these days,\" you know. \"I wonder if there's any record of it around,\" you know. By George, there isn't! I no-tice, however, in many books such as the theosophy texts, and so on, that it is bounteously mentioned, but it doesn't really say wherein. Well, the age we're in, by the way – the age we started, by the way – already has been named. This might also be an interesting side note to you. It's the Age of Love. There was the Age of Reason and the Age of Science and the age of a lot of other things. But twenty-five hundred years ago, why, Gautama Siddhartha said that in twenty-five hundred years, the Age of Love would begin in the West and this is an interesting prediction because the first thing that Clears start talking about is love, you know. It's interesting. Of course, nobody ever made this before, so how was he to know? But, anyway, this is supposed to be the Age of Love. No longer the Age of Reason – thank God! [laughter] Well, there are probably a lot of things I could talk to you about – I don't know any of them at the present moment that would be more useful to you than another. Completions are up so I don't have to worry about that and you seem to be doing fine on the course, so I don't have to worry about that. But there is a lecture that I think you could use in a high degree of generality and that is a roundup of the study materials. There was never really a final lecture on the study materials and in this lecture I will not for a moment adventure to give you a summary lecture which includes all the salient points of the study materials. There are quite a few of them. But there are some additional materials about the study materials in general which I think you might find of great interest. And that is the basis of intent – intent during study. Now, this is a very; very important sub-ject. As you study, what do you intend to do with the information? Very important point! There are points on the basis of faulty source, as you are studying. This we haven't really looked at. We have presupposed that all sources that we are studying are themselves perfect, you see, and have – (1) have information to deliver and (2) are delivering it in a way that it can be assimilated. We've more or less assumed that and the student is always asked to take the effect point and assume that he is studying comprehensible, worthwhile material. This fact, all by itself tends to knock the whole subject of study appetite over tin cup because very little of the material you are asked to study has any value or comprehensibility out in the wog world. And it is a rare textbook which actually relays the information and subject matter which you are supposed to assimilate – a very rare textbook. Now, when you get study gone mad, you really have a mess. This is one of the reasons why there are such a tremendous number of suicides in universities – and there are a great many suicides in universities. The proportion is fantastic. It is not as high as psychoanalytic"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 3 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 355 HPCS practice suicides, which amount to one third in the first three months. Did you know that? Well, for some reason or other, it's never been advertised. The source of that is the psychoanalytic bureau, or whatever they called it, in New York. We've more or less finished that subject, by the way. Very little of it left. But the suicides which occur in French universities is probably the highest in the world and French students blow their brains out and jump out of windows all over the place come examination time. The number of failures in a university do not, however, have anything whatsoever to do with the product turned out by the university. None of these things are related. Because their examinations are very hard does not make it a good university. You see, the ones with the hardest examinations are not necessarily those that produce the most brilliant students. It's not a coordinated fact. There are many other facts which don't coordinate with regard to this and that is be-cause study is a very fruitful field for a suppressive. It, like government, attracts suppressives like honey attracts flies. And you can get all types of suppressive reactions found in textbooks as well as behind the lecture rostrum. As a result – as a result, we have to, when we speak of the subject of study, discuss whether or not the subject itself has a clean bill of health. Is the subject an ethics – or the rendition of the subject – is this an ethics subject? Now, I will tell you a field which, without any doubt whatsoever, would keep a thou-sand ethics officers busy a thousand years and that is the field of navigation. Now, I'm some-what expert in this particular line, but I very seriously doubt if I could walk into a Board of Trade or Bureau of Navigation and pass today my master's examinations in the field of navi-gation. I doubt this very, very much, because it has so little to do with navigation. And I have had the unfortunate experience of having had to navigate in many oceans off the cuff; on my own – inadequate equipment, stopped chronometers, and all of this sort of thing, and missing tables, and so forth. And somehow or another these barriers would not put you into a posi-tion – must not put you into a position where, of course, you lose the ship. So you navigate. And the method by which you navigate is the all-important thing in an examination on navigation and that you navigate is the only test that Old Man Sea requires of you. And I usually – usually when some chap has just passed his navigation examinations with \"A\" and walks aboard a ship that I have anything to do with, well, I get very alert. Be-cause this doesn't say to me that he can navigate at all – has nothing to do with navigation. I've had such a chap walk aboard, take a look at the helm and say, \"So that is a wheel! Well, I've often wondered. And that is a binnacle, that's a compass! Oh, goodness! And that's an engine room telegraph! How interesting!\" And I thought to myself; \"How interesting!\" The man had his ticket; he must have passed his examination. But he hadn't even reached the point of where he knew the environ-ment in which he was supposed to do his navigation. And you break navigation down to its basic principles, you just have certain elemen-tary principles which are just the facts of it, and they are very, very streamlined, obvious facts. For instance, the whole subject is dedicated to the location of where you are on a"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 4 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 356 HPCS sphere. And in view of the fact the sphere also has rocks, shoals and land masses, also has somewhat tempestuous areas which are less safe than others and has calm areas that you jolly well better stay out of; it becomes somewhat important that you know where you are. And in view of the fact that the sea is a water surface which obscures the things even a few inches below it... I remember one time sailing along in a perfectly beautiful flat calm and doing all right and looking over to port and seeing a sea gull walking on the water! [laughter] You don't think at that moment I went slightly pale! Because of tide-races which had been caused by a storm or were going backwards according to the tide tables, and so on – the depth of water over a shoal just alongside of me was not twenty feet, but was one inch! So you see... It was supposed to be high water at that time. Now, therefore, all navigation performed with mathematical activities only can only be counted on to do one thing: wind you up on the rocks. That you're fairly sure of. Because the whole subject is dedicated to knowing where you are. And the next thing is not running into, on or colliding with objects which you're not supposed to frequent or associate with. That's easy. And then we have some other facts: that the stars don't move very much; and cliffs and headlands don't move very much; and the sun, it moves pretty regularly; and the moon moves erratically but very regularly – you can predict its erraticness. And so you can look at these things and if you have a chronometer which happens to have been wound up or can get a time signal from some place, you normally can locate where you are on the sphere by its reference to stellar bodies or, in case of piloting, by recognition of land masses. That's actually all there is to the whole subject. Now, do you understand something about the subject? Audience: Yes. I assure you that you now understand far more about the subject than a first-year mid-shipman at the Naval Academy. Because he's given a book that is named Dutton. Dutton is the bible. Now, Dutton might have been a good textbook to begin with, but it has gotten into the hands of admirals; and it has been ceaselessly rewritten. Now, the Primer of Navigation by Mixter was the elementary textbook which kept the officers who stayed off the rocks off the rocks in World War II. He published it in 1940; it became the bible of the young officer of World War II. And it now – Mixter is dead – is now in the process of being rewritten by the admirals. And when I read it the other day, I just picked up a copy of it and looked – read it – \"This doesn't sound like Mixter.\" So last night, I got ahold of a copy of my World War II copy of Mixter, and a brand-new copy of Mixter's that just came off the press, and I read them page by page against each other and it's considerably different! The words have gotten longer. Now, Bowditch has undergone this process for so many years that from a little tiny textbook published at the end of the eighteenth century in simple language – so that even Bowditch's cook could navigate after a cruise to China – has become a textbook about three or four inches thick which is staggeringly full of sines, cosines, haversines, tables, traverse tables, equations and all kinds of mad things. And it's become an enormous book of tables. If"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 5 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 357 HPCS they don't know what to do with a navigational table, they put it in Bowditch. It is now an official textbook of the United States Navy I imagine there are things in the Royal Navy which have gone this same evolution. But the main point I'm making here is that you would have thought somebody would have paid attention to such a subject – lack of knowledge of which kills men. See, you can die awful quick through an absence of navigation, you see – and not – sometimes not so quick, sometimes rather messily. You'd have thought they would have made every effort to make it simpler. Well, it's true that they've evolved simpler methods of taking star sights, but their textbooks are so complicated that the first time I ever picked up a copy of the Naval Academy textbook on navigation, Dutton, I read the first four sentences, I read them again; they still didn't make any sense. I read them again. I put the book down and that's as far as I've ever gotten with Dutton. Many years later – many years later, I read the first four sentences again and I found out that if you were an expert navigator and needed no information of any kind on the subject, the first four sentences of Dutton made sense. Well, I think that's very interesting. The Encyclopaedia Britannica, in its earliest editions, is a rather simple encyclope-dia – very interesting. I don't like editions later than the eleventh, because you find all sorts of things in editions up to then. They're rather simply written. They're written on the basis that a person owns an encyclopedia because he doesn't know certain things, and he'll want to look them up and find a quick rundown on them. Well, more recent Encyclopaedia Britannica, I'm sorry to say, publish articles on the subject of landscape gardening that only a landscape gar-dener could comprehend or be interested in. We've gotten into the world of the expert. Now, the expert, in writing a textbook, very often goes mad. Last night I picked up a textbook on the subject of... I'm using navigation at this particular time instead of photogra-phy, as I was using in the subject before, just to get a parallel subject. I picked up a textbook on the subject of yacht equip... yacht cruising equipment. Oh, very, very authoritative text, very modern. And there was a chapter there on binoculars. So I looked into this chapter on binoculars and it's just page after page after page about binoculars. It's very interesting be-cause it takes it up from the days of Galileo. It tells you how to build – without being specific about it, but being very complex with complete formulas – a Galilean telescope. I think it's very useful; I can see me now out on a yacht in the middle of the Pacific building a Galilean telescope. I can see this now. So anyway, it goes on from this – which is comprehensible – you say, \"Well, anybody would put that in the first paragraph.\" No, he puts that in the first two or three pages. And we go on from there to the assimilation and – of light by glass and various types of glass and how the glass is made, and we go on and on and on about the formulas now by which you grind glass. I can see me now, you see, just outside the Diamond Head at Waikiki, wondering which binocular to pick up and, \"Let's see now, what is the glass formula that ground the glass of that binocular?\" you see. Silly!"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 6 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 358 HPCS So anyway, it just goes on at this mad rate and at the end of it finally concludes, with-out any preamble of any kind whatsoever, that a yachtsman needs a 7 x 50 type pair of bin-oculars – an authoritative conclusion based on all of the optical formulas. A yachtsman is not an optician; what's he got the formulas there for? Completely batty! Now, the truth of the matter is that that chapter does not contain the following: how to preserve, waterproof and clean glasses being used at sea. And you can wreck a pair of glasses just that fast if you don't know that. How to set a pair of glasses to your own eye prescription and be able to set up any binoculars that you pick up instantly so that you can use it instantly without fiddling about – didn't contain that. Didn't contain the fact that in small vessels, the vibration and the bounding about is such that the shake of the glass makes it impossible for you to detect numbers on buoys, or identities of or names of ships at any distance if you use too high a powered glass, and a 7 x 50 will inevitably blur out on the motion of a small yacht. It is not the glass for a yacht at all. What you want is a three- or four-power for a small boat, and then you can read the numbers on buoys. So even his conclusion was wrong. Fascinating! He spends all these pages, see? But somebody comes along that's had to live with binoculars, knows all the things that dumb, brandnew, untrained quartermasters can do with binoculars – you see, he's used binoculars under all circumstances and he finds out that what the fellow wrote has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject. But wait a minute, wait a minute. A fellow that's been using them for years under those conditions doesn't need that textbook, does he? And if that textbook doesn't inform the user of any of the data that he will require in order to use... What is this? Wow! There's more to this than meets the eye. Considerably more to this than meets the eye. Let's read a few books picked up at random off the shelf on the subject of the sea. And unless you are very clever – and a Scientologist – you will not notice that all it speaks of is disaster. It just tells you, consistently, page after page after page after page, how disastrous it all is, how you must do this and that because this is going to happen, how you must do that and this because something else is going to happen, how you must not do so-and-so because something else is going to happen. You read in vain how to get another half a knot out of your sail set. But you read all about how the tracks to the front of the sail as they attach it to the mast – not to go technical on you – how these little gimmicks that they put on the sail to go up the Marconi track, how they tear loose in storms and jam sideways and make it necessary for people to get up and climb up mast, which is impossible. And if you read very much of this, you would not go to sea; you would be scared stiff; just scared stiff! And even on a person of considerable experience this creeps up on him and he doesn't notice it. And eventually he starts going to sea, and he gets in a sort of a half-hysterical frame of mind. Beautiful calm day, he's out in the middle of a channel fifty miles wide, there are no ships in sight and he's worrying about his azimuths, or did the subpermanent magnetism of the hull change the last time she was in dry dock, and is his compass reading right, and will he pick up – oh, just worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry. He'll never sit back, you know, and say, \"Great!\" you know?"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 7 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 359 HPCS Now, if you want to go into hysterics sometime, read coast pilots. For light reading, for those who like horror stories, that is what one recommends. I remember one time considering taking the big jump down from Alaska – just going outside all protection in the middle of winter and tearing on down across the wide reaches of the Pacific and fetching up at a California port as a direct bang! you see, with an expedition-ary vessel – without going behind anything, and so forth. And I sat there and the mate I had was sitting there, and we were both reading – we had two copies of the same coast pilot. And we were looking it all up – and it wasn't – but it was not the same coast pilot; his was British and mine was American – and we read it. It seems that five hundred miles off of the coast there are fantastic currents which, when the wind and fog come together – because the wind comes with the fog at the same time in the middle of December and January – you can absolutely count on being torn to pieces, sunk, engaged, involved, becalmed, messed up and in general finished. And it was so bad – it's much worse than I'm saying – and it was so bad that he and I, sitting up... It was already, you see, complete black dark outside at high noon, you know, and we were going to take this run and somehow or other we were going to get the hell out of there. And we all of a sudden simultaneously broke into hysterical laughter Nothing could be that bad, you see, but nothing! The British pilot, American pilot – nothing could be that bad! One time I read about a terrible tide-race. And it was a tide-race. And it told all about how it had sunk a Canadian gun boat and lost two hundred men, and that this tide-race went sixteen knots and – every time the tide changed, and there was a huge rock in the middle of it that split vessels apart but was visible at night because of the spray leaping into the air. Well, normally you would go through these things at slack water anyway. I went through it at slack water, and the cook, all the time we were going through it, was cooking up hot flapjacks and pushing them up on the bridge, because I was sitting there eating my break-fast the entire distance through this mad tide-race. I shot another tide-race one time, a narrows, where \"anybody that entered it was prac-tically sunk, but sometimes the ships caromed off the sides of the cliffs and kept afloat some-how.\" And I was in the middle of this thing in the middle of the night, because there was an error in the American tide tables – a two-hour error – and I'd hit the thing at race instead of at slack. And the water was going through there just boiling white and, man, I came near that in a sailing ship and I was into it before I could do another thing. And the lights of the cabin were shining through ports on the cliffs, so close up that you could see the moss. And the tiller broke, and left us with no tiller. So I rigged an emergency tiller in the middle of all of this and steered her on out the other side and suddenly realized we'd gotten through it. And I realized something else about it: I never really at any time ever had to know anything about that millrace at all, if I'd hit it at slack water, high water, or any other way, it didn't matter if it was fast; it always sends a boat through. What was I studying tide tables for? So it runs fast. You get the idea? Well, of course, it's very nice to know all these cautions, but what did the captain of the Indianapolis... He was a US Naval captain. And they have stripes, you know, that go clear up to their cap. This fellow took the cruiser Indianapolis through this first narrows I was talk-"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 8 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 360 HPCS ing to you about. And the local pilots cautioned him about it and he'd read all the tide tables and he was a graduate of the Naval Academy and he was a man of great experience, I'm very sure, and so forth. And he had all this information, because every time they graduate, you know, up – I mean every time they get promoted they have to pass complete examinations on everything, you know? I'm sure he had the information – \"A\" student all the way. And he got the USS Indianapolis crossways in that channel at full race, with its stern stuck on one bank and its bow on the other. This he managed. I can't for the life of me know how he could pos-sibly have done it. But if you look very carefully through these textbooks, you will find the bulk of them simply tell you not to go to sea, that it's very dangerous. And a person who studies them very, very hard and abides by them totally, eventually loses all the fun of going to sea – and doesn't. So, there is suppression throughout that field. Now, of course, it is very nice for them to tell you that if you let the boat flood with butane gas and then strike a match, the boat will blow up. We're glad to know that! It's very nice to know where the rocks are. But let's not concentrate on them for the rest of our lives. Let's also point out where the open, easy-sailing water is, but we never hear about that; we just hear about the rocks. And we could, then, take any subject and write it up for study purposes as a suppres-sive subject. Now, you want to tell people the dangers – sometimes you can tell them too lightly, that's true. For instance, it – I'd hate to tell people... There's two extremes here: I'd hate to have to omit the idea that if you do an incorrect Search and Discovery you can make your PC quite ill. You get the wrong SP, the person can be sick; he can now get sick, because you've restimulated the right one, you see. And that is what's making him sick. You're not making him sick, the right one is. Now, I can tell you that, but now to go on raving and ranting and describing S&D as only how not to get the wrong one because you're sure going to do it, I could get you into a frame of mind – I don't say I would – but you could be gotten into a frame of mind whereby you would probably never do an S&D because it's too dangerous. Interesting! You could be scared right off of doing the right thing because it's too deadly. Well, now, that would be how you would curve a subject and make it suppressive. That's a suppressive rendition of the subject. It's not the subject that's... But we could just go on talking about \"People get sick when you do an S&D on them if you do not so-and-so and you want to set up your meter because people will get sick. And your meter has to be trimmed, your trim knob has to be so-and-so because people are going to get very sick. And then it's your fault as the auditor, you see? And then so on,\" and we never talk about anybody ever recovering because of an S&D; we just talk how sick they'll get if you do it wrong, do you see? Then it becomes too dangerous to do. Now, they've done this about the mind, and they managed to have scared off – the SP on the track managed – has managed actually to scare off all intelligent research on the sub-ject of the mind and soul. You've heard time and again how dangerous it is. \"You mustn't fool around with the mind!\" Perfectly all right to take a meat ax to the brain, but you mustn't fool around with the mind!"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 9 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 361 HPCS I got my belly so full in 1950 of psychoanalysts telling me how dangerous it was to fool around with the mind. But I finally more or less rejected it with laughter, because I looked at who was talking. And when he said fool around, man, he meant fool around, be-cause I found out he could not study Dianetics; he could not do it. And do you know our main departure from training psychoanalysts and psychiatrists and medical doctors is not really based on the fact we are antipathetic toward them at all. It's the fact that they can't seem to duplicate study materials. And it's just so hard, it's so tough. A person comes off the street; you can teach him a Comm Course in a week. Well, you'll teach a psychologist a Comm Course in something like six or eight weeks. Rough, see? Because the guy has been very suppressively taught. He can't duplicate anymore on this sub-ject. And it's contra everything else he has been taught, you see. So it's all going in sideways and backwards and he's got preconceived notions and he's actually in Remedy B of The Book of Case Remedies. That's what he needs. Now, the suppressive subject then is something which booby-traps study, and all of the work which you put in to get somebody to know his algebra, and so on, might be all lost because he hasn't got a textbook which teaches him algebra. You see? Now, what is needed is an appreciation of the study materials by the people who write materials to be studied. Now, blokes will try; they'll try very hard. I was reading a book on ocean cruising the other night. It was very fine. It was not ocean cruising but Coastwise Navigation Wrinkles. And he said, \"But what you should use if you have a crew who isn't trained,\" something like that, \"and it's much safer, you should always have a grid compass.\" A grid compass. He starts it out with the fact that everybody must understand his work. That was the condition under which he wrote it. And in the first few sentences here is this phrase \"grid compass.\" There's no further explanation of any kind whatsoever. So, just for fun, I picked up various naviga-tional and equipment texts to find if I could find a grid compass: a picture of one, a definition of one. I picked up two or three nautical dictionaries to try to find a definition of a grid com-pass. Didn't exist – very hard, very rough. Now, there was a guy who was honestly trying to do a good job and he skidded because he didn't know that he mustn't put in a word that people wouldn't know. Now, in Dianetics and Scientology we've been consistently up against the fact that we're beyond the limit of language. The English language does not include the parts of a sub-ject which was unknown. You understand, I mean, if you don't – if nobody's known anything about any of these things, you see, well, they have to be named, which unfortunately gives us a lot of nomenclature, and so on, which we could be very happy without. We have to have it because it isn't in the language. Now, once in a while a psychoanalyst tries to turn it around, or a psychologist tries to turn it around to his own nomenclature, and you get the real reason why some things which could have been called by old terms aren't – is because he's got an entirely different definition and his definition is in argument with the other definitions in his own field, so they don't know what they're talking about. So, it's a completely messed-up area. Now, where they did have some words, the words didn't mean what they're supposed to mean, do you see, and then there's argument about the definition of those words."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 10 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 362 HPCS So the solution to this was actually to turn verbs to nouns where possible, to use no-menclature which was expressive to some degree of what it represented. Now, not knowing the study materials when the material was originally written, it was not possible to apply all this and go back to the beginning and sort it all out up the line. Now, this would be a very, very long and rough passage. This would be a tough passage to try to rewrite everything all the way down the line. Now, we suffer to the degree that we don't even have a dictionary; we do not have a real dictionary at this time which would give – and that is because every time I get a copy of a dictionary, and so forth, I have to, myself; check the whole thing. And I find myself making changes and corrections in it. And then I have to work very hard, you see, on it, and then somebody else has been working on it, and it's a major project. And just about the time I will get started, you see some – a lot of it's been done, and then I've got to carry on through with corrections – something will come up, something will be totally demanding of total time, and it doesn't get done. And this dictionary – we've been on dictionaries for I don't know how long, trying to get you a dictionary. Well, it's a rough job. It's a rough job at best. But you will find nearly everything is defined in the text where it originally appears. Therefore, were you to cover all of the data, you would get all of the language. And that is one of the reasons why I said that a Saint Hill student had better go back to the original method of study. And the original method of study is you covered it all lightly. You covered it all lightly and you wound up then with a good grip on the entirety of the subject. And then, what you really had to know, well, you then studied that hard for star-rate. But volume was what it took. Now, of course, you're up against not knowing where the word was originally used and there are probably a great many tapes missing. I don't imagine we have many Wichita tapes, and I know we have few or no Elizabeth tapes compared to the lectures. There were eight hours of lecture a day there on many days; five hours was routine, teaching different classes and units. But this gives us a difficulty right there. But we're clever enough to know we have that difficulty. And now what I'm going to tell you is going to solve this to a very marked degree, and this is the subject of the intentions of study. For what purpose are you studying? Now, until you clarify that, you in actual fact cannot make an intelligent activity of it. Now, most students study for examination. That's folly! Complete folly! You're not going to do anything with the examiner. You're sitting there studying for examination, study-ing for an examination, studying for an examination, \"How will I regurgitate this when I am asked a certain question? How will I respond? How will I pass my checkout?\" Well, it's very hard to keep \"demonstrate\" and \"example\" and \"clarify\" into examina-tion. It's so much easier to fall back on \"What did it say in the bulletin,\" you see, and get di-rect quotes of the material itself; when in actual fact that's really not proper examination. Be-cause the fault that can be found with education in the university, the argument the practical man has with the academically trained man when he first gets him on the subject and has to make him fully acquainted with it – you know, like the guy who's been out there building"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 11 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 363 HPCS houses for a long time and he all of a sudden gets an assistant who's just been trained in the university to build houses. He goes mad! Guy doesn't know anything about the subject at all. He's been studying it for years, yet he knows nothing about it and he doesn't know why this is. Well, I can tell you why it is, because the fellow who just went through the university studied all of his materials so that he could be examined on them. He didn't study them to build houses. And the fellow who's been out there on a practical line is not necessarily supe-rior in the long run at all, but he certainly is able to get houses built because all of his study is on the basis of \"How do I apply this to house building?\" Every time he picks up an ad or lit-erature or anything else, he's asking the question throughout the entirety of his reading, \"How can I apply this to what I'm doing?\" And that is the basic and important difference between practical study and academic study. Scholastic or academic study is not worth very much. Why you have a fellow go through a course and wind up at the other end of the course unable to audit, it's because he in actual fact studied for the examination. He did not study to apply it to people. So he winds up with the material unapplied. That's regrettable. This is why you get failures in practice after certification, and is the whole reason. Now, if a fellow were just studying for the examination, he would not have to know the exact meaning of all of the words. He could sort of gloss over it and pass it off because he could include the word in the totality of its sentence and merely quote the sentence if he was asked the question. And he wouldn't really have to know the meaning of the word. So he tends to move out the material over here and have sort of nothing to do with the material while he is busy studying the material, because he can just rattle it off. And this explains the student who can rattle off his material so beautifully but doesn't know anything about the sub-ject. See, you say to him, \"Fulcrums.\" He doesn't know what a fulcrum is. He hasn't a clue, but he knows it fits in a sentence that says, \"The law of the fulcrum is rat-a-tat-tat tat-a-tat-tat,\" so he can write it all down rat-a-tat-tat. And he knows how to solve fulcrums because those are the formulas by which you solve them: distance, weight, so on. So he just applies it for the problem he's given, \"Rat-a-tat-tat-a-tat-tat trrm-pa, there we are.\" One fine day he's got to move a barrel. And he stands around and he looks around at this barrel and he scratches his head and he doesn't know how he's going to move that barrel, because he can't get one end of it picked up to slide anything under it, and he couldn't hold it up if he did, and so forth. And finally somebody who doesn't know anything about fulcrums at all comes along, takes a pole, sticks it over the top of a stump and sets up a \"fulcrum,\" see, and moves the barrel with the big lever. The person watching this is not likely to connect his lessons in physics with what the workman did. And therefore, we can get very educated dumbbells, and that's how they're made. It's on the intention of the study. He's studying it to be examined on, or he's studying it to apply it, and it's just those two different things. Now, where a subject is booby-trapped and suppressive in the extreme, it can be stud-ied for examination but can't be studied for application. Doesn't matter how complex a study is, no matter how suppressively written, no matter how badly organized, it still can be memo-rized. It can be spat back on the examination paper, if you work hard enough and your mem-"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 12 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 364 HPCS ory is good enough. But you can't apply it. You can't begin to apply that subject, because there was no understanding in it with which to apply it. Isn't that horrible! There was nothing there to be understood and if there was nothing there to be understood, of course, it couldn't be applied. I imagine you could write up a whole textbook on the subject of \"weejacks,\" and no-body would ever know what they were, you didn't know what they were, or anything else. You could write a very learned text that was full of mathematical equations by which the whole situation of \"weejacks\" could be completely fixed up, and wind up at the other end of it with a subject on which some students could get \"A.\" Totally synthesized subject. Now, on the other side of the picture – the other side of the picture – if you studied that subject for application, every time you hit a bump that was incomprehensible in the text, you yourself would require clarification. If it wasn't in the text to be understood and if it was-n't in any parallel text to be understood, why, in order to apply it you would have to clarify it. And you wouldn't run into a bunch of misunderstoods, because you would stop at them when you arrived at them, and you would get them clarified. Do you see? Now, your difficulty in studying Dianetics and Scientology is basically the lack of a dictionary. But I call to your attention that I just got through turning you out two tapes and a bulletin which, if you look through them very carefully, you will not find anything in them that isn't defined in them. You noticed that about them? Well, that's the Dianetic materials which is directly being applied at this moment in the practice of Dianetics. Now, that's totally defined for total application, and so therefore, the application is possible and you can study it for application. And we notice that students who are auditing in Dianetics are getting rather interesting results. Now, in addition to that they're told to study this material so they can go audit, right now! Do you see? Now, that would produce this other frame of mind of studying it for appli-cation. Now, if anybody is making any – having any trouble with the Dianetic materials at all, it is simply that they have not studied the Dianetic tapes or bulletin for application. They have studied them for examination. Now, if you were to go back, brand-new, as though you'd never heard of it before and study it for application, and every time you got a single sentence of it, wondered how you were going to apply this to a pc or what this had to do with your perform-ance as an auditor in the application of Dianetics to the pc, you would wind up at the other end with no case of indigestion. You would wind up with a complete grasp of the subject, able to get results. Bang! Bang! Bang! Do you see? But one is taught very bad habits of study in universities and in schools in this society at this time, because so much stress is put on examination. The stress on examination is so terrific that one can become a social outcast through failing his examinations. I notice in the United States, now, they call them \"dropouts,\" \"Rrrhh! Dropouts!\" Guy flunked, he's finished. But it's also interesting to note that of the four fellows who dropped out (I think it was Princeton) in one semester – now this is very paraphrased data, I'm not going to try to give you their histories – four \"dropouts\" in one semester at Princeton, from the lower classes of Princeton (you know, freshman, sophomore, and so on), all were making in excess"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 13 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 365 HPCS of twenty-five thousand dollars a year within the year. Wait! What! Whoa! What's that? Those weren't the failures; they were the successes in that class. Now, we check in vain to find a single philosopher, except Mills, who ever got a pass-ing grade in school or who stayed in school to its end. Read the list, man: Bacon, Spencer – just read them off. Bang! Bang! Bang! This one, that one, the other one, oh yeah, well, he was kicked out. He was in there seventeen days. He was at Oxford and they gave him the deep six, and so on, so on. Why? Why? Well, man for a long time has just avoided this. He knows it exists. But he's avoided it totally because it's a complete assignment of failure to his educational system if it can't teach the bright boys. And he's given many explanations to it, and so on. But the explanation is simply that the study materials that are given are not for application, and these birds are doers in life and they want material for application, and the university texts are not arranged to ap-ply anything to anything. Now, I'm not riding a hobbyhorse in my own resentments, but I will tell you this brief anecdote. I was flunked in analytical geometry, and I was flunked resoundingly! I was given a great big \"F.\" I know it sounds like a mathematics, and unless you're acquainted with mathe-matics in general you've probably never even heard of it. And that's because it's a dead mathematics. It has no possible use – according to the professors. But I'd sat back at the end of – the back of the class and I got intrigued with this stuff because it could be applied to aerial navigation. And I found out that you could draw up a formula out of it which would solve the drift of wind – you know, wind drift, and a few other things could be applied very easily – and I found out that it might be a jolly useful mathemat-ics. Oh, I made a mistake, man! That finished it. I made a mistake! I told the professor – name was Hodgson. If you ever saw a flame light in any man's eye, it was to see this beautifully dead mathematics being given purpose and application. I told him rather indifferently. I didn't try to push it through. I wasn't doing anything, not arguing, very polite. He flunked me just like that – the whole course. Well, fortunately, I was able to go over to the chair of mathematics of the university. His name was Taylor, he was one of the twelve men in the United States at that time who could understand Einstein. And I don't think he knew whether he was talking to me or not talking to me, but I told him that I required a reexamination on the subject. So, he ordered Hodgson to take off and make a new examination. And so Hodgson put every formula in the book – you had to know every formula in the entire text verbatim, you had to know every theorem in it verbatim, and so forth. And he said, \"I'll fix him – trying to make a live mathe-matics out of a dead mathematics.\" I got ninety-eight on the examination. But this was a direct assault on the citadels of \"We've got knowledge nice and dead, let's keep it that way.\" And I erred there by telling him there was a use for the stuff. It was a fatal error on my part. I should never have opened my mouth. I was also flunked one time in a class on free thinking, and so forth, because I'd decided that you could think freely. [laughter, laughs] The entirety of study materials depends, then, on the material to be studied and the at-titude with which it is being studied – the purpose and intention of the student."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 14 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 366 HPCS Now, if you were to go over Dianetic materials and Scientology materials just on the basis of \"How could I apply this, and how can I use that, and how can I apply this?\" And if you examined principally on the basis of \"All right, we've got bulletin number 642...\" I would expect people to know the auditing commands verbatim, but \"How do you apply this? HCOB blankety-blank date,\" you know, and the Examiner said – he didn't say, \"What's in this bulle-tin?\" see – he said, \"How do you apply this bulletin?\" You just read it. I bet you would get an awful look of horror in many a student's eye. He has read it to be examined on; he hasn't read it to apply it. But now he, in actual fact, will have no use for it of any kind whatsoever if he has read it to be examined on. But if he has read it to apply it, then he will find it is useful information. Got that? Now, I say you have the liability in the fact that you're dealing with a subject which has no tradition in its vocabulary; its vocabulary is new. There is – singularly horrible to have it missing. There's a missing dictionary, and so on. But most of the materials, if you're study-ing them broadly, are defined in the text themselves and you can gather what those things are. Also, your Instructor generally will know what it is, and you can ask questions to clarify them, and you should clarify them. Well, now, these materials concerning study amplify, of course, the other materials we had about study. And I'm very amused at one particular subject, which is one of – probably the biggest football and causes more trouble to man than any other single subject, and that is the subject of economics. And the subject of economics has been used to forward political ideologies. So for every ideology there is an economics written up to fit it, to a point where people no longer believe there is a subject called economics. But the odd part of it is there is a subject called economics, and it has certain raw, fundamental basics which, if violated, wreck the works. But these things have all been carefully set aside and a brand-new facade has been erected in its particular position in order to forward communism or fascism or some other -ism, -ism, -ism; and then you, of course, you get the socialist using capitalistic economics, the capitalist using socialistic economics. I don't know how they do that, but they do, you know? You know the Labor Party right now uses nothing but capitalistic economics. They're dedicated to the destruction of capitalism, but they're using capitalistic economics. I don't know how they're going to succeed with that. The Conservative, on the other hand, who is dedicated to capitalism, is using nothing but socialist economic proposals to remedy things. I think it's the most wonderful mess I ever saw. But there was where a subject was taken to fit a certain, to use a crude word, pitch. You see, the subject was written up to have a curve. \"This is communist economics,\" see? \"And the rudigadders of the whuterbuds all go whir-whir, and the formulas are 'for every man according to his bla-bal',\" you know? Yuck! The second you start applying it, it violates the subject that there is a basic subject. There is a subject called economics and it is a very simple subject indeed, and it's been ob-scured."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"STUDY AND INTENTION 15 SHSBC-439 – 18.8.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 367 HPCS So there's something else you can do with a subject: You can pervert a subject to such a point that the subject is no longer applicable or assimilable, or if applied, becomes catastro-phe. So, that's something else that can be done with a subject. That's what they did with Freud's work. I'm sure Freud had a lot of workable technol-ogy. It's – doesn't survive in the practice of psychoanalysis, I assure you. Because what I was taught in 1924 as Freudian analysis isn't in any textbooks anymore. I know it seems a long time ago to be taught the first time about psychoanalysis, but it is true, that was when I first got this stuff and it sounded very interesting. It's all gone. I haven't heard any of that for years. I've heard other things. I've heard how the \"autoerotic economic system very often recoils upon the society because of the perversion of the id.\" You want to take one of Horney's books, or something like that on psychoanalysm, and to – read it to a party sometime. Just take a paragraph at random, read it out of context. There's nobody at that party will believe that that is in that book; they will be sure that you are just quoting gobbledygook. They're absolutely positive that you will be quoting gobbledy-gook, because no textbook could be like that. But that's how you could take a subject. Now, all of man is being caught up in an economic web. He's being caught in an eco-nomic net at this particular time. Every hour of his day is being monitored by economics. It isn't – interesting that the subject of economics has been so overcomplicated and so bent and so badly defined and turned off and made so suppressive that nobody can get at the root of what they're doing. The most beautiful obfuscation, the most beautiful obscuring of motive which I have ever seen. Now, you are studying a subject in which there is no curve. If it errs in any direction, it's probably you aren't warned enough at certain places. But there isn't any curved intent in this. You're studying, actually, along the line it was researched. So that if you were to study this subject for application, you would quickly find out in it what was not applicable and you would find out what was incomprehensible to you, or just is there but is incomprehensible. You would find these things out. And gradually you would get any kink shaken out of your materials, whether I sat down and wrote a dictionary or not. You see? So anyway, the next time you want a good laugh, pick up some text on some subject, you know, like \"Landscape Gardening for the Beginner,\" and find out whether the book is an ethics case or not. It's quite interesting. You will find amongst the texts by which man is ho-ping to carry forward his culture and civilization, you will find the SP very well represented. You will also find perfectly good blokes who go right along fine. But you will also find that some of these chaps, who are very good and have done a good job, are the most damned peo-ple that anybody ever heard of. For instance, Will Durant in writing The Story of Philosophy and attempting to clarify philosophy, and so on, if he's still alive, actually spent the entire latter part of his life in seclu-sion in California in shame and horror because so much hell was raised with him for writing that textbook to make philosophy simple and comprehensible to others.

And you read the book, you find out what calculus is. And it's sufficiently simple that you wind up laughing, you see, and you go ahead and you can do something with calculus. But that isn't the calculus textbooks in the university. I have had professors who severely warned their stu-dents against this book, because it permitted the mathematics and its very abstruse language to be communicated to the student. So you will even find teachers who warn people against simple textbooks, and you will find large stratas of the society get a \"down\" on simplification. Well, study materials – study materials needed a few other remarks. Maybe this lec-ture has helped you out a little bit; maybe it's clarified what you're doing. The next time you're studying something, why, take a look at it and you'll find yourself up – \"And the Examiner is going to ask this,\" and so forth, and you just haul yourself up at that particular point and ask yourself this question instead, \"Does this have application? Does this amplify my understand-ing of the mind? Does this broaden my grip of the subject? And if so, how? How can I apply this, if I knew this datum, out in life?\" and so forth, \"Of what use would it be to me?\" And you all of a sudden will find yourself recover from any indigestion you have from studying too much too fast.

It's not deserved; I've been very mean to several of you in the last day or two; very, very mean, with good results. Okay. What is this? Audience: 24th. It's the 24th of Jan. AD 12 – 1962 – in the Year of Our Travail, especially yours. All right. Now, I have some good news for you. Going to sit down in this lecture, if you don't mind. But I have some very, very good news for you, some excellent news for you; that if you were beaten over the head, tortured, treated with sarcasm, hammered and pounded and generally abused, you eventually decide to find out – you go past, you see, merely attacking Ron, you see, that breaks down and you go past that, and you say, \"Well now, if this much fuss is being made about it, maybe there is a right way to do it,\" and so you try that for a while and nothing much happens. And then if you are hammered and pounded and beaten some more, then you decide to do it right, and then all of a sudden there's tremendous dawn-ing on every hand that there was something here. And that has just happened on this good day of our Dianetics in 1962. This just happened. Several of you in just the last session you ran discovered that 3D Criss Cross worked like crazy; just discovered it – brand-new discovery. Some of you have not made that discov-ery yet, but many of you – the majority that were having any difficulty with this – all of a sudden it dawned that there was something here and that it did work and that the session ran like a hot bomb, and all became suddenly well. Now, the old-time student here who has had a great deal of training – I will say this, a great deal of training shows up along these lines – got results with 3D Criss Cross at once. The second it was presented to them they started getting results with 3D Criss Cross, which is quite interesting, see. They looked it over, they said \"That's okay,\" they started listing and everything, and the next thing you know, they were getting results with it. But those of you who have just come up to the nervous state of newly created IIb did-n't measure up this well. And you've been floundering and falling on your heads now for the better part of two weeks. It has been pretty gruesome. I mean I have actually suffered for you. I didn't suffer for the PC. I can always straighten out a PC. If I can straighten out a PC, why, I don't worry about the PC particularly. But I suffered for the poor auditor, sitting there doing"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 2 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 370 HPCS exactly what he was told (if doing it backwards), and with Ron shouldering the total responsi-bility of it all going bad because it probably didn't work, suddenly waking up, deciding to do it right, and then the second step: finding out that it worked like mad. Now, that is quite a win. That is a win for me. However, it tends to validate this sys-tem of activity, a system of activity which begins with apathy. See, you confront somebody in apathy, \"Nothing works anyway and there is no way to do anything right anyhow. But if you did do it right nothing would happen, because there isn't any way to do it right because noth-ing would happen if you did do it right.\" Now, it is sometimes necessary in action to throw a bit of a hand grenade into that par-ticular type of activity and just say \"Yow, yow, yow!\" outrageously, you see? Say, \"Well, look a'here. You're only writing on one side of your auditor's report.\" And the person says, \"Well, yes, of course I'm only writing on one side of the auditor's report, and all auditors do, don't they?\" \"Well, they mostly do, but you shouldn't, you see?\" And then, \"You should have known better than that, see? It has never been published or released, so you should have known about it.\" Expect the student to have picked it all up telepathically, expect the thing to have sort of leaked in through the pores by association with the tile, or something like that, you see? Doesn't much matter. Now, this is very pertinent to you in the training of Class IIs. When you start training Class II auditors you should recognize this for what it's worth, and it's a little lesson that I could teach you on the subject of raising hell. That's the title of the lesson, \"Raising Hell.\" Now, there are two ways you could get somebody out of apathy, see? They don't know and there is no right way to do it and there are probably no results anyway. Now, there's two ways to approach this problem. One is on the route of making auditors and the other is on the route of auditing. Now, the way you make auditors differs entirely, of course, from the way you audit PCs. There are two routes here that we employ, not necessarily for the betterment of cases but for getting the job done. Of course the net result of all this is the betterment of all cases, but there are two routes that we actually employ and you should recognize these as distinctly different routes. And the first of these is where a person is concerned as an auditor. And we have always had a bit of line on this, and you found in an Academy in the old days where they didn't have this policy in force they made very bad auditors. Wow! Terrible! And that was this type of an approach: \"Well, we know you can't audit because you have a case, and we'll try to patch your case up, and if we get your case up, why, then maybe some day you will be able to audit.\" That type of approach does not work in the making of auditors. Just write it down to that. You see, if we admitted that the auditor had a case then nobody on this whole planet would ever be sprung. Do you see that? So this is just a piece of arbitrary snarl. Do you see? This datum must not be true! It isn't that it is true or isn't true, it just must not be true! See, there's no logic to it at all. It just must not be true, because otherwise you would never bail anybody out of anything because there would never be anybody to audit him. And true"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 3 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 371 HPCS enough, over the years watching Academies that practiced the idea, \"if we...\" – the D of T, if he had the idea that \"If we just processed all these students and somehow or another if I just gave them all a little bit of a case gain, and I got them all in shape so they could confront their PC and if I could get their cases from getting in their roads, why, then I could make them into auditors.\" And this goes out as far as this: \"If we only let 'good' people into the Academy...\" We don't know what this \"good\" person is. He lurks out someplace under the rhododendrons or someplace but he never seems to have come near any organization to date, this \"good\" person, you see? \"Now if you could just get 'good' people,\" that's the other song you hear, but that's just a little bit of a downgrade. Immediately after you hear this \"good\" people action the next tune that you hear being played on the out-of-tune street piano is \"If we just could audit all of the cases in the Academy, why, then, you see, they would all be able to audit.\" And they of course have propounded a piece of nonsense. You see, if there's nobody to audit all these cases in the Academy, how the hell are they ever going to get audited? And you don't have an Academy at all, you have an HGC. So this quickly defeats itself as a philosophy. So very early, I think it was about the 7th ACC, this philosophy was entered into the training of auditors. And the philosophy is workable; it is not necessarily true, it is not neces-sarily easy, it is not necessarily kind, sweet or good. It simply works and it is in a workable line, true. But it's only a workable truth. And that is, simply, \"Auditors do not have cases,\" period. That is the one thing that we must insist on. Now, it goes as far as this, that if he's slightly warm and you can see a mist on a mirror held against his mouth, [laughter] he or she is in shape to audit. If they can be dragged to the chair and if an E-meter can be propped up in their vicinity, they're in condition to audit. This goes to a total extremity. They could be sitting there with both legs cut off from a street acci-dent, but they are in shape to audit. That's it. That's just it. It's like when nations get down to the last – they're getting the conscripts from their 14-year-old class, you know, and the 72-year-old class and the 14 year-old class; anybody who dares walk back in through, you see, from hospitals or anything else, anybody who dares come anywhere near the assembly officers who are putting together new regiments, you see, is instantly just stamped hugely \"FIT FOR COMBAT,\" see? We don't get it from that particu-lar thing, but it just gives you the idea. Now, when time goes on and a nation gets more fit to work, they start then saying \"Well, this person is not fit for combat and should be audited,\" and that sort of thing. But let me call something to your attention: that we are not a nation but we are certainly a people, and this is very germane. We are not in that condition today where we can say \"Well, let's take this person and let's audit him for a while, and maybe he'll learn how to audit some day and – you know, if we get his case out of the road, why, maybe he can audit.\" We're not in that condition. We're not that wealthy. See, we're just not that wealthy in people, nor are we that far advanced along the lines. So this datum not only has been true but will be true for quite a while."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 4 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 372 HPCS Now, oddly enough this is a workable philosophy, totally workable as a philosophy. It does work, and today is one of those days when I have seen this philosophy work. Some peo-ple with Class IIb who are so far from clear they would have to have a moonshot to compre-hend it (I'm talking about cases now, see, just casewise, bluuhh! see?) have actually been driven in toward the absorption of data, the regularities of practice, to an actual recognition that what they were doing ended in a very, very powerful, fine gain for the PC, and that they could do it. That's much more important. Now, this is one of those days when that philosophy has worked out. Now, I don't say that you're in horrible condition. I'd say when you get some process-ing and so forth you will probably get up to being in horrible condition. [laughter] Compare the way you – the condition that you were in a couple of trillion years ago, or 500 trillion or something like that, whatever the outrageous figure might be, and you're not in such good shape these days, you know? And for you to actually start putting together a being – not a human being, anybody can put together a human being. You just take some electronic shock waves and some implants and kick him and destroy all their self-determinism, then destroy other-determinism, and then racket him between destroyed self-determinism and destroyed other-determinism, and you fix him up real good and get them to accumulate all masses and never as-is anything, and you've got a human being. All right, so you just – it'd be no virtue to make one of those. Let's move it up just a little bit further – but to make a functional being, to take a big seven-league boot stride in the direction of making a functional being. Now, that has happened, and that's just happened just in the last couple of days. This sort of thing has been coming up. I'm very happy about this because it's far more significant than you might realize at first glance. It means that the thing can be bootstrapped. Now, we expect somebody that's been under training for a half a year of heavy duress and so forth to be able to pick up a process and be able to do it, but I was very proud when those older students just did that and were able to do that and just kicked it off from the start-ing line and that was it. Well, that was a little victory in itself, but it was not particularly a victory for this other philosophy because they have had good case gains and they are a long ways from where they were. The other people who have just come up to Class IIb had not had very significant case gains yet and they were able to do it. Now, that was very important. Well, you see, this philosophy works, and it's a distinct philosophy: If he's warm he can audit. Get the idea? And that you can actually bring enough pressure to bear and enough training to bear on an individual so that he actually can do a properly laid out comprehension and action as far as the PC is concerned and arrive with a tremendously significant result. Now, that's a victory, because if that weren't true we as a people would never make it. We'd just never make it, that's all. There would be a few able guys and they would quickly go out the bottom through auditing seven and a half hours a day. I've already scolded two or three Saint Hill graduates who have left and who all of a sudden sat down to a grind of audit-ing of about seven and a half hours a day and just didn't do anything else, didn't really bother to train anybody or try to pick it up or push it through. They were just going to audit people,"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 5 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 373 HPCS audit people, audit people, audit people – well, they can't audit enough people to do any good. It's just a spot in the ocean. Now, if you looked around you would find out that there aren't on earth at the present moment enough auditors to give enough sessions to enough people to make any significant gain in the society at large in the next century. The mathematics are all against it. If you never made one more auditor, if we just took the auditors we had at this particular moment and eve-rybody audited hammer and tongs, seven and a half hours a day for the next ten years or something like that, you add it up and you compare it to the world's population and you get a drop in the bucket. It's a discouragingly small amount. And if we never trained another audi-tor, the auditors that had been trained would have long since gone by the boards before they even got halfway through the population of New York City. You see, the mathematics are dead against it. Don't think that you, with your auditing, cannot make a change in the society. You certainly can, you certainly can, but you would be making actually a rico and a pobre society. In other words, you'd be making the society of the rich and the poor, the aristocracy and the slaves, and so forth. It wouldn't help but do that, because of course you could pick out people here and there and put them into terrific condition and never fix it up so they're ever backed up, see? Well, they – oh yeah! They've got a big zone of influence, that's for sure! And they'll get things done, that's for sure; but let me assure you they would not, all of them, be tempered by the peculiarities that I suffer from which is that man should be free. Not even after you'd audited them would they suffer from that peculiarity uniformly, let me assure you. That just wouldn't be done. And give it a decade, give it two decades, something like that, and they would be start-ing to get a little bit impatient. Enough victims would have been deposited on their doorstep for them to start erecting the stocks and the whipping posts. The next thing you know, we'd find we had two or three classes of citizen. We would have the clear and the slave, you know? We'd divide the whole society up in some kind of a line. It would just be forced upon us to do this. That is actually a very dangerous direction in which to proceed because that direction has always led civilizations into decay and chaos. There is no such thing as a successful civi-lization which is made out of slave masters and slaves. I assure you that it is not successful. It's never been successful and it never will be successful. Now, it's attractive and it can be practical but it's not successful. It has no great duration and it doesn't make anybody much happier. So this is quite interesting from a point of view of a long look. Very few of you ever give a long look to Scientology, you leave that up to me to a marked degree. Well, thank you; but when I look in the crystal ball and look up the line a century I can see a number of pic-tures presenting themselves, a number of aspects of what might come of all this. And don't think you can fire a shot of this volume and magnitude in a planet of this type without creat-ing an effect. It might be a slow effect, just to the degree, you see, that it is practical. Its speed actually is determined not by the inertia of the masses but by the efficiency and effectiveness of what you're doing. And you can't let go of something like this in a society or a world of this"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 6 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 374 HPCS type or size without having repercussions that don't just go up a century. They'll be still rack-eting up the line until this planet is a billiard ball. Now, it might become a billiard ball sooner than you think. But not all of you will for-get Scientology even if you go to another planet. So you see we've never fired this shot si-lently or without effect, you see? I'm not degrading what you, yourself, as one person can do. But if you're going to do the job fully and wholly or do the job effectively, then the job will be done rather swiftly; and in doing the job relatively fast you save many of the cataclysmic aspects of what might hap-pen because of the entrance upon this scene of Scientology. In other words, the more rapidly you do it the better the job is done. It's just like auditing a PC. You see in one PC the world at large, you see? He is the microcosm and the world is the macrocosm; and you see that what is happening to a PC – you know that if you audit him slowly and poorly he makes thuhh, and he goes duhhh, and he gets a little bit better and in about two or three days he says, \"Well, maybe I'll make it. Maybe I'll bla-bla-blah ...\" and all of a sudden he doesn't feel so well, and so on; he didn't get much of a result and he slows down and goes into third gear, and he puts it all on the back burner, and so forth. Well, those fits and starts would be the fits and starts of the track of the civilization in which we live if we did not approach this problem effectively and do it with fair effectiveness. And part of that effectiveness is make enough auditors. Now, you're not enough audi-tors. You just aren't enough auditors, that's all. There just aren't enough. We're not against a quantitative proposition here particularly, but when I say \"auditor\" I mean somebody who merely audits. You have to combine in your repertoire the ability to train auditors and then you're enough, then you become enough auditors, don't you see? Right away, just the people in this room would be enough auditors if they trained auditors. And providing you did your job superlatively well and you knew how to make an auditor do his job superlatively well, you see, if you knew that, then you – with that kind of progress you would wind up with enough auditors. Then you could do the job, you see? That could be done. But not otherwise. I know I myself at times have felt rather muscular – mentally muscular – and have stood up baring my breast to the tirades and freakeries of fate and fortune and have said, \"Well, this is enough. Just – I could do this all by myself, you know, just standing on my head, you know? No help at all. I'd just do it all by myself. That's easy, you know?\" I just felt tough that day, you know? And before noon I didn't feel so tough. [laughs] Now, in my particular levels of training and background I would have perhaps, not necessarily, but perhaps more reason than you to believe that I could do the job all by myself, see? I have done jobs all by myself and they were not necessarily easy jobs. Now, I did get away with them. I don't think I could do this one all by myself, see? Different type of job, it goes out in terms of longevity. It embraces many more lives and beings than anything else that's been attempted in this corner of the universe for a very long time. Well now, the better it is done, the more rapidly it is done, the more effectively it is done, why, the smoother forward track it will have."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 7 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 375 HPCS So therefore you are busy learning to audit. You are busy learning to audit and in that you are making progress and that's very, very good progress. We do not have here the facili-ties much to train you how to teach auditors, but by training you we can certainly give you a model and you'll know how to handle somebody else when you're training them, and maybe you'll profit by some of the mistakes we have made. But don't try to profit in the direction of being kind. Don't try to profit in the direction of \"If we just process him then he will be able to audit.\" Don't profit in that direction because there's no profit to be had there. If he's alive he can audit. He walked into the PE Course, he is a long-term Christian Scientist, until he got so many overts on Christian Science that he be-came a Rosicrucianist, and then had too many overts against Rosicrucianism to remain any-thing but a theosophist, and has arrived to prove that Scientology doesn't work. You can make him audit. You could teach him to audit; you really could. But now we're getting to a dividing line: Why that many handicaps on the auditor, see? Why go quite that far afield to teach somebody to audit? No, there are people around you at once, in your immediate vicinity, that could be taught to audit well and those are the people to put lots of time in on. They are the people to put time in on, because if you make them very good auditors, of course they can make auditors. And it is better to have – right now, the way we're going – it is better to have a lot of crackerjack auditors than an awful lot of very medio-cre auditors. See, that's better. And you sometimes look over \"Who are you going to spend time on?\" Well, the natural impulse is to take this bird I just described who has so many overts on Christian Science that they had to take off into Rosicrucianism, got so many overts on Rosicrucianism that they became a theosophist, and have wandered in to prove that Scien-tology doesn't work. Well, now this character... Well, unfortunately you could make a tremendous error, and do you know that instruc-tors will do this? Even an instructor here, now and then, catches himself; fortunately he catches himself doing it. He's so outraged by the performance he sees in front of him that he gives that person more time than he gives the apt auditor who needs just a little bit more coaching to do a very fine job. Instead of that he'll give this total dud, you see, a tremendous amount of time and pressure trying to get them up to a high level of mediocrity. Remember that, when you're training auditors, take those that are very apt and give them most time. See, that's the way to go about it; and let the others drift along. Let them drift along. They've got a certain rate of absorption. And it isn't that you should let them go. You shouldn't let this fellow go; oh no, oh, nothing like that, see? You might put him... downgrade him a little bit in the zone or area in which he's being trained but you don't forget about him. But he plods along at a certain rate and that certain rate has very little to do with anything you're trying to teach him. He's just kind of sloggy. For anybody to assign the length of time it takes for somebody to learn something is adventurous. It can't ever be factual. I'll give you an experiment in this. Take one datum and try to teach it to somebody with the old educational processes of the 17th ACC. Those were very interesting processes, by the way. Try to teach him this datum. Take any datum in Scien-tology, say it to him and have him repeat it. This is the simplest of all these; just say it and have him repeat it, you see, and say it and have him repeat it, and then say it and have him tell"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 8 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 376 HPCS you what it is all about, you know, by giving you an example of it. You say it, he gives you an example of it. That is the wildest thing you ever did with anybody. That is quite incredible. As simple as this mechanism is, it has considerable horsepower and it is a very interesting thing. I have seen that datum move a very tough case, by the way. That was what was inter-esting about those educational processes. They were very limited in that they didn't move very many cases, but they could knock aside this \"no effect\" proposition on training. Now, I recommend those to you. We actually don't have any students bad enough to start chugging in with these educational processes, and assign somebody to say a datum and he's supposed to say the datum back, and then he says the datum and they make an example, or any of the combinations of those processes. There were about three of them. But they're awfully good for the fellow you have despaired of utterly; they are much better than auditing. You assign a student to teach him with this system, you know? You of course don't have to use Scientology data. You can say, \"The cat is black. All right, now tell me 'The cat is black.'\" And the fellow says, \"Well, there are a number of instances I could think of where a cat wouldn't be black.\" And you say, \"All right, good, good. But now, now just tell me this one datum, 'A cat is black.'\" And you'll finally get them to actually be able to – you say something, they can say something. And then the second grade of that is you say something and they can understand it. In other words, let them duplicate the words and then let them duplicate the understanding. You in essence are doing this in training, only you're doing it live. You see, you're doing it all the way. You read a bulletin and then you go in and see Mike. Of course some of you – some of you wish you hadn't but that's all part of the game. And – I didn't manufacture Mike's 3D-terminal package [laughter], but I, I probably couldn't have done a better job than he's done. But look a-here, he's not trying to be unreasonable with you; he's just trying to get you to do one thing – that's the one step of the educational process. In essence what is happening is this: I have said something to you and then he's trying to find out if you can duplicate it. And don't think this isn't therapeutic. It is! It jolly well is! But we're not interested in it from a therapy line. We're interested in it from the basis of the communication of a datum, and you get, finally, so that you can actually take a datum and so on. Now let's look at this. This process has been going on for six months or more with some of the older students here. And 3D came out incomplete, not well stated, just brrupt! you know, and that's it. And they did it at once and got results with it at once. In other words, it took them – oh, perhaps 10 minutes to understand it; this is length of time to look at it and read it. I mean it was that fast, you see, and they could put it into action and they could do something with it, and all of a sudden this happened. Well, this doesn't mean that they've be-come puppetized, it simply means that their ability to duplicate it has now gone over into a second stage – understand – because of course they weren't given any data to duplicate. Now, you look at the original issue of 3D, of the original mention of 3D that was given to you. Why, the first mentions of it are just some scribbles in the case histories, you"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 9 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 377 HPCS know, in the case folders, the first mentions of it, and then there's a rather incomplete descrip-tion of 3D Criss Cross that doesn't amount to a hill of beans, and then there's class rumor. Well, what I'm showing you is there was practically nothing there to duplicate in the way of wording, and yet these people had actually gotten to this point, where they not only could duplicate the datum that was said to them but they could get a – what this was and they could understand what this datum was and put it into use. Now, look at that as a considerable gain, and look at it for just what it is, as a gain, a training gain. And that's quite remarkable. Now, the comm lag on others who hadn't had that much training has been something on the order of ten days to two weeks, to first duplicate the wording – and complain because there wasn't any wording, don't you see? They were still in a step where they had to have the exact words. And then finally, it took an amplification of a bunch of exact words and a lot of individual notations in case folders for them all of a sudden to do what they were doing and get a result, and the understanding is dawning. See, that's slightly different action. Do you see this as a training mechanism? Do you see where this winds up as a training mechanism? Do you see what its stages are? In other words, your first gradient of the thing is no comprehension of the words. This is your first gradient, see, no comprehension of the words. Now, it's quite shocking to find that morale is suffering, and all sorts of things are go-ing wrong in some HGCs, by being made to exactly duplicate a bulletin. Do you see where they are there? Do you see where they are on the training step? It would not matter, by the way, as far as their ability to learn was concerned – let's look this over. Let's say we were just trying to increase a person's ability to learn. Learning rate – that was the only thing we were trying to increase. Let's just think of that, see. It wouldn't matter if we were teaching them automotive assembly books; you know, manuals used in Detroit for the assembly of automobiles, to a person who is never going to assemble an automobile and has never assembled one and hasn't even played with toy cars. See, it wouldn't matter if we were doing that. Or the \"Works Progress Administration History of Socialism and its Development in the Northern Part of Arizona,\" you know, there's proba-bly volumes of books on that. They paid them – they paid them if they got out some stacks of paper to – on the Works Progress Administration. They'd get somebody who was out of work, so they made sure he didn't do any because otherwise he would have been in work, and all he had to do was pile up old clippings and papers, you see? They didn't have to relate to any-thing. And then at government expense they were published between very thick covers in very heavy volumes, and they were quite available for a while. You could get them to hold up corners of desks where the leg was missing, you know, and they were very useful; but they were the most non sequitur nowhere as far as data was concerned you ever cared to cast your eye over. We could use that, do you see? We could use the \"Legal Code of the Early Church of England as Interpreted by the Catholic Church.\" We could! I don't care what you're using, as long as there's some data stated. Doesn't matter how much dunnage or how little dunnage as long as there's some data studied. Is data there to study? You would still do this. You'd still use this as learning rate. You see where we are? See, we'd read it off. We'd have the individual sitting there and we would read it off to the individual. This would be the stylized auditor type of approach on"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 10 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 378 HPCS this, and we would say, \"All the churches of Northumbria were deprived of their windows because of a window tax which was three and six per window per sabbatical.\" (\"Sabbatical.\" That's what it said, see.) And we tell the individual, \"All right, say that.\" You know? \"Now, what did I just say?\" you know? And he'd say, \"The window tax – window tax? What about window tax is this? What's sabbatical mean? What's this? Yeah. What book are you reading, anyway? Where did this come from? What part of Northumbria are you talking about?\" You get all this confusion? And you've got an example now of your first step. As you try to merely get him to repeat a line of sounds (you don't even call them words, you see?) he gets tremendous confusion. So your first step – your first state in which the person is in is one of tremendous data confusion which blows off at any attempt to dupli-cate data. So it blows off at once that there's an attempt to duplicate data on his part, he starts blowing off this confusion. \"Northumbria? What Northumbria? What sabbatical? Two and six? Two and six window ta- but who would have been taxing them? Uh – who – what tax? What is a tax? Was there anybody taxing anybody at that particular time?\" Now you get down to the communist level of this, we would have had a communist cell meeting to discuss whether or not capitalists should exist, you see, because we've mentioned tax. In other words, it just would have hung up on some button some place or another, and would have come into a total collision with this button, and from there on we never would have moved off the button. This is of tremendous use, by the way, when you're handling committees. You know, the art of getting something done through a committee has never been perfected. This has never been perfected in the history of man. If you don't want to get anything done, appoint a committee. And don't put anybody on it who has an individual responsibility for any piece of its work. Just give it in general to the committee. Now, now we've really got malfunction in screaming exclamation points, malfunction from here on out. Well, similarly, the way you can park any committee or any board – and some of you might want to know this sometime; it's sometimes of great moment for you not to have some-thing discussed, and not permit them to come to any conclusion or pass a motion. Commit-tees, being only a medium of half-thought-out averages anyway, generally will arrive at the wrong decision about most anything. You know, they haven't got much of the data, and they're not really interested, and nobody there is responsible, and they sort of just want to get rid of it all, you know? And they get into that state of mind, and they're suddenly discussing something that is a very, very important point that is going to affect the longevity and man-agement of this company or group, and man, you just are not about to get something like that. Now, the first thing is to introduce – the way you want to do this is just to introduce any button that will cause them to take zero responsibility. Just introduce any button that will reduce their responsibility. Anything! It doesn't matter. Give them a restimulative word. Just do it by symbols. You see, you're trying to paralyze this committee, that's what you're trying to do, you see, just overtly, so they won't make a wrong act."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 11 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 379 HPCS They say, \"Well, I don't know.

Nobody's particularly interested in this thing, so ... One of the principal buttons that is used in this is the word \"study\", see, and that just hangs everybody. Just introduce \"study\" into the thing, you see? Bang! And it just hangs the works here. And just say, \"We'll make a proposal that the matter be given further study,\" and hit \"study\" hard. And you get parked right there. It'll just stop. It's gorgeous! You don't have to introduce like that. You can say something, \"Well, wasn't the last time this type of proposal was proposed, wasn't that – \" you know, there was a fellow by the name of Bellham who was just hated throughout the whole organization, you see, just say this word and everybody went Eeeee! and so on – you say, \"Wasn't that last proposed by Bellham?\" Everybody of course takes no responsibility for it instantly, you see? And then they will get into a discussion about Bellham, and you're all set. [laughter] But they just derail on a button like that! And you'll see somebody do this, you'll see it when they're studying like this. This fel-low's got lots of overts on the Sabbath. So you say \"sabbatical,\" he's wondering if this is con-nected with Sabbath, and you just get into a total discussion of \"Sabbath. Is it right to have a Sabbath? Where was the Sabbath originated? Really wasn't it a pagan introduction in the first place?\" and we go on and on and on. It has absolutely nothing to do with what we're studying. He'll derail right at that point. That's very interesting. Now, you'd think this person would have to have lots of auditing to get rid of this. No, there is another system that gets rid of this and that is it sort of teaches him that he can ride past these hung points, see, that the hung points don't keep him from duplicating. And he gradually learns this, you see? These buttons that he's got really don't keep him from duplicat-ing something. See, even if it's upsetting and he doesn't like it he can still duplicate it, and eventually he begins to see duplication in its proper light. Duplication is duplication. It is not running out buttons, it is simply duplication. It just is itself, that is all. Now, you couldn't see at all unless you could duplicate. You've got to be able to look down that row of doors or something like that, you look down the row of doors and you see that there was a row of doors there. And – you can play this on some PCs in processing with the most fantastic results. You just say, \"Well, what's over there along that wall?\" And some fellow will say, \"Oh, uh – uh – must be students' lockers. Those doors don't fit very well at the top, do they? Well, they must be some kind of students' lockers. They were probably put in there for some purpose or another.\" Then all of a sudden he'd say, \"Well, do you have a carpenter working for you?\" What did you ask him? You said, \"What's down that wall?\" you see? Actually all he's got to do is look down the wall and say \"There's some doors there,\" but he always does it the hard way. Just watch him at first glance and he will just do it the hard way. That's the way it will roll off of this whole operation.

The ceiling, of course, is what's over your head right now. They always man-age to miss the obvious. And factually, it takes a lot of drilling before people will observe the obvious, and that is all there is to that step, is obnosis: the observation of the obvious. \"What is in front of your face?\" just ask somebody sometime who has low havingness and can't reach much. Just ask that question, \"What is in front of your face?\" Of course, the obvious answer is \"You are.\" But, you know, you can get some of the most conditional and oddball responses you ever want to hear of from simple questions of that particular type. Well, that's because the individual isn't really adding significances into everything, it's because every time he thinks of something significance plunges in and he thinks he's got to pay more attention to the signifi-cance than he pays to what was going on. In other words, what is happening to him right now, you see, is less important than what might happen to him or what is coming in on him or the consequences of all of it. He's consequence-happy so he's really not in present time at all. Well, when you take this parking button called \"study,\" people tend to go sort of \"Ummmmm,\" you know, on this anyhow, and that's a very good button to work on because it's inflow of data, therefore the duplication of data, and no more important than that, just the duplication of the datum spoken. You understand, I'm not now saying a datum like \"there are ... a problem is postulate-counter-postulate.\" I'm not talking about a significant datum. I'm talking about any datum, either signifi-cant or nonsignificant. You could say, \"There is one Christmas in a year,\" and some people will promptly say, \"Well, that is insufficiently important. Of course everybody knows there's one Christmas in a year.\" You'll get all kinds of chitter-chatter and so forth. The only thing you've asked them to do is repeat this after you, what you say. You say, \"There is one Christmas in a year.\" And the person would say, \"Of course I know there's only – any damn fool knows there's only one – what – what kind of a thing is it – you think – what – what is this all about?\" And you say, \"Well, just rep- all right. Good. But – just – just – let's just repeat this af-ter me, There is one Christmas in a year.\" \"Well, there's no sense in it. Of course, everybody knows that there's one Christmas in a year,\" and so forth. And they're into the terrible non-significance of it, you see? You stated something sufficiently non-significant that they can't do anything about it. There's nothing there to attack and they just get terribly disappointed, you see? You say - you say, \"Most men are male.\" You know, \"Most men are male.\" Or you say, \"Women are females.\""},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 13 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 381 HPCS \"Women are females. Well, of course we know most women are fe – what are you talking about? Naturally,\" and so forth. \"Naturally, of course, everybody knows that. What – what are you saying that for?\" And you will get – all of a sudden the fellow becomes very curious about you, and what your motives are and what your intentions are and what you're trying to do here. Well, it's a fantastic proposition. You just say, \"Women are females.\" \"There's one Christmas in a year.\" \"Days begin at midnight.\" Some people would not realize that, you know, and they'd say, \"Oh, really? Do they?\" And you say, \"Well, all right. But 'Days begin at midnight,' I just want you to repeat that. Just 'Days begin at midnight.'\" \"Well, that's a funny thing. I never knew that before, you see?\" And they've just flown off into interest, see? And they're all stuck on the interest, you see? And you're just saying, \"'Days begin at midnight.' That's what you're supposed to say.\" And the fellow says, \"Ah, well... Why should I go into that, you know? 'Days begin at midnight....' What are we studying here? Is this a lesson in Scientology or about time? Or is time part of Scientology? Are there any axioms about time? Oh, I see! Oh, I see! Yes, I see! The days begin at midnight! And it's – oh, what axiom does that refer to anyway?\" And you say, \"No, no. Just repeat after me, 'Days begin at midnight.'\" \"Yeah, but why?\" You get the whole idea, see? In other words, they have an automatic reflexive mecha-nism. They're going on a total basis of stimulus-response and nothing else. Just total stimulus-response. But what's responding? The person or a bank? And this is just another way of dig-ging up a thetan. Eventually you get to a point where the thetan responds. You say, \"The day begins at midnight.\" He says, \"The day begins at midnight.\" It doesn't bother him any if the day begins at midnight or the day doesn't begin at midnight. Has nothing to do with it. You just say, \"The day begins at midnight.\" He says, \"The day begins at midnight.\" \"Good!\" All right. You say, \"Christmas comes once a year.\" He says, \"Christmas comes once a year.\" Right? Now, people who don't like this and are still enturbulated on it say, \"Well, you're mak-ing a slave there,\" you see, \"that's slavery,\" or something like that. \"That's something very deep-seated and very significant. There's something very significant about this operation. If you can get a person to do this, he of course thereafter is a slave, see, obviously!\" – except the data is never borne out. The only time you really get a person to talk back sensibly is when he can do this, because he can observe what he's talking back about; and up to that time you get people talking back about things that aren't happening, and that's very disconcerting."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 14 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 382 HPCS Somebody comes in and raises hell with you because of the hussars that are all over the front lawn. And you go and look, you don't see any hussars on the front lawn. And you ask him to go look and see if there are any hussars on the front lawn and he says, \"Why should I look? I just know.\" And you say, \"Well, that's fine. Well, let's go look at the front lawn and see if there are any hussars there.\" \"Why should I do that? Are you doubting my word?\" And now we go off into a dis-cussion of whether or not you think he is a gentleman. Do you see the various excursions that we get on this? He starts with some unreasonable premise and winds up with an idiocy. All you're ask-ing a person to be able to do is simply duplicate a datum. You say, \"Christmas occurs once a year,\" and he says, \"Christmas occurs once a year,\" and it doesn't bother him and it doesn't not bother him. Now, at the same time this individual can turn around and do something else which is quite interesting. This individual can cause himself to be duplicated. So, he has a brand-new thought all of his own little own, and he said, \"I'm going to paint this house green.\" And he goes out and he says to somebody, \"Paint the house green.\" And the person says, \"Um-hmmm-mmm. Viridian, eh?\" \"No, no, just green.\" \"Oh, well. There's lots of greens, you know? Green, there's lots of greens. There's lots of types of paint, too. What paint store do you deal with? Well, I tell you what I will do. There is a house over in the next county that is painted a particular shade of green, and we will write them a letter and find out what paint company they got the paint from and what shade it was, but of course you will have to go over and take a look at that house first to find out what color that house really is.\" And you'd say, \"No, I want this house painted just common, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, just green.\" And they will try again. They will say, \"Some paints don't last as long as others.\" If you can do that, you yourself have developed the ability to get yourself duplicated on your own ideas. And you'd be surprised; if you can do this well, you'd be surprised as your ability rises how the duplication occurs with the greatest of ease. You go out and tell some-body to paint it green, he pulls a color card out of his pocket and says, \"You want this one or this one or this one? You want that one? That's it. All right.\" He goes and gets the paint and he paints the house green, does a good job of it and that's all fine. This cuts down randomity like mad. In other words, by learning to duplicate you can get into a state where you yourself can be duplicated. Now, this is not exactly a processing activity. This is the process of life and livingness that is most significant. And it's havingness like mad because you start to have the things that you're surrounded with."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 15 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 383 HPCS All right. Beyond duplication comes understanding. Understanding comes after dupli-cation, not before. Now, how much understanding do you think this fellow did when you said \"Christmas comes once a year,\" and he said, \"Well, why are we taking that up? It doesn't seem to have very much to do with the process,\" and so on and so on. Well, you'll find out nearly everything he's asking you summates into not understanding, or trying to understand. You've told him the datum \"Christmas comes once a year\"; this is the datum you've told him. Now, he tries like mad to understand that datum and he can't grasp it. He'll just work himself frantic trying to understand this datum, to understand what datum is there, understand your motives in trying to get him to understand this datum, trying to understand what the da-tum applies to, try to understand why there is nothing there to understand; and you'll find out most of his \"Ooooooo-oooooo-ummmm\" is just some kind of an effort to understand. And this is why study is such an important button, because that's \"getting somebody else to understand relieves anybody of any responsibility for understanding.\" Every govern-ment in the world at the present moment is totally seized with this as a mechanism. This is their operating mechanism. They don't have to understand anything because they can always have it studied, you see? And that just absolutely stops any progress in a committee or any-thing else. You've stopped it instantly and at once. You say \"It's going to be otherwise studied so therefore you don't have to duplicate any part of it; and therefore you don't have to... if it's going to be studied, you don't have to understand any part of it and therefore all we expect from you is to execute something which you have no comprehension of and haven't found out in the first place.\" And you get the usual democratic processes when they are totally abused. They're pretty mad. See, democracy does not work in the absence of understanding. It can't work. Now, here's your second thing, then. If responsibility for understanding depends on personal study – and it does – why, then of course you have raised the person's ability to comprehend, or understand. Not only does Christmas come once a year, but now beyond that point he is capable of understanding and studying \"Christmas\" and \"once a year\" and what this refers to. Only now he's capable of finding out that it's a totally unimportant datum. Up to that time it might be important, it might not be important; God help us, we never would be able to find out whether it was something we had to know, or something that we didn't much care about, or something we're liable to be shot because we didn't know, or some-thing that we'd certainly better forget in a hurry, or something that goes along with the fact that most peoples have shoes, the bottoms of the soles of which are dirty. You see that? So classification of the importance of data is the thing which lies up there as the sec-ond step. Well, that's your third step. Your first is non comprehension, non duplication, con-fusion. Your second one is merely the ability to duplicate. And after that we get the ability to comprehend, to understand, and therefore get the ability to observe. Judgment lies in that field and this is a road to judgment. Now, nobody has really ever bothered to teach anybody judgment before in the last 200 trillion years. And you're not going to find much judgment in any bank you've got. If there had been much judgment in it, you wouldn't have it as a bank. Let's look at that. If this"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 16 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 384 HPCS valence had been capable of enormous study, differentiation and judgment, you wouldn't have it as an aberrative valence. Isn't that so? So this has been a scarcity on the track. So you have here in essence, a new skill. It's going to be very difficult to process it into somebody because they've never had it. They were capable of observation once, but how did they observe? They always put a curve on the observation in order to make a game out of it or something like that. Pure observation, pure study, pure duplication, pure comprehension, or pure judgment have never been a study in the field of philosophy. They just don't exist. You just will not find these things as subjects of discussion, even. They are touched on very slightly by the Platos and Socrateses and so forth of yesteryear, but just touched on very slightly. Totally avoided in religions and religious philosophies. Oh, they're just avoided like mad! Oh, it's just like showing them a snake spitting in their face, you know? Huuuuh! Comprehension, understanding, duplication? Oh, no, no, no, no, no! That's what you're not supposed to do! And of course we know what the source of all this is. The greatest overt there is is en-forcing a noncomprehension. That's an overt! You don't believe it? Take somebody sometime, you say, \"What have you done?\" Oh, this girl has got withholds, she's got crimes, she can't wear any of her frocks because they're so bloodstained, you know? She doesn't dare reach into any of her purses because of the asps she's stacked away at one time or another, you know? She can't even open up her own medicine chest with any feeling of security because of the arsenic coming out, you know? And we say, \"What have you done?\" And she says, \"Done? Well, I ate dinner.\" And you say, \"Well, what have you withheld?\" \"I haven't withheld anything.\" \"All right. Good. Well, what have you done?\" \"Oh, I sat down here a while ago.\" \"Good. Well, what have you withheld?\" \"Nothing. I never withhold anything. My life is an open book.\" And you go utterly mad trying to security check this person because you can't find any responsibility on which to hang the Security Check. You've got to increase their responsibility before you can find any withholds. They're there but they're totally muzzled, you see, by the irresponsibility of the attitude of the PC. You see, one of the ways you tell if a case is gaining is whether or not it's getting more withholds off. Well, that's just a way of saying \"Is the case gaining in responsibility?\" Yes, the case is gaining in responsibility, because they're getting more withholds off. Weren't withholds up to that time. But you can take this same person, this same girl, and you could say, \"What doesn't your family know about?\" \"Oh, well, that is something else. Well, they don't know that I poisoned Joe, that I shot Pete. They don't know anything much about where I hid the body last month. They don't know what happened to the children. Ha-ha-ha-ha! They – ah...\" see, and \"don't know\" is still"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 17 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 385 HPCS a button. All the way down \"don't know\" is still a button, all the way down and all the way up. It's a button the whole way. You can always security check with \"don't know\" and \"not know,\" when overts and withholds are passing right over the PC's head like these orbiting space flights that aren't tak-ing off, you know? See, \"don't know\" goes all the way. So a study of not-knowingness has been approached by philosophy by two philoso-phers – notably two philosophers: one is Kant and the other one is Spencer. And they've con-cluded that what wasn't known couldn't be known. Oh, how interesting! In other words, the closest approach philosophy has ever made to \"don't know\" or \"not know\" has been that you couldn't know. That's interesting, isn't it? So, as I tell you, there has been no road to judgment. Now, for many years I've been trying to teach you characters judgment. It has been a tough and difficult job. Judgment on the subject of another being, the ability to understand what was going on in a session, and operating with judgment so as to do the right thing about it. Now, do you know what bars you from judgment? It's just the not-knowingness of it all. Well, where's the not-knowingness of it all come from? It begins first with duplication. There is the entrance. Oh, of course you could security check it out. \"What don't people know about you?\" and so forth, and smarten the guy up no end; but that's a processing approach, and we're not now talking about a processing approach because there is nothing there to process to. You see, processing processes to what is there, see? Now, if a thetan ever got himself in bad condition, he's invalidated his own judgment, he's come off of his own judgment. The whole lesson of this universe teaches a person not to duplicate, just as it teaches him not to communicate. You know, there are only two crimes in this universe that you have committed and that you have made others guilty of having committed: One is being there and the other is communicating. Those are the two crimes. There are no other crimes than that, being there and communicating. Now, if those two crimes are crimes, and those things have been made into crimes, then there's only one other thing that you can possibly make up your mind about it: A person has to learn, you might say, not really learn, but become comfortable with being there and communicating. And the way and the route one would take to bring comfort on the subject of being there and communicating would of course be duplication of a datum. Now, a datum is a location which doesn't have to be pinned down. A datum is a loca-tion, a cousin to a thetan, you know? All data is a sort of a cousin to a thetan. You know, he's an idea, he thinks sometimes and he's got ideas and he can communicate ideas. And you can always put a whole stack of ideas into your thetan briefcase and have no mass at all. So it's ideally portable, most portable thing in the world is an idea, so thetans chased out of here and chased out of there begin to use ideas for location. They feel comfortable when they have an idea, you known. And that idea that they feel comfortable about is an identity. Even though the identity is mobile, they feel more comfortable with an identity than without one because it gives them the sensation of being located. They like this."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 18 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 386 HPCS So what's the conclusion here? The conclusion is that you can learn to have judgment, and the way you learn to have judgment is just those two steps: duplication of data, and, pur-suant to that, understanding. There's the duplication, the understanding. You don't get it this way: you don't get understanding and then duplication. Now, what you should know about this is it's any data would serve as long as it is data, any data. \"Classification of the Geological Formations of the Middle East as Observed by the Geological Department of - Serving After the Fact of the Appointments from the Rockmount Foundation, Appertaining only to Schists and Slides of the Lower Saudi Arabian Canyons,\" in 185 volumes, folio, see? That's data, you know? It's wild data, you know? \"Anamorphic schists are often found most closely blended with hornblende.\" You say to the PC, \"Anamorphic schists are most closely blended with hornblende.\" Well, this would be a \"faschinating\" situation. He would wind up, of course, with a drill. He would wind up with an ability to do something, and he would also wind up with judgments on the subject of women, which I think is marvelous. You know? Nobody could wind up with that. I've been trying all these years. [laughter] It's impossible. And yet he could, by studying the anamorphic schists for the formation of hornblende. Very interesting ! Now, beyond that you cannot go in the teaching of judgment. You cannot teach a man how he should judge something and still have him judge something. You understand that you can teach a person data. Yes, by force of beingness in you, you can relay communication and understanding to people and they do understand it. Well, I'll give you an example of that. One ACC I did nothing but lecture. Nobody processed anybody this whole ACC and they all had marvelous profile gains. I gave them two lectures a day and we went over all kinds of data and so on. Well, that was just a relay of un-derstanding and comprehension, and they felt better and they had a bunch of cognitions on the thing and life looked better to them. You understand? So that was in itself a kind of a process-ing. That had one of the highest gain ACCs we ever had, which is interesting. Now, this is totally possible, and without that possibility of course we'd never get any-place. So that possibility natively exists. But let's take the other one. Let's take the other one. Let's raise a level of skill on the subject of judgment, just overtly and directly create a level of skill on the subject of judgment. We would do that by duplication. All right. What's this amount to here? What's this amount to? We are doing this – you do not see how this is working out according to the educational processes of the 17th ACC; first reason (to have no withhold from you, and so forth) is it wasn't realized or rationalized from those directly. What you're dealing with right this minute is – stems from prior under-standing to the 17th ACC; 17th ACC is an outcrop of that understanding of how to go about these things. Nor are you dealing necessarily with a preconcerted effort to give you under-standing. You're not dealing with that either. You are dealing accidentally with two different things, and one of those things is just the action of understanding and duplication, you're deal-ing with that, and at the same time you are dealing only with the data of Scientology which you can learn."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 19 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 387 HPCS But incidentally the data of Scientology is being used to develop in you judgment, not on the subject of Scientology. Now, you don't notice this because you're learning judgment across a pretty high, beefy line. This is a high-voltage line, you see? So if you can learn judgment off of this line, marvelous! Because this line, of all others, would tend to destroy your self-determinism and judgment, wouldn't it? Yeah, you're not given any chance to think what life's all about. My God! Is there anything else to think about than what life is all about? Isn't that right? Well, I'll give you what life is all about, and then you don't have to think about it at all, and you're all set, and that's it, hm? Well, the data is true so therefore it tends to stick, right? Do you know that a lot of you, unbeknownst to you, have run straight through having been taught it. And some of you haven't noticed that you've gone through having been taught it. You've come up on the other side of the thing into a realization of it; and now you have the realization of it, not because you've been taught it, but because you realize it. And this is what we know as \"making it your data.\" You've often said this to a student but some of you perhaps have not looked too closely on what we mean by \"make it your data.\" In other words, he has to go along the line of duplication of the data to an understand-ing of the data, and with that understanding of the data he has the final step, which is the re-alization, totally self-determined, of the existence of the data. And when you're dealing with truth you always have this fourth step. You have the ability to realize and to perceive. So you have first this \"Thaa! What wall? Don't ask me to duplicate anything.\" Then you have simple duplication, and that's followed by understanding, and that is followed by realization or own comprehension. So therefore one's own self-determinism is restored on such a track. Of course it's most rapidly restored on such a track by teaching the person the exact truth of something. There is the truth of something, he is able to duplicate the truth of some-thing after many travails, and this truth of something is immediately pursued by the under-standing of that something he has been taught. You understand that that is a stage; he's still dependent on you for the understanding of what's been taught. And your next stage up is a realization, which he reached at a sudden step up the line on his own bootstraps, so to speak. He regained an ability to understand, and so then he himself could realize. That's the route that you're taking. That route has total self-determinism and other-determinism and, of course, therefore, pan-determinism all mixed up in it, all at one fell swoop. The person becomes pan-determined over the data. The person can not only under-stand why they learned the data but why the data was taught to them, and understand and real-ize – of course the realization includes the independent truth of the datum regardless of hav-ing been taught the datum. And with that, of course, a person has reached a high peak of the ability to judge something. A person then has judgment. There's no other route that I know of. I mean if this is not a perfect route, all right, so it isn't a perfect route. There is no perfect route. Perhaps there is a perfect route, but there is no perfect route to hand at the moment if this is not a perfect route."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 20 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 388 HPCS But there is this, that it is the first route through to such an end product. It certainly is that. And it is married in against an entirely different function. So you get a side play of the same thing. That is to say, you've got this thing doing two things. It wouldn't matter – well, your instructor has the horrible idea occasionally – he says, \"All right. Now, what time span is there in an instant read? How soon must the read occur after the thing, an instant read?\" I don't know how many answers you've got. I wouldn't set it right for worlds; not for worlds, I wouldn't set it right. Gives the instructor a marvelous opportunity. He can say, \"Yes. But that tape, see? What does it say on that tape? That tape!\" And you say, \"Well, actually, it's a half a second, a quarter of a second, a fifth of a second, a tenth of a second, it doesn't matter. I mean there – there it is.\" \"Ah, but which one is it on that tape?\" \"Well, I can't tell you what that tape is. It doesn't matter whether it's a quarter of a sec-ond, half of a second, a fifth of a second, and so on, so on. I mean, all these answers and so on\" – natter, natter, natter, natter. And he says, \"Flunk!\" [laughter] And you go back and snarl, and run up a whole bunch of overts against me, and so forth, and listen to the tape again. And you say, \"Well, what do you know? Hang on, let's see, what was it on that exact tape? Oh, gorblimey! I never heard that before! A twentieth of a second! Twentieth of a second! Kaaa! All right,\" and you go in. \"Twentieth of a second.\" \"All right, that's it.\" Now, you see, it'd be totally pedantic (and we're not doing it on this other system) for the instructor to say \"What are the first seven words in the fifth paragraph of the third bulletin written in 1959 in the month of June?\" See, that is just becoming a memory contest, and if you'll notice, nearly all study is devoted to memory contests. And nobody is asking you to engage in a memory contest. Somebody is asking you to engage in a duplication activity. If you can duplicate the data your memory will come up sooner or later – even yours. It's very, very horrible; some of you first confronting this thing, you find it ghastly! You find it utterly horrible. It's the most terrible thing you ever confronted. Recognize the mechanism you're up against, and recognize that not for a moment is anybody going to relent on this datum. Also find out, as you go along, all of a sudden you're able to understand things you weren't able to understand before, which is all quite peculiar; and you possibly have never noticed this, but you're now understanding things you never understood before that have to do with other things that have nothing to do with training, nothing to do with the sub-ject matter you're training on, which is quite amazing. You get something going like this, why, you've made gains in another direction, and that's what an auditor has to have. An audi-tor has to have comprehension. He has to be able to understand what he is looking at. He has to understand what is going on. An auditor who gets into this kind of a situation is a dead one, he's lost. The PC says, \"Ah, women are such a bore!\""},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 21 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 389 HPCS And he's pulled the same gag you might have pulled on the committee, as far as the auditor is concerned. He said that fatal word – two fatal words: He said women and bore. These things are not compatible, outrageous! One can't possibly marry up those two words in the same sentence. Whoever imagined they could become bored with women? This is incomprehensible, and the auditor just sits there and he starts some kind of a natter, natter, natter, interrupt the PC, you see? \"Women, bore? Women, bore? What are you talking about?\" And instead of saying \"TR 4\" cheerily, and going on with the session, he says \"Natter, sub-natter.\" [laughter] He does all kinds of things, says Q and A, \"What did you say? Where are we going? What are you doing? Why? Why did you say that? Have you got an engram there? What's happening in the thing?\" and so forth. In other words the auditor goes into a \"trying to understand,\" do you hear that? PC can sometimes put you into a \"trying to understand,\" and you'll find yourself hav-ing a hard time auditing the PC for quite another reason. You don't audit PCs by telepathy, and this PC isn't talking very much or loudly, you see? And you say to the PC, \"All right now, what is your opinion of women?\" And the PC says, \"Ummm-ummm.\" And you have to say \"What did you say?\" Not to understand what the PC says is a misdemeanor of the first water. The PC is sort of putting you on a point where you are made to think that you don't understand the PC because you can't understand what the PC's saying. I remedy this usually quite well; PC goes – tips over, is all curled up in a ball, head is down in the chair, mouth totally compressed against the curve of the arm, and is saying \"Ummm, ummmm,\" and so on. I don't risk any ARC breaks on my part or theirs. I say, \"Sit up. That's right. Sit up. That's good. Now speak up.\" And the PC says, \"Ummmmmm.\" You say, \"All right. Now, what was that answer again?\" \"Oh, women are such a bore.\" \"All right. Thank you very much,\" you know? \"All right.\" In other words, I make the PC communicate to me, which may be tougher but you'll find out that you'll run up ARC breaks when you don't. You pays your money and you takes your chance. In other words, if you leave him in that condition, you're going to have – soon you're going to be totally out of comprehension of what's going on with the PC. You're also going to feel that you don't comprehend what the PC is doing, and therefore you can't observe anything that's happening to the PC and all sorts of things go wild. But let's get back on the other thing. Let's take an auditor who cannot happily dupli-cate a datum, a non sequitur datum, but always insists that he hang up on a button. And the PC says, \"Women are such a bore,\" and he knows that this can't exist, and he himself has lots of trouble with women, and his immediate response is \"Why is women boring? What is this?\" and so on, and go squabble out of session here. \"You've challenged me. I don't believe that. That hasn't anything to do with this. Just why did you come to that particular conclusion? I"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 22 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 390 HPCS don't see what there is in the auditing command that would make you come to that conclu-sion.\" The PC finally says, \"Well, it was just a cognition!\" And the fellow says, \"Well, it's a cognition. That's a remarkable thing to say when you come to think about it, you know? It's a remarkable thing to say – just a cog....\" But the PC says, \"But it's just a cognition. You know, I just said it, you know?\" He says, \"Well, all right.\" And the auditor goes on, you see, and audits him a little bit longer, and the PC says, \"But all men are stupid, when it comes right down to that.\" And \"stupid\", you know, that's a button, so the auditor says, \"Stupid? Who? Oh? Who? Who? Who? What did – what did you say again?\" \"All men are stupid.\" \"Why did you say that? Do you have a picture there?\" and so forth. \"What's going on? I mean, have you got an ARC break? Got some withholds? Are you withholding something? Is that what you're withholding, that all men are stupid? Just exactly how does this add up?\" and so on. And the PC says, \"But it's just a cognition. I – I just – just – I – I – I just had the idea. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\" And you then have a PC who won't blow anything. You have a PC who is punished for cogniting. You have a PC who is punished for auditing and therefore have a PC who is punished for getting rid of pieces of the bank. And if you audit the PC in that framework the PC will make no gain because they're being taught not to blow anything, because they don't ever dare mention anything; and they're made sorry every time they open their mouths be-cause there's no comprehension. They look up, the auditor's trying to understand, trying to understand, trying to hear, trying to hear, trying to find out what it is, what it is, what it is, where it came from, where it came from, wha – da-da-da-da-da – if you'll just – you don't – no, no – you've got the auditor on trying to comprehend, trying to comprehend, trying to comprehend. And of course you haven't got an auditor at that stage who is capable of dupli-cating what the PC said. My God, I've heard PCs say some of the most outrageous things you ever heard of in your life. Now, this never startled me particularly, but once in a while I have been startled by something. You notice that you're normally most startled by overts or withholds the PC has which pertain immediately and directly to you, or to somebody you're close to or like, you know? You're immediately influenced by these particular overts and withholds. Well, what if the whole session – supposing the auditor were in such poor state with regard to duplication that every bit of the auditor's auditing was as reactive toward the PC as your sudden Rrrrr! when the PC has just told you some fantastic lying withhold about you. Now, you know your own startlement when you've heard one of these occasionally. Well, supposing they're trying to understand – \"Where did you hear that?\" you know? You – right away you're just yanked out of it sometimes, you know?"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 23 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 391 HPCS He says, \"Well I – I have a withhold. I – I saw you....\" You say, \"Yes, what?\" \"Well, I saw you up at the corner of the lane up there the other night with – well, you know who.\" \"Well, who? Who? Who?\" you know, \"Who? Who did you see me up there with?\" and so forth. \"Oh, well – well, you know. We needn't really go into it.\" \"Well, what's this all about? Where did you hear that? I mean, did you see that your-self? Did you see it in person? Were you there? What time was it? Well, did anybody else see it?\" you know? You'll get caught off base, and you will ask more questions about it than you ordinarily would ask about something else. That's your effort to try to understand because you're hung up on some kind of a button that concerns you intimately. Do you see that? All right. Now, an auditor who can't duplicate runs the whole session in that frame of mind. Not just things that relate to him, but anything that relates to anything, the auditor has the same greeting of that – the same greeting from the auditor. The PC says, \"It's been a nice day all day.\" The auditor says, \"What? What? Where? Where? Where? I mean, where did you hear that? Oh, you – you what? Today. Oh, you're talking about today, not yesterday. Well, I thought it was a nice day today, too, that is, this morning, early. Er, yes, let's see. What were we talking about? Oh, yes. The auditing command was – what was the auditing command? Ah – yes – yes. Have I withheld anything from you? All right. Have I withheld anything from you?\" You watch it, man. Therefore, if you get a zone or area where the auditors are having one awful time trying to duplicate a bulletin, what must you also assume? That they've been in there endlessly trying to understand the PC, trying to understand the cases, being hung up on all kinds of wild-ball buttons, and they're right down there at the first stage I gave you. They're in that stage. See, if their morale is going down because they can't pass any bulletin tests, you would know at once how they've been handling PCs. Do you see that? So duplicative training is absolutely essential. And it is successful. Now, you can make up your mind to that. Now, what I've talked to you about you may or may not have found very burningly in-teresting. Naturally, it doesn't apply to you personally. [laughter, laughs] But in training audi-tors you should know it. The baptism of fire that causes people to look so pale and so drawn under the thing is, for instance, duplicating under resentment. See, they go through all kinds of emotional bars on this particular thing. Learn like mad but it's all resented like mad, you see, because \"Uhhhhh! It couldn't possibly be – uhrrhhh!\" and so on. Well, they pass through that one, too. But sometimes you see a student here who goes around for the first two or three weeks, and they get paler and paler, and shadowier and shadowier, more and more hollow-eyed, more and more gaunt, things looking worse and worse. Or they look more and more"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"TRAINING: DUPLICATION 24 SHSBC-108 – 24.1.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 392 HPCS apathetic. You can hear them the way they start up their cars, and things. You can hear about how a new student is going, you know? At first, why, they start up their cars in a sort of a puzzled way; and then they start up a car, you know, very angrily indeed, you see? You can hear the gears crash about three times as they get up the drive, you know? And then eventu-ally they wander up the driveway running into both sides of the verge; you know about what state they have reached, and so on. That's all done by training, and it is not the route of processing. Don't consider it a processing route. It is just a route by training because it is a new skill. You very often have been asked in the past to memorize \"the structural components of a Mark VII space vessel with gyro rotators, complete, all number parts.\" I'm sure you've had to do something like this. I'm sure you have had at some time or another. And the funny part of it is you wound up at the other side being able to look at the space vessel; and on the other side of that somebody says to you, \"Oh, well, these Mark VIIs – these Mark VIIs, they – they – they sure fly low, and they sure fly slow, Mark VIIs do.\" And, \"No, no, no,\" you say, \"you don't really understand this ship, you know. You don't understand how to run one. No, when you first get them into the outer area of an atmos-phere, you see, you turn on the coolers, you see, at that moment. See, you don't slow them down as you come in. Just turn on the coolers way out there, you see, so that you supercool the whole hull, you see? That's the way you really handle these things. And then you come in, hit the atmosphere on a skip, always hit it on a skip the first time, you see? And then sort of smush in, you know, with everything supercooled. Come in fast, don't lose your speed, you're all right, you see? And then have your counter-blasters in excellent condition so that when you come down toward the surface, and that sort of thing, right at the exact proper – and so as not to waste any fuel – these Mark VIIs, you really have to pour that blaster to it. And if you pour it to it very suddenly and very quickly you stop, you see? And then you land all right. And the reason they're having crashes with them is they just don't understand them.\" And somebody comes out and watches you land a Mark VII, you don't land one that way at all, but you sure understand one. You understand how to land one; but every time you land a Mark VII you land it entirely differently than at any other time you ever landed a Mark VII. You never land a Mark VII the same way twice, yet you always land them and they never crack up and everything is fine. You got the idea? But you never drive the same ship the same way two days consecutively running. That's because you understand it. Routine and rote, in other words, are a poor substitute for understanding. And the place I'm trying to get you to is a place where you can process by realization, process by comprehension, process by the exercise of judgment. If I can get you to that point, I will have considered it very well worth doing, no matter 'ow 'eroic it has been on the way. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 393 HPCS STUDY AND EDUCATION A lecture given on13 August 1964 What's the date? Audience: 13th of August AD 14. Thirteen Aug. AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. We've got another lecture here on study and education. You probably have realized, going down the line, that we've got this pretty well wrapped up. But we didn't expect some of the bonuses that we got. This was actually quite an astonishing and adventurous thing to do as I've already mentioned and so forth, is all of a sudden pick up an analogous field of practice and study, in order to study that, in order to find something about study, so that you're not interiorized on your own subject, don't you see? So get an exterior view and study this as a lowly neophyte that is tyroing his way up the line. Both of those mean \"beginners.\" And then carry this subject of study out through, not on a dilettante, but on a professional, hammer and tongs basis, you see? There's a great deal of difference between these two types of study. And what remains undone of that now, of course, is the professional practice of what one has learned. And that will have to be added into it to help you out in that particular field and sphere. That doesn't seem to be too much but here is – the whole subject of education has as its end product the accomplishment of certain doingnesses, the accomplishment of certain ends or aims, and education which doesn't lead toward this, of course, is just sort of doodle-daddle, monkey business, you know, sort of stuff. It's pure dilettantism, by which could be best defined as \"one doesn't intend to do anything about it except annoy his friends.\" The difference in these two fields of the doodle-daddle type of monkey business sort of and so on – I really wouldn't call it education. I wouldn't dignify it with that particular field. I would say it's acquaintance – it's acquaintancy. It's getting a nodding acquaintance with some data or a field to find out what is in it. In other words, it's just becoming acquainted with it slightly and doing a light skim around its edges and that would not, in my estimation, be education. Education would be in the direction of accomplishing certain actions professionally. Now, that is my own word introduced into there, \"professionally,\" but if one is educated in a subject, one expects him to be able to accomplish certain things with that subject. I don't care if this is merely a theoretical line of education, one is still expected to come out the other end being a good theoretician."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 2 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 394 HPCS So education – education I would define as something that is for blood and I would say that many things pass under the heading of education which aren't. I'm not talking if – this is a good English dictionary definition, you see? Education means learning or knowing or accomplishing the knowingness of a certain subject, you see? Well, let's take that as a flat-out definition. If one is educated in a subject, then he knows that subject, you see? See, you know, exclamation point, he knows the subject. He's able to accomplish the actions which are taught in that subject, he's able to accomplish the results which are taught in that subject, don't you see? That's education. Now, to call the modern school system \"education,\" then, is quite laughable, because this poor little kid gets in there and they – they keep the kid's time occupied. Let's go down to that. Well now, that doesn't seem to me to have to have anything to do with education what-soever, to keep the child's time occupied. And yet a survey of this field demonstrates that the best reason for formal education of youth and so on is to give their mothers a break. That's the fact. That's the way they look in that direction. Well, what is this kid being taught to do? And right away, then, you see what your quarrel with young schooling is. He's not being taught to do anything, see? Voilà! So it isn't education. You see, if you just took the word in its pure definition, with an exclamation point, you know, \"educated!\" well, this has come to mean a sort of an esoteric fly-around that he – well, what? So you say, \"This fellow was educated.\" You say, \"He was educated at Oxford.\" Well, what is this? All right, good, he was educated at Oxford, fine, he's an Oxford man. Good. We expect certain stamps and social reactions and so forth. All right. If he was edu-cated to be a gentleman – good! So he's a pro gentleman. See? Fine. Fine. But you can't really disassociate education from an active doingness and a role and a professionalism, you see? It's not possible to disassociate this, to take this over, so we say, \"Well, we wanted to give him a good education, not so that he could do anything, but...\" Well, that is immediately a contradiction. That's saying, \"We must pick up all the white peas by leaving all the white peas on the ground.\" You can't do that, you see? You can't just \"edu-cate\" somebody without any end in view. It – because then he wouldn't be educated, don't you see? And that is the modern quarrel. We have the largest budget, next to armaments, in the world, is child education. That's a big budget. And I don't care if the teachers all say they're underpaid and everything – which they are. It is, nevertheless, a fabulous piece of money which is spent in this particular direction. When you look at it all the way up the line and when you include under that heading of expense all the training, all the educational actions that are done in this world, you see that there's a terrific investment. Now, practically everyone in the Western world has had a considerable sum invested in them to become educated. That's a considerable sum. It runs into the thousands of pounds; whichever way you want to look at it. It runs into the many, many thousands of dollars. By the time a young man has gotten through college, for instance, he stands, educationally, at something on the order of the ten-thousand dollar mark, or did ten years ago; that's an old figure. And he probably stands at a higher figure today. That's a lot of money to invest in a man – for maybe no result."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 3 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 395 HPCS All right, so a lot has been spent upon his education but has he become educated? Male voice: No. Yeah, and that's the quarrel. See, there was – a lot is spent on his education but he did-n't get educated. I was rather shocked to find, the other day, that my young'uns couldn't write their name. They're being \"educated\" (quote) (unquote) at a remarkable rate of speed, but they couldn't sign their name. I wouldn't say that then they were being taught to write. They were not ed... being educated in how to write. No matter what they were doing, no matter how many \"traveling ovals\" they were making, if it didn't wind up with the end product of being able to sign their names – well, I should think that would be one of the first things that some teacher would think about. They'd say, \"Well, you know, a kid should be able to sign his name.\" Because, frankly, that is almost the basic test of literacy. The fellow that stumps aboard ship and has to make an 'X' on the articles is instantly and immediately considered to be illiterate. Well, maybe he could write in a flowing, copper-plate hand everything else, but if he couldn't sign his name he'd have a hard time convincing people he wasn't illiterate. So it would seem to me to be first things first, and when I found this out I caused quite a storm by insisting that they learn how to sign their names. They – even the children got quite upset. It hadn't occurred to them that if they knew how to write they should be able to sign their names. They couldn't do it. So there's a lot of holes left along the line. Now, you take arithmetic. Well, this is sort of taught as a handy, handy thing that is – you need so that you won't get shortchanged. I think that's just about the wildest short look at any subject I ever had anything to do with. And yet I'm sure that that is the basic reason why it is taught, because I've had children explain to me, patiently, this one point. So this has been taught to them as the reason they were learning arithmetic is so they wouldn't be short-changed. Nobody ever tells them that there's another way not to have to worry about that, is also make enough money. Well, look at it. If you – if you made enough money, you wouldn't have to know arithmetic, because it wouldn't worry you if you were shortchanged. See, there are other ways to get around this. I mean – so therefore, there is some other route on this business of being shortchanged, although I offer that one as simply a ridiculous one, it's nev-ertheless quite a factual one. Midas never worried about being shortchanged. So, what have we got here in terms of arithmetical education? Well, I defy the bulk of the teachers who are teaching arithmetic to give you much of an end product for knowing arithmetic. They'd say, \"Well, uh-uh-uh-um – well, of course, he has to have it because it's a fundamental in so many other subjects.\" Well, all right. Now we're talking about teaching other subjects. Well, we're not inter-ested in other subjects, we are talking about arithmetic. How about this thing called arithme-tic? Well, we wonder why people don't know arithmetic. Well, he can't be educated in it be-cause it has no end product. The fellow says, \"I don't want to be an accountant. I don't want to be a bookkeeper. I can learn to count on my fingers so I don't get shortchanged.\" Elementary. Why learn arithmetic?"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 4 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 396 HPCS \"Well,\" you say, \"well, you have to have it to learn other su...\" \"No, no, no, no. Let's talk about education and arithmetic. Let's not go worrying about other subjects.\" \"Yeah, well, if you put a restriction like that on the argument,\" they would say, \"of course nobody can argue with you.\" And you say, \"That's the point. Who wants to be argued with?\" The point I'm making here is that arithmetic, having no finite end in itself – of course, it has – it has finite ends, and it could be described – but having no described, finite end in itself is therefore almost impossible to teach. And you have nearly everybody doing very badly in their grammar schools on arithmetic because it itself is not a subject, so therefore no one can become educated. It's become more and more – this is very manifest in the university – I'm not talking over your heads here, this is something that's very, very bang! It's very obvious. You get into a university, you're all the time having problems being shoved under your nose in engineering schools that you're supposed to do by algebra; you're always having problems shoved under your nose that you're supposed to do with calculus, any one of which is solvable by sight arithmetic. That's something to think about. Now, what has happened here? Well, arithmetic, not being a subject in itself, and be-ing a somewhat degraced and degraded subject, has gradually shrunk and is ceasing to be a subject, but is simply an auxiliary subject which moves up into higher mathematics. And if you don't know arithmetic, you can't do higher mathematics. That's the way it's represented, more or less, to the engineer. Well, I was quite interested in old McGuffeys Readers at one time to find out how adept at arithmetic somebody was expected to be in 1888. The problems which they were expected to solve in arithmetic were the problems of algebra. And they were expected to solve these with arithmetic. And what do you know? It was a great revelation to me that it was very possible to solve these algebraic problems with their \"Xs\" and \"Ys\" and all that sort of thing by common, ordinary, garden-variety arithmetic. And it made a lot better sense – made a lot better sense. I looked at this and I've run into some old-timers who could take a column of figures about five figures wide and about ten figures tall and add them up in a pe-culiar way, which was very peculiar to me, of some kind of a crisscross addition that I would be quite at a loss to explain to you how it was done, but arrive with almost an immediate an-swer. And you say, \"How did they do that?\" \"Well,\" they say, \"it's very simple. You see, nine added to something gives you itself, so all you do is go down the column and find all the combinations which make nine and for-get those, and you add the remainder and you get the total.\" What do you know, you know? Well, of course, that's just tricky stuff, but all this at one time was part and parcel to arithmetic and it's not here anymore in arithmetic. Where did it go? Well, you must have a dying subject. Why is it dying? Nobody is delineating its pur-pose to the student of it. No matter if some – no matter if some purpose does exist in it, that's"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 5 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 397 HPCS beside the point. Yes, you could figure out lots of purposes of it, but all you have to know is, is nobody is delineating, marking out, showing the purpose of that subject to the student so one doesn't consider that he becomes educated in arithmetic. Arithmetic is just some auxiliary subject that keeps you from being shortchanged. So that as the purpose of a subject deteriorates in its advertisement or rendition – as the purpose of a subject deteriorates – the subject itself also falls away. Sounds like a very – a very strange sort of a thing to give you, but as the purpose of a subject falls away, why, so does the subject disappear from the ken of man. Manufacture of buggy whips? Go around and try to find somebody today who knows all about the manufacture of buggy whips. There's probably a couple of boys sitting around in England who know the subject backwards and forwards and who make all the circus whips. See, there are practically no more whips made. Dying, because it has no purpose. Nobody's got any horses to flip buggy whips over, see? So becoming educated in how to manufacture whips today would sort of be an end – a dead end. It would not be a very productive career. Now, that doesn't sound very amplified, but let's take it in reverse and at once it will make a great deal of sense. Then, a subject for which the purpose is not delineated will die away, not only in the society but in the individual. Both of those two – those statements are true. The first one is so true that it's almost nonsense. But the other one is not nonsense and it's not been detected. If the individual to whom you are teaching this subject has not got the purpose of this subject, then that subject will die away in that individual. It might have a tre-mendous purpose, but if the purpose of the subject is not being taught to the individual, he's had it. Do you see? So you can get the difference between a live study and a dead study. A live study is one which has purpose, has a use; and a dead study is one that hasn't any use. And the way you make a live study into a dead study is dual: Its use dies away as in buggy whips or one simply omits it as part of the educational process. And it will make the subject die away, not only in the individual but the society; not only in the society but the individual. Do you see that? And we have to assume that a person cannot become educated, just by the definition of the word \"education\" as I have been stressing it here, in a dead subject because it has no end product. So you find these things become obsessive. Somebody starts to study \"miniatures painted in Holland by blind painters.\" Well now, miniatures painted in Holland, we've got some use for that. But \"miniatures painted in Holland by blind painters,\" well, we would sort of look around for quite a while before we found any use for this particular subject. Oh, you could find uses for it, but don't get yourself all cluttered up on – on introducing your ingenuity to supply the lack in an educational system that – because by being reasonable, you cripple yourself. It's a question of \"What is there?\" not a question of \"What could we dream up to put there?\" Oh, we could dream up some subjects, but let's just say this boy is studying this eso-teric study – strange, weird, useless, nowhere. Do you know that he can easily become ob-sessed with it? He has no purpose for it, no use for it and so, of course, it's impossible for him"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 6 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 398 HPCS to become educated in it because he can never display his virtuosity. He can never display its use. Who would listen? He can't even tell his friends. They'd say, \"This, guy is a ruddy crank! He goes around talking all the time...\" Somewhat like your families and so forth have occa-sionally regarded you on the subject of Scientology. You're over their heads, you see? But much worse than that – much worse than that, we would get it on this sort of a basis, see. No-body knows what he is talking about and nobody knows why he is studying it and it isn't of any use and it's not of much interest anyway. Well, this poor bloke can never communicate it. He can never communicate it for the best reason that communication becomes difficult: No-body will listen. Did you ever think about communication being difficult because nobody listens? Well, just run this into the field of education. If the subject doesn't exist and has no use and has no application and has no this and has no that, well, to that degree their listening ceases because it isn't of any use to them, either. He's studying miniatures painted by blind painters in Hol-land. People sort of say, \"Well, I could understand his studying miniatures painted in Hol-land... I think he's nuts!\" That would be the immediate conclusion, don't you see? Well, your families look at you sometimes, where you have run into this and collided with this head-on, and people wouldn't listen to you on the subject of Scientology or were impatient with you for studying it, and that was because you weren't talking to them about the purpose of Scientology. And you didn't talk to them about the purpose of Scientology within the framework of what it could do for them personally. Now you are coming right on close to home. Your mother might have been interested if she heard what it had done for you personally because she's interested in you. But even your mother would conceive it to be a subject only when a purpose was delineated. Now we'll go a bit – a little bit further: when the purpose that was delineated could be executed to any degree. You know, the purpose you've given it could be executed to any degree. Now, your next stage is, is they don't believe it. See, you could give them the purpose but they don't be-lieve it. In other words, the purpose isn't real to them. So you not only have delineated the purpose but you have delineated it to them in such a way that it is – seems to be an attainable purpose. An attainable or doable purpose. So we walk up to this bird and we say – we say to this bird, \"Your – your interest in this subject should be very great because this subject will make you a Clear.\" He immediately says, \"What wall?\" because it's not an understandable purpose, see? The purpose ceases to be understandable when the goal does not seem to him to be attainable or valuable. And it can cease to be attainable or valuable merely because it isn't understood. So for an educational subject to exist and continue to be a subject in which one can become educated, or if you ever expect anybody to ever be educated in the subject – let me put it that way – for it to continue to exist, for it to survive, it has to have a purpose which can be seen to be an attainable action. It has to be attainable. The purpose must be attainable. Now, the value of a subject – the value of a subject depends, simply and utterly, upon the value of attaining that stated purpose. How valuable is it to attain that particular stated"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 7 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 399 HPCS purpose? Is it valuable to be able to accomplish this or is it not valuable to be able to accom-plish this? And to that degree a subject appears to be a fringe subject or a vital subject. So the woof and warp of the culture is made up of educations which are subdivisible – that's the woof and warp of a culture... (Woof and warp: rug term. Try not to put too many words on the line, here. The woof goes that way and the warp goes that way, see?) It's – the make-up of a culture is subdivisible into two general types of education. A culture is held together solely and only by education. Whether that education is accomplished by experience or by teaching, a culture, as a whole, is the summation of its education. And those are two divisions to the educations of a culture, and one of those are the vital ones and the other one is the \"nice\" ones. Now, an education achieved is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable. An education is remunerated to the degree that its service is understood to be valuable. And it frankly is not remunerated one penny more. Sometimes they falsely remu-nerate, but not often. And that tells you that there must be some mighty funny, funny things, because there are some things in the society – because this rule I've just given you is true and the society at large then must be misunderstood to some degree because there's several educa-tions in the subject at large which are remunerated to an enormous extent which are not held by certain educational authorities to be valuable. Public must like to be fooled. They're always paying con men of some kind or another. There must be some real value in having hope shot up to the moon in the stock market be-cause those birds are very often paid off heavily. You could reevaluate the society on the ba-sis of what I've given you. Yes, you could say, \"Well, the society makes mistakes in this di-rection. Yes, the society is lied to.\" Well, I don't think the society makes mistakes in this di-rection. That's a new thought, isn't it? Do you know that the most valuable prof... single tech-nical profession in the United States is burying people? Hm, very highly paid! They've man-aged to convince everybody that the loved one should be in sealed bronze caskets and in con-crete and steel vaults outside the caskets so that seepage won't trouble your loved ones. And they had the whole country absolutely convinced that this was Congressional law, that it was local law. And a recent Congressional investigation disclosed this fact and they found out that there isn't any statutes in the United States that compels anybody in the United States to be buried even in a board coffin. There are statutes that require them to be buried, but there is not even a statute that requires them to be embalmed. So you roll Aunt Agnes up in a blanket and dump her in a hole. [laughter] As long as you've got a death certificate, man, that's all you need. So, this particular profession – this particular profession was selling what? They were sort of selling some weird life after death, weren't they? They were akin to some religious cult or something like that. And it was obvious that people did buy life after death. And we find out that one of the most expensive things you could do in Egypt was to die. That was a very expensive thing and that's gotten that way in the United States today. It's very costly to die. By the time they get through with you, man, well, you've got no estate left. But this is very peculiar. The society remunerates this and rewards it. Well, it's just about the most educated art you ever had anything to do with in your life. Undertaking is a"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 8 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 400 HPCS supereducated art and the society of undertakers themselves – \"morticians,\" they like to refer to themselves – these birds run their own schools and their own technology and that sort of thing and they really hammer-pound it in. And the final end product is very visible. But these guys are quite sharpies. I know, because back in the days when I was having a ball around New York as a writer, why, the medical examiner – that's what they've begun to call the coro-ner around New York now – they changed their names, too – the medical examiner of New York was a particular pal of mine. He was the coroner of the city of New York and one of the nicest blokes you ever had anything to do with. He'd embalmed personally, with his own paws, 15,000 corpses. I got interested in this particular field by being sent in his direction to do a series of stories about undetectable crime and of course I wound up in the lap of the medical examiner of the city of New York and he started my crime education on the subject. And of course, this was in the field of what they call forensic or legal medicine. And this boy, he had it all at his finger tips and so forth. But the casualness with which he could roll off all of these various things showed a great familiarity with the subject. This was not an esoteric subject. This had to do with lots of dead bodies which had been strewn all over the place in various states of dishabille, various states of knocked-about. They were untidy at times. This was quite a boy. And oddly enough, he conceived that he was not acceptable socially. And I was very acceptable socially, so he and I formed a very good partnership, because he always liked to – if I was going anyplace and asked him if he'd like to come along and so forth, he was there on a rocket plane, you see? Right away, quick! But there wasn't anything – there wasn't anything that was wrong with this bird. He had perfect manners, he was a perfect gentleman and so forth. But part of his education was that his sub-ject was looked down on and therefore he felt he was socially unacceptable and so forth. Well, I don't know. A lot of people – lot of people look down on – street sweepers think they're looked down on and so forth, but street sweepers keep the streets swept clean, don't they? Hm? Well, this guy obviously was keeping the streets of New York from being littered with decomposing corpses. And oh, I used to see him every once in a while. When I was president of one of the writing societies there and so forth, why, he used to come over there quite regularly and he'd give detective writers talks if I'd ask him to and so forth. And they would go away from the luncheon or something like that the weirdest shades of green. [laughter, laughs] But man, here was – here was data. Here was data. And it had a very definite end product, if only in the field of detection. A guy like that could take one look at a corpse and he'd say \"Carbon monoxide, been dead about three hours.\" \"Cyanide.\" \"Arsenic.\" This, that, the other thing. Brrrrrr, boom! \"Oh, I'd say that was botulinus poisoning, Joe. Yeah, yeah. Well, put him on the slab and we'll run a – we'll run a test on it, do an autopsy. Well, I'm pretty sure that's just botulinus, you know some – eating green beans in the wrong time of the year that had been in the icebox too long. That's – looks like that's what that is to me.\" Almost always just dead on the button, you see? This was art, the art of observation, the world of death. But even in the days of Egypt this art was not accorded any social status. The boys who embalmed the bodies down in the"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 9 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 401 HPCS deadhouse and so forth were actually never even permitted to leave the deadhouse. They were held in. But here's this terrific, terrific amount of art, terrific amount of detail, terrific amount of technicality, terrific amount of stuff and it's come right straight down through these cul-tures from the days of ancient Egypt, and it is totally uninterrupted. It's interesting that such a bird as this could sit down and discuss the relative preservation qualities of modern embalm-ing and Egyptian embalming. And he was certain he was doing better these days than the Egyptians were. It's the first time I'd ever heard that, because we've seen these Egyptian mummies in univer... in university museums and that sort of thing, and we've seen these things around and they're still there, all wrapped up and so forth. But his attitude toward it was the attitude of a true professional: \"Well, their features hadn't been preserved and their coloring was bad.\" That's what he said to me one day, so forth. \"Yeah, the next time you're down in the museum, Ron,\" he said, \"if you don't believe it, if you don't believe that we're way ahead of them these days, you just take a look at one of those mummies. Features haven't been preserved and coloring is bad.\" And I said, \"But man! Those guys – those guys have been dead for thousands of years!\" And he said, \"Well, in a few thousand years one of mine will have been, too.\" And he said, \"His features won't be bad, and his coloring will be good.\" He said, \"We can do a better job than\" – almost – \"we used to do.\" Well now, here's a steady – I'm talking to you about a relatively debased profession, but a highly remunerated one. And keeping the bodies off the streets and prettying up the loved ones and so forth is very highly paid. Preservation of memory and so forth is a very highly paid profession. And it has been continuous – it has been continuous for a very long time without its know-how dying away. Wherever there's been a civilization, they seem to have known the data of the last civilization on this, no matter how many wars have swept across the top of it and they deal it off the cuff and so forth. Why, even the ancient tribal rites, they would go find a dry cave that would automatically embalm the corpses of their loved ones. So here's this – here's this very interesting technical line. That's a technical line, man. What you have to do in order to keep a corpse from going bad and what you have to do to and know about what killed this person and what he died of, so that you won't get all mixed up in your embalming activities and what you have to do in order to straighten all this out, or so forth. And how you're supposed to bury them and exactly how you're supposed to handle the grieving family and exactly how you were supposed to sell them the most for the – for the most, you know? These are technologies, no matter which way you look at it. They are very broad and they are very prec... exact and boy, do they wind up with a finite result! You know? You've got the body, you embalm it, you bury it, you collect your money. Thud! Very easily understood. So that we would say that the subject is – a subject is not only remunerated to the de-gree of its need but also to the degree that it is understood by the public at large. It's remuner-ated to the degree that it is understood. All right now. How about this longevity? How about this longevity? The continuing need of a purpose can then preserve a subject. The continuing need of the subject can preserve"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 10 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 402 HPCS the subject. If the subject continues to be needed, it will be preserved; that's a corollary of what I just gave you a few minutes ago. But the length of time that it gets preserved is entirely dependent upon the need of and the relay of its technology. You see, you must have the tech-nology continue to be needed and the technology must also be relayed. If it continues to be needed it will be also relayed, which is all very – very fascinating; rather obvious. But where you get a subject coming on down the line – where you get a subject com-ing on down the line across the millennia and so forth, it is only because its purpose is carried with it. Its purpose has gone along with it and its purpose is understood. Now, one could de-stroy that subject by destroying its purpose – no longer needed, you see – or by destroying the relay of its technology in some fashion or another; or in being too insistent or too – too force-ful in relaying its technology and tacking lots of other things to its technology which didn't belong on it. In other words, \"Before you can study engineering, you must have had a gram-mar school education, a high school education, gone to finishing school and learned how to knit.\" I can expect that will be about the next one, see? You're not going to have any engineers after a while; all the bridges will start to fall down. Well, one of the reasons why you won't have any engineers after a while is very ele-mentary, and it's contained in our own technology, but only in our own technology, the reason for this. And that is, you've given him too much takeoff. He's had too much of a run on take-off and – and the longer in an – in education – let's get back on education now – the longer it takes to approach the education, the more opportunity there is for tacks on the runway. We could probably state that in a much more easily expressed way, but that's about the way it is. If this character is taking off, taking off, taking off, taking off, he's running on the runway, he's trying to get up speed, everybody is saying, \"Well, you mustn't pull back on the stick yet. You must stay there on the runway and keep running on the runway, ready to take off, ready to take off, ready to take off, ready to take off.\" Well, by the time he's done this for about forty-five years and finds out he isn't off the ground, he doesn't take off. The reason for that is, is the number of opportunities to fail are directly proportional to the length of the approach. That's a law: Number of opportunities to fail are directly propor-tional to the length of approach, or length of time that it is going to take to get up to where you're going to study this thing. Now, that law is balanced by the fact that if you don't study something by gradients, a person can get into a mess by going into too high a gradient as I was talking about the other day. He went too steep, too quick. So there's – somewhere there is a proper length runway for any subject. It's a runway of the right length for the subject. A runway of the right length for the subject, then, would not be so long that it need-lessly multiplies the opportunities for failure and it had better not be so short that a person jumps a gradient and gets himself into a confusion. And what is the right length of a runway for any given subject? How much preparatory action should there be or how long should a course of study be and all of those things, those questions, are answered in this: Well, it should not be so long that it needlessly oppor... multiplies opportunities for failure and it should not be so short that it takes a person up too steep."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 11 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 403 HPCS He'll fall off on his nose, like we used to do when I was in flying clubs in college. There's many a sad young man would pull back on the stick too quick. The evolution there was a \"whipstall.\" Called a \"whipstall\" – technical term, aviation – you come up the line and you – there isn't enough forward speed to sustain the vacuum on the top of the wings, and you have just never seen an aircraft do anything quite as sickeningly funny as it does in a whip-stall. It's flying along very, very nicely, and all of a sudden it's flying too slow, there's no longer any vacuum above the wing and it goes \"Whooof!\" It is fast! It's not for nothing it was called a whipstall. And of course, when you're only about 100 feet above the runway or some-thing like that, and the edge of the field and so on, why, it – you don't develop enough speed in the process of falling to then be able to pull back on the stick and pull out of it. What they do is send a notice to your folks and get in touch with my old friend the medical examiner of New York. Anyway, that's what happens to a student, see? He gets himself into a state of overcon-fidence or something like this and he pulls back on the stick and he hasn't had a long enough runway, he hasn't developed his speed, don't you see? In other words, he goes into too steep a gradient. Now, Mary Sue did it the other night. She's studying typewriting, of all things. She typewrites pretty well, but she's decided – started to do touch-typing. And she's going to make the grade on the subject of touch-typing, hammer-pound – bang! And it's quite interesting. I ran an educational process on her for a very, very short period of time on this subject and busted the dam on this. I don't know that she's noticed it and – she isn't here just now; she wound up with lawyers, so – but she probably hadn't noticed that there is a coordination be-tween her sudden interest in learning to touch-type and breaking the barrier on one of the old \"too long a runway\" propositions and \"too short a gradient,\" too. I broke that with a process and now she's very interested in learning touch-typing and she's spending about an hour a night, with everything else she's got to do, sitting there hammer-pounding on a machine on a touch-typing basis. This is very difficult, because at the same time she uses the typewriter during the remaining hours to hunt and punch out notes, you see? So on the one hand she's busy touch-typing, you see, and the next, why, she's hunting and punching it out, you see, doing her work. And then she'll get back and she'll be touch-typing away. I threw her. I gave her a metronome the other night and she suddenly conceived that her rhythm was off, which it was, and so forth. And she couldn't do anything with that metro-nome running. She said she had to shut that off right now. It was too high a gradient. But she went onto the gradient of two rows of keys before she had licked one row of keys. Now, you see what I mean by too tight a gradient? This was too tough, see? And boy, did she whipstall! She whipstalled right now. And she just went into a total confusion. But knowing, now – yesteryear she simply would have quit; that would have been that – but knowing, now, the technology that we – that I've managed to get together here on the subject of education, she sits back and says, \"Now, let's see, what did I do? Oh, yeah. Well, this is just too tough a gradient. I just went up on too high a gradient.\" She went back to one row, patter, ta-patter, ta-patter, ta-patter and then went over onto two rows and she had it, see? See, she – in other words, she moved up over that gradient smoothly."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 12 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 404 HPCS So a person knowing this can actually guide his own traffic through very nicely. No-body had to tell her that, don't you see? All right. Then an educational subject is simply that something that winds up in a do-ingness and is approached by the process of getting educated in it. Now, that's a hell of a thing to have to say! But you know, hardly anybody really knows this. They don't really know it. They give it lip service all the time, but they're always engaging in activities which they do very badly and fail at like crazy and it never occurs to them they've never been educated in the subject. I'll tell you something used to drive me stark, staring mad, down in Hollywood. Every director, every supervisor and as far as that's concerned, every actor on the set, they all knew how to be a writer. They knew – knew how to – they knew writing. They could all write sto-ries. The place was just lousy with writers. You want to know why Hollywood never got out of kindergarten on stories; that's just because of it. They never recognized that it's a technol-ogy; it's a professional technology which is studied like crazy. It has more ins and outs and ramifications; actually it has quite a terminology. But all these birds knew they knew how to write. It wasn't anything you ever had to study, so of course if they did get a pro in their midst – and Hollywood developed very few professional writers, in fact it developed no pro-fessional writers. They come in from elsewhere and go to pieces. Well, the process is done by everybody there knowing the profession of the fellow who just arrived. See, he's a writer, he's a professional, he arrives, everybody else knows his profession. Well, now, he won't give the movies the beingness necessary to realize that maybe movie writing has a few tricks of the trade, too, so of course he looks a little bit stupid to these people, whereas he's not stupid at all. He just hasn't learned that particular specialty of his own subject, which he could learn rather rapidly. And Hollywood, not realizing this, never bothers to teach him how to write for Hollywood. And they have never found out that it's nec-essary to be educated to know how to write. So here's this wild profession which is sometimes remunerated to a fantastic degree and in which you can very easily starve to death and in which people grant you fantastic quantities of beingness and in which people ignore you utterly. So it is through all kinds of contradictions. What is a professional writer? Well, by test he's somebody who is successful and is getting his stuff published or at least read or viewed. But of all the subjects of the arts, this is the wildest one to have anything to do with because nobody grants it the beingness of having any technology. And yet the boy who succeeds – you would be very interested – the boy who succeeds is not just somebody who wandered in with an idea. You go up to the Screen Writers Guild and you for – you find out that the reason education in writing has gotten a bad name is be-cause it's taught in American universities. They have gone out and hired a bunch of failed writers. And failed writers either become editors or professors. And they dramatize their fail-ure, by the way, and they try to make a writer fail. And I've never seen one do anything else. I beg your pardon, there have been a few that worked like mad, they were tremendously suc-cessful, whatever they had to do with succeeded and that sort of thing. But they weren't under the idea that they were writers. All these other birds still had this wild idea that they were"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 13 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 405 HPCS kind of writers, but here they were, editing, see? They weren't trained in it or if they had been trained in it, they'd failed at it. Here's a chance subject. The whole society seems to run, to some degree, on the ro-mances and imaginations and so forth of the writer. But you talk about a hidden piece of technical training. Well, the technical training of this field doesn't exist. If a professional writer wants a good laugh, if he wants just to lie right down in the aisle and laugh and laugh and laugh until his sides are sore, all he needs to do is read the curriculum of the professional writing classes of Princeton, for instance. You just double up in a ball. I mean, you – you can't help it. And I took the – a professional writing class at Harvard one time, and put them into paralysis. And I was told by the professor later, they never did recover. I made the mistake – I was very young and very brash and of course when you're in-vited to lecture on your own subject, you see, at some very esoteric institution of this particu-lar character, it rather goes to your head, and you chuck your weight around, you know? Par-ticularly if you're very young and brash and me. [laughter] And so I stood up in front of this writing class, and I said to them, \"I noticed your current subject here is style. Now, no writer really knows whether he has a style or not until he has sat down,\" and I was being very rea-sonable, \"until he's sat down and written a couple of hundred thousand words. And by the time he's done that, he can probably detect in his work whether or not he has a style.\" From the professional writer's viewpoint this is the most reasonable statement ever made by any-body, because a pro, even – even Dickens would just think nothing of getting out a hundred thousand words in a month, see? Nothing! I don't know where all this idea came from that they all write painfully with their blood while twisted in agony, see? They don't. They don't at all. If it took somebody seven years to write a great work, it's because he was drunk six and a half. [laughter] They write well, they write easily, and they write facilely. For instance, most of Dickens' stuff was writ-ten at the rate of 5,000 words a day. At one time I worked it out and handed it over to the press and it got national press. You saw that story kicking around and so forth. They thought less of his work then, of course, I suppose. But a writer can write. What better definition do you have for it, see? He can write easily, facilely and rapidly. Well, all right, I said this to those poor blokes sitting there in their classroom and I no-ticed there was a sort of a shock went through the classroom. And it was very shortly after that, that I concluded my lecture and I didn't get hardly any applause. They were all sitting there sort of like statues, stunned. They didn't even bother to get up at the end of the bell. And finally one or two of them turned around to one or two of them, they muttered something or other. And the professor, who was a pretty good bloke, he came back and got me off the ros-trum and walking out with me and so forth, and he said, \"Well, you sure raised hell with that.\" And I said, \"Why? For pity's sakes, why? What is this all about?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"they – they write 1500 words a semester.\" And those people were upset, man! I was back there again, and that whole class, no-body even would speak to me. They were upset! They had thrown me overboard. I couldn't"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 14 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 406 HPCS possibly be a pro, you see? But yet my stuff was on the newsstands. But this must be a fluke. Something was wrong, because the data I'd given them must be wrong. These birds had never been told that they should have to write! They were all being taught to be writers, but nobody had ever said to them: \"Brother, write!\" You understand? And I was the first one to announce to that class that were going into their fourth year that a writer should write. I don't know what a writer was supposed to do. He was supposed to dis-cuss or he was supposed to do this or supposed to do that, but they – commercialism has a dirty word connected with it to such people and so forth. Why? It means hard work! They don't disdain money. Never get those people wrong. They don't disdain anything that goes with it. They don't disdain being commercial or being anything else. It isn't their art they're holding on to. It's hard work to produce, to them. This is just too tough. So they had studied for four years and had not covered their first gradient, which is that you do it! \"We are now teaching you about ceramics. In the field of ceramics you make pottery and glass and other such objects. By the end of this course it will be expected that you will facilely and easily be able to make bits and pieces of pottery and tell things that are wrong with pieces of pottery that are not well made and so forth and you will know the technology of making pottery.\" Somebody comes along and says, \"Well, you're – you're really teaching a polytechnic subject,\" or something. No, no, man. Writing is simply cutting down trees, running Bulldoz-ers, there's many a man out there digging a ditch that hasn't got the physical energy it takes to write. That's right. It's just another job. And when approached in that fashion, becomes rea-sonable and comprehensible and understandable, and you – then you sit down. A writer isn't somebody who wears a red fez hat and blue slippers and smokes a pipe and gazes out the window. A writer is somebody who sits down to a desk with a pencil and a piece of paper or with a typewriter with some paper in it and he writes. What does he write? He writes what will be published and what will sell and what people will look at, because by definition a subject has to be accepted by the society in which it exists for it to be a profes-sional subject. Now, this is awful cold-blooded, hard-eyed looking. That's right down to earth. Now, I don't exaggerate when I say in a university they don't say this. The best professors will stand around and say, \"Well now, when you're out in the field some day, and you're looking down that transit, don't blame me if you haven't got it level.\" No, they don't teach that way. They hand them a transit after class and tell them to go survey something and don't even give them a lecture on what the transit is, because it's some nasty object. No, the tools of the trade are transits. Engineering: the tools of the trade are levels; the tools of the trade are big pieces of drawing paper and blueprints and bricks and pieces of steel and machines and bulldozers and tough foremen and shady contractors. These are the tools of the trade. They don't teach any course in \"How to Keep Your Own Ethics While Working for the Bide-a-Wee Construction Company.\" They're not real, in other words. They've gone into some other never-never land."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 15 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 407 HPCS So that was how I shocked the short story course at Harvard. And I never could figure out exactly why and how I had shocked them. It wasn't that I had told them too many words. That I assumed for a long time, but I know now, in studying education, what I had done. What I had done is simply told them that, \"If you're studying writing, you write. You're expected to write. You're expected to turn out wordage.\" And it probably wasn't even in the phrase, \"You won't know a style,\" because my whole talk was devoted to this single idea. But it was when I finally gave them a quantity, right after what I meant by \"words on a piece of paper.\" I remember standing up there on the rostrum calculating it rather rapidly. I said, \"Well, I'll get some low figure that anybody in his right mind would be able to do in a few weeks, you know, and it won't buffalo anybody.\" So I said: \"A couple of hundred thou-sand words,\" you know? \"Gaaargh!\" see? Well, that was what they went: \"Gaargh!\" But that isn't what the shock was contained in. The shock was contained in the fact that my whole ad-dress to the subject of writing is that you wrote and that a writer writes. And that was what the shock was in. If you're going to be educated in a subject, you should be able to do it. Now, it's not a dirty word to do things. Now, you don't have to go on obsessively doing this the rest of your life. It is very confusing in this course that I've just taught. I've just been taught. The very best of these teachers have been thoroughly grounded in theory, and have worked like madmen with lots of doingness and lots of ramifications of it in their own field. Now, when you've got that combination, you've got a fellow, when he said something is so, there was something very believable about it because it was very right. It was very recognizable – he might not even know how to write well, but he could express this because it was his own subject and he knew what he was talking about. Now you've got somebody who couldn't do it and that would show up – gahhh! Huge lights going up in all directions; the impracticalities of it, don't you see this? This bird – it's not the right emphasis. He doesn't tell you about the right things in the subject. He tells you about something that he thinks might be interesting, but he himself, through experience, doesn't know whether it would ever be useful or not, see? Makes a big thing out of some little thing, don't you see? I had one the other day – it slips my mind right now, on – in this course. It had some-thing to do with the fact the guy was just tearing – oh, yes! Yes! It was projection. It was the projection of transparencies. And if you had a screen six feet away, why – and a screen twelve feet away, then your light and density of the transparency – your light was, of course, much less on the screen twelve feet away for – not only because the footage was increased, but be-cause it was more distant and therefore the density of the transparency was very important for projection. And transparencies had to be very, very carefully developed and printed and so forth, in their positive form, in order to overcome these differences of – I was – it was one of these boys. He was a little more esoteric than the others.

You know, it's an old technology, lantern slide shows. It is the immediate grandpappy of the cinema, see? But this boy had probably never given one, so he gives this terrific stress of how careful you've got to be to get this point at which – it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how thick a transparency is, as long as it's a viewable transparency. It doesn't matter how dense it is or how thick it is or how hard it is to look through, if it's too far away, get a brighter light. And the thing has a solution. That's all. Put another lamp in it. You don't do it in the darkroom, in other words. You do it while you're projecting it, but he didn't know this fact so he makes this big, labored halfpage that you have to sweat through about printing transparencies and making sure that you know beforehand at what dis-tance they're going to be projected, because it makes so much difference between the – oh, no! You get the idea? Now, if this bird had been – had ever done this or had had much to do with this, he wouldn't make a mistake like that. So you – what you do is get wrong emphasis. So true knowledge will give a correct emphasis and only a theoretical knowledge will give wrong emphasis. And I imagine the universities by this time are absolutely strewn with wrong emphasis. And you can keep moving something farther and further afield with wrong emphasis, up to a point of where the technology practically gets lost. Wrong emphasis, wrong emphasis, wrong emphasis! Maddening! In other words, \"Be very careful, now, about the varnish on your E-Meter. Now, E-Meters are varnished and we're going to go through, now, the next three weeks of study on the manufacture of varnishes for E-Meters.\" Well, it's a matter of how unreal can you get? It doesn't have anything to do with the subject matter at all. Just because there is some varnish in a session – it probably never oc-curred to you till this moment there was any varnish in a session. [laughter] Somebody makes a big deal out of this, you see? He says – he figures out, because varnish is shiny, he figures out that light falling on this might possibly influence the preclear into being distracted by the meter. He's read someplace that something or other, you see? He's figured out that this must be true, but actually an experienced auditor would tell you that he has never had this com-plaint from any pc every place, so it's not a problem, so why solve it? So these unrealities simply consist of this, and this is a very precise definition. Unreal-ities enter when an educational activity teaches solutions to problems which don't exist or fails to solve problems that do exist. And the mean between those is what should be taken up. And the one thing that gives this is experience. Some bird has the – he has the activity of carving stone heads out of the mountain: Gutzon Borglum. He... this is it. I imagine you could go up and you could learn more con-founded things from a bird like that. I imagine he's got it down. But he'd expect you to have a whole grounding in the field of the world of arts and sculpting before you even got there. But nevertheless, there's probably a lot of specialized doodle-daddle that he would tell you all about, like, \"You can tell whether that particular piece of rock that you're going to go into has a crack in it by the fact that there's discoloration of the pattern of it,\" and so forth, and this would all be very good, you see? Well, he's solving something real. You start to carve a"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 17 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 409 HPCS cracked rock and it goes \"crack.\" And this is very disastrous, particularly when you've only got one mountain to cut up. You can't order another mountain. So this is probably a very important problem. And you go out there again and you look it over and he's got a new assistant who has been taught all about how to fix up faces and heads in mountains by somebody who never did. And now, Gutzon Borglum is faced with the fact that he's got to train this – first he's got to untrain this assistant and he's got to train him again, so he's just got about twice the job on his hands, you see? This bird's been taught that it's very, very bad to smoke at heights because it destroys your aesthetic sense. Has nothing to do with carving faces out of a mountain, see? Carving faces out of a mountain doesn't require very much aesthetic sense. It requires a lot of leaning on these great big \"widow maker\" pneumatic drills and blasting powder and it's a very violent activity. There's lots of motion and mass and doingness connected with it, you see? But somebody that would never do it, he'd teach, \"Well, you have to be very careful of your aesthetic sense,\" and so forth, and blyehhh! see? He'd try to extrapolate a subject with which he had no acquaintance and that would be a very difficult thing to try to do, to teach a subject with which you had no acquaintance. And yet, apparently it is not – it is very difficult to do, but it is always being done. And it's given higher education a bad name today in many areas – it's given it a very bad name, because they're always being taught by people who ha-ven't done it. And I have really learned my lesson in this photography course. Boy, I can see one of these birds coming up in the textbook a mile away now, and I – ahhhh! I say, \"Ronnie, here we gooooo! Wharooom! We are now going to solve all sorts of problems that don't exist, and we're going to not have any solutions for the problems that do exist, but all of this will be stated in such a way that it's impossible to extract any meaning out of it anyway. But you will have to extract the meaning out of it unless you want to get barriered or blocked on this par-ticular subject.\" Now, isn't that an interesting problem? So it makes about seven times the amount of study, just easily seven times the amount of study that should be there. He doesn't know what he's talking about, but you have to know what he's talking about, so you have to read his subject and then sort of dream up one and figure it out for yourself against your practical applications. It's a bum show. So all subjects, regardless of whether people call them \"pure mathematics\" or \"pure art\" or something like that, all subjects wind up in a finite doingness, a very specific doing-ness; all subjects wind up in a specific doingness if they are educational subjects in which a person can get educated. And if they do not wind up with a specific doingness, a person, no matter how long he studied them, couldn't become educated in them. Now, this isn't just for the definition of the word education. I haven't given it that meaning. I mean, you could go on and on and on, and feel more and more baffled and more and more baffled by this particular subject and so forth. Well, it is not a subject in which somebody could become educated. Do you follow that? Well, that's your bafflement. You're trying to become educated and it's impossible, because it doesn't wind up in a finite doing-ness."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 18 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 410 HPCS So, anything that winds up in a finite, specific doingness – that's a measurable, you know? It has limits and actions. Anything that winds up in a finite doingness is susceptible to being educated. In other words, you can educate it. But if it doesn't wind up that way, a per-son cannot become educated in it, no matter how hard he studies it because there isn't any way he can ever check out if he ever learned anything. So it becomes a total significance for which the mass is absent; and education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is hard on people. Education attempted in the absence of the mass is hard on the student. It's very tough on the student. It makes him feel – physiologically, it makes him feel squashed; actually, actually makes him feel squashed, makes him feel bent, makes him sort of spinny. It – these are all physiological and mental reactions; makes him feel sort of dead, makes him feel bored, exas-perated, makes him feel a lot of different ways. This isn't the only way a person can become those, by a long ways, but that is the result of studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent. The mass of it is absent. Do you understand? You could understand that you were studying nothing, and therefore you would not expect any mass, so that probably wouldn't upset you; but you're studying tractors and you ain't got no tractors; no tractors and you're studying tractors. Photographs help. Motion pictures would help. They would do pretty good, because they're something of the mass. They're a sort of a promise or a hope of the mass. But the printed page and the spoken word are not a substitute for a tractor! Remember that. And this isn't the old argument, \"Of course, we know that a person has to have some-thing of the stuff they're studying around them.\" No, no it isn't – it isn't even into the area of your – your practical, and so forth. Don't look for a further explanation for this datum, be-cause you have to understand this datum in its purity. And that is simply that educating a per-son in a mass which they don't have and which isn't available produces physiological reac-tions. That is what I'm trying to teach you. I'm not even saying it should be done or shouldn't be done. I'm just saying it produces physiological reactions. That's just a fact. You under-stand? You're trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and you're not giving him any trac-tors. Well, he's going to wind up with a face that feels squashed, he's going to wind up with headaches, he's going to wind up with his stomach feeling funny, he's going to feel dizzy from time to time, his eyes are very often going to hurt and so forth. Now, have I got this datum across? It's a physiological datum. It has to do with proc-essing and the field of the mind. So therefore you could expect that you would get the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses. Clever, huh? And therefore I can tell you, knowing that datum, exactly what the French educational system con-sists of. I don't even believe they would be permitted to have a desk in the room if they were studying desks. I think the teacher's first action would be to have all desks removed from the room and then he would teach them the theory of desks."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 19 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 411 HPCS Now, one of the ways you get away with it, I talk to you, for instance, in these lec-tures. You are looking at somebody who does have a mind and you're looking at a body and it's very live, so you've got more mass actually, in a lecture, than you have in a bulletin. You'd probably much rather be lectured to, live, don't you see, than you would be to a bulletin. All right, your second best is you've got the mass of the tape and the sound and that probably isn't so bad, but it starts reducing on down to a silence and a nowhereness, and a – so forth, and about that time you'd start to feel bad. And then if you were studying somebody without ever having them there – have you ever read a bulletin, for instance, and suddenly recognized something about the pc you were auditing? You actually have an impulse to go find him or her. Well, to the degree that you don't do that, you get upset. You've got an applied mass now, but you haven't got the thing there that it directly and immediately applies to, so your ten-dency is to go find it. All right, one must understand that this phenomenon exists, because there is another series of phenomena that exists which are physiological, which are based on the fact of too steep a gradient. That's another source of physical or physiological study reaction, because too steep a gradient. And this is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness, goes on this and it's probably – a distinct physiological reaction, distinct from the other. Now, I confess to you, I haven't bothered to make a table of which gives which, but I'm just telling you that there is a distinction which could be drawn between these two things. And then there is the third one of the physiological reaction brought about through – an entirely different one now; an entirely different set of physiological reactions are predicted to exist in this field – a bypassed definition. And the bypassed definition gives you distinctly a blank feeling, a washed-out feeling, a not-there feeling and a sort of a nervous sort of an hysteria will follow in, in back of that. Those are some of the physiological-mental reactions that follow this definition. In other words, I'm talking now about the fact that you'd know whether somebody was jamming you in the arm with a pin, or hitting you on the toe with a hammer. Well, these are two different physical reactions, two different physiological reactions, see? Well, I've just given you three sources of physiological reaction to aspects of study and they are three differ-ent areas of study and they are three different sets of symptoms. And I haven't bothered to bring it out in a table form, but – I haven't read it or studied it enough to bring it out in a table form, but I recognize the differences which exist. There might be a fourth and fifth, you understand? I'm not giving you this as the total grouping. These are the three I know, and know exist, and know that are important. You've got the one, where – this is the least upset ones of the thing but it produces the most distinctly recognizable actions, and you'll wonder in vain at what is producing this if you didn't know it, and that is, it's just studying something without its mass ever being around or its space ever being around or something. Let's say you're studying a sky and nobody ever lets you look at a sky. You've never got a sky to look at, don't you see? Something like that. You can study a mind because you know that the mind has an invisibility and contains certain amount of masses and that sort of thing but you understand that and you do have minds around and it's quite obvious that you have a mind in front of you when you're auditing the pc,"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 20 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 412 HPCS don't you see? But if you were studying this all off in some ivory tower in Austria or in Belle-vue Hospital or someplace else where they don't have any minds, you would very soon find yourself experiencing these reactions, see? They'd be \"zuuuu!\" and so forth. The manifestation of \"blow\" stems from the third one of the misunderstood definition, or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word and so forth. That's what produces \"blow.\" A person doesn't necessarily blow on these other two. They're not pronouncedly blow phenomena. They're simply physiological phenomena. Well, you could therefore make a child feel sick or well in the field of study. Now, that gives you a whole table of what you could do. Little Johnny is having an awful time in school with his arithmetic. Well, obviously, let's get him some apples and give each one of them a number and he's got a number of apples in front of him and there are no longer a theo-retical number of apples. Let's give him the mass of what he is studying, see? See? We find out, suddenly, that he had a problem that involved apples and by golly, he never had any ap-ples on his desk to count. You understand? You know, we'll trace it back to an absence of mass, see? Or we could supply the mass, which is – I'm trying to give you the positive rem-edy – we could supply mass, we could supply an object or a reasonable substitute and we'd find out that first one I gave you there would cure up. The remedy for the second one is cutting back. Find out when he was not confused on the gradient: what new action he undertook to do. Now, that's a – that's a doingness level, that gradient. Or what action he understood well and let's find the missing point right in what he understood well. Just before he was all confused, what did he understand well? And then we find out that he didn't understand it well. See, it's really – it's really at the tail end of what he understood well, and after that he went over the gradient, see? All right, but that is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness. The individual is suddenly asked to learn handling his sensitivity control and he has been get-ting along just dandy watching the needle of the E-Meter swing to the left and right and now he's all confused about the sensitivity control. Well, there is something wrong with the E-Meter's needle swinging back and forth. Don't go over and try to explain the sensitivity con-trol. Because he doesn't misunderstand the sensitivity control. You have hit too steep a gradi-ent. It was too much of a jump, because he didn't understand what he was doing and he jumped to something next and that was too steep and it went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulty to this new thing. So that's true in this gradient, see? That's true of gradients. Now differentiate, because gradients, here, sounds terribly like definitions. But re-member that they are quite distinctly different. Gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness, but they still hang off in the field of understandingness. But it is the action that we are interested in, in gradients, where we have a plotted course of forward motion. See, we've got a plotted course, he should go through this, he should go through that and then he's sup-posed to go through that. And we find out that he was terribly confused on the second one he went through. Well, we must assume that he never got out of the first one. That's the gradient approach. And that is one whole set of phenomena accompanies that and it looks awfully like this other one."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"STUDY AND EDUCATION 21 SHSBC-399 – 13.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 413 HPCS But this other one is so much more important than the gradient approach – which you only run into the intimacies of actually training somebody – this other one is so much more important, the last one, than gradients, that it's the woof and warp and the make-up of human relations, the mind, subjects. It establishes talent, it establishes aptitude, lack of aptitude, it's what the psychologists have been testing for years and it's all of this balderdash. And that's just the definitions of words: the misunderstood word. That's about all it goes back to: the misunderstood word. And that produces such a vast panorama of mental effects, that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity, the prime factor involved with many other things. If a person weren't this way, his talent might or might not be present, but his doingness would be present. See, he might not paint a great picture, but he'd be painting pictures. So, his aptitude in being able to do it would have something to do with his sensitivity, have something to do with a little bit more, you see? You know? We're – we can't say that Joe would paint as well as Bill if both of them were unaberrated on the field of art, see? That's an unreasonable assumption. But we can say that the inability of Joe to paint compared to the ability of Joe to make the motions of painting, is dependent exclusively and only upon defini-tions. I'll go over that again; exclusively, only upon definitions. There is some word in the world of art that the person who is inept didn't define or understand. And that was followed by an inability to act in the field of arts. That's very important, because it tells you what happens to doingness. And the restora-tion of doingness depends only upon the restoration of the misunderstood word; the misun-derstood definition. This is very fast processing, it's a very swift, wide, big result is obtainable in this. It has a technology which is a very simple technology. It enters in at the lower levels, because it has to. It'll probably be discussed at Level I, and it will be memorized and done at Level II. And it will be followed on up the line, but because it is low grade does not mean it is unim-portant. It means it has to be at the entrance gates of Scientology, that's all it means. But it is a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education. And don't neglect it. You can trace back the subject he is dumb in or any allied subject he's got mixed up with it and you'll find out why the psychologist cannot understand Scientology. There is noth-ing wrong with Scientology, there was everything wrong with psychology. He never under-stood a word in psychology, so he doesn't ever move over into Scientology. Got the idea? Audience: Yes. Well, that opens the gate to education, so although I've given it last along that line, that is the most important one. Okay? Audience: Yes. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 415 HPCS THE PE COURSE A lecture given on 1 September 1964 Glad to see you, too! All right, then this is the what? Audience: First of September. One Sept. AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, 1 September. Well, the Research Department slipped, I don't see any lecture lying here on the desk in front of me to be read calmly. I don't know what to talk to you about today. You know eve-rything there is to know and some of it true, some of it not so true. [laughter] I've been re-cently sorting out PE. And I'd better give you a bit of a talk about it and I won't say this whole lecture's about it, but I'll just give you a few thoughts in passing here. And I found out some interesting data out of the field of study that particularly relates to PE. It naturally follows that if all of the students who come to a PE course are given in-comprehensible words, they will then go away and that will be that. And I think that is really the sole and total loss of new people into PEs. That's just all there is to it. I mean, it's a simple little package that you can put a red frame around and hang it up on the wall in the PE In-structor's office or across from your own desk and you'd have it made. You're going to think there are lots of reasons. But that is the reason why you start in on Monday with fifteen people and wind up on Friday with two people. You see? Or no peo-ple. It's just to the degree that you have not found or used or given them words they didn't understand. It's as simple as that. That we should learn this with all of our technology and numerous nomenclature in Scientology is quite fabulous but it just shows that I'm laying a foundation for being an honest man. Self-criticism is a virtue. And we have done this rather consistently and I now find out that it is a glaring and terrible error. Only it is not an error necessarily in our framework. It is an error in general in the whole field of study. Now, what does this – what does this bring about here? Now, this brings about a da-tum that you would not expect to find in a lecture on a PE course because I'm not lecturing to PE students. It says what has been discovered here is the prior act to the overt. This gives you a brand-new piece of that very, very important thing called an overt-motivator sequence. The overt-withhold sequence. All of that data is suddenly illuminated. Before there is an overt there is a noncomprehend. Anytime you find an overt you'll find a noncomprehend preceded it. It's preceded. So it's as elementary as that. So an overt sequence goes, in exactly this fashion: A noncomprehend and its commonest, most usual form is simply a misunderstood word – a noncomprehend that can usually be traced to a misunder-"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 2 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 416 HPCS stood word. So you're going to get into some sequence, that's something like this: a misunder-stood word, a noncomprehend, a belief that it's okay to commit an overt, a commission of the overt, the withhold of the overt, an attack or a withdrawal. Now, this can be in magnitude or this can be slight. In other words, you – an overt sequence can go with exclamation points or it can go in light print, you understand? It can mount up to a big overt, it can mount to a little overt. But the final analysis of the thing is it amounts to a blow or an attack. It's as simple as that. It's very elementary. So, we have a new illumination of the overt sequence. Now we know this: that when the auditor sits down and asks somebody for an overt act, and the pc gives him a critical thought, the auditor thinks he's got an overt act and so buys it and so never gets the overt. Do you follow that? That is a common auditor error. All right, so let's trace it back from that error in a session and let's see where we wind up. The pc is asked for an overt act and gives a critical thought. He thought something criti-cal. All right, the auditor that lets it sit there has not pulled the overt. Because that critical thought is a symptom of an overt having been committed. All right, now, let's back it up one and the auditor then says, \"All right, fine. I heard you. You've thought so-and-so. Very good. Now, what overt have you committed?\" The pc, you see, has not answered the auditing ques-tion. He's been asked for a committed overt. And he has given a critical thought. And believe me, that's not an overt. So, we trace it back to that point of the overt and he dropped a flatiron on the person's foot. All right, we pull that. Now, that produces a sufficiently salient result that we as practi-cal practitioners, in this particular field, would be rather satisfied. But interestingly enough, that just prior to dropping the flatiron on somebody's foot there's a noncomprehend, and just prior to the noncomprehend there's a misunderstood word. So you'll find that those four steps are present in any overt you find in any pc. Fascinating, isn't it? Now, let's examine something else. Let's examine something else here. We've got a situation where a psychologist sits down in a Scientology course. He can't learn. Actually, I'm now giving you a datum, not a criticism. This is just data. This has happened over and over and over. They have the hardest time of anybody you ever had anything to do with. They come in and one poor girl who was a major in psychology – actually had her doctor's degree, sat in an Academy course, in the Comm Course, for eight weeks and managed to get up to TR 1 – eight weeks – TR 1. So it is not a criticism that I'm giving you here, but actually just the plain, bald data. This has happened too often. Well, let's look this over. You say, well, Scientology is so far afield and adrift from the things that she studied – look how we can rationalize, see. Just like an auditor sitting there saying – saying this, that and the other thing, the auditor has given them the business on criti-cism. You see, \"I've had a critical thought,\" and so on. Well, you get a big rationalization and the auditor says, of course, that's very reasonable, and then we do a figure-figure-figure on how it is so reasonable, and so forth. Well, we're – it's a disease known as reasonability. We can pull it in this one, too: There was a real reason why that person sitting in that Academy course couldn't learn and you couldn't have gotten it on a – being reasonable, \"Well, of course, of course,\" because no matter how reasonable you get you don't solve anything."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 3 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 417 HPCS That's very important about – to know about being reasonable about it all. It really doesn't solve a thing. When you've got somebody who is totally civilized and totally this and total effete and totally gone and he's long wound up and so forth, why, his final stage is being rea-sonable about everything. He can't do anything about anything, but he can be reasonable. And you fall into that trap, see. Guy's run over by a truck, see, because the careless driver and the bad licensing in the – in the traffic office and so forth, so he's run over by a truck and he lies under the truck wheels and is reasonable about why he's been run over by a truck, don't you see? That's – it's fascinating, but this is a sort of a disease that a civilized per-son gets into. They're reasonable about everything. Now, because we can be so darn reasonable and say this psychology student of course is having trouble in Scientology because it's so different than the terminology and so forth they used in psychology, that we wouldn't look for the real answer. And the real answer is in the field of the associated subject. This is all, incidentally, germane to PE but a lot of other things it's germane to, too. Ah, there have been subjects which have been associated, which are associatable with Scientology. Oh, yes. Healing, education, religion, psychology, these things always – all have an associative point, you see. It's – they're related. You're dealing with cousins. And it didn't do any good being reasonable about this psychologist because it wouldn't have trained him. We forget the end view – person who can't make his goals any-more, he can be reasonable. All right, well, if you really find out what the score is with regard to this thing, why, he no longer has to be reasonable, he can do something about it. Psychology is an associated subject to Scientology and you must assume that when that person sat down in the class and couldn't understand Scientology that they never understood psychology. And when you're trying to cure this person up and teach him Scientology you're wasting your time, because the misunderstood word is in psychology. We don't care if they went through to the end product of a degree and so forth in psy-chology. This didn't guarantee anything because modern education does not require that one does anything or accomplish anything. One simply is reasonable about the subject matter and can regurgitate it properly on an examination paper and one immediately gets his degree. In other words, no practice or action is ever demanded. The engineer does not have to build a bridge before he's labeled \"bridge builder,\" see? That's that hole in education. So they would never notice this. The person could say the right words and give the right answers somehow or another and so he got labeled and so forth. But this didn't mean that he understood the subject. All right, let's examine this field of psychology. What is there to misunderstand in the field of psychology? Now, we're tracing this fellow down so he can understand himself some Scientology, see, and we'd have to go about it in a processing session in this fashion. And it'd have to be processing, I make that point. You could never do this in training, because this is auditing. You can tell the fellow to do some certain things, but realize you're – tell him to go back and look up the words in psychology which he didn't understand and look them up and find out what those are, it'll brighten him up. Oh, yes, but that would be assigning him self –"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 4 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 418 HPCS auditing, which is perfectly okay but remember, you're assigning him auditing. The second you depart from the immediate field on the clay table in training of the exact nomenclature the student is being taught, you are into processing. Because you have departed from this. When you get somebody to define the word memory in the Academy, you is doin' wrong! Because that is not a Scientology technical word. You understand? The way you do clay table training is you take this word \"as-is\" because it's in an Axiom. You take this word \"Scientology\" and you take this word \"engram,\" you take this word \"facsimile,\" you under-stand? And you don't take such words as mind because that's a general term, not a Scientol-ogy particular term. So in training somebody on a clay table in Scientology you would only take up the particular terms of Scientology. It's just Scientology. And clay table training is entirely different than Clay Table Processing. Clay Table Processing is done, \"Yes, yes, yes, of course, all right. Represent the object.\" Session, see? Clay table training is, \"Make up the word 'Scientology' in clay.\" Maa, maa, maa, maa, so on and so on, makes a little blob and throws it down in the middle of the table and writes \"Scientology\" on the top of it. This is not an auditing session, this is a training session. He hasn't got an auditor, he's got a coach. And what does the coach say? The coach says, \"Flunk. Flunk.\" \"Well, I don't see why you're flunking me and so forth. I understand a glob of clay is Scientology and rrrrrr.\" \"Well, nevertheless I'm flunking you.\" [laughter] \"All right. Why are you flunking me?\" \"Look, I don't understand how that represents Scientology. Now, let's go at it again.\" The guy – so on, so on, so on, so on, so on, so on, he finally makes something – that's just a test of whether or not the coach understands it. Coach finally understands it, why, he figures out the guy probably understands it, so he says, \"All right, that's fine. Good.\" That's not an auditing session – training is mainly evaluation. In training you tell the guy what's wrong with him, in training you tell him what the definition is – not in auditing. Auditing is a different approach. We unfortunately are in two fields simultaneously, see, and we're asking the same guy that trains to also audit occasionally. Well, he's got to learn to shift his gears. An auditor never sits there and when the pc has got his representation of so-and-so and so-and-so the auditor never says \"Flunk.\" The auditor says, \"Fine, fine. I don't quite understand that. Could you show me a little more, tell me a little more about it?\" And of course, the thing shifts around, the guy realizes he hasn't done it. It's a different guiding principle entirely. All right, so teaching this psychologist what he missed in psychology, by definition of clay table work, is auditing, because you've immediately departed the field of Scientology, you got that? You're gone. So you're into an auditing session, you're on his backtrack, see, you're way over the hills and far away. So if you haven't got an auditing session going to han-dle this you're just going to lose him. All right, let's see what there is one is not capable of defining easily in psychology. And we'd audit this on the person. We could assign it to him as a self-auditing session but – and you would in PE.

You've seen them in PE. The right gear for the Instructor is, \"Sir, what – what – what similar field have you studied to Scientology?\" \"Oh, uh – well, uh – I had three years in psychology.\" \"Very good. Well, look, could – could we realize something here? That actually, it's – you're not having any difficulty with Scientology, you're having difficulty with psychology. Would you realize that please?\" It's a PE course. Now, a course can assign auditing. But it doesn't audit. \"All right, you've been in psychology. Very good. All right, now, could we re-quest, could we please request that you look up some of the words in psychology which you did not understand and write them down on a sheet of paper and go down to the local library and look the things up and see if you can't get that untangled.\" And you'll find out that handles it just like bang. You can be very polite about it. \"Now, for the minute can we lay that aside,\" you've already told him it was psychology he was upset about. \"Can we lay that aside now and get on with Scientology, which is really a different subject?\" And you're not going to hear another word out of that boy. You've as-signed him self-auditing, see, which is, \"Make a list of words you didn't understand and go and look them up.\" See, that's a self-audit. But you can assign him that. And you'll find out that forcefully shuts him up. And you no longer have to contend in a PE with the natterer. That ends him. This you do. Now, when I say a natterer I mean a person who's just consistently uncomfortable, who seems to be trying to – you can tell him, they say, \"Well, what does this have to do with theosophy?\" Well, man, ask yourself what – what good is it to know this point? This point has no validity, it tells you that he's stuck in theosophy, he hasn't understood telekinesis or some-thing, see. He's flying around on cloud ten. And I'd just take this boy who is busy nattering and \"wloo-wlff-wlaa I can't...\" and I that's... I'd just assign him that self-audit, see, like that, and the steps are very precise; they're not cloudy – is \"What similar field to Scientology have you been studying in the past?\" And he says, \"Well, I was in theosophy.\" \"All right, would you please realize that you're not really having any trouble under-standing Scientology, obviously, because I haven't taught you any. You must be having a great deal of trouble with theosophy and would you make a list of the words in theosophy which you did not understand and between now and the next time you come to class go down to the local library and look them up and get their definitions straight. Would you do that for me please? Thank you very much. Are there any more questions?\" That's a precise action, see. That runs off, brrrrrr – phonograph recordwise. And you'll find out that just handles that right now. All right now, let's differentiate between that bird, and the fellow who says, \"Scien... Scien... Scientology?\" Different time period, recognize it as such, this guy is dealing with a term right here in the course which you are teaching. He's dealing with that term right now and he's grappling with it, and he's trying to understand it and the answer to that again is a"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 6 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 420 HPCS one – two – three – four – just like this. You say, \"Now, what word have I used, sir, on this course, that you haven't understood?\" And he sits there and he thinks. \"Huh. Oh yeah – yeah, permissive. Yeah, what's permissive?\" You say, \"All right, it's an English word, it means without force, without duress, let him do as he pleases.\" \"Oh, is that what it means?\" \"All right, very good. All right, now let's get back to Scientology here.\" And he'll find out, \"Scientology, yeah, well, that's scio, yeah, I got that.\" You got it? See, that's a different drill. All you have to be able to differentiate is the difference between the bird who is saying nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah because he hasn't had time to gather this against Scientology so it must be against some other target. See, and the bird who is – who is trying to – trying to dig it. The bird who's trying to – trying to – trying to dig it up one way or the other. Got it? So there's two different reactions. Now, actually there's a third reaction, there's a third reaction that's very important – is the \"nodder.\" [laughter] Hasn't got a clue! And is just going on, you know, \"Yes, yes, yes.\" And the Instructor in a PE always overlooks this person. Because this person causes no trouble, this person is the perfect student. Could proba-bly put it all down on a piece of paper again too or something but really hasn't a clue. Now, we get over this in PE by asking for written illustrations of the points made. And this is the backflow which we should get. So they keep a sheet of paper, and during the term of the instruction there, periodically, every time you've made a big point, something like this, then they have to sit there for a very few minutes – don't make it too long – and scribble down an illustration of that point taken from existence, from real life. And this lets them participate and backflow. And at the end of that period of training, that is to say the evening instruction, at the end of the lecture and so forth, you get that back. You collect those papers and you'll be able to spot the nodder. Because they could tell you almost verbatim sometimes what you said, but to apply it or associate it to the real universe is quite beyond them, and you don't have to look at those papers very thoroughly. You just look them over for the reality of an example. Look at about the third example you have asked for. If it bears any resemblance whatsoever they're doing fine. The nodder will give you one that bears no resemblance; par-ticularly that deep into the hours of lecture. It will bear no resemblance. You've given them a big point here, you see. You've said that \"A thetan is taken from the Greek word theta which means thought. And the Greek word theta – out of the Greek let-ter theta stood for the Greeks for this thing thought. Now, give me an example from your ex-perience of the word thought.\" Well, \"worrying\" is good enough, see, so he writes down \"worrying\" or something like that. Well, they've got the idea, you see. The nodder will say \"being kind,\" or will say some-thing else that's... How, how...? All the Instructor would have to do is, \"How the devil does that exemplify it?\" And then having gotten that clue out of it you examine two or three others, and you've got this person cold. You'll find out that it's just a total unreality and they have not connected with something there somewhere; they're lost."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 7 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 421 HPCS So you write on the paper, \"Give me a list of the words you have not understood since the course began.\" And you take these, when you get these words back and so forth, you use that as your instructional or seminar type thing. It's the words they haven't understood. You simply redefine them, you simply define them again – you take it up. In other words, you just go in very heavy on the subject of words. You get the cycle here now? The person – all the students are asked to write down examples, and at the end of each period of training – such as an evening – you collect all those papers with the student's name and so forth on it, you see. And then the Instructor, all the Instructor has to do with these things is glance them over rather rapidly to see whether or not those examples are applicable and have anything to do with it, and if he finds anybody whose examples are just for the birds, then when he hands the papers back, why, he gives a special assignment to this person to write down all the words in the course which this person has not understood. That's just – that's your drill, see, that's the drill – zzzzzzt. Now, when you get that list back, you use such lists as that. You say, when do you do this? Well, you can actually skip a night or two with it, it doesn't matter, because this person's going to come back because they're waiting to hear about the rest of the assignment, see. And you take these words up. You'll find out that probably somebody else had a hazy idea of them, too. And this means that a PE course has one of these cracking, great, big, unabridged, two-ton dictionaries. Don't teach a PE course out of the Bible, teach it out of the dictionary. [laughter] And you'll find out that that'll be very successful; and you won't lose people. All you have to be is alert to this one point. It goes back to the first definition I gave you, and these are just the ramifications of what you do when you run into it, see. Be sure that every student understands every word he's given. And your very, very backward student has failed to under-stand a similar subject. The natterer, the guy who's going to give you trouble, and the person who's just having immediate trouble right here, right now, he's hung up on not the word he thinks he's hung up on. He's hung up on a word that happened just ahead of that word. And you've got to point this up to him. And he's got to give you what this is. You understand? It – he's not necessarily – you don't exp... you can get into just endless upset by con-tinuing to explain the word the student is asking about. Go ahead and explain it, but don't get to running on a treadmill on it because that isn't the word the student misunderstands. So you and the student have gotten into a gay minuet that had nothing to do with the ball. Because that student is hung up on this word because the student had an earlier word he didn't under-stand and that's why he can't get this word. And he isn't mentioning the earlier word because he hasn't noticed he didn't understand it. So you've got to point this point up. Do you see how this is taught, then? I notice some of you look a little blank. It's actually pretty easy. You've just got to be sure that you don't then ever get involved in one of these floor discussions with the PE course. The natterer is going to cut the whole class to ribbons and distract all this attention. The person who didn't understand this particular term that you're using, or principle, he probably goes over to an understanding, he didn't understand this concept. No, it is not a con-cept he didn't understand, it was a word. And he's going to talk and the Instructor is going to"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 8 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 422 HPCS ruin his vocal chords trying to explain this one concept or something to the student and the student doesn't understand it more and more and it gets more and more... Well, it will get more and more involved because that isn't what the student misunder-stood. It's something that happened just before that, that the student misunderstood. There's how you handle these various aspects and don't forget the nodder. All right. Now, you get a PE course rolling along, you just keep up this cycle, and as long as you're just teaching them very straight, highly defined Scientology, you're all right, you're all set. And you can just keep it rolling. Now, I will make this comment about a PE course. What would you think of some-body who told you to come to a course so that you could understand all about the automobile and of course you didn't know anything about an automobile, you'd really never seen one but you'd heard dimly about automobiles and you thought this was kind of an interesting subject. Something that ran along the ground at tremendous speeds. And you'd like to know more about this thing, and see if – this fellow said he was going to teach you a course and you were going to come in there and he was going to tell you all about this automobile. And so you happily went over to this course. And then he spent the next five nights telling you why you should know about this automobile. How do you like that? How good it was to know about automobiles or any other ramification. The direct forte is, of course, to know about an automobile. So in a PE you teach them about Scientology, not how good Scientology is or how bad Scientology is or arrrghorso whether Scientology's big or small or anything else. You teach him just about Sci-entology, see. And you're all set. Don't get into these other involved arguments. Look at this fellow who's going to teach you about the automobile and he gave you everything else. No, no. But look at how happy you would be with a course that was going to teach you all about the automobile, you didn't know anything about an automobile, you thought that was a good thing. So you go in, the Instructor says, \"Those are the front wheels, front wheels, they go around – wheels, see. And they go around and they got tires on them. And that travels over the ground and that cushions the shock and these are shock absorbers under here to keep the wheels from bouncing up the passenger too much and those are the back wheels and that is the bonnet. And that is the hood, see, and we're all set, see. And there's the engine, and this is the steering wheel.\" You'd be perfectly happy about it. You wouldn't even demand that he show you where the starter button was. You – he could keep you all involved with this. It's just with this – this is the automobile, this is how it runs. The engine goes around this way and it turns the wheels around that way and there's gears in there and here are the way the gears go and so forth. And you'd be very happy with that course, man. And he'd say, \"That guy sure teaches you about automobiles.\" \"Now,\" he says, \"Now, if you come back next week, I'll show you how to drive one.\" Brother, you'd be there! And when you arrive for the course about how to drive one he says, \"This is the starter button. This is the ignition key. There's the brakes. Here's the way you work the brakes. Now, get in there and work the brakes. Good. Turn on the ignition key on and off. Good. Work the brakes. Good. Turn the steering wheel. Good. Work the brakes.\""},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 9 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 423 HPCS You'd leave after some kind of – the first night or two of that kind of training, boy, you'd be pleased as punch. You'd say, \"Boy, right down there – know their business down there on the subject of automobiles. Next week, next week, I'm going to get a ride in one!\" Don't you see, right direct on the subject, right on the groove, see. Now, that has a tremendous liability to teach a course like that because, look, you're handing them nomenclature all the time, all the time, all the time. And it's terrible not to have nomenclature. Instead of cursing your Scientology nomenclature because of its numerous-ness, just thank God that you don't have to stand there tongue-tied. Now, how – how – how are you going to teach a fellow about automobiles if there is no word front wheel? Well, if you had no nomenclature for an automobile and you're going to teach somebody about auto-mobiles, you couldn't teach them any nomenclature and they could never communicate on the subject of automobiles. There's got to be nomenclature. But they've got to start out learning the language of an automobile. And although they were being taught all about an automobile they're actually in that first jump-off being taught the language of the automobile. Now, you – if you were teaching automobiles that way to a bunch of people that had never seen them or had much to do with them and so forth, if you could figure yourself down in the middle of the Congo or something like that and you were going to run this course on automobiles and so on, actually, you've just about got it taped because there you sit with an advanced technology that this civilization knows not what of or any part of it. And it's falling into problems consistently. And you're just all the same – in the middle of the Congo. And you're going to tell people, \"It's very nice to know about the mind.\" Hell, they know that. They know all about that. What about the mind? Well, it has parts; it runs on various rules. First place, you're not specializing in the mind, you're teaching them about the universe and you're teaching them about a being in the universe. And there's a body and there's walls and there's the planet and there's the sky and here's a being who lives in the midst of all this and we call him a thetan. See? And we just tape it, see, and never let him miss a definition, and you've got a PE course there that, well... I taught a PE course like this one time and I taught it sufficiently well that eighteen psychiatrists attended the first lecture, which was repetitive. In other words, I always gave the first lecture again every night and then gave an advanced lecture in another room. There weren't nobody being charged in the other room, but there were new people com-ing along all the time so I'd keep giving the first lecture. I always gave the first lecture. I'm not advising you to do this, it was just a freak of the situation. And then I'd give the people who had heard the first lecture the remaining lectures. And we had quite a few people there. But amongst them there were eighteen psychiatrists – nineteen. And they came to nothing but the first lecture. And they were some of the leading names in psychiatry, and they turned up just as regular as a clock every night, man, to hear that first lecture all over again. And they sat there, nodding, nodding; trying to figure it out. And one of them finally got into action on the subject, he took a dangerous schizo-phrenic and put him back into childhood using Dianetic techniques, and then instantly real-ized that we really had something in Dianetics, so with the person returned on the track, psy-"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 10 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 424 HPCS choanalyzed him. Told him, \"Now you know why you hate your father – he didn't change your diaper.\" Of course, I wouldn't say they had absorbed very much, but – but the funny part of it was, is it's simplicity that holds people. It's terrible simplicity. People do not like a totally new subject. They like the familiarity of the old and that isn't just because we're in England talking about English jokes. English jokes are partially nostalgia. It's a good – was a – been a good joke for a long time, he's glad to hear it again, see? But you get the idea. Yeah, I was looking at an old pal of ours, Frankie Howerd, on the TV the other night – he told the same jokes. I actually was very happy to sit there watching him tell the same jokes, you know. He's the bird that has the aged pianist who is hard of hearing and he makes cracks to the audience about his aged pianist. And she once in a while will comment to him that it's chilly in there and he will turn around and say, \"Yes, chilly. Poor old so-and-so.\" All a very 1.1 type of act, see. Well, he's been doing that just for years and years and years and years and he's a headliner. And I don't think he's had a new joke or a new line in all those times. Trouble with an American comedian, he knocks himself out all the time. That's why he passes into oblivion, too – he never develops a nostalgia. Now, here's an interesting point then. As long as you're teaching somebody absolu... something absolutely new, they're going to feel like they're in totally strange territory all the time, all the time and therefore, it's very, very strange to them. My apologies for the crack about English humor. I can always make the English laugh, I have no trouble with English humor. I've learned to wait. [laughter, laughs] Now, the public goes for and likes the old and what they like to see occasionally is just a little bit of improvement. They like to see a little bit of improvement on this old subject. They don't like new subjects. So you'd better represent Scientology as what it is, which is the only conservative study in the field of the mind. Truth of the matter is, when you look it over very carefully, a lot of things happened. Before I get too far ahead of my story, let me – let me give you what happens to these students who don't – let me – let me get that in because I might forget to tell you – the student that you don't handle as I've just described to you in PE will get the misunderstood – look at the cycle they run – see, the misunderstood word, the misunderstood concept, then they go into either the critical thought or the overt. And they will commit an overt against Scientol-ogy. And it gets all right to commit an overt against Scientology because that's the cycle. They have to justify not having understood. And that is what this is all about. It must be strange and they have to justify not having understood it and so they commit an overt against it. Shows that it's no good, do you see? So it's – they'll rig it that way, in spite of anything you can do, and then they go out and give you bad public presence. The second they don't understand that first word – the first word they don't understand is liable to start this cycle, so that is what you prevent. If you just prevent that all up on the line and they all go away feeling fine and everything's happy and so forth, and furthermore you're doing a more honest job and you're showing them exactly what they came in to find out – that you know the answer so you can do it."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 11 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 425 HPCS And let's see why psychology got off to a bad start. And this hooks in with what I was just giving you now. Scientology is the conservative study. It is the traditional study. It fol-lows the traditional patterns of philosophy, religion and the mind. It may be one of the rea-sons why your own interest in it is deep-seated, because you recognize in it the familiarities of ancient Greece. You recognize in it the philosophy of Rome, the philosophies of the Mid-dle Ages. The work of Saint Thomas Aquinas – all of this material as you roll on forward – faculty psychology. You'd feel very comfortable in amongst the big religious universities of 1500, 1550, with the faculty psychologist – that's the psychology of the faculties, of the senses and perceptions. Faculty used in the line of sense and perception. You'd feel very comfortable with these boys. You'd be talking about the same things, only you'd have answers to what they didn't have answers for and boy, they would fall around your neck like mad, because you'd be talking the familiar to them. They're talking about such things as attention. They're talking about such things as seeing. They're talking about such things as hearing. The faculties, you see. And they're talking about these things and how they relate to things – and sort of foggily. And of course, you could say to them, \"Why gentlemen, you're talking about communication. You're talking about communication between the indi-vidual and the physical universe around him or to other individuals through the medium of the physical universe. And therefore sight and sound and so forth are means of communication with the physical universe or with other people through the physical universe.\" And they would say, \"Holy smothering Godfrey, Gadzooks! By Jove, the chap's right! You know, that's true. Never realized that one person was ooowa and that's what perception is and that's what sound is and so forth; it's a method of communication.\" And you would have been right there, brother! But you can't talk to a psychologist about this. Do you know why you can't? Oh, the answer is absolutely fascinating. There isn't anybody there. There isn't anybody there. The whole universe and the people in it are sort of a delusion of machinery. In the absence of sen-sation and association there is no perception. That's a stable datum in the field of psychology, of circa 1960, 64. I know I've given you that and you've glanced over the top of it and you've said, \"Well,\" and so on, \"they're psychologists, so I don't have to understand it.\" No, I invite you to understand this. Perception depends completely upon sensation and association. And after you've looked that over for a little while you begin to feel sort of creepy as though somebody had walked over your grave. Because that tells you a volume. It says a machine in the absence of somebody tickling its gears, and in absence of cer-tain gears meshing with certain gears is incapable of noticing anything is happening. You see, perception depends upon sensation and association and that is the psychologist's definition of perception. Now, of course, you look at that as a Scientologist and you say, \"What the devil is go-ing on here? You mean I've got to have an association between a wfff and zfff before I can see a blap?\" No, that is not true. That is not true. But a machine – it would be true. A machine would have to have little cogwheels that wizzergoo'd with the cogwheels in order to tell you that the wizzergoo was on the other side of the wazzergoo and therefore it should take some notice."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 12 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 426 HPCS Knowledge is totally evolved out of the results of perception, but is individually evolved by a sort of a funny computer, that then tells a person what to perceive. By the time you've drawn this up on a drawing board you've got a machine and there's nobody there. You get what I'm talking about, don't you? I know – I – if you don't grasp it, don't blame yourself [laughter] because I frankly, the other night, spent over an hour looking at the words out of a text written by one of the leading God-help-us psychologist who – of the United States – on his definition of perception. And it was that sensation with association brings about percep-tion. And that was what perception was. And I looked at this and I looked at it and I looked at it. And I finally understood the frame of reference on which he was viewing this thing. And he's viewing it on the basis, you have to understand that a psychologist considers that everybody is a brain, a piece of meat, see, which vanishes with death and so forth. You have to understand all of these peculiar things. And then you understand what the devil this means. It means that once you've tickled the gears of the machine in some fashion or other and showed them which gears was being tickled, why, then it perceives what's tickling, see. It looks in that direction, but wouldn't otherwise. Of course, this absolutely violates your own concept of yourself You say, \"Before I can look at a field of hay I'd have to receive – have received a sensation from the field of hay and associated it with my childhood.\" Well, the reason you don't understand it easily is be-cause you wouldn't think of yourself as a machine. And naturally a machine – think of rolling a robot out there now. Now, you roll a robot out there and of course... field of hay, it'd have to have some kind of an associative memory situation, see. It's got a sensation of heat waves and some kind of a sensation of pattern, and that brings it up and so forth – and then the memory sorts out as the eons race around, and it finally associates this with fields and then with hay and then it says, \"Ah, a field of hay.\" And this to the psychologist is a man. Well, why does he think this way? Because he's a wild-eyed radical. He is the revolutionary; he's the Johnny-come-lately. Fifteen hundred and fifty, you would have been perfectly understood by the faculty psychologist in any great uni-versity of the world. He would have made much out of you, man. He would have had you out for tea and invited you to the – to the local hop and made much out of the situation. You walk into a modern classroom of today and you say \"perception is engaged upon by the being himself as a means of communication with the universe around him and other beings,\" they'd throw you out on your head. What do you mean? You have introduced voli-tion. You've introduced volitional and nonvolitional acts, to use a couple of fancy words. Acts that are willed, acts that are not willed. You have set up an individual as seeing what he wants to see and not seeing what he doesn't want to see. You have set up the whole mechanism of power of choice. And you have set up the dignity of the individual. And that they want noth-ing to do with, because they, of course, in not understanding man have gone the road of the overt. And that's why psychiatry cuts out brains. They've got to make nothing out of man be-cause they haven't understood him. And that is the whole genus of it, those poor luckless boobs.

They know their subject doesn't work. \"Us con men together, if we band together right and hold ourselves up high enough and sneer enough at anything else, we'll eventually be able to triumph over these poor boobs.\" Those are hard words, but I'm afraid that is the dominating idea. If you've talked to these birds as much as I have – I had an awful hard time understanding where comes this idea of this con-tempt? Where's this terrible contempt I see? What's the genus of this thing. What are these odd and peculiar ideas about man, the degrading aspect of them and so forth? This worried me frankly because they're dominating thought in the universities and schools of the world today. They're teaching everybody man's no good. He's just a machine. Well, naturally, your leaders of the world have got to have some kind of a philosophy of this character, they think. Look how dangerous this philosophy is, however. If you just ordered thirty million men killed, you want a philosophy that teaches you men are no good. Hm-mmm! You've got to justify that overt, man. If you're busy firing people and ruining peo-ple all over the place, why, naturally you've got to have some kind of a demon that stands alongside of you and says, \"It's perfectly all right, they're no good. Perfectly all right, they're no good.\" And they found their perfect demon in psychology and psychiatry. Man is no good. He's ninety-seven percent – cents' worth of chemicals. There is no dignity of the individual. The man has no power of choice. He has none of these things. He's not capable of personal volition; he's just a machine. You push a button with your modern advertising, he whirrs-clicks, reaches into his pocket and pulls out the sixpence. And it's perfectly all right to pull out the sixpence com-pletely illegally and fraudulently because actually, he's no good. And that's where you have to have a philosophy, you have to have a philosophy that man is no good in order to go on com-mitting overts. So it isn't that man has degraded. It's that man's mental subjects first didn't bother to understand anything about man and so then began to commit overts. And then employment was found for these blokes, by fellows who had to have their overts justified. And naturally, the guys who had to have their overts justified – the Hitlers, the other guys, the Stalins, the birds that have really backed up this particular field of psychology – naturally, these birds are going to put those fellows in the driver's seat. And so there's where the degradation of man comes from. Actually man is not more degraded than he was before. He's only degraded the mental sciences because he has departed from the traditional which had to do with the dignity of man. And you're in the tradition. It sounds wild. I've studied this very carefully. It's not some new con pitch I'm giving you. Our teachings and facts would have been revelatory, straight through from the ancient"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 14 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 428 HPCS medicine man through the wise man of Persia, through the philosophers of Greece, in the days of the first universities and so forth – that you called such around 1200 A.D., through all the great periods of the Renaissance and so forth. The ideas which we are moving along with and have – make no mistake about it – enormously improved and clarified are nevertheless those ideas. They had to do with attention, they had to do with perception, they had to do with power of choice. They had to do with the dignity of man, they had to do with the motivation of behavior. All of these things. And not on a vicious basis of how rotten and wicked every-body is and how they all ought to be shot down in their tracks. But just what's this all about. And we are to a marked degree preserving the dignity of man. And we're carrying forward on a basic tradition which has come up through the ages. But in 1879 in Bavaria, Leipzig University, a fellow by the name of Wundt must have fallen asleep in too damn many classes. And he missed the boat. And there are too many words he didn't dig. So he had to figure out that men were animals and that's exactly what he figured out. Men were animals. And he advanced this as a philosophy as recently as 1879. Completely departing, madly de-parting, from every traditional level of study there was in this field. And this was carried forward with great enthusiasm by the early Russian student in this field, and which culminated in Pavlov. Criticism of the Russian, circa 400 A.D., is that they made very good fighters because they became quite merciless and were – associated man with animals. And to them everything was animalistic. And therefore they could drive for-ward in an animalistic fashion. They thought of man as being animals. They thought of ani-mals as being animals. They lived amongst animals and so, therefore, their cavalry was pretty good and pretty vicious and so forth. These are commentaries on Russians, moving on for-ward. Same commentaries we hear occurring along about 1000. Same commentaries around Timur Lenk, around 1300. Same commentaries around Pavlov. The dog hasn't changed, his ears still flop. Yeah, that pattern hadn't changed at all. So Pavlov and psychiatry rushed on the scene. Man is an animal. Man is no lousy good. We should kill everybody. What you do with a city is level it until a pony will not even stumble being ridden at a full gallop across its ruins. What's the difference? There's no differ-ence. It's out of the steppes, straight on forward until now. They've always had the same idea that you could condition an animal. That if you beat a horse enough he would then do what he was supposed to do. Animal training. Pavlov. No difference. He just carried forward the Rus-sian tradition for animal training. Only this, my God, somebody accepts as a study of the human mind! Ha! Somebody must be in an awful need of justification for their overts. You see, it was always there to be bought. You always had the idea there that men were beasts and so forth. The idea was al-ways there to be purchased by anybody who wanted to purchase it, but it's interesting that it didn't get purchased until after 1879. Those are all Johnny-come-lately. You see the point I'm trying to make here? Well now, I don't think – I don't think the – Germans are okay, I use their Rolleis con-tinuously with great success and I wish they'd stay just building cameras and things like that. But the German has no enviable reputation for humanitarianism. I will say he has contributed music to the world, and that's dandy. But if he'd just stayed with music and cameras we'd all"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 15 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 429 HPCS be a lot better off. Every once in a while he gets careless with guns, and for some reason or other he's got to go out and kill everybody; for reasons best known to him. And he authored modern psychology. Modern psychiatry was authored by the Russian and modern psychology was authored by the \"Sherman.\" And by nobody else, don't let anybody kid you. That's ex-actly where they came from. You should read a Russian textbook on the subject of psychiatry. And every technique they know of in psychiatry is in a Russian textbook. Today, I will tell you, that when the czar went on the skids and lost his head, it was very interesting that the revolution began to frown on psychiatry. It was only Stalin and his fascist impulses and so forth which kept it going any length of time at all. And we have the completely weird subject of the Russian now having lived through all of these cycles of what we call modern psychiatry and now having nothing to do with it. So here's all the Western psychiatrists that come in, you know, with their hands drip-ping with blood, to this conference up in London the other day and the Russians standing around and saying, \"But we don't operate on people's prefrontal lobes anymore. But we don't give them electric shocks anymore. But we don't use these treatments anymore, because we found out they were ineffective. We don't do this anymore. We're good boys now,\" and so forth. And the Western psychiatrist saying, \"What's the matter with you jerks?\" you know, \"What's the matter with you guys?\" Well, what's the matter with these birds? These birds are now in a reform cycle. Too many overts. But that's where it came from. Pavlovian psychiatric responses. There's more to psychiatry than just Pavlov, of course, but not much. And that's a radical school. Those are both radical schools. You heard me say these things before, but I've never put it to you from the point of view that these are radical schools. Relatively uncivilized, rather degraded and very new. And they have not been productive of results. And my point of view is I think we should return to more traditional methods. I think these fellows have had their chance – they've had their revolution. And they didn't get anyplace with it. And I don't think that they should be permitted to stand in the road of traditional study in the field of philosophy or relig-ion or psychology of the field of the mind. And I don't even think they ought to be left with the word \"psychology\" because they can't define it. I think in actual fact that psychology is a portion of Scientology. And I see no reason to give psychology a modernistic, razzle-dazzle, mod-rocker spelling, like p-s-y-c-o-l-o-g-y, I should think it should be spelled properly, which is p-s-y-c-h-e-o-l-o-g-y. Psycheology. Put the \"e\" back in it. Of course, psyche means spirit. And is the Greek symbol for spirit. I don't know why we have a sudden psych, I don't know what this thing called psych that suddenly arose, that occurs in both psychiatry and psychology, because it doesn't mean anything and it never has meant anything. And they don't think it means anything, so forget it, skip it. Of course, we should return it to a more proper state. In other words, the familiar. And the old is really what we're studying. Somebody comes in to learn about the mind, you say, \"Very good. We're glad that you came in to learn about the mind. The whole field of the mind embraces, of course, the other fields of knowledge and the field of philosophy and that sort of thing. The field of philosophy,"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 16 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 430 HPCS religion and so forth, and a study of the mind is actually not too disassociated from a study of a human spirit. And we're glad you've come over here to study this because we're happy that people take interest in more traditional and conservative ways and we're happy to have people studying the more standard psychology. And you came here to learn about psychology, well, you came to the right place. Now, this is a body and this is the physical universe and you are an individual...\" You got the idea? \"And the eyes see, the ears hear...\" See, you teach them about the automobile. \"Now, why do the eyes see? Well, they don't see because somebody is a machine, they see because there's something there to be perceived. Now, the eyes can actually see by some-body putting something there to be perceived as well as something being there to be per-ceived. \"For instance, you simply – we don't now see this black crayon and we put it there to be perceived. Now, you think of a cat. Very good. Now, some of you got a picture of a cat. Well, you saw the cat, didn't you? Well, we won't worry about whether or not you saw that with the eyes or not because it really – it isn't absolutely necessary to have eyes to see.\" In other words, you see what kind of a PE you could conduct that would look a little bit different, wouldn't it? It wouldn't be \"Here's this great brand-new subject and it's all differ-ent and so forth and these conservative fellows who are there in the university and so forth, those are the fellows who are actually the authorities in the field and so on. And we're new, we're brand-new and we're doing something very, very strange and we're doing something very, very peculiar and ... These fellows object to us and they're just a bunch of bums really,\" see? That's – this is a different course. This is a different course. It says, \"Well, we're very glad you have come to the people who know about these things. And we're very glad that you have resumed a traditional study of this particular thing and are having done with radical approaches which have not resulted in any good effects. And you want to study the field of Scientology, of course, that's composed of philosophy, and re-ligion, psychology, what makes men do what they do, why men act the way they act, what life is all about. And you've come to the right place. Well, of course, you shouldn't mind being taught old answers along with new answers, and there's a great deal in Scientology that is new but the breakthrough is all in the traditional field, it's not a radical breakthrough.\" Where does that leave psychology? Where does that leave \"Old Man Wissergoo\" with the eighteen letters after his name as the head of the department of \"psyrology\" of Chicago University or Illinois University. What's that – where's that leave him? It leaves him in a gib-bering fit, that's where it leaves him. \"Well, Hubbard's done it again! This does about enough! Now, we're a part of Scientology! You know what that Hubbard's done? He said we're a part of Scientology. Isn't that terrible?\" And the public at large says, \"Well, really, are they?\" Be-cause they're all reasonable. And this is the way the wheel is going to turn. And the wheel has already begun its slow inexorable spin. They are about to become a more radical element of Scientology. And we're about to become the conservatives and they're about to become the revolutionaries. They're the Johnny-come-latelys, the cowboys in the black hat. And we're the old homestead-ers, been there a long time.

They will help us. In every university they will help us. They'll explain to all of their classes, \"Hubbard is crazy because he says actually Scientology is a very broad subject that psychology is just a part of, ha-ha-ha!\" None of the students are laughing. [laughter] Student can understand a radical offshoot, or a Johnny-come-lately type of an ap-proach that says all men are animals. \"Oh, yeah, that's – yeah, we understand that. That's German protocol, see.\" And the professor starts gibbering because he doesn't really dig how he would feather the wing straight in our direction. He couldn't serve us better than the way they will serve us. \"Yes, Hubbard has gone to the last straw now. Hubbard has gone to the absolute last straw. That's the – that's the end. That's it. Now, we are all part of Scientology and a very small part of it at that.\" [laughter] I can hear them now at a conference, you know, out in the anterooms. They gibber, you know, about some of the things we do. They have fits and so forth. They are – they're mad at us right now, you know, just for one reason, actually just one real reason that they're mad at us is everybody who is operating in an – charlatanism in the fie... as a charlatan in the field of the mind, is calling himself a Scientologist these days. They have not reached the – they have gone past the point of saying, you see, now, that we are bums. They're saying the reason we're bad is because other people can call themselves Scientologists. Other people who are bad can call themselves Scientologists. You get this? Well, that's – the American Medical Association Journal has made that rather astonishing remark very recently. Well, they know that man is no good because they can't do anything for him. An audi-tor who would have a hard time with people might wind up in this direction. You could ask why more auditors don't wind up embittered and mean and vicious and so forth. But they don't. So we must not have done too bad a job amongst ourselves in defining the parts of the mind and existence and the various words which are associated with it. We couldn't have done too bad a job amongst ourselves, because there's so many of us still here. And there's so many of us that have a kindly attitude toward man and so many of us that's – still capable of understanding. So we couldn't have done a very bad job, don't you see; proves itself. But because we are capable of understanding, and capable of making sense out of the problem, and capable basically of doing something about these various things, we of course, are in the favored posi-tion. And we don't really need to do anything very strange to make capital out of that favored position. We're in the favored position of the people who know how to do something about it, you see? We're in the favored position knowing our business. Well, knowing our business we of course would win over somebody that was just a fake and didn't know his business and didn't even know what his subject name meant. See, this is very easy. Well, the wheel is going to turn anyhow. The fun I get out of life is just making it turn now and then a little faster. I remember learning how to drive a Jaguar. You always take the Jaguar down the road, you never let the Jaguar take you down the road. And then you can drive a Jaguar. If you want"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 18 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 432 HPCS to ruin your driving sometime, why just try that. Just go out and practice taking the car down the road. Take – you take it around corners. You take it up the highway. You take it here, there and everyplace and it's very fascinating. Your driving goes all to pieces because the ma-chinery starts breaking up, don't you see? It's a, \"Now I'm going to turn this corner, yes, and I turn the corner, you know, and all right, now we're holding it on the straight, now just go straight, you know, hrrmmm, just straight. All right, now we're going to stop. Yes, and so on... and all of a sudden your machinery goes whoooo! I wouldn't try it in an exciting driving situation. [laughter] But after you've done it for a few days your driving improves enormously, and all of a sudden you realize that for years the car has been taking you everywhere, and all of a sudden you have a completely happy attitude toward cars and things; your whole driving aspect will change. So I don't like to just sit and watch the wheel take us someplace, don't you see, I like to also coax the wheel along. Well, there – although that's a very technical dissertation which I've given you along the line of PE, you wonder why I injected psychology and psychiatry into it to the degree I should – I probably should make my point with great clarity there, for people who are coming in to your PE and so forth have to some degree been reached or indoctrinated by this other field but are already dissatisfied by it and you don't have to curse very hard. But you have to know the relationship of psychiatry and psychology to the field of the mind and to the history of the mind. And their relationship is not different than I have told you, their relationship is very exactly what I have told you. This isn't just my idea of it. But they have given another facade. They have given the facade of \"We are the au-thorities and we are the conservatives and we are the big boys in this particular field.\" They're a lot of fakes. They're not. They're Johnny-come-latelys that are following a very, very radical line of thought, calculated to degrade man. So when your people come in for PE they are actually looking for something which is more relaxed, less degrading, which is better calculated to bring about a happy frame of mind toward existence and your best way of handling it, of course, is just tell them, \"Oh, you want to know about philosophy and religion and the mind and that sort of thing? Psychology? Well, we teach it here. You've come to the right place. And here is your first lesson.\" And the best you would do about psychology or psychiatry or something like that is explain occasion-ally to the student, patiently, perhaps even a little sadly, that there is a long tradition in the field of the mind which culminated with Scientology and that it is the longer, more conserva-tive tradition and there have been new discoveries in this tradition which revived it. And these discoveries were rather terrific, and they're very interesting. But they are discoveries in an old tradition. They are not discoveries in a new tradition. And that the old has enormously improved, improved enough to revive all over the place. And so we've got something that amounts now to a very good breakthrough, and therefore we needn't go off into radical lines. That's just cutting up people's heads and that sort of thing. Sounds rather barbaric to us. And discuss the relationship with the class, just to that degree, and from that particular viewpoint. And you would find out they'd be with you all the way. You see, man is basically good, you can do something about the situation. People become better people when"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 19 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 433 HPCS you handle their problems and aberrations. All the various things which you know about Sci-entology, they all fit into this frame of reference. Scientology is not an effort to degrade man. The student would very shortly recognize this and he wouldn't even have to have it pushed to him very hard by the very definitions and Axioms and things like that which were being given to him. He would recognize very clearly what he was looking at. And then, if you never let one of those PE people get away with a misunderstood word, then you have not started a germ of revolution against man. Not against Scientology, but a revolution against man himself. Disgust with man. But more intimately to you, dis... upset about Scientology. They'd just stay with you because, you see, their best reasons they would stay with you is there is something there to know. We can do things, you see, there's all the good reasons why they should, you see. So the fact that they don't is really unreasonable. And that unreasonability comes from the early word which is not defined. And where a fellow is incapable of studying Scientology as a subject or confronting it – he just comes around to mock it or something like that – you must realize that that person has already been in trouble with another associated subject earlier and you've got to handle him, then you've got to handle the fellow who – not get involved all the time with the fellow who doesn't understand what you're saying. Don't get involved with him to the degree that you're trying to explain what he's asking about all the time. No, do it once, explain to him once what you're – what you're talking about. Explain to him carefully. That doesn't handle it, all right. Right away you know that there was an earlier word which he didn't understand and you ask him for that earlier word. \"What word have I used – what word has been used here that you didn't understand?\" And he says, \"Uh – clay.\" \"Well, what about clay?\" \"Well, in Kindergarten they called it Plasticine and clay's different. This is messed up, see, because uh – clay – why do you say 'clay'?\" Well, there's a pat explanation for that, too. \"Plasticine is a trademarked word which you would be forbidden to use if you did use it, but clay will always be with us, and many substitutes for clay will come and go, so we just use the basic word.\" All right, this clarifies it for him and he says, \"Cheers, oh – uh – that's the way it is. All right. Cheers!\" See, let's go on with it, see? But you'll always find the fellow who persistently can't understand what you're talking about, you see. You try to explain it to him and he can't grasp it and so forth. Well, you could keep this up, you see, for the next half-hour of class time with no production. What you've got to find is the word he didn't understand just before that and handle that situation. You will find that word, explain that word and go on. And then don't forget your nodder and catch that nodder with the – the write-back. \"Give us an example. Give us an example of what I've just told you.\" Then look over those papers and you'll find the nodder, sitting there, but not a clue. And that person you'll also lose eventually or overwhelm completely."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 20 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 434 HPCS And the subject matter of a PE is under development at this particular time, and I can't give you the entire rundown of a PE, but I am giving you as much of the PE as I consider very solid ground and very solid form for PE at the present moment. I'm not talking to you about what words to teach, I'm just talking to you if they came there to learn about the field of the mind and the spirit and philosophy you jolly well better teach them about the mind and the field and philosophy, and not tell them why they should know about the mind and the field and philosophy cause they already decided that. So, you just go rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat, and if you treated the PE as an area where they learned the language and they learned the parts of things, and they learned the nomencla-ture of things, and they learned what was there, these are all the same things, don't you see? You can't show a fellow a front wheel and say the word of this is \"front wheel\" with also showing him the fact that there was a front wheel there, see? You know, he's got to have ap-preciated the existence of the front wheel as well as the definition of the words \"front wheel.\" So you get these two things in good balance and all of a sudden these people will come up smiling. And believe me, this is a very successful line of teaching, because there are many people – read some of the earlier texts on Dianetics and Scientology, understood them with great clarity and recovered in some cases from very serious illnesses, just by clarification of existence. So if your end product there in the PE was a clarification of existence by the demon-stration and teaching them nomenclature in a new language so they could talk along this line, if that was all you succeeded in doing, providing you left not one student with a word im-properly defined, then you would have succeeded all the way. And your batting average would be not 10 percent or 5 percent in PE in organizations and in private practices, but it would be much closer to 98 percent. There'd be the lady who fell off the bridge and broke her leg and couldn't come back to the PE course. She would happen every once in a while. But – so it couldn't be a 100 percent, but it could be awfully close – be awfully close to a 100 per-cent, it would wind up at the end of that week with you. Now, any PE that you have ever run or any course you have ever run or any series of talks you have ever given that found less people attending than attended the first night is as-signable, not to your diction, not to whether you wore a blue dress or a green one, not to whether or not the surroundings were easy to reach and attractive: all of these things are be-side the point. The people that didn't wind up with you the second night missed a word. They didn't get the word. They missed a word, that's all. They missed something. They heard this – they heard this word, \"overt acts,\" and they couldn't get it and they didn't hear it, and they did hear it but they didn't hear it, and they don't know what this thing is and they just don't wrap their wits around it and they don't come back the next night. But now, because they haven't misunderst... they haven't understood – they haven't gotten this word you see, now they don't understand the subject. And not understanding the subject it's perfectly all right for them to perform overt acts against Scientology. And if there's any hostility against Scientology in the world it's derived from that point. See? So we therefore are actually, building our own opposition to this degree. I've just given your orders for America on the subject of, \"Don't leave anybody over there who has any"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"THE PE COURSE 21 SHSBC-400 – 1.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 435 HPCS words misdefined on the subject of Scientology and that's your campaign. And you'll find out that's going to make a big difference.\" But those are the concentrations and the points of PE, and that's what kind of a course they're attending. They're attending it – rather a traditional course that has a great many new developments in an old and conservative line. You know, they're taking a course at Rolls Royce. Now, they could go and get one of these two-bit, cut-rate courses, you know, down there at Alabama University but well, it's much better that they came to you. More traditional. Longer, harder, but more traditional. You have to be able to confront better to take a course like this, you see. You can't dodge around the back of the thing and say, \"Well, we don't know what the word 'Scientology' means. Uh – we don't know what that is. And uh – however we're going to teach you about the left foot. And we're going to teach you pedagogy, mixed up slightly with pediatrics. And then if we have any time left at the end of the week and so forth why we'll get into pedantics.\" Well, of course, the poor student who has enrolled and has got to have a degree and a career at the end of the line and so forth has no choice. He can't walk out of a university. But that's what makes it different from your PE course, you see, they can walk out of your PE course if they don't like it. They can't walk out of a university. So actually what they do is force people to go ahead and study these subjects through to the bitter end till they're in such a state of committing overts that nobody is safe with them. I would just as soon open up a lion's cage and throw a patient into it as I would to let them go near an institution anywhere in the world today. You think it over. At least it would be over with rather quickly in the lion's cage. But if you look at this as a point of view or a representation where the public is con-cerned and their first entrance course the PE, I think you would find it extremely successful. Now, you've looked on yourself as a ruddy revolutionary. Yes, you're a revolutionary against the revolution. You have been revolting against the revolution. But we hadn't clearly recog-nized that we were revolting against a revolution and it was a revolution had occurred. And it occurred in 1879. And that there was a traditional course of study which was going on and in which discoveries could be made. I entered back into that field. My own training is very severely in the more traditional lines of philosophy. It's interesting that there isn't even a degree, did you know this, there isn't even a degree for psychology. At least they've been that cautious, haven't they? There's only a degree in philosophy. And we are definitely in the field of philosophy. This is more germane, then, to what the public wants to know. They want to know how to live better lives, they want to know what existence is all about, so forth. So teach a straightforward course, teach them all the definitions of these things, teach them what exis-tence is all about, wind it up at the end, they'll be very happy with you and very keen to get back next week, because then they get to start the motor. And you'd have a very, very suc-cessful PE. Okay? Audience: Yes. Thank you very much.

The being didn't understand something because a word or symbol was not understood. Thus all caved-in conditions, illness, etc, can be traced back to a misunderstood sym-bol, strange as that may seem. It goes like this: 1. A being doesn't get the meaning of a word or symbol. 2. This causes the being to misunderstand the area of the symbol or word (who used it whatever it applied to); 3. This causes the being to feel different from or antagonize toward the user or whatever of the symbol and so makes it all right to commit an overt; 4. Having committed the overt, the being now feels he has to have a motivator and so feels caved in. This is the stuff of which Hades is made. This is the trap. This is why people get sick. This is stupidity and lack of ability. This is why Clay Table Auditing works."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"OVERTS, WHAT LIES BEHIND THEM? 2 HCOB 8.09.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 437 HPCS Clearing a pc then consists only of locating the area of the motivator, finding what was misunderstood and getting the word made into clay and explained. The overts blow. Pure magic. The trick is locating the area where the pc has one of these. This is discussed further in Saint Hill lecture of 3 Sept 1964, but is too important a discovery to leave only in tape form. The cycle is Misunderstood word or symbol – separation from ARC with the things associated with the word or symbol – overt committed – motivator felt necessary to justify the overt – decline of freedom, activeness, intelligence, well being and health. Knowing this and the technology of auditing one can then handle and clear these sym-bols and words and produce the gains we have described as being clear, for the things causing the decline are cleared out of the being.

And that R6 materials are suffering from the same fate when meter activ-ity lessens. It's this way: The student runs across a word he or she doesn't understand. He or she looks it up in a dictionary, finds a substitute word and uses that. Of course the first word is still misunderstood and remains a bother. Example: (Line in text) \"The size was Gargantuan.\" Student looks up Gargantuan, finds \"Like Gargantua, huge.\" Student uses \"huge\" as a synonym and reads the text line \"The size was 'huge'.\" A short while later is found still incapable of understanding the paragraph below \"Gargantuan\" in the text. Conclusion the student makes – \"Well it doesn't work.\" The principle is that one goes dull after passing over a word one does not understand and brightens up the moment he spots the word that wasn't grasped. In actual fact, the bright-ening up occurs whether one defines the word or not. But to put another word in the place of the existing word, whether in Level 0 or Level VI is to mess it all up. Take the above example. \"Huge\" is not \"Gargantuan\". These are synonyms. The sen-tence is \"The size was Gargantuan.\" The sentence was not \"The size was huge.\" You can't really substitute one word for another at Level 0 or Level VI and get anything but an altera-tion. So something remains not understood at Level 0 and the meter stops at Level VI. It just isn't what was said or thought. The correct procedure is to look over, get defined well and understand the word that was used. In this case the word was \"Gargantuan\". Very well, what's that? It means \"Like Gar-gantua\" according to the dictionary."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"WORDS, MISUNDERSTOOD GOOFS 2 HCOB 10.3.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 441 HPCS Who or what was Gargantua?

In one mass experiment the following, given for illustration here, occurred. A class of 15 on Dianetics, taught with all Course Supervisor policy fully applied, the students not pre-selected for aptitude, 7 had attained full HDG with all auditing well dones and very well dones in just under three weeks. The remainder were mixed with a part-time Dianetics class (31/2 hours of study a day) of over a hundred people. In the following three months only two had graduated. Most of the remainder were only on their first time through at the end of three months.

A qualified Course Supervisor and staff were placed in charge and the large course began to graduate three a day almost at once.

In THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES we find on page 25 Remedy A and Remedy B. These two remedies are A and B because they handle a primary source of worry to supervisors and auditors. AUDITING STYLE Each level has its own basic auditing style. The Auditing Style of Level II is Guiding Style. The Secondary Style is Guiding Sec-ondary Style or Guiding S Style. ASSISTS An assist is different from auditing as such in that it lacks any model session. Assists are normally short periods of auditing but not always. I have seen a touch assist go on for months at the rate of 15 minutes a day, two or three days a week. And it may take hours to do a touch assist on an accident victim. What characterizes an assist is that it is done rapidly and informally and anywhere. \"Coffee Shop Auditing\" isn't really an assist as it is usually done over coffee too casu-ally to be dignified by the name of auditing. The pc is never informed at all of the existence of a session. The pc, in an assist, is however informed of the fact and the assist is begun by \"This is the Assist\" and ended by a \"That's it\", so an assist, like a session, has a beginning and an end. The Auditor's Code is observed in giving an Assist and the Auditing Comm Cycle is used."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 2 HCOB 21.2.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 445 HPCS As an Auditor one sets out in an Assist to accomplish a specific thing for the pc like relieve the snivels or make the ache in the leg better. So an Assist also has a very finite pur-pose. SECONDARY STYLES Every level has a different primary Style of Auditing. But sometimes in actual ses-sions or particularly in Assists this Style is altered slightly for special purposes. The Style altered for assists is called a Secondary Style. It doesn't mean that the primary style of the level is merely loosely done. It means that it is done a precise but different way to accomplish assists. This variation is called the Secondary Style of that level. REMEDIES A Remedy is not necessarily an Assist and is often done in regular session. It is the Remedy itself which determines what auditing style is used to administer it. Some Remedies, as well as being used in regular sessions, can also be used as Assists. In short, that a process exists as a Remedy has no bearing on whether it is used in an Assist or a Model Session. GUIDING STYLE The essence of Guiding Style is: 1. Locate what's awry with the pc. 2. Run a Repetitive Process to handle what's found in 1. In essence – steer the pc into disclosing something that needs auditing and then audit it. GUIDING SECONDARY STYLE Guiding Secondary Style differs from proper Guiding Style and is done by: 1. Steering-the pc toward revealing something or something revealed; 2. Handling it with Itsa. Guiding Secondary Style differs from Guiding Style only in that Guiding Secondary Style handles the matter by Steer + Itsa. Guiding Style Proper handles the matter with Steer + Repetitive Process."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 3 HCOB 21.2.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 446 HPCS DEFINITIONS PROCESSING Definitions Processes, when used as Remedies, are normally processed by Guiding Secondary Style. Both Remedies of The Book of Case Remedies A and B are Guiding Secondary Style in their normal application. One would expect them to be used by a Class II Auditor. One would expect the Assist to last 10 or 15 minutes, perhaps more, but less than a regular session would take. One would expect that any case in a PE class, any student that was getting nowhere, would be handled by the Instructor with Guiding Secondary Style using Remedies A and B as precision processes. REMEDY A PATTER One would not expect the person or student in trouble to be turned over to another stu-dent for handling. It's too fast, sharp and easy to handle that trouble oneself if one is Class II or above and far more certain. You can do it while you'd be finding another student to do the auditing. It would be uneconomical in terms of time not to just do it right then – no meter – leaning up against a desk. The auditor's patter would be something like what follows. The pc's responses and Itsa are omitted in this example. \"I am going to give you a short assist.\" \"All right, what word haven't you understood in Scientology?\" \"Okay, it's pre-clear. Explain what it means.\" \"Okay, I see you are having trouble, so what does pre mean?\" \"Fine. Now what does clear mean?\" \"Good. I'm glad you realize you had it mixed up with patient and see that they're different.\" \"Thank you. That's it.\" In between the above total of auditing patter, the student may have hemmed and hawed and argued and cognited. But one just steered the pc straight along the subject selected and got it audited and cleaned up. If the student gave a glib text book definition after chal-lenging the word preclear, we wouldn't buy it, but would give the student a piece of paper or a rubber band and say \"Demonstrate that.\" And then carry on as it developed. And that would be Remedy A. You see it is precision auditing and is a process and does have an Auditing Style. And it works like a dream. You see this is Steer + Itsa as to its style. And that it addressed the immediate subject. What makes A Remedy A is not that it handles Scientology definitions, but that it handles the immediate subject under discussion or study."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 4 HCOB 21.2.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 447 HPCS REMEDY B What makes Remedy B Remedy B is that it seeks out and handles a former subject, conceived to be similar to the immediate subject, in order to clear up misunderstandings in the immediate subject or condition. Remedy B, run on some person or student, would simply be a bit more complex than Remedy A as it looks into the past. A person has a continuous confusion with policy or auditors, etc. So one runs B like this (the following is auditor patter only): \"I'm going to give you an Assist. Okay?\" \"All right. What subject were you mixed up with before Scientology?\" \"I'm sure there is one.\" \"Okay. Spiritualism. Fine. What word in Spiritualism didn't you understand?\" \"You can think of it.\" \"Good. Ectoplasm. Fine. What was the definition of that?\" \"All right, there's a dictionary over there, look it up.\" \"I'm sorry it doesn't give the spiritualist definition. But you say it says Ecto means outside. What's plasm?\" \"Well, look it up.\" \"All right. I see, Ecto means outside and plasm means mould or covering.\" (Note: You don't always break up words into parts for definition in A & B Remedies.) \"Yes, I've got that. Now what do you think spiritualists meant by it?\" \"All right, I'm glad you realize that sheets over people make ghosts ghosts.\" \"Fine, glad you recalled being scared as a child.\" \"All right, what did the spiritualist mean then?\" \"Okay. Glad you see thetans don't need to be cased in goo.\" \"All right. Fine. Good. You had Ectoplasm mixed up with engrams and you now realize thetans don't have to have a bank and can be naked. Fine. That's it.\" (Note: You don't always repeat after him what the pc said, but sometimes it helps.) Student departs still cogniting. Enters Scientology now having left Spiritualism on the back track. Doesn't keep on trying to make every HCO Bulletin studied solve \"Ectoplasm\", the buried misunderstood word that kept him stuck in Spiritualism. DEFINITIONS PURPOSE The purpose of definitions processing is fast clearing of \"held down fives\" (jammed thinking because of a misunderstood or misapplied datums) preventing someone getting on with auditing or Scientology. Remedies A and B are not always used as Assists. They are also used in regular ses-sions. But when so used they are always used with Guiding Secondary Style – Steer + Itsa. As a comment, people who seek to liken Scientology to something, \"Oh, like Christian Science,\" are stuck in Christian Science. Don't say, \"Oh no! It isn't like Christian Science!\" Just nod and mark them for a fast assist or a session the moment the chance offers if they seem very disinterested or aloof when asked to a PE Course. There's weapons in that arsenal, auditor. Use them. As Remedies A and B stand as the first and second given in THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES, so before a large number of potential Scientologists stands the confusion of defini-tions."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 5 HCOB 21.2.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 448 HPCS We have made Scientology definitions easy for them by compiling a dictionary, using words new to people only when useful. But those that don't come along at all, are so wound up in some past subject they can't hear or think when that earlier subject is restimulated. And that earlier subject is held down only by some word or phrase they didn't grasp. Some poor pawn howling for the blood of Scientologists isn't mad at Scientology at all. But at some earlier practice he got stuck in with mis-definition of its terms. You see, we inherit some of the effects of the whole dullness of Man when we seek to open the prison door and say, \"Look. Sunshine in the fields. Walk out.\" Some, who need Remedy B say: \"Oh no! The last time somebody scratched the wall that way I got stupider.\" Why say, \"Hey. I'm not scratching the wall. I'm opening the gate\"? Why bother. He can't hear you. But he can hear Remedy B as an assist. That's the channel to his comprehension. UNDERSTANDING When a person can't understand something and yet goes on facing up to it, he gets into a \"problems situation\" with it. There it is over there, yet he can't make it out. Infrequently (fortunately for us) the being halts time right there. Anything he con-ceives to be similar presented to his view is the puzzle itself (A=A=A). And he goes stupid. This happens rarely in the life of one being, but it happens to many people. Thus there aren't many such messes in one person in one lifetime that have to be cleaned up. But there are a few in many people. The cycle of Mis-definition is: 1. didn't grasp a word, then 2. didn't understand a principle or theory, then 3. became different from it, commits and committed overts against it, then 4. restrained himself or was restrained from committing those overts, then 5. being on a withhold (inflow) pulled in a motivator. Not every word somebody didn't grasp was followed by a principle or theory. An overt was not committed every time this happened. Not every overt committed was restrained. So no motivator was pulled in. But when it did happen, it raised havoc with the mentality of the being when trying to think about what seem to be similar subjects. You see, you are looking at the basic incident + its locks as in a chain of incidents. The charge that is apparently on the lock in present time is actually only in the basic incident. The locks borrow the charge of the basic incident and are not themselves causing anything. So you have a basic misunderstood word which then charges up the whole subject as a lock; then a subject charging up similar subjects as locks."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 6 HCOB 21.2.66 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 449 HPCS Every nattery or non-progressing student or pc is hung up in the above 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cy-cle.

If natter, no progress, etc, is continuous and doesn't cease when all is explained in Scientology or when attempts to straighten up Scientology words fail, then it's an earlier subject at fault. Hence, Remedies A and B. Hence Guiding Secondary Style. Hence, the fact that Definitions Processes are proc-esses. And vital processes they are if one wants a smooth organization, a smooth PE, a smooth record of wins on all pcs. And if one wants to bring people into Scientology who seem to want to stay out. Of course these Remedies A and B are early-on processes, to be audited by a Class II or above on a Level 0 or I pc or student. However, some in Scientology, as of this date, are studying slowly or progressing poorly because A and B haven't been applied.

Remimeo (Corrections in this type style.) Study Series 2 CONFRONTING The first requisite of any subject is the ability to confront the various components (things) (parts) (divisions) of the subject itself. All misunderstoods, confusions, omissions, alterations of a subject begin with failures or unwillingness to confront. The difference between a good pilot and a bad pilot depends of course on consistent study and practice, but underlying this, determining whether the person will study and prac-tice, is the ability to confront the components of study and airplanes. A \"quick study\", by which is meant a student who learns rapidly or a person who grasps a subject quickly, has a high ability to confront that subject. In a dramatic profession, the wild animal trainer who could confront wild animals re-mained alive. The one who couldn't confront was too slow of perception to live long. In a more common line of work, the fast typist could confront study and typing in the first place and the slow typist couldn't and can't. The confusions about \"talent\" and \"native ability\" and such are resolved to no small extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront. Basically, if one can just be there with it, he can then achieve the skill of communicat-ing with whatever \"it\" is and handling it. Thus, before communicating with the components of a subject can properly begin, one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject. All power depends upon the ability to hold a location. To communicate one must be able to hold to a location. This is even true in the physical universe. You can't move a chair unless you can hold a position yourself near the chair. If you don't believe it, try it."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 2 HCOB 2.6.71 I PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 451 HPCS Thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle. But before one can communicate with something one must be able to be in a location near it. The age-old puzzle of how some scholars can get \"A\" on a subject they have studied and then not be able to apply even a scrap of the data is resolved by this fact of confronting. They can confront the book, the class and the thought. But they haven't attained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject. At least such \"glib\" students can confront the book, the paper, the thought. They are partway there. Now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which the subject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know. Some people are not so lucky as to be \"glib\" students. They have to work up to \"being there\" with the book, paper, classroom and teacher. Thus \"confronting\" is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive. Amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this. Dullness, percep-tion trouble, fogginess, sleep and even pains, emotions and convulsions can occur when one knowingly sets out to be there and comfortably perceive with the various parts of a subject. These reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres (continues) and at last, some-times soon, sometimes after a long while, one can be there and perceive the component. As one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront other compo-nents. People have mental tricks they use to get around actual confronting—to be disinter-ested, to realize it's not important, to be sort of half dead, etc—but these discharge (run out) as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortably perceive. Eye blinks, swallows, twitches, aches, pains, are all systems of interrupting confront-ing and are the symptoms of discomfort. There are many of these. If they are present then one is not just being there and perceiving. Confronting on a via (using a relay point) is another method of ducking out of it. The worst off cannot even tolerate the idea of being there and perceiving anything. They run away, even go into emotional fits rather than be there and perceive. Such people's lives are a system of interruptions and vias, all substitutes for confronting. They are not very successful. For success in life depends not on running away from it but by being there and perceiving it and then being able to communicate with it and handle it.

Anyone can do anything forever unless he begins to stop it. \"Invalidation\" means a refuting or degrading or discrediting or denying something someone else considers to be a fact.

For some reason Dianetics and Scientology words are more easily grasped than simple English. Words like \"a\", \"the\", \"exist\", \"such\" and other \"everybody knows\" words show up with great frequency when doing a Method 2 Word Clearing. They read. It takes a BIG dictionary to define these simple words fully. This is another oddity. The small dictionaries also suppose everybody knows. It is almost incredible to see that a university graduate has gone through years and years of study of complex subjects and yet does not know what \"or\" or \"by\" or \"an\" means. It has to be seen to be believed. Yet when cleaned up his whole education turns from a solid mass of question marks to a clean useful view. A test of schoolchildren in Johannesburg once showed that Intelligence decreased with each new year of school!

Take \"economics\" for example. The subject of psychology began its texts by saying they did not know what the word means. So the subject itself never arrived. Professor Wundt of Leipzig University in 1879 perverted the term. It really means just \"a study (ology) of the soul (psyche)\". But Wundt, working under the eye of Bismarck, the greatest of German military fascists, at the height of"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"SIMPLE WORDS 2 HCOB 6.9.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 459 HPCS German war ambitions, had to deny Man had a soul. So there went the whole subject! Men were thereafter animals (it is all right to kill animals) and Man had no soul, so the word psy-chology could no longer be defined. The earliest misunderstood word in a subject is a key to later misunderstood words in that subject. \"HCOB\" (Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin), \"Remimeo\" (Orgs which re-ceive this must mimeograph it again and distribute it to staff), \"TR\" (Training Drill), \"Issue I\" (first issue of that date), are the commonest misunderstoods. Because they occur at the begin-ning of an HCOB! Then come words like \"a\", \"the\" and other simple English as the next words that often read. In studying a foreign language it is often found that the grammar words of one's own language that tell about the grammar in the foreign language are basic to not being able to learn the foreign language. The test of whether the person understands a word is \"does it read on the meter as a fall when he reads the word in the material being cleared\". That a person says he knows the meaning is not acceptable. Have him look it up no matter how simple the word is. L.

The misunderstood word is looked up in the dictionary and the meaning read out loud and they tell you what the word means so that they know it without again referring to the dictionary. Then the word is used in several sentences which clearly indicate that it consults their understanding. Words sometimes have different or more than one meaning. You have to know every different meaning so all definitions are looked up and the word is fully defined. You also must choose the definition in use in the sentence so that the materials are un-derstood. THE ALPHABET Knowledge of the alphabet is the key to finding words quickly. The alphabet must be known cold. The Word Clearer who has to figure out which letter comes first, M or N or U or V, wastes many precious minutes which add up to many wasted hours. Words are arranged in alphabetical order in all dictionaries. All words beginning with the letter A would be in the first section, all words beginning with the letter B in the second section, and so on. Within these sections the words themselves are arranged so that each sec-ond letter in the word is in alphabetical order. (For example, the word fall precedes the word few, which precedes the word field, etc.) Near the top of each page, printed in bold type, are the first word and the last word on the page (in very large dictionaries it's every two columns). You can use this as a guide to quickly find the page that contains the word you are looking for. HOW TO BREAK UP A WORD Many words are in a combined form and by separating the word you can look up each part in the dictionary. By doing this, the meaning of the word often becomes clearer. Take the"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"HOW TO USE A DICTIONARY 2 BTB 4.09.71R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 461 HPCS word Theo-logy. The first part, Theo- means god or gods and the second part of the word, -logy means discourse or expression or the science, theory or study of. When you put the two parts together, you have the science, theory or study of god. Sometimes in combining forms of words, a letter is changed, as in the word in-dividu(e)-ate. LOOK UP WORDS IN THE DEFINITION Many times when looking up a word, you will find in its definition other words which need to be looked up in order to understand the meaning of the original word. Therefore, each word given in the definition must also be clearly defined and understood so that there are no underlying misunderstood words on the word you are looking up. Large child's dictionaries are good as the definition words are simple. The so-called \"Merriam Webster\" dictionaries in the U.S. are almost useless and give out more misunderstoods in definitions than they clarify in clearing, don't bother with them. The World Book Dictionary available from Field Enterprises Educational Corporation, Mer-chandise Mart Plaza, Chicago, Illinois, 60654, U.S.A. is a huge and very good child's diction-ary. In the U.K. the 18 volume Oxford series are good. USE A BIG ENOUGH DICTIONARY The smaller dictionaries (paperback or junior) seldom contain complete definitions of a word. Sometimes a most vital part of a definition is omitted. This can involve running around to look for another dictionary or missing the real meaning of the word. So always use a big enough dictionary. GET THE WORD USED IN SENTENCES AS LONG AS IT HAS TA The word, when it reads on the meter, is used over and over in sentences until it has no more TA. It doesn't matter if the word was looked up in the dictionary as the word will still read if the word is misunderstood. The dictionary usually has several examples of use. These are not enough. The person has to make up several of his own before he really knows the word. Words of a special tech require a dictionary of it if possible. Many students have been or are engaged in technical professions outside of Scientol-ogy such as engineering, computer programming, architecture, etc, and you will need a glos-sary or dictionary of the terms involved in these technologies.

They are three different sets of symptoms. ____________________ (1) Education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved is very hard on the student. It actually makes him feel squashed. Makes him feel bent, sort of spinny, sort of dead, bored, exasperated. If he is studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent this will be the result. Photographs help and motion pictures would do pretty good as they are a sort of prom-ise or hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not a substitute for a tractor if he's studying about tractors. You have to understand this data in its purity – and that is that educating a person in a mass that they don't have and which isn't available produces physiological reactions. That is what I am trying to teach you. It's just a fact. You're trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and you're not giving him any trac-tors – well he's going to wind up with a face that feels squashed, with headaches and with his stomach feeling funny. He's going to feel dizzy from time to time and very often his eyes are going to hurt. It's a physiological datum that has to do with processing and the field of the mind. You could therefore expect the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field of education most devoted to studying absent masses."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"BARRIERS TO STUDY 2 HCOB 25.6.71R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 465 HPCS This one of studying the something without its mass ever being around produces the most distinctly recognizable reactions. If a child felt sick in the field of study and it were traced back to this one, the positive remedy would be to supply the mass – the object or a reasonable substitute – and it would clear it up. ____________________ (2) There is another series of physiological phenomena that exist which is based on the fact of too steep a study gradient. That's another source of physiological study reaction because of too steep a gradient. It is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness that goes with this one. You've hit too steep a gradient. There was too much of a jump because he didn't understand what he was doing and he jumped to the next thing and that was too steep and he went too fast and he will assign all of his difficulties to this new thing. Now differentiate here – because gradients sounds terribly like the 3rd one of these study hang-ups, definitions – but remember that they are quite distinctly different. Gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang over into the field of understanding. In gradients however it is the actions we are interested in. We have a plotted course of forward motion of actions. We find he was terribly confused on the second action he was supposed to do. We must assume then that he never really got out of the first one. The remedy for this one of too steep a gradient is cutting back. Find out when he was not confused on the gradient, then what new action he undertook to do. Find what action he understood well. Just before he was all confused what did he understand well – and then we find out that he didn't understand it well. It's really at the tail end of what he understood and then he went over the gradient you see. It is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness. That's the gradient barrier and one full set of phenomena accompanies that. ____________________ (3) There is this third one. An entirely different set of physiological reactions brought about through – a bypassed definition. A bypassed definition gives one a distinctly blank feel-ing or a washed-out feeling. A not-there feeling and a sort of nervous hysteria will follow in the back of that."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"BARRIERS TO STUDY 3 HCOB 25.6.71R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 466 HPCS The manifestation of \"blow\" stems from this 3rd aspect of study which is the misunder-stood definition or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word. That's the one that produces the blow. The person doesn't necessarily blow on these other two – they are not pronouncedly blow phenomena. They are simply physiological phenomena. This one of the misunderstood definition is so much more important. It's the make-up of human relations, the mind and subjects. It establishes aptitude and lack of aptitude and it's what psychologists have been trying to test for years without recognizing what it was. It's the definitions of words. The misunderstood word. That's all it goes back to and that produces such a vast panorama of mental effects that it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity and the prime factor involved with many other things. If a person didn't have misunderstoods his talent might or might not be present but his doingness would be present. We can't say that Joe would paint as well as Bill if both were unaberrated in the field of art, but we can say that the inability of Joe to paint compared with the ability of Joe to do the motions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitions – exclusively and only upon definitions. There is some word in the field of art that the person who is inept didn't define or un-derstand and that is followed by an inability to act in the field of the arts. That's very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and that the res-toration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of understanding on the misunder-stood word – misunderstood definition. This is very fast processing. There is a very swift wide big result obtainable in this. It has a technology which is a very simple technology. It enters in at the lower levels because it has to. This doesn't mean it is unimportant, it means it has to be at the entrance gates of Scientology. It IS a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and don't neglect it. You can trace back the subject a person is dumb in or any allied subject that got mixed up with it. The psychologist doesn't understand Scientology. He never understood a word in psychology so he doesn't understand Scientology. Well that opens the gate to Education. Although I've given this one of the misunder-stood definition last it is the most important one. L.

This law at once explains why communication, ideas or application become falsified, twisted and corrupted. This law is of great use in Word Clearing: A. It indicates who has to be word cleared fast, at once, now, before duties go off the rails any further. B. It detects the area just before which there is a misunderstood word. A is useful to the administrator. Knowing it and knowing Word Clearing and being able to do it himself or get it done, he can avoid wholesale dismissals, frantic transfers, gen-eral inefficiency and organizational strain. B is very useful to the Word Clearer. Example of B. A person can do everything on an order except \"File the Folders\" which he insists on delivering to a wrong room. Look over the order and find where in it it talks about filing folders. Just above or beside that will be a misunderstood word. Locate it, get it identified, defined and used in sentences. The person can suddenly file folders! Just before or with the point a person begins to alter will be found a misunderstood word. Thus 1. Discover what a person alters. 2.

Therefore the system given in Sept 24, '64 Pol Ltr is to be used as follows: 1. Do not use the old method of covering each bit combined with the new method. 2. Use only the new method. 3. Spot check the words and materials, do not try to cover it all. This is done the same way a final examination is given in schools: only a part of the material is covered by examination, assuming that if the student has this right the student knows all of it. 4. Flunk on comm lag in attempts to answer. If the student \"er . . . .ah . . . well . . .\", flunk it as it certainly isn't known well enough to use. (Doesn't include stammerers.) 5. Never keep on examining a bulletin after a student has missed. 6. Consider all materials star rated or not rated. Skip 75%'s. In other words, the check-out must have been 100% right answers for a pass. 75% is not a pass. When you con-sider a bulletin or tape too unimportant for a 100% pass, just require evidence that it has been read and don't examine it at all. In other words, on those you check out, re-quire 100% and on less important material don't examine, merely require evidence of having read. THE \"BRIGHT\" ONES You will find that often you have very glib students you won't be able to find any fault in who yet won 't be able to apply or use the data they are passing. This student is discussed as the \"bright student\" in the Sept 24, '64 Pol Ltr. Demonstration is the key here. The moment you ask this type of student to demon-strate a rule or theory with his hands or the paper clips on your desk this glibness will shatter. The reason for this is that in memorizing words or ideas, the student can still hold the position that it has nothing to do with him or her. It is a total circuit action. Therefore, very"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"THEORY CHECK-OUT DATA 2 HCO PL 28.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 471 HPCS glib. The moment you say \"Demonstrate\" that word or idea or principle, the student has to have something to do with it. And shatters. One student passed \"Itsa\" in theory with flying colours every time even on cross-check type questions, yet had never been known to listen. When the theory instructor said, \"Demon-strate what a student would have to do to pass Itsa,\" the whole subject blew up. \"There's too many ways to do Itsa auditing!\" the student said. Yet on the bulletin it merely said \"Listen\". That given as a glib answer was all right. But \"demonstration\" brought to light that this stu-dent hadn't a clue about listening to a pc. If he had to demonstrate it, the non-participation of the student in the material he was studying came to light. Don't get the idea that Demonstration is a Practical Section action. Practical gives the drills. These demonstrations in Theory aren't drills. Clay Table isn't used to any extent by a Theory Examiner. Hands, a diagram, paper clips, these are usually quite enough! COACHING IN THEORY There is Theory Coaching as well as Practical Coaching. Coaching Theory means getting a student to define all the words, give all the rules, demonstrate things in the bulletin with his hands or bits of things, and also may include doing Clay Table Definitions of Scientology terms. That's all Theory Coaching. It compares to coaching on drills in Practical. But it is done on Bulletins, tapes and policy letters which are to be examined in the future. Coaching is not examining. The examiner who coaches instead of examining will stall the progress of the whole class. The usual Supervisor action would be to have any student who is having any trouble or is slow or glib team up with another student of comparable difficulties and have them turn about with each other with Theory Coaching, similar to Practical coaching in drills. Then when they have a bulletin, tape or policy letter coached, they have a check-out. The check-out is a spot check-out as above, a few definitions or rules and some demonstration of them. DICTIONARIES Dictionaries should be available to students in Theory and should be used in Theory Examination as well, preferably the same publication. Dictionaries don't always agree with each other. No Supervisor should try to define English language words out of his own head when correcting a student as it leads to too many arguments. On English words, open a dictionary. A Scientology dictionary is available. ____________________"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"THEORY CHECK-OUT DATA 3 HCO PL 28.2.65 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 472 HPCS Remember that with Courses becoming briefer in duration, the number of bulletins and tapes which the student must know on a Star-Rated basis is also less. General written examination for classification, however, remains on an 85% pass ba-sis. ____________________ Be sure that students who get low marks constantly are also handled in Review, pref-erably by definitions of words they haven't understood in some former subject. Scientology is never the cause of consistent dullness or glibness. Processing of this nature can be on an Itsa basis. It does not have to be Clay Table. Just finding the prior subject by discussion and discussing its words usually blows the condi-tion. I've seen it change the whole attitude of a person in just 5 or 10 minutes of auditing on a \"locate the subject and word\" basis. Therefore, definitions exist at Levels 0 and I, but not with Clay Table or assessment, only by Itsa. You'd be surprised how well it works and how fast. \"Subjects you didn't like\", \"words you haven't grasped\" are the discussion question. ____________________ The subject of \"wrong definitions cause stupidity or circuits, followed by overts and motivators\", is not easy to get across because it is so general amongst Mankind. There is a possibility that past lives themselves are wiped out by changing language, whether it is the same language that changes through the years or shifting nationality. But however that may be, don't be discouraged at the difficulties you may have in getting this principle understood and used in Scientology departments-the person you are trying to convince has definitions out somewhere also!

FURTHER MATERIAL ON STUDY - EXAMINATIONS Progress in study can be inhibited through the usage of a poor system of examination. By asking of questions irrelevant to the material covered and by failing to ensure that the stu-dent is fully aware of exactly what question is flunked, the student can be given sufficient losses to slow down his rate of learning and to cause ARC breaks. A misunderstanding comes about in the first instance purely on the basis that the stu-dent understood that he was studying a given subject. An irrelevant question asked by an ex-aminer indicates to the student that such an understanding was false or that no basic agree-ment existed on the subject in the first place. An example of this would be to ask a student of a French language course to give the main historic dates and their significance to Eighteenth Century France. The original understanding was that the student was learning to speak and read French, not to learn the history of France. In Scientology an example of an irrelevant question would be to ask the student to give the distribution of a bulletin. The understanding of the student is that he is there to learn Scientology, its theory and application, not to learn the internal administration of organiza-tional communication lines. A further example would be to ask a Level II student a question concerning data and material covered in Level IV. Frequently enough a Supervisor has to cope with a student who has come into Scien-tology to study the law of Karma or to study sociology or some other previous misconception without adding to the difficulties by asking irrelevant questions. Knowing what we now know about study we can handle earlier misconceptions, but a Supervisor must never ask a question of a student which is irrelevant to the subject or level. We must ourselves be careful not to"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 475 HPCS add to student confusion. Therefore, any Supervisor tendency to ask irrelevant questions must be firmly restrained. In the second instance of the unknown question, a student can be given a verbal ques-tion on which he is flunked. In most cases the student will not be able to remember the ques-tion asked as he would not have flunked it in the first case if he had not already failed to un-derstand the material covered by the question. Failure to remember the question asked or a Supervisor's refusal to give him the question asked reacts upon the student as an unanswered question, and therefore an uncompleted communication cycle, but also as an unknown ques-tion. The student will ARC break. You can easily demonstrate this by mumbling a question which is not clear enough to be understood and then insist upon an answer. You will soon enough have a very upset person on your hands. This is what happens when a student is asked a question, flunked, and then not given to clearly understand the question asked. Therefore Ron now requires that any examiner must always write down verbal questions asked before asking them, and when a student flunks, hand him the written question which he flunked. The student will then be able to know what he didn't know and be able to look up the material and clear up what it was that he had not understood. Further, this will enable him to complete the communication cycle. If tape examinations are addressed to a class as a whole, these questions must be posted and the examination papers returned to the student. The student can then see what it was that he missed and what question was missed. Many people have had experience of such poor systems of examination which failed to follow the above. It is common practice in universities not only not to give students the questions asked, but also never to return examination papers. Most frequently all the univer-sity student is given is a grade. If that grade is not 100%, then the student never knows what it was he didn't know and so can not look it up to know it. This leaves him in the uncertain con-dition of insecurity about his data on a particular subject. And if the student flunks the subject and has to re-take it, he cannot comfortably study the subject because the whole of the subject has now become a complete mystery to him. Thus, the subject is set up as an ARC Break. Universities probably do this to be sure that their examinations do not get out to stu-dents, but then one can only state that this is laziness or lack of ability on the part of profes-sors to think of different questions, or perhaps even a professor's own lack of understanding of his subject sufficient to enable him to be able to think of enough questions to ask. It also could be that there is a complete lack of worthwhile material in more primitive subjects than Scientology on which to ask questions, in which case it should never have been part of the curriculum. (Freudians mainly examine on the dates of Freud's papers for their qualification of psychiatrists!) The administration of a proper system of examination is quite simple: 1 . Tape examinations or examination questions given verbally to the class as a whole must be written down before being asked and must be posted on a bulletin board af-terwards and all examination papers must be returned to the students."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 476 HPCS 2. Verbal questions asked of individual students must be noted down in a book like an invoice book with tear-out sheets and a piece of carbon paper. Such books are easily procured from stationers as they are used in most stores. The student is given the yel-low copy of the questions with the flunked question plainly marked. The white copy is placed in the examiner's folder for the bulletin, tape or material. In this fashion we will be able to collect good questions to be asked; to notice funda-mental areas of mis-understanding individual students have; and to note any areas of mis-understanding which are broadly mis-understood. We can, therefore, see where the indi-vidual student needs help and see where it is necessary to elaborate more fully, on certain technical data in order to make it more broadly comprehensible.

Retesting the entire bulletin is both time-wasting and exasperating. Therefore bulletin and tape tests are given an Expiration Date. If retaken in one week, the only part examined is from the area flunked onward. If, however, the bulletin or tape is retaken after a period of one week the entire material is retested. The Examiner, when a student flunks, marks the student's bulletin or tape notes with an initial and a date just above the area of the first flunk. The Examiner may go a question or two above the question flunked to enter the date and initial. No other record is made. If the student is re-examined on a date before the date marked plus seven (within one week) the Examiner only asks questions from the date mark onward. It does not matter how many flunks are given or how many weeks a bulletin or tape exam is extended so long as no period of seven days elapses between tests. If such a period does elapse (date written + 7 days) only then does the whole material get examined. The reason for this Expiration Date is this: students are often very poor administrators. They take a bulletin or tape, study it and flunk it, throw it aside and take up another one. Fi-nally they have gone through all the course materials in this fashion and have nothing on their check sheets and nothing but failure in their studies. By introducing the Expiration Date they are persuaded to complete that which they begin. As students have to go to the end of the examination line, popping back in for the next bit a minute later is unworkable. Further an Examiner seeing that a student is trying to pass an examination with one question passed at a time can always exercise his right to assure himself the student knows the materials by a spot examination of the whole bulletin or tape before granting a pass.

Not flunking immediately on a comm lag but getting reasonable and allowing the stu-dent to carry on with the checkout. This stems from not knowing the reason for flunks on comm lags. (See HCO PL 4 Oct 64, \"Theory Checkout Data\", point number 4.) 2. Not spot checking a student on the policy or bulletin. This stems from not knowing the purpose of spot checking or why it is okay to spot check a student. (See HCO PL 4 Oct 64, \"Theory Checkout Data\", paragraph number 1 and point number 3.) 3. Not knowing that Coaching in Theory means getting the student to define all the words and give all the rules. This misunderstanding comes from not knowing the pur-pose of Coaching in Theory. (See HCO PL 4 Oct 64, \"Theory Checkout Data\".) 4. Not asking the student to use the word in a sentence after asking him to define the word in his own words. You ask for the meaning of the word and the use of the word in a made-up sentence. (See HCO PL 24 Sept 64, \"Instruction and Examination: Rais-ing the Standard of.) 5. Not knowing that a dull student is stuck in the blank space right after the misunder-stood and that a dull student is handled the same way you would handle a glib student. (See HCO PL 24 Sept 64, \"Instruction and Examination: Raising the Standard of.) 6. Not asking questions that demand an ability to apply the data assuming that if you ask a student to demonstrate you have asked him to apply the data. This is the most impor-tant point in giving a checkout and is the purpose of giving a checkout. It must never be neglected in giving a checkout. (See HCO PL 24 Sept 64, \"Instruction and Exami-nation: Raising the Standard of, and HCO PL 4 Mar 71, \"How to Do Theory Check-outs and Examinations\", second to last paragraph.) 7. Not sending back a student to restudy the policy or bulletin when he flunks but instead showing it to him and then carrying on with the checkout. Also doing this when a stu-dent flunks on a word and just having him look the word up and carrying on with the checkout without having him look up the word and restudy the materials.

All the above points were found to be out in greater or lesser degrees on students who hadn't done the Checkout Mini Course and on students who had done the Checkout Mini Course in the field. The understanding of them and application of them are essential to giving good checkouts. All the above points are found on the Checkout Mini Course, but somehow they aren't being duplicated and hence the need for this corrective policy which calls attention to them.

There is a technology of criticism of art, expressed beautifully in the Encyclopaedia published by Focal Press. In this article it stresses that a critic who is also an expert artist tends to introduce un-fairly his own perfectionism (and bias and frustrations) into his criticism. We suffer amazingly from this in all our courses. I had not previously spotted it be-cause I don't demand a student at lower levels produce results found only in higher levels. You can carelessly sum this up by \"letting the student have wins\" but if you do you'll miss the whole point. Example: A student up for a pass on his Itsa is flunked because he or she couldn't ac-knowledge. But a student at the Itsa level hasn't been taught to acknowledge. This student hasn't even read the data on acknowledgement. So the student can't pass Itsa level and so never does get to the level where acknowl-edgement is taught – and if he does, really never passed, in his own mind, Itsa and so hasn't advanced. And we catch all our students this way and they don't therefore learn. How is this done? How could this be? The instructor is an expert auditor. That's as it should be. But as an expert auditor, bad execution of a level above where the student is studying, pains the instructor. So he flunks the student because the auditing looks bad. But look here. The student wasn't being checked out as an auditor. The student was only being checked out on Itsa."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 2 HCO PL 24.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 489 HPCS Further, the action of auditing as a whole is so easy to an instructor who is an expert auditor that he fails to take it apart for instruction. If I say the following, it will look ridiculous and you'll get the point better: The student is up to pass TR 0. The Instructor on check out looks the student over and says \"You flunked the test.\" The student says \"Why?\" The Instructor says \"You didn't take the Class VI actions to clear the pc of all his GPMs.\" All right, we can all see that that would be silly. But Instruc-tors do just that daily, though on a narrower band. The Instructor puts in additives. As an expert auditor it seems natural to him to say \"You flunked your test on Itsa because you never acknowledged the pc.\" You get the point. This really is as crazy wide as the ridiculous example above. What does Ack have to do with Itsa? Nothing! Because the Instructor is an expert auditor, auditing has ceased to have parts and is all one chunk. Okay. A good auditor regards it that way. But the poor student can't grasp any of the pieces because the whole chunk is being demanded. What's Itsa? It's Listen. Can the student listen? Okay, he can listen but the expert says, \"He didn't get 15 divisions of TA per hour.\" On the what? \"On the meter of course.\" What meter? That's Level II and Itsa is Level 0. \"Yes,\" the expert protests, \"but the pc didn't get any better!\" Okay, so what pc is supposed to get better at Level 0. If they do it's an accident, usu-ally. Now does this student pass? \"No! He can't even look at the pc!\" Well, that's TR 0 of Level I. \"But he's got to look like an auditor!\" How can he? An auditor has to get through a comm course before you can really call him that. \"Okay, I'll drop my standards.... \" the expert begins. Hell no, expert. You better pick up your standards for each Level and for each small part of auditing. What's it say at Level 0? \"It says 'Listen'.\" Okay, then, damn it, when the student is able to sit and listen and not shut a pc down with yak, the student passes. \"And the meter?\" You better not let me catch you teaching meters at Level 0. And so it goes right on up through the Levels and the bits within the Levels. By making Itsa mysterious and tough, by adding big new standards to it like TA and Ack you only succeed in never teaching the student Itsa! So he goes on up and at Level IV audits like a bum. Can't control a pc. Can't meter, nothing. So the expert tries to make a student do Class VI auditing the first day and the student is never trained to do any auditing at Level 0. This nonsense repeated at Level I (by adding a meter, by purist flunking \"because the pc couldn't handle an ARC Break\") and repeated again at Level II (\"because the pc couldn't assess\") and at Level III etc. etc. Well, if you add things all the time out of sequence and demand things the student has not yet reached the student winds up in a ball of confusion like the cat getting into the yarn."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 3 HCO PL 24.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 490 HPCS So we're not instructing. We're preventing a clear view of the parts of auditing by add-ing higher level standards and actions to lower level activities. This consumes time. It makes a mess. The new HCA always tries to teach his group a whole HCA course his first evening home. Well, that's no reason seasoned veterans have to do it in our courses. If you never let a student learn Level 0 because he's flunked unless he does Level VI first, people will stay on courses forever and we'll have no auditors. Instructors must teach not out of their own expertise but out of the text book expected actions in the Level the student is being trained in. To go above that level like assessment in Level II or Ack and meters at Level 0 is to deny the student any clean view of what he's ex-pected to do. And if he never learns the parts, he'll never do the whole. And that's all that's wrong with our instruction or our instructors. As expert auditors they cease to view the part the student must know as itself and do not train and pass the stu-dent upon it. Instead they confuse the student by demanding more than the part being learned. Instruction is done on a gradient scale. Learn each part well by itself. And only then can assembly of parts occur into what we want – a well trained student. This is not lowering any standards. It's raising them on all training. BULLETIN CHECK OUTS The other side of the picture, theory, suffers because of a habit. The habit is all one's years of formal schooling where this mistake is the whole way of life. If the student knows the words, the theory instructor assumes he knows the tune. It will never do a student any good at all to know some facts. The student is expected only to use facts. It is so easy to confront thought and so hard to confront action that the Instructor often complacently lets the student mouth words ideas that mean nothing to the student. All theory check outs must consult the student's understanding. If they don't, they're useless and will ARC Break the student eventually. Course natter stems entirely from the students' non-comprehension of words and data. While this can be cured by auditing, why audit it all the time when you can prevent it in the first place by adequate theory check-out? There are two phenomena here."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 4 HCO PL 24.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 491 HPCS FIRST PHENOMENON When a student misses understanding a word, the section right after that word is a blank in his memory. You can always trace back to the word just before the blank, get it un-derstood and find miraculously that the former blank area is not now blank in the bulletin. The above is pure magic. SECOND PHENOMENON The second phenomenon is the overt cycle which follows a misunderstood word. When a word is not grasped, the student then goes into a non-comprehension (blankness) of things immediately after. This is followed by the student's solution for the blank condition which is to individuate from it – separate self from it. Now being something else than the blank area, the student commits overts against the more general area. These overts, of course, are followed by restraining himself from committing overts. This pulls flows toward the per-son and makes the person crave motivators. This is followed by various mental and physical conditions and by various complaints, fault-finding and look-what-you-did-to-me. This justi-fies a departure, a blow. But the system of education, frowning on blows as it does, causes the student to really withdraw self from the study subject (whatever he was studying) and set up in its place a cir-cuit which can receive and give back sentences and phrases. We now have \"the quick student who somehow never applies what he learns\". The specific phenomena then is that a student can study some words and give them back and yet be no participant to the action. The student gets A+ on exams but can't apply the data. The thoroughly dull student is just stuck in the non-comprehend blankness following some misunderstood word. The \"very bright\" student who yet can't use the data isn't there at all. He has long since ceased to confront the subject matter or the subject. The cure for either of these conditions of \"bright non-comprehension\" or \"dull\" is to find the missing word. But these conditions can be prevented by not letting the student go beyond the missed word without grasping its meaning. And that is the duty of the Theory Instructor. DEMONSTRATION Giving a bulletin or tape check by seeing if it can be quoted or paraphrased proves ex-actly nothing. This will not guarantee that the student knows the data or can use or apply it"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 5 HCO PL 24.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 492 HPCS nor even guarantees that the student is there. Neither the \"bright\" student nor the \"dull\" stu-dent (both suffering from the same malady) will benefit from such an examination. So examining by seeing if somebody \"knows\" the text and can quote or paraphrase it is completely false and must not be done. Correct examination is done only by making the person being tested answer (a) The meanings of the words (re-defining the words used in his own words and dem-onstrating their use in his own made up sentences), and (b) Demonstrating how the data is used. The examiner need not do a Clay Table audit just to get a student to pass. But the ex-aminer can ask what the words mean. And the examiner can ask for examples of action or application. \"What is this HCO Bulletin's first section?\" is about as dull as one can get. \"What are the rules given about.....?\" is a question I would never bother to ask. Neither of these tell the examiner whether he has the bright non-applier or the dull student before him. Such questions just beg for natter and course blows. I would go over the first paragraph of any material I was examining a student on and pick out some uncommon words. I'd ask the student to define each and demonstrate its use in a made up sentence and flunk the first \"Well.... er.... let me see.... \" and that would be the end of that check out. I wouldn't pick out only Scientologese. I'd pick out words that weren't too ordinary such as \"benefit\" \"permissive\" \"calculated\" as well as \"engram\". Students I was personally examining would begin to get a hunted look and carry dic-tionaries – but they wouldn't begin to natter or get sick or blow. And they'd use what they learned. Above all, I myself would be sure I knew what the words meant before I started to ex-amine. Dealing with new technology and the necessity to have things named, we especially need to be alert. Before you curse our terms, remember that a lack of terms to describe phenomena can be twice as incomprehensible as having involved terms that at least can be understood even-tually. We do awfully well, really, better than any other science or subject. We lack a diction-ary but we can remedy that. But to continue with how one should examine, when the student had the words, I'd demand the music. What tune do these words play? I'd say \"All right, what use is this bulletin (or tape) to you?\" Questions like, \"Now this rule here about not letting pcs eat candy while being audited, how come there'd be such a"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"INSTRUCTION & EXAMINATION: RAISING... 6 HCO PL 24.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 493 HPCS rule?\" And if the student couldn't imagine why, I'd go back to the words just ahead of that rule and find the one he hadn't grasped. I'd ask \"What are the commands of 8C?\" And when the student gave them, I'd still have the task of satisfying myself that the student understood why those were the commands. I'd ask \"How come?\" after he'd given me the commands. Or \"What are you going to do with these?\" \"Audit a pc with them\" he might say. I'd say, \"Well, why these commands?\" But if the student wasn't up to the point of study where knowing why he used those commands was not part of his materials, I wouldn't ask. For all the data about not examining above level applies very severely to Theory Check out as well as to Practical and general In-struction. I might also have a Clay Table beside my examiner's desk (and certainly would have if I were an HCO hat checker, to which all this data also applies) and use it to have students show me they knew the words and ideas. Theory often says \"Well, they take care of all that in Practical.\" Oh no they don't. When you have a Theory Section that believes that, Practical can't function at all. Practical goes through the simple motions. Theory covers why one goes through the motions. I don't think I have to beat this to death for you. You've got it. L.

To make the materials being studied real to the student by making him demon-strate them in clay. 2. To give a proper balance of mass and significance. 3. To teach the student to apply. The student is given a word or auditing action or situation to demonstrate. He then does this in clay, labeling each part. The clay SHOWS the thing. It is not just a blob of clay with a label on it. Use small strips of paper for labels. The whole demonstration then has a label of what it is. On the checkout, the student removes the overall label. The student must be silent. The examiner must not ask any questions. The examiner just looks and figures out what it is. He then tells the student who then shows the examiner the label. If the examiner did not see what it was, it is a flunk. Clay table must not be reduced to significance by the student explaining or answering questions. Nor is it reduced to significance by long-winded labels of individual parts. The clay shows it, not the label. The clay demonstrates it. The student must learn the difference between mass and sig-nificance. For example, the student has to demonstrate a pencil. He makes a thin roll of clay which is surrounded by another layer of clay – the thin roll sticking slightly out of one end. On the other end goes a small cylinder of clay. The roll is labeled \"lead\". The outer layer is labeled \"wood\". The small cylinder is labeled \"rubber\". Then a label is made for the whole thing: \"pencil\". On checkout, the student removes \"pencil\" before the examiner can see it. If the examiner can look at it and say, \"It's a pencil,\" the student passes. It might also be noted that checkouts on bulletins must also ask for demonstrations. Use paper-clips, rubber bands, etc. The examiner should ask questions that require an ability to apply. Give the student a situation and have him tell you how he would handle it. Questions about what is rule \"a\" do not detect the glib student.

You will find that students at any level in any course will benefit greatly from Clay Table work on definitions. The importance of this will become apparent as you study our ... educational technol-ogy, now mainly to be found on the Study Tapes. THE CLAY TABLE A Clay Table is any platform at which a student, standing or sitting, can work com-fortably. In an Academy it may be 3 feet by 3 feet or 5 feet by 3 feet or any larger size. Smaller sizes are not useful. ... The surface must be smooth. A table built of rough timber will serve but the top sur-face where the work is done should be oilcloth or linoleum. Otherwise the clay sticks to it and it cannot be cleaned and will soon lead to an inability to see clearly what is being done be-cause it is stained with clay leavings."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 2 HCOB 10.12.70R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 497 HPCS In the Academy castors (wheels) can be put on the legs of both the clay table and the clay container where they will be moved a lot. Large classes should have several clay tables. CLAY Several different colours of clay should be procured. The best source is a school sup-ply house where educational supplies are sold. Artists' clay is not as good as the school type. (Ask for kindergarten clay.) A receptacle, also of wood or metal and having a separate stand of its own of any type, is also valuable. It should have subdivisions in it for the different coloured clays. The amount of each colour is not important so long as there is at least a pound or two of each colour in a small class. ... In the Academy colours are only used to make a student see the difference between one object and another and have no other significance as the objects in the mind are not uni-formly coloured. While \"ridges\" are black, they can become white. Engrams may be a number of colours all in one engram, just as Technicolor is a coloured motion picture. However, some persons see engrams only in black and white. So the colour in the Academy is for instruction only, assisting to tell the difference between one object or another. ... ... USE ON COURSES Any part of the mind or any term in Scientology can be demonstrated on a Clay Ta-ble. This is an important point to grasp. The use of the table is not just for a few terms. It can be used for all definitions. The ingenuity of ... the student and his understanding of the terms being demonstrated are the only limits on a Clay Table. Simplicity is the keynote. Nothing is too insignificant or unimportant to demonstrate on a clay table. ... Anything can be so demonstrated if you work at it. And just by working on how to demonstrate it or make it into clay and labels brings about renewed understanding. In the phrase \"how do I represent it in clay\" is contained the secret of the teaching. If one can represent it in clay one understands it. If one can't, one really doesn't understand what it is. So clay and labels work only if the term or things are truly understood. And working them out in clay brings about an understanding of them. Therefore one can predict that the clay table will be most used in a practice or organi-zation which understands the most and will be least used in an organization that understands the least (and is least successful)."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 3 HCOB 10.12.70R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 498 HPCS Let us look over the level of simplicity of the terms to be used in a course of instruc-tion. Let us take body. All right, make a few lumps and call it a body and put a sign on it \"Body\". Now that doesn't seem to be much to do. But it is a lot to do to forward understanding. Let us make a yellow ring of clay beside the body or on it or in it and label it \"A Thetan\". We can thereupon see the relationship between the two most used terms in Scientol-ogy, \"Body\" and \"Thetan\". And cognitions will result. The student's attention is brought right to the room and the subject. Getting the student to do this by himself ... produces a new result. Getting the student to do it 25 times with his own hands almost exteriorizes him. Getting the student to contrive how it can be done better in clay or how many ways it can be done in clay drives home the whole idea of the location of the thetan in the body. Art is no object in clay table work. The forms are crude. Take a large lump of clay of any colour, and cover up both \"thetan\" and \"body\" with it and you have Mind. Take every part of the mind and make it in clay by making a thetan, making a body and making one or more parts of the mind (Machine, facsimile, ridge, engram, lock, what have you —all Scientology terms) and get the student to demonstrate in clay what it is and we begin to clarify what we're about. Get a student to make a Present Time Problem. Make him put in all its parts repre-sented in clay (boss, mother, self) and have each one done with a body, a thetan and a mind and some rather remarkable insights begin to occur. The quantity of things that can be made has no limit. LABELING CLAY DEMONSTRATIONS Any part of the mind can be represented by a piece of clay and a label. The mass parts are done by clay, the significance or thought parts by label. A piece of clay and a label are usually both used for any part of the mind. A thin-edged ring of clay with a large hole in it is usually used to signify a pure significance. ... Everything is labeled that is made on the clay table, no matter how crude the label is. Students usually do labels with scraps of paper written on with a ball-point. ... The procedure should go - student makes one object, labels it, makes another object, labels it, makes a third object and puts a label on it and so on in sequence."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"CLAY TABLE WORK IN TRAINING 4 HCOB 10.12.70R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 499 HPCS If a student makes all the masses of his demonstration at once, without labeling them, he is sitting there with all those significances stacking up in his mind instead of putting down each one (in the form of a label) as he goes. The correct procedure is label each mass as you go along. SIZE OF CLAY DEMOS The size of the demo can be important. A clay demo should be rather large. (One or two inches high is usually inadequate.) Large demos help to increase the student's reality on what he is demonstration. More reality means more affinity and communication and therefore more understanding. CHECKOUTS The clay demonstration must show that the student's understanding of the materials being demonstrated is present. The clay shows the thing, not the labels or the imagination. If a student's clay demonstration isn't correctly done or doesn't show what is to be demon-strated it must be flunked with reference to the material. In such case, the student must be referred to the correct Bulletin, Policy, Book or Tape reference from the materials of the course. Another student's demo is never referred to or used as an example. HANDLING CLAY Clay is messy. Until we find or unless we find a totally non-oily clay, precautions must be taken to keep students clean, and if not clean, cleaned up afterwards. Therefore the course administrator can provide liberal quantities of cheap cleaning tissues and odourless solvent. The clinging quality of clay and the odour of bad solvents could put an end to the great value of clay table work. So safeguard against this. _______________ The principal thing is to get every Scientology term made in clay and labels by the individual student. You will see a new era dawn in training. You will see Academy blows vanish and time on course cut to one fifth in many instances. These are desirable attainments in any course so Clay Table work is serious Academy business. Ingenuity and understanding are the only limits on the use of the clay table and the at-tainment of excellent results with it. L.

The correct use of demonstration is contained in the LRH HCO PL of 4 October 1964 \"Theory Checkout Data\". The purpose of demonstration by that policy was to detect glibness on checkouts. If the person can't demonstrate a datum by the use of a few rubber bands or paper clips it is ob-vious the person is glib, able to quote the words but not able to apply the data. The solution would be to find WHY that person is not applying study tech, get him oriented toward appli-cation, locate and handle any misunderstood words in the materials and get them re-studied and checked out. The use of demo kits became extended and altered to mean the student fiddles with bits and pieces continually while studying. This serves no useful purpose and is not demon-stration. The twin or supervisor has the student demonstrate key principles of the materials while doing starrate checkouts. This doesn't mean the student fiddles constantly while being checked out. It means specific demonstration of data contained in the materials as asked for by the person doing the checkout. If a student, while studying, is not clear on something and has looked up the words, he may use a demo kit to work it out. This is not demanded. It is at the discretion of the student himself. The more usual action in such a case is for the student to go over to the clay table and work it out properly in clay in accordance with the clay demonstration HCOBs (which are fully valid and in no way changed by this HCO PL). The principle of demonstration is invaluable for working out something one is devel-oping. A staff member working at his desk isn't going to do a clay demo. He can however easily use a pen and paper. Part of demonstration is drawing something out in two dimen-sions.

This applies not only to construction details but also to the full sequence of co-ordinated actions resulting in a building in the physical uni-verse. It is a full program worked out on paper as an \"arrow diagram\" showing co-ordination of sequences, terminals, materials, sub-products, etc. against time. From this diagram specific written instructions for the job are easily and accurately drawn up. Such a graphic demonstration immediately shows up any outpoints and confusions and is a key use of demonstration. When a graphic representation gets too complicated or can't be graphed at all, you have something wrong. Usually the diagram will show what is wrong and itself leads to the solution. An obvious example is a navigator who, instead of trying to work it all out in his head with some foggy concept of where he is, simply graphs the sailing plan and progress on a chart. Org Boards and statistical graphs are also examples in their own way. There is another form of demonstration, by far the best when applicable, and that is to show the actual thing to the person. It is limited to those things which currently exist and are available. You can show a housewife a washing machine but you can't show a person a hu-man mind in the same way. The human mind can however be well demonstrated in clay. Demonstrating datum's in clay is too slow a method of detecting glibness on checkouts so one uses rubber bands and paper clips, etc. Demo kit is not always an easy way to work out some-thing new being developed so one uses pen and graphs it out diagrammatically in such cases. The graphic form is also much easier for disseminating to others, clay demos being difficult to pin on walls, mail, or put into hats. SUMMARY There are four primary methods of demonstration used in Scientology. 1. Demonstration by showing the actual object (e.g. \"What is an E-Meter?\" – \"This is an E-Meter.\" \"What does an auditing session really sound like?\" – \"Listen to this tape re-corded session of LRH auditing.\") 2. Clay demonstration. Used to demonstrate existing data, etc. Adds mass to the sig-nificance and is invaluable where the actual thing is not present or cannot be shown visibly. 3. Demo Kit using rubber bands, paper clips, etc. Used in starrate checkouts to detect glibness. 4. Graphic demonstration. Used in developing or clarifying sequences, lines, flows, how things work or go together, etc and locating bugs in such. A useful fast form of develop-ing something new and communicating concepts, sequences and arrangements to others."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"DEMONSTRATION   3   BPL   15.4.72R   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 502 HPCS All four methods are for use and are part of Scientology study tech.

As a supervisor, you would want to handle anything that slowed or interfered with such a student's F/N. Using dope-off as the only detection of misunderstoods is supervising at a below F/N level. The F/N went off long before the student reached the point of dope-off, so waiting for dope-off to occur before handling is waiting too long. Let us look at this from the point of view of the tone scale. If you consider that each student who is not at tone 5.0 during study has a misunder-stood word – and if you do something about the misunderstood word – then you can drive up study velocity so that all students are flying along as F/Ning students. (It's not a misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but a misunderstood word.) This always occurs before the subject itself is not understood. In comparison with waiting for dope-off to occur before handling the misunderstoods, this method is like high level auditing where slowed F/Ns are taken as reads – rather than TA rise being the read. An estimation of the tone level of students on one course showed them at about plus or minus 2.5. This would mean many students had a very tight meter needle if we compare them to the F/Ning student who is flying along successfully. This could be remedied."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"STEPS TO SPEED UP PRODUCT FLOW 2 BTB 29.6.71R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 509 HPCS If you had this problem of a group of students at tone 2.5 it could be approached this way: 1. Set up one or more word clearers in the classroom. 2. Start with the faster study students, but not those at tone 5.0 or above. 3. If TA above 3.5 or below 2.0 send to Qual for a C/S 53RI. 4. Word clearer inspects student stats graphs and locates with simple two way comm what was being studied at the specific period just before the graph leveled or started to go down. If the graph has not done either but just maintained at a low level, the word clearer selects out the earliest materials on the course. 5. Do method 4 on the materials selected on each student, taking each word to F/N. 6. Any student with BIs which do not clear up, or who runs into trouble on method 4 is sent to Qual for WCCL. 7. Push back the action so it's done within the first few days of course for all new stu-dents, once all existing students are handled. 8. Keep in the M4 for all new students within the first few days as a standard action. 9. Do method 4 or use other methods of word clearing on all course students at the first sign of a non-F/Ning student. By eliminating all these slows (misunderstood words), the students' average points will rise and you will get all students flying along as F/Ning students.

The reason they do not know what their posts are is a host of misunderstood basic words connected with that post. Put a person on a meter: Have the person read some of the material relating to his post or hat, beginning with the most basic material about it and starting at the very top of the first page, including even the heading and issue numbers. Watch the meter carefully. Halt the person at each read and whether he says he knows the meaning or not, if it read, have him look it up in a good (big) dictionary. Have him use the word in sentences of his own invention. Make him do this as long as it is bringing the TA down. If you get into trouble with him go back and find the misunder-stood you missed. Keep hunting and keep working at it and his misunderstood words will blow and his inability to understand the post will blow. EXPLANATION Failed posts and duties trace back to misunderstood words. Until you see it you won't believe it. One student who had studied his post for a third of a year was given Method 2 on its materials. It took 15 hours of Method 2 work, protests, blows, upsets to finally discover that he did not know what POST meant! OR what the words in the title meant. Another person studied half a year to be an administrator. Yet when he was given his personnel orders appointing him, and Method 2 was done on them, in the first 50 words of the personnel order there were 13 individual misunderstood words each one of which related to the post and were simple English. A similar ratio continued throughout the personnel order."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"WORDS AND POSTS 2 HCOB 2.09.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 517 HPCS He was about to fail with a fanfare.

One must be able to handle ARC Breaks, Problems and withholds and read a meter. One must have a very big dictionary available when little ones fail.

This is correct sequence for doing the three types of word clearing. By doing No. 1 in full session, using the list for assessment, one obtains the basic word and meaning errors of the past. By getting these out of the way, it is now possible to clean up current materials much more rapidly with Method 2, where the person is put on a meter and reads the material to another who is watching the meter and catching each read. With Method I out of the way, Method 2 becomes more rapid. Method 3 will then be done by the person himself because he now knows better. No. 2 and No. 3 can be used on and on one or the other. If you do it backwards, beginning with Method No. 3, much more time is consumed. If Method No. 2 is used without No. I being done, much more work has to be done to clean up an existing piece of study material or text. So the correct sequence is No. 1, No. 2 and then No. 3. This does not mean you cannot start with No. 3 or No. 2. It just means it is much faster to do them in correct sequence. PURPOSE CLEARING When purpose of the post is to be cleared it is done after Method No. 1 in general and Method No. 2 has been done on the duties and texts of the post.

(In choosing the materials to be cleared in No. 3 above choose the texts, handbooks or materials most closely related to the post and most basic to the post.)

However there are a few. It is possible for an auditor or student doing word clearing on another to get misunder-stood words himself unless he also looks at the definitions and understands them at the same time he is clearing them on the other person. This requires no extra step. In fact it would be rather hard not to also see the definition of the word. A person trying to \"blow\" (leave) and refusing further Word Clearing almost always has a HUGE misunderstood on some word not yet located. The correct action is to get him back and find and clear the word. Not getting a good result using Methods 1, 2 or 3 is cured by using the Word Clearing Correction List, HCO B 21 July 71, Revised 9 August 71. This Correction List applies to all methods of word clearing. For instance, if Method 2 goes sour and the student \"knew all the words anyway\" or \"doesn't understand it any better\" or is critical or demonstrates any other unfavorable reac-tions which do not win through, there is always Word Clearing Correction List. This list is done by a Class III or above auditor. It is quite miraculous. Example: Student badly bogged after Method 2 by his twin. Handling: A Class III auditor does the Word Clearing Correction List on him. The Correction List is handled as per HCO B 14 Mar 71, \"F/N Everything\". In other words, one takes all reads on it to Floating Needle. Any other list called for by reads on the Correction List is taken to F/N and when that called-for list F/Ns then one considers that the Word Clearing Correction List line has F/Ned. (Correction List reads on 4. List Error. The auditor takes a list called L4B which corrects lists and makes every read on \"L4B\" F/N. Then \"4. List Error\" is marked \"F/N\".) The technology of handling a Word Clearing Correction List is all covered in the gen-eral materials of auditing. Not knowing how to use a Meter can cause trouble."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"TROUBLE SHOOTING 2 HCOB 13.9.71 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 523 HPCS A special Course in using an E-Meter is available. The E-Meter Drill Book gives all the drills. It does not take long to learn. Also E-Meters are abundantly available today. Learning to be a Class III or preferably a Class IV Academy Auditor is not difficult IF one uses word clearing! All word clearing is done under the discipline of The Auditor's Code. One's \"TRs\" (TR = Training drills for auditing) can be straightened out on a TR Course on which one learns to confront, to speak so one can be heard, to acknowledge, to be able to repeat commands and to handle originations by the student. Troubles in word clearing, then can be listed as coming from lack of training. So any-one doing word clearing should organize himself to (1) Do a TR Course, (2) Learn to use and acquire an E-Meter, (3) Learn the Auditor's Code and, (4) If not one already, learn to be an Academy Class III Auditor. Knowing how to do 1 to 3 above is essential to do Method 2 Word Clearing. And the skills under (1) to (3) are very easy to acquire. Further, it is not all that difficult to become a Class III Auditor. People sometimes think only someone who wants to be a professional auditor studies in the Academy, a false impression. One can't imagine how a father or businessman or mother or clerk or official could succeed without knowing the basics of human reaction and how to handle them. Someone who is a Class III or Class IV knows how. The real professional usu-ally becomes a Class VI and the real experts are the VIIIs, IXs and Xs. It's a matter of how expert you want to be. A Flag Ship Class XII could turn a severe mental case from raving lunacy to not only sane but bright and normal in about 8 or 9 hours and a normal person to a genius in 15 to 20 hours. But here we are dealing with the whole range of the human mind. In word clearing Method 2 one certainly should know his \"TRs\", his Auditor's Code and his Meter. And for Method 1 it takes a Class III Academy Auditor. Almost all troubles will be found to stem from an omission of these requirements and not using Word Clearing on the materials one is studying to achieve these skills. Very few troubles actually will be encountered if this HCO B is followed. Word Clearing is a precision technology and there IS something to know about it as it has never before been known. L.

Actual experience shows that doing WC 2 without WC 1 restimulates earlier charge on words that have been misunderstood in the past. When a person has not had Word Clear Method 1 and tries to do Word Clear Method 2 on materials, it can go very slowly, the student (due to earlier charge on words) can become quite misemotional. Using Method 3 (going back to find the misunderstood word) is all right. And using common ordinary \"Look up, don't go past a misunderstood word\" is all right.

When the person is constantly F/Ning on the materials being word cleared Method 2, that is the time to end off. The \"EP\" has been reached. When the word clearer forces the student to go on beyond this, the reads gotten are of-ten false or are from protest. Reads that are false come from cognitions (realizations) on the material. Protest reads come from just plain annoyance with having to go on. When the EP of 2 is reached on a specific set of materials, the student is then permit-ted to go on by himself, looking up words he doesn't know or going back to find one that was missed. A person who enters a new subject or a new branch of a subject should be given WC 2 on it. A person who begins a higher level of a subject should be given WC 2 on it.

Example: The M4 Word Clearer in Qual says, \"Look at definition No. 5.\" The Student does and gets it but later has trouble with the same word or HCO B due to incompletely defined words. Example: The PCRD Student who looks up words until she's \"feels good about it\", incompletely defines half the words on the PCRD and utterly defeats its purpose, and hers. PROCEDURE In clearing words the Student looks up every definition, using each meaning of the word in sentences until he's got it. When all definitions have been cleared, the context of the sentence the word was found in is consulted and the Student chooses the definition that ap-plies and ensures he understands it. At this point the word has been cleared, and not before. PRD This procedure applies especially to the PRD where the context is unknown.

Very few dictionaries have full definitions for such words and they have no exam-ples. Words like \"a\" \"the\" \"and\" are really parts of language construction and are more complex than they at first appear. A Word Clearing Auditor should have a simple grammar book to hand as well as dic-tionaries. The best Grammar textbooks are those compiled for persons foreign to a language, like immigrants. These do not contain the supposition that the student is already an English professor. Lots of examples is the real test of a good grammar. When doing the Study Tapes or Student Hat lack of a simple grammar textbook can really throw the student off.. Those \"simple\" words can be the huge rocks that stand on the highway to becoming a word clear. So a Grammar is needed. If a student is very deficient (lacking) in grammar it is best to make him do a whole simple grammar text first before he begins to get into just words. The words won't hang to-gether for him. It takes less time to do a short textbook in Grammar than it does to struggle with grammar all the way through. Grammar can look like a ghastly subject until one really looks at it. Then it's easy.

The meanings they give are often circular: Like \"Cat: An Animal.\" \"Animal: A Cat.\" They do not give enough meaning to escape the circle. The meanings given are often inadequate to get a real concept of the word. The words are too few and even common words are often missing. Huge dictionaries can also be confusing as the words they use to define are often too big or too rare and make one chase through 20 new words to get the meaning of the original. The best dictionaries are the very large child's dictionaries like THE WORLD BOOK DICTIONARY (A Thorndike-Barnhart Dictionary published exclusively for Field Enterprises Educational Corporation, Merchandise Mart Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60654 or Doubleday and Company. Thorndike-Barnhart has a whole series of dictionaries of which this is a special one. Field Enterprises has offices in Chicago, London, Rome, Sydney, Toronto.

(It is not a complete Dictionary and would require another larger dictionary for full word clearing. But it gives American usages of words and phrases, which could be important as Dianetics and Scientology are written in American English.) It was sent to me by an SHSBC Student who found its definition of Grammar was very helpful to other students. This definition also tells you why some college or school texts are so ghastly hard to read – they are not in standard English. It also tells you why, in 1950, the head of the English Department in an American University hailed Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health as marking a new era of scientific writing. One reason is that it was written by a writer, not a professor. The other was that it was written in the English that was in use. But read the definition: GRAMMAR GRAMMAR is a systematic description of the ways in which words are used in a par-ticular language. The grammarian groups words that behave similarly into classes and then draws up rules stating how each class of words behaves. What classes are set up and how the rules are phrased is a matter of convenience. A grammarian is free to classify his material in any way that seems reasonable to him. But he is never free to say that certain forms of speech are unacceptable merely because there is no place for them in the system he has designed. THE CLASSES Most grammarians are interested in a number of languages. As a rule they set up classes that are useful in handling many languages but that may have very little meaning for a particular language. For example, the distinction between the dative him and the accusative him is important in the Indo-European languages generally. But in a grammar designed solely to teach English, this distinction does not have to be made. Similarly, there is an etymological or historical difference between the English gerund in -ing and the participle in -ing. But it is"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"GRAMMAR DEFINITION 2 HCOB 18.08.72 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 537 HPCS sometimes impossible to say whether a given word is a gerund or a participle; for example, in journeys end in lovers meeting. For this reason, some grammarians prefer to handle these forms together under one name, such as \"participle\" or \"-ing\". The familiar terms of classical grammar are defined in this dictionary for the conven-ience of persons who need to use these concepts. But a much simpler classification, based on the structure of present-day English, is employed in all the discussions of usage. THE RULES In order to say how words are used, the grammarian must examine large quantities of spoken and written English. He will find some constructions used so consistently that the ex-ceptions have to be classed as errors. But he will also find competing, and even contradictory, constructions, which appear too often to be called mistakes. He must then see whether one of these expressions is used by one kind of person and not by another or in one kind of situation and not in another. If he can find no difference of this sort he accepts the two constructions as interchangeable. In this way he assembles a body of information on how English words are used that may also show differences, such as those between one locality and another, or be-tween spoken and written English, or between literary and illiterate speech. Studies of this kind are called \"scientific\" or \"descriptive\" grammars. This is a relatively new approach to the problems of language and the information brought to light in this way is sometimes surpris-ing. The first English grammarians, writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, did not attempt to describe the English of their day. On the contrary, they were attempting to \"improve\" English and they demanded Latin constructions which were not characteristic of English. They objected to the expression I am mistaken, because if translated into Latin this would mean I am misunderstood. They claimed that unloose must mean tie, because un is a Latin negative. They objected to the \"double negative\" which was good Old English, and also good Greek, but not good Latin. These eighteenth century rules of prescriptive grammar have been repeated in school books for two hundred years. They are the rules for a curious, Latinized English that has never been spoken and is seldom used in literature, but that is now highly respected in some places, principally in scientific writing. It should be recognized that these rules were not de-signed to \"preserve\" English, or keep it \"pure\". They were designed to create a language which would be \"better\" simply because it was more like Latin. Dryden, writing in the seven-teenth century, said: \"I am often put to a stand in considering whether what I write be the id-iom of the tongue or false grammar and nonsense, couched beneath that specious name of Anglicism, and have no other way to clear my doubts but by translating my English into Latin and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in a more stable language.\" One result of this double translation was that Dryden went through his earlier works and rewrote all the sentences that had originally ended in a preposition or adverb. A generation later, Swift com-plained that the English of his day \"offends against every part of grammar\". Certainly this is blaming the foot because it doesn't fit the shoe!"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"GRAMMAR DEFINITION 3 HCOB 18.08.72 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 538 HPCS Because some people would like to write the language of the textbooks, the entries in this dictionary not only tell what standing a given construction has in current English but also explain how the rules of the prescriptive grammarian would apply, wherever the rules and standard practice differ. But in such cases the rules are never simple, and the person who has to use this type of English may feel that it would be easier to follow Dryden's example and write in Latin first. THIS BOOK The grammar entries in this book are designed for persons who speak standard English but who may be confused about certain isolated points. The entries are arranged so that the answer to a particular problem can be found in the least possible time. But anyone who wishes to make a systematic study of English grammar, using this book, can do so by starting with the entry parts of speech and following the references to more and more detailed discus-sions of each concept.

The endless Semantic circles pursued by Korzybski and company (see Data Se-ries 1, \"The Anatomy of Thought\") never really led to the realization that a word and its meanings are embodied in the basic concept or idea symbolized by that word. That conceptualization of meanings is foreign to dictionary writers and \"experts\" is evidenced by the fact that definitions are so subject to alter-is and change with the passage of time. For example, modern definitions of the word \"understand\" are found to be largely in-adequate. A really full and meaningful definition of it could only be found in a First Edition of Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms, 1942: \"Understand. To have a clear and true idea or conception, or full and exact knowledge, of something. In general it may be said that understand refers to the result of a mental process or processes (a clear and exact idea or notion, or full knowledge). Understand implies the power to receive and register a clear and true impression.\" CLEARED WORDS Operating within a society steeped in misunderstood words and mis-definitions, Study Tech is subject to arbitraries. Thus, a cleared word is defined as follows: A word which has been cleared to the point of full conceptual understanding. In Metered Word Clearing this translates as: F/N, VGIs. There are many ways and combinations to achieve this EP. Using the word in sen-tences until the meaning is grasped conceptually is the most common.

If the student can't find the misunderstood by looking back for it, he can get another student to spot check him. The other student takes words from the text that could be misunderstood and asks: \"What is the definition of the word?\" seeing if the student gives a correct definition. 4. The student looks up the word found in a dictionary, thoroughly clears each definition and uses it verbally several times in sentences of his own composition until he has ob-viously demonstrated that he understands the word by the composition of his sen-tences – and feels fine about it. 5. Then the student reads the text that contained the misunderstood word. If he isn't now \"bright\", eager to get on with it, back up tone, etc, then there is another misunderstood word earlier in the text. This is found by repeating steps 2-5. 6. When he is bright, up tone, etc (an F/Ning student), the student comes forward from where the misunderstood word was in the text to the area of the subject he did not un-derstand (where step 1 began).

The person doesn't read it. He may have some strange meaning for it like \"Israel\" (actual occurrence). He may omit \"didn't\" each time it occurs and the reason traced to not knowing what the apostrophe is (actual occurrence). He may call one word quite another word such as \"stop\" for \"happen\" or \"green\" for \"mean\". He may hesitate over certain words. The procedure is 1. Have him read aloud. 2. Note each omission or word change or hesitation or frown as he reads and take it up at once. 3. Correct it by looking it up for him or explaining it to him. 4.

Its End Product is Super-Literacy. The steps are these: Usually an alphabetical list of every word or term in the text of a paper, a chapter or a recorded tape is available or provided. 1. The person looks up each word on the alphabetical list and uses each in sentences until he has the meaning conceptually. The words are looked up in a big dictionary. The grammatical words or small words are looked up in a simple grammar. If the per-son has too much trouble with grammar he should do the whole simple grammar text before going on. Any technical terms not in the dictionary are looked up in a technical dictionary or glossary or in bulletins on the materials, i.e. a photographic dictionary. This is not done for the whole subject, it is done for a paper or a chapter or one tape of a series. 2. One then reads or listens to the paper, chapter or tape for its sense or general meaning. 3. Method 4 is then done on the person to find any misunderstoods. 4. These are cleared up per Method 4 procedure. 5. The person reads or listens to the material again. 6.

The procedure is: 1. Student or staff member reads the text out loud. He is not on the meter. 2. The Word Clearer has a copy of the text and reads along with the student silently. 3. If the student leaves out a word or stumbles or exhibits any physical or verbal manifes-tation while reading the text, the Word Clearer immediately asks for the misunder-stood word or term and gets the meanings cleared with a dictionary and put into sen-tences until the word is understood and VGIs are present. 4. Student rereads the last section and continues the text to completion, picking up and handling all misunderstood words, as evidenced by verbal or physical manifestations. 5.

Word Clearers must be specifically and extensively drilled to do M9 (or M7) so that they can read a text and pick up any and all physical manifestations at the same time. Only then is an OK to do M9 (or M7) issued. The fact of having had material word cleared using a different method does not pre-vent M9 being used. In fact, it would not be unusual for specific material to be handled first with M6, then M9 then M4, if one wanted to be very thorough.

The first requirement is Method One in the person's basic language. If the person speaks several languages, or lived in several countries, the languages would be handled in the sequence they were encountered. To do Method One in English on a French person without first doing M1 in French is more or less a waste of time. The person won't make it in English until the earlier misunder-stoods connected with the earlier language are fully handled. When Word Clearing a person who speaks a foreign language, it is imperative to have a proper dictionary in that language to hand. Do not use the English/French or Eng-lish/German \"dictionary\" for it is not a dictionary but a reference manual only and does not contain full and proper definitions. The most charged language(s) will be that first learned and that used in school. Obviously, it is best for a foreign language person to be audited on M1 by an Auditor who speaks the same language. However, if one was not available, it could be done by writing up the M1 list phonetically in the language concerned and running a standard M1, making sure that the Pc keeps the Auditor very well informed on the definitions in the dictionary. Foreign language students on Courses are usually provided with translated tape courses. In this case, the full technology on handling tape courses and their repair must be fully applied. M2 and 4 on tapes must be set up for immediate handling in Tech and Qual. It could be also that a foreign language student cannot read English because of unhan-dled problems on reading his own language and so would greatly benefit from an M7 on a reading text in his own language.

You can show somebody how to do things far better than you can tell him. This then extends into Div 6 Introductory Actions as well. The relay of data comes af-ter the demonstration in action terms.

The tape is then reversed to the exact end point of where he was doing well. The first MU will be just after that and there may be others. 7. The Supervisor/Word Clearer operates the foot pedal start-stop control of the tape ma-chine as well as the E-Meter, and does worksheets of the Word Clearing. 8. The student listens to the tape. He also holds the cans of the E-Meter while he is lis-tening to the tape. If the student's TA is above 3.5 or below 2.0, send the student to Qual for rapid C/S Series 53RI handling and return to course. 9. As the tape plays, the Supervisor/Word Clearer watches his Meter needle. As soon as the needle reads (small fall, fall, etc) the Supervisor/Word Clearer stops the machine by use of the foot pedal, and asks the student for the misunderstood word. It is extremely important that the Supervisor/Word Clearer stop the tape player at the exact moment of the Meter read, otherwise he may be asking the student for three or four or even six or eight words later than the reading word, and thus cause undue diffi-culty for the student. 10. If the student can't spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer replays the last short section to assist the student to find the MU. 11. If the student still can't spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer turns the tape back a little further and replays that whole section, using the tape counter numbers to guide his stopping and starting actions.

All misunderstood words on tapes are cleared according to BTB 4 Sept 71R, Rev. 15 Dec 73, 20 July 74, WC Series 22R, \"How to Use a Dictionary\", clearing each word to F/N. 13. The student keeps hold of the cans and the Supervisor/Word Clearer locates the word in the dictionary, understands the definition himself and then holds it for the student to read. 14. The student reads all definitions out loud whilst the Word Clearer watches the needle in order to pick up any MUs in the definitions. 15. The Word Clearer ensures that the student puts each definition into sentences to ensure the word is fully understood, to F/N. 16. The Word Clearer ensures that the student has clarified the exact definition of the word as used in the tape, and plays back that section of the tape for the student, in or-der to ensure it is cleared. 17. The tape is now turned back to the beginning of the section where the student ran into trouble to double check that it is now resolved. There should be no reads, and F/N, on that section of the material. If there are any more reads, these are picked up and cleared, and the section replayed again, until there are no more reads on that section, and F/N on the repair. 18. The trouble is now resolved and the student is returned to normal study, where he is expected to apply Method 3 Word Clearing as a routine. 19. If the student's difficulty has not resolved, the student is sent to Qual for a Word Clear-ing Correction List, which will locate the cause of the trouble. 20. The student is returned to Course when the difficulty has been located and handled, re-sulting in an F/Ning student.

The Word Clearer in-forms the student, \"I'm sorry we will not be starting Word Clearing at this time.\" The Word Clearer reports this in writing with the student's TA position to the Supervisor who forwards the report to the DPE so that the needed C/S Series 53RI session can be given the student. This must be done quickly so he can be gotten on to his Word Clear-ing. The student is immediately called in for C/S 53RI handling to the result of an F/Ning student at which point the student is returned to his course. D. Starting the Word Clearing is done by informing the student, \"I am not auditing you.\" The tape is then started and the procedure is as given earlier in this BTB for Method 2. The only difference being that the whole materials are covered in this manner with the Word Clearer taking up and clearing all reading words (and any words originated by the student as misunderstood). E. Each word handled is cleared to Floating Needle on the Meter. F. The Word Clearing period is ended on Floating Needle. G. Note: If the Word Clearing bogs down and it can't be resolved, the Word Clearer or Supervisor must end off and send the Worksheets to the Review Auditor in Dept 14 at once, who will handle by doing a Word Clearing Correction List.

It is necessary to know the minimum materials an org in a non-English speaking country would need to function. It is not enough to have one book published. It creates a demand for services. The de-mand for service must be met. An HAS Course in the language is not enough since it is not income producing. Thus the org could not survive financially.

By production is meant training auditors who can au-dit, auditing pcs to a good result and making money, or in a total socialism, obtaining ade-quate support in ratio to production. If an org just teaches an HAS Course or tests people, it will not be able to survive for it will not be able to obtain enough funds or support.

As a paperback it does not pay for itself. To this add testing materials printed in the language for intelligence and personality testing and their marking directions. RECORDED TAPES Recorded tapes and tape players in the org to play to individuals in classes is the easi-est form in which to deliver data. From such tapes students may take notes. As time goes on the tapes will be transcribed and the material printed or mimeo-graphed. (This is not to be done by the individual orgs.) It will be found however that tapes will always be necessary even when some is printed as the volume of data is very great. Students should not be permitted to print copies of their notes and sell them as time has shown that such notes are not accurate enough and spread errors that show up in training and auditing failures. In reviewing, a student must be sent back to the original, not to his notes, so he can correct his notes and get the data accurately. Nearly all no-results are traced to altered data or poor training of the student, which amounts to the same thing. The minimum list of tapes is: 1. Mini Course Supervisor Hat 2. HAS Course 3.

If every bit of the above is known and used by a staff they will not have too much trouble. Set up and functioning and solvent, an org can then think about further materials. Class VI, a Class VII, a Class VIII and a Class IX Course materials on tape should ex-ist in a Saint Hill org in the language of that country. For the org itself a Volume Zero of the OEC Course should exist on tape. After that the full Course Supervisor's Course should exist. Then further books such as DIANETICS '55!, SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL and THE CREATION OF HUMAN ABILITY should come out as tape and then in published hardcover form. The full OEC should now be acquired on tape. The full Study Tapes should be to hand. The org will now be ready to use all the FEBC series and the FEBC tapes. ____________________ The hardest idea for an org staff to get is the idea of production in terms of auditors trained who can audit, pcs audited to excellent results and money or support produced to keep the staff members and the org solvent. Because of this it is best for 2 or more bilingual executives to attain full FEBC train-ing. However, with the above minimum materials fully studied and in use, an org can sur-vive until it is ready to prosper. ____________________ Note, at this writing many are working hard to complete the listed materials.

It is imperative that the earphone quality be of the highest, and the tape copy have very good sound quality. Otherwise students go to sleep over misunderstood words. The individual tape player method is used because (a) it can handle a large or small number of students, (b) it works where there is a trickle of students starting at different times, (c) it works where students studying subjects different from each other are using the same classroom. It takes more tape players and must be earphone equipped but it prevents students going past misunderstoods as can occur if they are all listening to a group tape play. The foot controlled start-stop pedal is necessary so the student can use his hands freely to take notes and look up words in the dictionary. It also enables the tape to be stopped instantly without the time lag it takes to reach for and push a finger button – thus going past the place where the stop is desired.

It's the 6th of August AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And we have another lecture today on study. Now probably, just to get off in high gear here, so the taxi cabs won't run up too big a bill out there this evening – just to get off into high gear, let me tell you at first that, of course, no field of study including Scientology texts of earlier times includes these principles. So this is a very adventurous thing I'm doing because it can rebound on a critical, you see, at Scientology texts because they are not written this way. They are written in an effort to make people understand what you're talking about but they do not go according to these prin-ciples and future Scientology texts, on the other hand, will go according to these principles. And you will see this suddenly entering and coming over the horizon. However, you have at this time only a bulletin or two which represent this. You probably have noticed of recent times that the more recent bulletins are much easier to study and that is a direct result of this study of study. Leave it to me to study study. But it's very interesting that your grades on examination, since I have been talking to you about studying, have increased from five percent in the nineties – five percent of the class in the nineties – to sixty percent of the class in the nineties. That's one of these astonishing leaps, you see? It is too astonishing to – well, it would be totally unlooked for. Now, you are already being trained above the level of modern education, that is to say modern education as she is taught. One shouldn't be grammatical about low-grade things, you see?

A lot of unex-"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 2 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 595 HPCS plored nuances in language and that sort of thing which are quite amusing. But of course, that's just amusing. In the field of study to improve the ability of a student to learn by altering the charac-ter and methodology of teaching is the exact aim here. Now, this is quite an interesting aim: that is, just to alter the ability of the student to study and to learn and improve it by simply altering the teaching methodology. Now, you see now, that in itself is rather adventurous, because you say, \"Well, I could make the subject easier to read,\" or something like that, but how about changing the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method of teaching which is employed? So, you see how far we have reached here. We are now handling in this subject the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method we use in teaching it. So, if you want to see some pan-determinism at work, that's it, don't you see? Now, study normally would simply be, you told somebody something and he was sup-posed to study it, you see; and if he didn't like it, why, you reported him to the headmaster, you see? That was how we achieved subjective reality on the student. In universities it's done by mechanisms of expulsion, a grade system whereby if somebody doesn't make a grade he is expelled. This lightly goes on – he's not permitted to go into the next grade. You see that very commonly, but this goes up to a point where somebody is expelled. Now, that was how they tried to give the student subjective reality on the subject he was studying by, of course, pun-ishment. How else would you expect, don't you see, the thing to conduct itself in the physical universe? So actually, beyond an effort to present the facts and say a subject was there and then provide a school technology which made the individual guilty if he didn't know it, the whole subject of study and training had not really much advanced beyond that point. That was about the high tide of study. Now, quite accidentally someone with intuition or insight – some professor, some teacher someplace, in some school – would depart from this rationale. He would depart from this method of teaching and he would try to invite the understanding and the interest and the participation of the student; and such people were very rare and people really tried, students really fought to get into their classes. And that was about as far as it had advanced. Now, when we recognize that education is not very successful we have made an enormous stride forward. Now, the educational authorities who are responsible for the educa-tion of children and adults refuse to recognize this fact and so they really don't really try to improve it. But when you are down against a practical subject such as Scientology where you have trained this auditor as best you could and then you see him sit down – you have an ele-ment there which is missing in most educational technologies. They teach the engineer to build a bridge but then nobody in that university is forced to sit down and watch him build a bridge, much less go across the bridge he has built. So you see, they do not in actual fact get a very good look at whether their educational methods are successful or not. We teach some-body ancient Greek. There is nothing wrong with learning ancient Greek but the teacher then"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 3 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 596 HPCS never really is a witness of the student speaking to the ancient Greeks, see? He doesn't pay too much attention to this. So therefore, in studying study, I avoided all those fields where observation of the stu-dent was not easily attained, the actual doingness of the student was not easily viewed. That ruled out a field for the study of study, you see? So immediately engineering technology, we could learn nothing from that because, of course, nobody ever sits around and watches whether or not the engineer builds the bridge, you see? So it had to be something as intimate as Scientology, which is, the Instructor teaches the student how to audit a case and then, oddly enough, is able at that very minute to have him turn around and audit the case, see? So this, of course, has a tendency to force progress and advance upon us and we are able then to make a further advance because we have an instantaneous inspection of the results of our study. So, perhaps one of the reasons why the civilization has not made considerable pro-gress in this line is because very few subjects are in this category, whereby the subject in-structed is not instantly practiced before the professor. Do you see that? So that therefore gives us – gives us you might say the driver's seat in this subject where – of study – because we can see instantly with no comm lag at all. We don't find out whether or not this fellow turned out to be a great and famous barrister, don't you see, twenty years hence. We don't find that out, but we find out whether this person became an auditor before the day is out. Can the person use this principle? Well, we walk right over into the auditing section and there is the same auditor that we've just had in practical and we've just taught him something in practical and there he sits, you see? There he sits with his bare face showing. Right there! And when the Practical Supervisor also does auditing supervision, he continues to work very, very hard to put his practical across to a point where he sees it all of a sudden in a session. You see? So, we probably have a closer look than anyone else. Now, there's a great zone of tolerance in most studies. They expect the student to be very amateurish. Let's say we're teaching a craft like silversmithing; now, we don't expect he is going to heat up any silver without burning his fingers, see? So we get a big gradient win: He heated up some silver without burning his fingers, see? Well, that's all very well and that's fine but we don't expect him to make a tea service that is going to please the general manager of the British Silver Trust in his first few weeks of silversmithing. We sort of would expect that fellow to go out and hang around silversmithing and improve his design and work with a master and gradually get there and when he is about fifty, why, turn out some cracking marvel of a piece, you see, that the general manager of British Tea Services, Limited, or something of the sort, would approve of and buy and use as a standard design, you see? There's always this comm lag. But there was a field, not to stretch it too far, there was a field where instant inspection was feasible and so that field lent itself peculiarly to study on the subject of study which would be analogous to Scientology and that was the field of photography. Now, when you tell a student to take a picture of a tree and he goes out and takes a picture of a tree, you in very short order are going to see a picture of a tree. And if it is upside down and if he has cut it in half and if he didn't hold his camera level and if he had camera shake, all of these things are immediately and distinctly visible. Furthermore, we have a direct and exact result of a combi-"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 4 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 597 HPCS nation of actions which, of course, is important. Can he put a sandwich on a tray? Well, all right, he can put a sandwich on a tray, but that's not a very complex action. Can he make a sandwich and put it on a tray? See? All right, well can he make the bread, you see, and make the filler and make the sandwich and make the tray and put it on the tray? You see how this field – you could suddenly start broadening, see, out a subject. Well, I'm afraid that we're in – very close in – to that kind of a subject in Scientology. It's a subject of complex actions. It's not a subject of simple actions. No matter how hopefully a person in a co-audit when he first comes in – I'm talking about a HAS co-audit – believes, no matter how touchingly he believes that all it is, is he has to sit there and nod, he very, very soon becomes aware that he is engaged in a complex action. He is expected to say something and this probably strikes him with the greatest of shock when he finally realizes he is ex-pected to say something and that it is up to him to get the person he's auditing to say some-thing. Now, we've got a double complexity: he not only himself has to say something but the person he is auditing has to have something said to him which will cause the person he is au-diting to say something. Do you follow this through? Then he's got to hear this and then he has got to acknowledge it. Well, he probably finally masters this, off a canned piece of paper or something of the sort, and he finally masters this and he feels very triumphant, only to dis-cover that the person who sits opposite him in the co-audit, as it changes around, is not the same case. He gets different pcs and these pcs have different cases and this is pretty grim, because we knew all we had to say to somebody was, \"Well, how is your mother-in-law get-ting along.\" and we had a good session going. But this next fellow hasn't got a mother-in-law, [laughter] so that is a total stumbling block and you would be amazed how big a stumbling block that might look. Now he has to enter the technology, if he's told that he has to do some-thing with problems, he has to enter the technology of problems. What the devil is a problem? In order to talk to somebody about problems, or dream up things about problems for the fel-low to talk about, we have to know something about problems. Now, he's away into the sig-nificance of the mind, added to the actions which he is performing. Now, the normal way we go about this is to get him to perform the simple actions and then add the complexities to them one after the other, on the basis that the person would be-come confused if given too much too fast. So, we have a new discovery which we have made, long since, called gradient scales which applies in the field of study and that you teach somebody on a gradient. Well, what is meant by \"teaching somebody on a gradient\"? Well, a gradient of course refers to a grade which is sort of an uphill looking sort of picture, don't you see? It's a little bit more so each successive step. What we mean by a gradient: It gets steeper or it gets more complex or it takes in more the further you go. Well, that's a gradient and as long as we attack a gradient – as long as we attack the subject on a gradient of complexity, we give him this cycle. We move along into more and more numerous actions, but we try to teach him each action that we're going to add to – we're going to add to this action – so we're going to teach him that action so well that it doesn't worry him. And then our next action that we teach him – this has its own complexity, but it's"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 5 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 598 HPCS done in combination with this first action. But if the first action is still worrying him and he hasn't got that down, then our next action is going to throw him. When you see somebody getting confused, then he hasn't gotten down the more fun-damental action he should have gotten down before he advanced into more complex action. It isn't that he doesn't understand the more complex action – he's not even confronting that ac-tion; he's still confronting this more basic action. See, he hasn't learned that basic action. Well now, the only place you can err in this area is trying to start in too high on the gradient and you can make that mistake and you can make that mistake with the greatest of ease. It's the easiest mistake to make because nothing else is done in the modern university except make this mistake. They don't educate – they make that mistake. Modern education is really the art and science of making the mistake of too steep, too quick, before anybody has learned anything about it. For instance, I've seen German taught with ferocity and velocity and the next thing you know, we were learning all about Schiller, whoever the hell he was. \"What's Schiller, where are we? How come?\" \"Well, that's just in the lesson text. See, that's the fourth week's lesson text.\" \"Yeah, wait a minute. What happened to the alphabet?\" Nobody can read a German alphabet in the – that's used only to English Alphabets. You can't read one of those Gothic Alphabets. It's just gobbledygook! Looks like bird tracks! [laughter] Well, all right, you're going to teach somebody about the nuances of Schiller, are you? When it doesn't even look like words on a page! He's not yet convinced there are words on the page, you see? He thinks the printer spilled some ink. He thinks his book has been damaged. Nobody bothers to teach him the German alphabet. Where was he supposed to learn it? We look in vain for where he was supposed to learn the German alphabet, because it's not any part of the syllabus of that course. Ah, but it's German 1; where the hell is German 0? Well, they must assume that that must have been in your last life. So, you can make with the greatest of ease the mistake of entering a gradient too high. A multimillion pound activity was carried on in Africa teaching a number of tribes down there \"Soil Erosion: The Techniques of Preserving Soil and Preventing Erosion.\" Par-liament up here was just appropriating money, along with peanuts, and so forth. It was back in the days when we were all comrades. And they were appropriating money for these ground-nuts – peanuts to you Americans – which never grew and nobody could do anything with them after they'd grown them because there was other things they did it with, see? Same time they were pouring this flood of money, as a support program to groundnuts – they got into soil preservation and preventing soil erosion. And they poured the money into this and they poured people down there and they had people in an airlift going down to Central Africa to solve these staggering and fantastic problems they were having in trying to teach these natives how to not erode soil. And the native was taking this in just about the way oil takes in water. I'm sure he was being polite and gentlemanly about listening but brother, he was really paying no attention."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 6 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 599 HPCS And it took a Scientologist in the middle of the program to straighten it out. He did it with gradients which we already knew about. He just decided that the government had cut in too late. The native didn't have any reason to not erode soil. Well, there was all of Africa full of soil – how come we were preserving it? It seemed to be the most bountiful substance he ever had anything to do with. And this dropped back to the fact that he had no idea of future. So this Scientologist sat down patiently and ran around and wrote them up something that they used in the program and one has never heard about it since, so it must have been very successful. No more billions are being promoted in that direction anyway. Just this: That you had to teach the native that there was such a thing as the future and that his future welfare of his children and tribe depended to a large degree on his still having pastures to graze and areas to grow things in. And they taught them this very carefully and considerable enthusiasm greeted soil erosion. Now, you very often make a mistake in a Comm Course when you find a new student comes into that Comm Course and you are teaching him this and you're teaching him that and you're teaching him this drill and you're teaching him that drill and he doesn't know how to sit in a chair, man. Now, you could go more fundamentally than this – you could go more fun-damental – maybe he didn't know why he was there. Maybe he came in by mistake. Maybe he still has some weird idea about how come he's there. Now you're teaching him a Comm Course. Well, you're not teaching a Comm Course to anybody that's there, so our basic gradi-ent on education is to get somebody there. That sounds too simple but almost every elemen-tary teacher in the world is making that mistake today. They are teaching children who aren't there. And you'll find the most marvelous increases in IQ and learning rate take place under that very, very funny simplicity and most of their big educational strides made with Scientol-ogy are simply based on that one little tiny factor of getting the student there. Well now, they don't know what they're doing, some of these teachers. They think they're doing something esoteric or wonderful when they tell the student class – when they tell the class each morning to \"Look at the front wall, look at the back wall and look at the ceiling and look at the floor.\" Maybe they're doing it \"because Ron said so,\" but it seems to work and this seems to have a great deal of workability and the children all appear to have an enormous increase in intelligence even though this is only used for five or ten minutes each morning. Well, that's quite marvelous if it's only used for five or ten minutes each morning be-cause the process obviously isn't run long enough to even get into the zone of having to be flattened. Nothing is going to happen here to a case to amount to anything. What they haven't noticed before is that the children weren't there to be taught and of course they look more in-telligent if they are there. Try and run an IQ test on somebody who is not sitting at the desk taking one. So, actually this is completely aside from the ramifications of havingness and other factors that would be involved in this – that first step is just to get somebody there. That's the first step. Now, maybe in a Central Organization somebody up in the Academy may be saying to himself, \"Well, the Letter Registrar already got the person here. Getting the person here is"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 7 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 600 HPCS the duty of the Letter Registrar. The person came in to take the course, didn't he? Well, the Letter Registrar was supposed to have written him letters, so obviously, then, the person is there.\" I've already had this explained to me. Do you see the rationale? No, they've got a body in class. They've got a body in class. Now, why the person is actually there? They don't know that. Well, the fads hit this course. Yeah, once in a blue moon we'll have a new fad – not once in a blue moon either – everybody will get on a fad thing. For a while, a year or two ago, I've forgotten exactly when it was, \"the problem they solved by coming to Saint Hill\" was in vogue and for a while, why, everybody was just making marvelous TA and gorgeous case gains and so forth – \"the problem they solved by coming to Saint Hill.\" \"What did coming to Saint Hill solve as a problem for you?\" See? And then they would run this out and they'd square it up and it's marvelous, and so forth. And I don't believe I ever thought about it very much, but my laughter on this situation would be based on this very elementary fact: That they weren't really running a Problems Process at all, see? They were simply making the per-son aware of the fact that they had arrived at Saint Hill. So, we don't do that anymore because we've got a little checksheet which goes in and out and is sometimes skipped and sometimes put back in again, which has to do with getting the person to go around and spot the locations of everything around here, see? We take care of it with a little checksheet. They're supposed to get this and supposed to get that and they're supposed to look over this and supposed to that, don't you see? So, there is a Touch Assist familiarity, so that – that wipes out two things: the vast mystery of where they have arrived at and the fact that they have arrived. So, your first gradient in education is to get somebody there. It doesn't much matter how you solve it. I have shown you here – get the little kids in school to spot the ceiling and spot the teacher and spot the floor and so forth. You've got them there now and they respond by appearing to be far more intelligent than they were before, so you say, \"Well, look at the tremendous IQ gain this gives.\" No, nobody is smart where he is not. All right, so there – there is the idea of education by gradient and the – repeat – the mistake you can make in education by gradient is a big mistake and that is: failure to undercut the gradient, failure to get simple enough, failure to get the primary action. You must get the starting action that the person can be made sure of so that he can then go on to another action and become sure of that and go on to another action that he becomes sure of, you see? Well, now if you haven't ever gotten a low enough or simple enough first action for the person to become sure of, then the person advancing into the next zone finds that very, very complex and starts to feel sort of spinny and then the instructor starts going mad trying to explain to this student what this is all about – this step two, see? Well, he has never gotten to step one and from there on his education is a complete mish-mash. And if you want to un-scramble anybody's difficulties with training, and so forth, then you will just have to find the gradient that they overlooked or skipped or missed, after which they entered into a confusion. And this would be very easy to find on an E-Meter, extremely easy on an E-Meter and that is simply: the E-Meter would register an early moment of confusion about study or train-ing and it would register it repeatedly, that is two or three times if it's never been resolved. It"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 8 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 601 HPCS would only go flick, or something like that if it had existed and then been resolved, you see? There would just be the residual charge left on the time track. But if it's repetitively reading, if it reads several times and seems to read very strongly as he discusses it – gives you in other words tone arm action – why, then you know that it has never been resolved to this day. Now, the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden for-ward with them into the present. Those are the difficulties that have to be treated and han-dled – the difficulties which they have had in the past which have ridden forward to them into the present. You can always get a registry on a difficulty somebody has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the time track as having had a difficulty. But if it is not riding for-ward with him into the present, you are simply using auditing to contact it again and it will blow. It won't restimulate particularly, it usually just blows. For instance, if you have had somebody get a deep, a very heavy surge, let me put it this way – if you get somebody got a – get a heavy surge on a meter in a session, you can ac-tually put them back into that moment of the session when they got the surge and you will get some ghost of that surge. That's not riding forward with them in the present time. You actu-ally took them back into the past to find the surge. But you can get that surge back again be-cause what you did was get the impression it made on the session. You didn't get the original reading – that blew. But then the fact that it did do this in the session is still a matter of record which can be picked up. So therefore, accordingly, you could go back into the time track of an individual and you could get an emotional reaction for everything a person had ever been emotional about. Or you could get heavy reactions – it isn't that the reactions are necessarily heavy or soft – but you could get reactions about what a person has been emotional about that he is still emo-tional about. Now, get the slight difference here. One is simply the impression on the time track of having been emotional. Well, you'll get a – you'll get a needle read on that. And the other one is a moment on the time track when he has been emotional that he is still emotional about. The thing has never been cleared up, in other words. And the difference between those two reactions is one will fade instantly, the first one – he has simply been emotional about some-thing; he is not still emotional about that thing, that's long since gone, you will simply get the whooh on the needle – that needle's going to move, just contacting the earliest point or the point when it occurred, see, you are going to get a needle reaction. But the other thing that you're going to run into, if it is still current, it will repeat. It doesn't blow through just being contacted – it now repeats and you can get more repeat. Well, that means it has ridden forward in time and has never been resolved. I just make this point to you. As an auditor you are only interested in those things which the individual has never resolved. You're not interested in just those things which he didn't resolve. You get the shadow of a difference between? He didn't resolve it, so what? He never did find out how to get along with his commanding officer, but – he never did – but it's not riding forward in time with him. It isn't even capable of being restimulated, therefore it will read once and go bvop and it flattens; see, it's right now, it's out. Now, you could revivify him or regress him to that moment in time and start running him through incidents which are"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 9 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 602 HPCS not in restimulation and oddly enough you could get some built up that would go into res-timulation. As an auditor you have considerable power over the mind, you see, you can do some interesting things with it. So, there's two reactions here that you are interested in: There's the reaction that simply was there and isn't bothering the fellow – it hasn't ridden forward in time with him, but you can get him back to it and it reacts on the meter; and the other action is one that has not only been active at the time but is active now without any difficulty whatsoever. You don't have to go back in time to find this thing. It's going to react right away and the only meter difference that you will see between those two reactions is that one, the one which is still with him and is riding forward in time with him, and so forth, that one is repetitively reading. It will read and it will read again and it will read and it will read again, you see? When you are checking out things you have to make sure that you've got something that will repeat. One of the main faults that you make in R6 is that you do not ever ask for the repeat read. Well, I wouldn't give you two nickels and a collar button, anytime, ever, for a one-read checkout – achto! Now, do you see why? Is maybe you checked it earlier and it read. Well, when you check it again, you might get the earlier read, you might get the moment in the session when it read before. Do you understand? So you are only interested in a read that will repeat itself. Reads that don't repeat themselves have either blown, or they haven't ridden forward in time, anyhow, so the devil with them. If you can't get something to read twice, skip it. If you can make it read twice, realize that it's riding forward with the pc and is therefore worrying him. Still worrying him to this day. Now, all of this is necessary technology, as elementary as that may be, that's necessary technology to an understanding of how you would locate somebody's early confusions with regard to an educational subject. Because of course he was confused; he was confused every time he attacked a new point on the gradient, but he unconfused afterwards. The meter will still register those moments of first confusion, but they will register as only onces, so they're not important. This, then, I have to tell you so that you can see and evaluate the observation. And then you get used to this and then you get some subjective reality on it, you realize what I am telling you is true. \"Yes! Oh, he was very confused the first time he looked at the letter 'A.' He didn't know what that was – that was – yeah.\" Well, you get a read – one shot, see? You get a small read there on the needle, the needle moved. \"What about the confusion about the alphabet?\" \"Yeah, the letter 'A'.\" Whoom! – the needle moves and you say, \"All right, now about the letter 'A',\" and there is no motion. He isn't still confused about \"A.\" But let's take this bird now and we say, \"What about the letter 'A'?\" and it goes whoompf! Now it's done it once. \"What about 'A'!?\" Whoompf! \"Well, how about – how about – can you tell me something more about being disturbed about this formation of the"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 10 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 603 HPCS letter 'A?\" Whoompf! Now, you suddenly realize this bird can't write, see? You just – from your various observations of the pc, you've suddenly remembered having observed this, see? You didn't need the observation until that moment, but this guy can't write. Well, you want to clean up his writing. Well, let's find out what underlay that confusion. Now, ARC must have preceded all misemotion and bad reactions. You don't have a bad reaction unless there has been ARC in the first place. There's got to have been ARC with something in order to make a bad action occur. You've heard me say that often enough. Well, all right, how about this – how about this confusion? Do you address the confusion in itself? No, it's just sort of an out-of-ARC subject. It's never the confusion that the person is supposed to be in, by himself and the Instructor and that's why education breaks down. Now, let's go over that again. It's not the confusion that the student is trying to learn and the Instructor is trying to teach him. If they are having any difficulty with that at all, then that's a guarantee that it isn't the right confusion. You can just chalk that up with a great big red mark. Student can't learn it – you follow me? We're talking now about a heavy reaction here, not just a little old light brush-over – the student can't learn it, and the Instructor can't get it through the student's head. Now, what are we looking at? We are looking at a lower point on the gradient which was skipped, getting back to what we were talking about in the first place. Here's this point on the gradient that he didn't master and then went on to the next point. With that next point he had enough confusion to cause him to be overwhelmed and he never did get that point. And when you look it over on the meter, that's the point you're going to get. You're not going to get the original point – you're going to get the next point on the gradient. So, one of the sneakers that made this very difficult to solve was the fact that the thing the student is apparently having trouble with is never the thing the student is having trouble with. And you can save yourself a great many Instructor hours if you recognize that and get a good grasp on that, in actual fact. Now this, of course, follows the pattern of the mind, doesn't it? If the pc knows what is worrying him and if he is worrying then – if he's worrying – then that isn't what he's worried about. See, we know that. If you know all about what's wrong with you, that isn't what's wrong with you, brother, because of course, that would as-is and cease to be wrong with you. That's elementary, see? So, this applied to education gives us this other weird look – that this same set of data applies in the field of training. And what the student is very confused about and unable to move forward into and what the Instructor can't seem to teach this student is not then the right point of address for instruction. That must then immediately, just by that adjudication, that must be the wrong point of address. And the Instructor just pulls off of that and takes a better, longer look at this situation. See, that's elementary, see? Let me give you an example – this becomes – this is terribly elementary, very, very simple stuff. You can very easily overlook it: one, very easily not credit that this has got this much jolt in it. I know an Instructor in a slight state of shock at some of the results that he's suddenly getting applying some of this material, you see, on a student. \"And did you know...?\" You know, that sort of thing – didn't realize it was that strong. A Theory Instructor is checking out a student on a bulletin and gets to paragraph three and decides the student"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 11 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 604 HPCS can't pass it. But the student has been having such a dreadful time that the Theory Instructor decides that this student had better have a little bit of instruction. He's not going to give him a pass on this but he just – quite ordinary – he's just tired of having him foul up on this particu-lar point. The student there can't ever seem to get beyond this point, see? So he says, \"Now-now-now-look, look-look-look-now. Can you get the idea that bla-bla-bla-bla,\" and he takes up, you see, the third paragraph. And the student gets all foggy, and the Instructor says, \"Now, just a minute. Let's see, how can I put this a little simpler? How can I put it a little eas-ier?\" See, the Instructor actually is reaching in the right direction, but he's still staying on what the student is supposed to be confused about, that's the mistake he's making. \"But how can I get this a little simpler? Now, how can I get it a little lower on the gradient?\" Now this student can't get it and the Instructor can't teach him. Now, the first thing you should know at once is that we're one or more steps beyond what the student was really confused about. Now, it goes this elementary; you then go back and find what word in the second paragraph – which obviously has been handsomely passed – the student didn't understand. And it may not be a Scientology word at all. It may be some common English word, just like that. And all of a sudden, why, the student says, \"Oh.\" You see, this is not prior in time just because it's the earlier paragraph in the bulletin, it just happens that bulletins happen to be written more or less on a gradient. That's why you get the apparency of the earlier moment then. But they've actually gotten to this point then and they didn't grasp the lower point of the gradient, so the upper point of the gradient is just bvuuurrr! And the moment they get into this upper point of the gradient it's, \"God! \" You know? And the walls are getting closer and there's little bright spots appearing in front of their eyes and they feel sort of headachy. It's physiological. It's no wonder the French over there – of course in a harder time, during Napoleonic times we could have said, \"Who cares how many Frenchmen get killed?\" do you see – but today we shouldn't have that calloused attitude and we ought to do something about the French educational system because they drive more students to suicide than you could easily count. They're specialists, specialists at making students commit suicide. The American uni-versity leads in as a close second. They just disgrace the fellow and send him down to skid row, if he errs. If they've made the mistake of too fast a gradient, then they condemn the fel-low. Crazy! You get how severe this is. This gets into – here is another salient point, I should not just interject in here, but I should give you full blast, is: Study can produce a physiological reaction and it can produce some pleasant ones and it can produce some confoundedly unpleasant ones. You can have some of the wildest physical reactions just from the fact of study that you care to have any-thing to do with. And this isn't just studying Scientology, man, this is studying how to paint barns – and it's not for nothing some student will be sitting there at his drawing board or something like that and he'll be getting more and more – he'll be getting more and more and more and more spinny, and he feels sort of weird and he's making himself spots in front of the eyes. And he's making himself sick trying to study any further. And of course, if he's being pressured forward against time, for a final examination, he cannot sit back and go for a walk"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 12 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 605 HPCS in the park, he can't do anything like that. He's got to sit there and wrap the towel around his head, don't you see, and swill up the coffee and of course he's just keying himself in like mad, he's tearing himself to pieces, and so forth. It's no wonder. Well, what is the trouble with him at that moment when all this happens? Well, the trouble with him is not what he is studying, it's what he has failed to study, just before. This is always his hang-up. When you get a physiological reaction you've got a skip on the gradient, that you can be absolutely certain of. You've skipped the gradient. You are all of a sudden going into something or other, and you are studying how to lay sticks of wood across a path in order to subdivide the thing and measure it up to be concreted or the number of grains of po-tassium bichromate that you're supposed to pour in if it is a British manufacturer as opposed to American manufacturer and you say, \"What's this?\" Now, it isn't just a missing datum. Don't get that idea, see? It isn't a missing datum. It's something on the subject of the mixture of chemicals or – see, it can be an analogous – it can be an allied subject where a more fundamental datum is or exists on... See, the gradient was skipped on an allied subject, see – or it was just the paragraph ahead of this in the text. See, it's not always the paragraph ahead of this in the text. Sometimes the fellow all these years has wondered, \"How do you really measure something when it's of irregular shape?\" you see? And, \"How-h-ow-ha-h-o-w?\" And then all of a sudden he's got this thrown in his teeth, you see? \"Well you measure out this concrete walk and you so forth and so forth and now the calculus which is superannuated on this sub-ject, is so on...\" and he's trying to understand the calculus – he's trying to understand the cal-culus – and trying to understand the cal – . There's nothing wrong with the calculus. He doesn't know how to measure a walk – and he's been keyed in by some sentence that went right along with what he thinks he's wor-ried about. It's right there next door – only it's a blank. And you know, the whole subject goes blank? The whole surrounding area goes blank. It's like you shoot the top off one skyscraper and the whole town disappears. I mean it's that peculiar a phenomenon, see? You say, \"Well, how could that whole page disappear?\" You know, or \"How could that whole textbook disappear?\" If a student is having very heavy going he will have words vanish off the page. I just had an experience a very, very short time ago; I was trying to look up a word in the dictionary that was included on a page which I was having a hard time coming to grips with, and you know, the word had disappeared out of the column and I said, \"Come off it now, it couldn't possibly be missing out of this column. It must be in this dictionary!\" And – specialized dictionary, and so forth, and I just sort of gritted my teeth and concentrated me eyeballs on it and, by George, it was right there. And, you know, it hadn't been in the column a moment before? [laughter] In this particular instance, I however, know what I don't quite understand, I know what I have skipped doing and I've got to go ahead and do something about it, because it's just get-ting more and more and more into my road. I do not know so that I can bark them off, the complementary absorbing colors by rote. I can't tell you every color combination which ab-"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 13 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 606 HPCS sorbs every component of white light, except one, you see? That sounds very complex, does-n't it? It is! But it's this kind of an action. But going on and studying beyond this point, which I went ahead and did, because I just didn't sit down and figure out a color wheel and get it all down within an inch of its life – it's lost back there. See? I crowded on past it. Now, somewhere in the vicinity of that is a non-comprehend. I have got that bit of noncomprehend pretty well spotted but that isn't what I'm studying now and that isn't what I'm having trouble with. I'm actually running into a point where things are disappearing off a page, much less headaches. But just going beyond this, beyond this – well, there's something back in that area. It is very easy and so on, but nobody has made one of these wheels; there isn't an illustration of one which gives it by complemen-tary colors in this textbook. And there are no wheels that give you primary colors in terms of what absorbs \"not them\" from white light, see? What absorbs \"not them.\" No list of what doesn't absorb them, so that would sort of have to be compiled and I'd have to sit down and draw this whole thing, I'd have to memorize all of these points of the thing and then I know I would have it straight. And about that time when I started to do this, something would fly up and hit me in the teeth like, \"What the hell is cyan?\" see? \"What's this cyan? What shade is cyan? I always thought cyan was blue, obviously it is not blue. I have all my life been told by medical exam-iners that when you fed somebody cyanide they turn blue and...\" See, here is a big bunch of confusion going on here and there is probably some foolish word like that kicking around in that area someplace, so I'll just have to go back and look over this area, because I know when it began, you see? That is I know the point that occurred before it began. See, you can get clever enough to spot where are you at. And all you have to ask your-self or all you have to ask a student, \"Where weren't you having trouble? Now where are you having trouble? Good. It's at the end of where you weren't having trouble.\" See, that's very simple, isn't it? So the formula is that you find out where the student wasn't having trouble with the subject and that meant that he had gone that far on the gradient successfully. And then find out where he began having trouble and you pick it up right at the tag end of where he wasn't having trouble and it lies in that immediate area. You can actually circumscribe it within a few words. I mean, you can do it that precisely. You can pinpoint. You'll have the half a paragraph that it's in or you'll have – sometimes you can get it down to the half a sen-tence that it is in and then you start plowing it out. But don't expect the student to be able to tell you exactly what it is that he is having trouble with, because that's why he is having trou-ble with it. So, instruction would consist of guiding a student along a gradient of known data. It wouldn't be inventing new solutions to the student's confusions. You start inventing new solu-tions to a student's confusion, you're just going to get in more and more trouble. Why? Be-cause you are already giving him – he has already got something he doesn't comprehend, now you're going to give him an incomprehensible that solves it. Good instruction is a system of backtracking. A student will go forward – you can al-most leave that on automaticity. He will go forward like a shot bear. Zarroom! He'll go into a subject. And all of a sudden you'll hear these – you'll hear this loud screak and the paws are"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 14 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 607 HPCS smoking, you see? Then you hear a thud you know? And then you feel the atmosphere around you shake. There's something happened. Well, exactly what did happen? Well, he went right over the top of one point on the gradient, thought he understood it, didn't understand it, went into the next point of the gradi-ent and ran into a brick wall. So the trouble with him is, it wasn't the next point on the gradi-ent, the trouble with him was that last point on the gradient that he thought he understood, but didn't. So therefore, it becomes very difficult with a student sometimes to spot this, because he's so positive that he understood that last point. Yet the evidence that he didn't is sitting in front of your eyes: He's having trouble with the next point. See, this fellow says, \"Oh, I learned how to sit in a chair, I learned how to sit in a chair.\" You're teaching a Comm Course, see? \"I learned how to sit in a chair. I know all about that. It's sitting in a chair and looking at somebody in front of me that is absolutely impossi-ble! That's terrible! I can't do it anymore!\" You say, \"Well, let's see.\" Here – here's... In the absence of this technology, one's re-action might have been, \"Well, let's see, how can I fix up a drill here to get him to look at that student?\" Now, you see how that would lay an egg and extend his training? See? \"Now, how can I figure out something whereby he can confront this bird?\" Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah – this is not – you are at the wrong point of the gradient, see? Here's just a practical application. You say, \"Well now, it's about sitting in a chair, see, that was – wasn't that the drill you had immediately before you had the drill of confronting the pc? Wasn't that the drill, huh, wasn't that the drill?\" \"Well, there was a little thing that came in between there,\" he suddenly remembers. \"What was that?\" \"Well, that was sit in the chair comfortably and of course that's impossible.\" \"Oh, oh, there was something else in this thing.\" \"Yeah, well, anybody can sit in a chair, actually you can force yourself to sit in a chair for hours.\" \"Well, how do you go about sitting in a chair?\" \"Well, you sit in the chair and you bring your heels together, you understand? And if you bring your heels together hard enough and press them in, you can press the calves of your legs out against the outer sides of the chair and you can keep yourself awake and erect.\" What the hell is all this? See, knowing the principle of undercut on the gradient, you see, you would find that out. But if you didn't know the principle you would just keep knocking your brains out, trying to train this person how to confront another human being. And they haven't – they actually wouldn't have any trouble confronting somebody else except they are trying to confront two things at once. They are confronting keeping their heels together and they're... See, they ha-ven't learned how to do that and now they're trying to confront something else at the same time. Their attention is split and they are starting to get very headachy. And then you find out"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 15 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 608 HPCS there's something wild about it they haven't understood, like: \"Well, why do you audit in a chair?\" \"Why? How should you audit?\" \"Well, couldn't you audit lying in a bed? I get very tired auditing.\" You see? All kinds of wild little things come up. You don't pay very much attention to what they've got to do. You don't try to solve those things. But these considerations have got to get into the fresh air. Now, all of a sudden we've got this fellow – he suddenly looks this over: \"Oh, you mean you just sit in a chair? Oh, you – oh, wait a minute, that takes some doing! Oh! What do you mean, just sit in a chair? Just sit in a chair! No, you can't just sit in a chair! Impossible!\" \"All right. Now, just tell me what's impossible about it.\" You don't even have to be an auditor to instruct, see? I mean you don't have to do a lot of clever auditing: \"What's so im-possible about it? What's impossible about it?\" \"Keeping your back two-and-a-half inches from the back of the chair, and so forth, is impossible because you have to keep – well, actually, you have to keep measuring if it's two-and-a-half inches, don't you?\" [laughter] It's pretty hard to believe until it has happened to you, but the whole next paragraph after the sentence which contained the word one didn't understand, can just disappear right out of this world. It can do the wildest piece of disappearing anybody ever saw. It just van-ishes. Almost a white piece of blank page and try to check the student out on this and you can check him out on the whole bulletin, but, by George, there's no paragraph there; no subject matter there of any kind whatsoever. You run that back, you'll find out there's something just prior to that collision they didn't understand. And if they didn't understand that with great vio-lence then you must realize that it's just before that; and you start running some student back, I don't know quite where you're going to wind up. Well, I wouldn't try to wind up outside this lifetime, but I don't know quite where you would wind up. Become interesting what would go on. Now, there's the primary mechanism of study. A study is a con... a study – I almost used a five-dollar word – I will use a five-dollar word – is a concatenation of certainties. It's a string of certainties. And these are a string of confidences and competences. There are many, many ways to promote these feelings of competence and confidence, and so forth, but the best way to do it is just a head-on thing of just making sure – not that the student walks slowly, but to make sure that the student walks certainly. Don't hold somebody back because you're not sure he's walking certainly. The other point is, is always let a student get into trouble before you help him out. Don't ever help out a student before he's in trouble. This guy is doing his Comm Course drills right straight through to the bitter end, he does them like a little wound up doll, everything is beautiful and smooth and so forth, well, what are you trying to do – find something to train? I mean, what are you going to do, rack this guy over until you can find something – till you create something that can be wrong? Or why would you – why would you do anything with"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 16 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 609 HPCS it? See, I'm just making the point: Why would you do anything with this? Your participation is not invited there by any difficulty. You see, why worry? And that is one of the reasons why study uniformly spread across a group is a mistake. See? Students run into trouble that the Instructor doesn't detect and other students aren't run-ning into trouble and they just try to make a medium average of trouble for the whole course, the whole class, you see? Well, the way to do is to let a student run into all the brick walls he wants to run into and the only thing you've got to be alert for is a student who has run into a brick wall. Now, when he has run into the brick wall, recognize that he has hit a gradient, hit a stage or a point beyond where he didn't understand something; that elementary. And the next must is: Don't ever take up with him what he doesn't understand. It's a waste of trouble – waste of time. He doesn't know what he doesn't understand. Always cut it back. \"What were you studying immediately ahead of this?\" Same formula I gave you before, \"What moment there weren't you in trouble?\" \"Oh, I wasn't in trouble over this and that, and so forth, that was all easy.\" \"All right, what moment did you get into trouble on it?\" \"Oh well, it's – oh-oh-oh – terrible and terrible and terrible, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...\" \"All right.\" Now, you've made a bracket there, haven't you, you've got parentheses; you've got the point of no trouble and you've got the point of trouble and now you must recognize that in the dead center, between, you will find the real trouble. Now, the clever Instructor, knowing this, could spot it right on out. Actually he doesn't have to be terribly clever, but it's a matter of \"All right, you say you were doing fine with this bulletin right up to this,\" and we finally spot it. I would even go so far, if I were having a lot of trouble, to slam the guy on the meter. Meters are made to be used. And I'd say, \"Now, you're doing all right on this first paragraph, you're doing all right on the next paragraph and you say you ran into trouble here about para-graph five. Well, let me look at paragraph five; yeah, there is a typographical error there in paragraph five. That's perfectly correct, there is one. Now, let's see, you had number four – number four, you didn't have any trouble with number four, paragraph four here, which starts so-and-so and so-and-so; you say you didn't have any trouble with that?\" \"No, no, I didn't have a bit of trouble with that.\" \"All right, now let's see, let's get down toward the end of paragraph four – paragraph four here; now, will you please listen to this sentence: 'So-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so...' clang! What is the meaning of the word 'disability'?\" \"Oh, well, Christ! Nobody could define 'disability'!\" [laughter] You got the idea? It isn't even that any big mental quirk sits behind it. No vast amount of case has to be taken into it. He just doesn't dig this word, man! Why he doesn't dig it, we don't even care, but he doesn't."},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 17 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 610 HPCS Now, what's very interesting is this is one of the first points of research, 1947, is the influence of a mislearned word on a life and that was the point of research. I'd picked up some of this from Commander Thompson on association of words and there are numerous other things about this, but I had jumped to an unreasonable assumption about this. As far as I was concerned it was relatively provable or unprovable, but it was relatively nowhere. They talked about association, they talked about this, they talked about that. Then I assumed, \"Then it must be that a word will make somebody sick.\" Well, what could be wrong with a word? So I started tracing backwards and getting people to redefine words and that sort of thing. I won't say I had any remarkable luck because there was no auditing technology that went along with it, but believe me people were sure interested. I wasn't using any method of testing at that particular moment that would have given me what the result was if it was. I lost a lot of people I was working with. I know that's a direct result. That is to say, they walked out and went back to work, and so forth, and didn't turn up in my office anymore. But that still didn't demonstrate very much for that period, because it wasn't well followed up. I didn't have somebody on a telephone to call them all up and say, \"Well, why didn't you come back the next week?\" You know? But those that I did contact on the thing, \"Oh, I feel fine now,\" or \"You know, it's really something else that's worrying me these days, it's the fact that I haven't got a job in Mexico,\" or something, you know? Certainly what was worrying them ceased to worry them, that was about the only thing I established out of it. Now, we find GPMs and the tremendous mass and significance mixed up with those and we must assume then, that all significances expressed as symbols – words, that is all sig-nificances expressed as words, which of course are a symbol of a significance – are locks on the GPMs. We know what's at the middle of this hurricane now. Now, we walk back and we take a look at this thing and we are going to find out that any word that you handle which is not in the GPMs is in actual fact to some degree a lock on the GPMs. And if not on actual GPMs, certainly on implants. They got the best of all worlds cov-ered. Very heavy locks, capable of producing a considerable amount of commotion in some-body's skull piece. Your skull bone could throb for quite a time. See? So when you got a – when you get yourself a – when you get yourself a good look at this, you recognize then that this is a symbological effort and one of the first reactions is simply become afraid of all words; then the next immediate action after that is to – well, to say, \"To hell with it,\" and be-come very stupidly adventurous about it; then eventually fall back into something sensible, like don't stand around and chant a known end word at somebody's face for half an hour. Not that you will do much to them, they might be stuck elsewhere on the track, but you certainly louse yourself up. [laughs] So, when we – when we examine this broad subject of teaching somebody something, we are examining the subject of relaying data to a person, which he can receive and under-stand in such a way that he will be able to use the data – the definition I gave you the other day just stated to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing now – and of course all of those are being done with words – words, motions, actions or examples. But there's some words mixed up in this."},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 18 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 611 HPCS So, when you get words on a bulletin, when you get words on an Instructor's comm line, when your words are going over to one of your students, well, don't be so sensitive about the Scientology vocabulary because, listen, you can make as much catastrophe in not naming a distinctly different part as you can in naming one too complexly. I ran into an example of this in this parallel course of study: \"Basic lighting\" and \"ba-sic profile lighting\" and I got toward the end of the book on portrait lighting with which I'd had terrible trouble. All the way through I was just running into trouble on this thing, trou-ble – trouble and somehow or another getting through and getting it crosswise and getting it straightened out, and so forth. And I found out the sin there was that they had called two dis-tinctly different things with the same word, \"basic.\" And I was called upon, I said, \"Now wait a minute\" I said to myself, \"before I take this exam, I better review what I've got here. The – let's see, there's three types of lighting, and one of them is Rembrandt and one of them is but-terfly and one of them is... I can't think of it! Now let's see, let's go over this again,\" and then I remembered that all the way through I had sort of dimly been... this is just different patterns, positions in which you put lights, not to hang you up on those things. Fancy names, aren't they? Rembrandt and butterfly: makes a butterfly because when the nose comes down it leaves a little shadow underneath the nose and you could imagine it to be a butterfly, see? [laughter] And when the photographic lighting makes a little shadow underneath the nose, why the pro calls it butterfly lighting. And Rembrandt is the face plane nearest the camera is less lighted than the face planes further from the camera but not line lighting – but this one is less lighted. It's very pretty – very pretty lighting, but those are – there are not very many – there are not very many ways you can put lights together. Here's these two; and what's the other one? What's the other one? I can't think of it, what's the other one, you know? Oh, well, I'll go back and study it over again, so I study it very, very carefully, study it all the way through, study it, study it, look it over, now I've got it all, I've gone back, good. \"Now, there's three kinds of lighting there. Wait – Rembrandt and butterfly and... where did it go?\" I look down into me head, have I got a 'ole in me skull these days? And finally I said, \"There's something very funny going on here,\" because I didn't quite know anything like at that mo-ment, because I was studying study, I didn't know the power that a messed-up definition could have, you know? And I went back and I looked and I looked and I looked and I looked and I looked and I finally found what it was. It's – there's a whole school of lighting, a whole system of lighting, known as basic lighting. It's just elementary lighting. You've got two lights and you shine one on the front of the being and you shine the other one on the side. That's all! And the ways you do that and the way his head is turned or shoulders are turned, while you're doing that, gives you this whole school of lighting. There's nothing fancy about it. The other two are the fancy lightings, but this one, which you simply – almost says, \"Turn light on the subject,\" I couldn't get and that was because under butterfly lighting there is a type of lighting, called \"basic profile light-ing,\" which everybody realizes is a butterfly lighting, but all professional photographers call \"basic profile.\" So, under butterfly lighting we have a kind of lighting called basic profile, but over here, under this other, this whole class of lighting is called basic lighting. And because they hadn't sufficiently had a differentiation in their nomenclature, they didn't have enough terms in other words – louse up, total confusion, see?"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 19 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 612 HPCS Well, that was the Instructors' confusion that was the people who were teaching you's confusion, because you obviously were going to fall into that trap. They just dug a pit, put a stake at the bottom of it and covered it up with leaves, man. And you've got one right now. Now, prepare for a little line charge. You've got an in-sufficiency of nomenclature. I know you'd never dream you had, but if you figure how many things there are in the mind that you – that you already have, you realize there's not much nomenclature for it. When you realize the few little things in the mind that the medicos had and the vast array of nomenclature; we've got a tremendous number of parts and things in the mind and not much nomenclature. And actually we don't have enough nomenclature and that would be the last sin in the world you'd think you would accuse Dianetics and Scientology of, but it's true. And you will agree with me in just about a split instant. There is a thing called an ARC break assessment and there's a bypassed charge as-sessment and hardly one of you monkeys have ever been able to tell the two apart or do either one of them. And I've lately watched you falling and falling in more pits and walk into more bear traps on this one subject than you can shake a stick at. Because a bypassed charge as-sessment is not an assessment. It's an auditing by list and the name of it should be \"Auditing by Bypassed Charge Lists\" or \"Auditing by List for Bypassed Charge.\" It's not an assessment. Now, you've begun to believe, you see, that an assessment is something that doesn't have anything to do with auditing and that's true. An ARC break assessment has nothing to do with auditing. You simply sit there and you reel it off, with your pc usually gritting his teeth to powder. And you finally see your meter react and you indicate the bypassed charge and you don't answer and you don't acknowledge and you jolly well had better not. If you value his sanity or yours on R6 material, you just sit there, man, and you reel this thing off and you find the bypassed charge and you indicate it right now. It's usually done in the middle of an ARC break. If you audit a person in an ARC break you will put him into a sad effect. So of course it can't be auditing! But unfortunately we have instantly, immediately afterwards, called a thing a bypassed charge assessment by which you take the same list but treat it differently and the person is not ARC broke when you have done it, so that is auditing. And this has been a source of enormous confusion to one and all, apparently. Why? Because both terms have the word \"assessment\" in them. So it's an inadequacy of nomencla-ture. There's a missing word, you follow? All right, so that's all the trouble you are having with regard to it. There isn't – the trouble isn't any worse than that, see? You can see that you could audit – auditing by list has to do with cleaning up each question, after all that's the Joburg and that's these things and you just read the question until it's clean. Read it and get it answered till it's clean and you go to the next one and you read it and answer until it's clean. Auditing by list. You can take the R6 list and you can do this with it. So, we had the same list, which gave a confusion and we had the same word attached to a process which gave a confusion, and so forth. So it's very, very hard, oddly enough now, to get auditors to do this. Well, that's funny, that it gets hard to get auditors to do this. There-fore, it must have a subtractive or a detractive action in excess of merely being misdefined."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 20 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 613 HPCS They couldn't do it; Auditing Supervisors were walking around in circles, \"Now, look! Please do an ARC break assessment on this pc, because he is blowing,\" and so forth. Come back, here is the fellow busy auditing by list, you know, doing a bypassed charge assessment, you know, cleaning up everything, listening to the pc, you know and so forth, all this sort of thing, you know? \"No, no, no!\" You know? \"Read the thing down the list and when you find the charge, and so forth, why, indicate it to the pc and that's all there is to this.\" \"Oh-oh, I see.\" So, in other words, a term can be confused by being used for two different distinct purposes. You could enter confusion then with not enough nomenclature. As a matter of fact it's probably, in the field of the mind, has been a more serious sin than too much nomencla-ture. Because the things were named in identification with one another. Do you follow me now? You've got this type of response? So of course, that will very shortly, as soon as I get around to pushing out a bulletin, that will very shortly become, of course: ARC break assess-ment is done so-and-so and so-and-so and not auditing; and then there's Auditing by List for Bypassed Charge and that becomes a completely different action. Now, you'll find out that's teachable. So, we've covered now two things here and these two things are: If you take a person up the gradient too steeply he will get lost at some step always because he is confused about the prior step and he will blame the step he is lost in, while being stuck, in actual fact, in the step he really didn't get out of – , and that's what makes it a masked area and which makes it upset; and that the responsibility for the subjective reaction of the student in a very large measure lies with the Instructor. Boy, that is a new departure, see? The student's attitude, and so forth, is really today with Scientology and what I am teaching you here, right in the hands of the Instructor. If you want to, you can almost produce the mental reaction you want to at will. You could blow a student off a course. It would work both ways – I'm not saying you'd do this, but this fellow is on course and you blow him off the course. You just with malice aforethought say, \"Well, all right, we're going to blow him off the course.\" One of the ways to do it is say, \"All right, now this is two people sitting in the chair there; they are actually both preclears and they are actually both at the same time auditors and there is no particular difference between the word 'auditor' and the word 'pc,' and so forth, and they really don't mean anything different at all. All right, very good. You got that straight now? Good.\" You won't have him there in about 24 hours, if he's green grass off the street. See what I mean? You could overtly produce that reaction. All right, now some guy is blowing and just as he leaves and you say, \"What word was it that I didn't get there?\" You will find out he'll stop moving, because you've already got part of the charge, see, just by indicating it's wrong with the words. All right, he'll stop exiting, in other words. \"Now let's trace it back. At what moment did you get confused?\" \"Well, it was in the last half-hour.\" \"Good, what happened in the first half-hour?\" see?"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 21 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 614 HPCS \"Oh, well, it was that word.\" \"Very good. All right, thank you very much.\" \"Oh, is that what that means?\" \"Yes.\" In other words, there's handling of the guy stays or the guy goes. There's the Instructor creating that effect or result with just the method of teaching he is using. Pretty sneaky, huh? You can get further along this line – there's more to learn on this particular subject but that is – but those things stand out like a beacon. The earlier gradient – the earlier part of the gra-dient – is the one he's fallen down on. Now, we get to the other section of it is – it is really always a word or phrase. Now, of course a word or phrase can be inadequate. I've got one going right now. I – nobody has both-ered to tell me why they use a yellow filter in a certain combination and in all the illustrations here sits this yellow filter. What is it doing there? What does it have to do with something?. I don't know. I haven't been told. I've not been demanded – it's not been demanded of me: Why is a yellow filter there? But yet, that is serving as just a little bit break there. I know there is something about this I don't know. So, you see the sentence could be inexplicit or it could omit the data or accidentally deprive somebody of the information. A typographical error will do this. The word \"cat\" is missing in the sentence: \"The dog chased a.\" All right, now we say to the student, \"Now, all right, let's tell us what that action is.\" Well, he's confused. Well, you certainly don't have to go very far afield to find out what he's confused about. So, the fault actually could be with the text, as well as with the student, if the text is not explicit by reason of typographical error or by some other reason, and so forth, the infor-mation is not relayed to him in an explicit form, so then he gets confused. So, it isn't always his fault that he is confused, don't you see? You can sometimes take a hold of the text he's been studying and just take one glance at it and all of a sudden see that two paragraphs have been omitted out of it. They are the paragraphs that define somebody. You see, somebody made a mimeograph copy and didn't copy two paragraphs, you know? This corny. You see that all words in an auditing session are defined, except \"auditor\" and \"pc.\" This is liable to bring about a certain amount of confusion. So, the upshot of the thing is that your confusion is not necessarily the fault of the text, it's not necessarily the fault of the student. We're not trying to fix blame in this particular line. We're just showing you that there was something not understood. It might also have been the fault of his first grade teacher, see? She never told him what some little word like \"reciproc-ity\" meant, or something like this. And we've got – we've got ourselves, then, a good look at this. It's treated on the basis of \"these are the factors which you must observe as an Instruc-tor.\" Now, you can put those things together. You can see why he didn't attain the gradient or you can ask him why he didn't. You can locate the point where he didn't move from one point of the gradient to the next point, you can isolate why he did this. We can see that nomenclature and other things could be responsible for this. Lack of definition could be responsible for this. We can see lack can be responsible for it as well as an"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"STUDY, GRADIENTS AND NOMENCLATURE 22 SHSBC-397 – 6.8.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 615 HPCS existing thing can be responsible for it. And we see also that the individual would not have really a clue about what he was confused about or he wouldn't be confused and we see that the Instructor who is doing the best job of instruction is actually never trying to solve the problem of what the student is confused about. We see the good Instructor would never do that. Why? He's already one gradient late, so he just gets more confused than the student, be-cause he can't understand why the student can't understand, see? It says, \"Cats are sometimes white.\" \"Yes, but I don't know why they are white, and so forth. Actually didn't – didn't Ben Franklin say something like that? I'm not sure whether Ben – I – uh – where – what is this – where-where-su-sa-su-dah...\" \"Well you see, cats – well, did you ever see a cat? Did you ever have a cat? Uh-uh-uh-do-do-do you – do you know anything about cats? \"Uh – let's-uh – let's go get a dictionary and look up a picture of cats.\" It's all a waste of time because it happens to be in the earlier paragraph where it said \"feline.\" See, he doesn't know what that is, see? He didn't know that applied to cats, but he hung up on this earlier one. So the apparency of his confusion is almost never the confusion he is actually in. An Instructor knowing this won't have any real difficulty answering the foolish questions he is asked, and so forth, because he just never bothers with them. He wants to know what's going over the top. But somebody asks the Instructor the definition of something: \"Yes, yes,\" he says, \"a caterwump is a – ba – and that's all.\" Okay? Audience: Okay.

Ah, yes, you're more certain about that. Twenty-ninth of September AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. All right. Going to talk to you today about a rundown of levels and classifications, and give you some kind of an idea on how this is all packaged together. And also give you a cou-ple of elementary actions about auditing pcs. This seems to be a scrambled sort of a lecture to give you all at one and the same time, but believe me it's the same lecture. And you could call this lecture \"Gradients.\" A gradient – a gradient is an extremely interesting concept, very interesting idea, and it has bypassed a great many Scientologists. The idea of a gradient. Whenever I see you sit down in a session and have difficulty pulling a withhold, I know what you're up against. You're not up against the fact that you haven't got nerve enough to pull a withhold. That's what you think, you see. You're just up against a gradient when you're up against that, that's all. Whenever you have trouble auditing, you're having trouble with gradients. It's the only thing. And if you knew gradients like crazy and you knew what a gradient was and you had it straight, you'd never have any trouble with any pc you ever had anything to do with. Clichés such as \"You have to learn to walk before you can run,\" that's a gradient. You can't enter the hundred and fifth story of the Empire State Building without going into the ground floor, that's a gradient. You can't climb a vertical hill, but you might climb one of a ten percent grade, that's a gradient. And if you really had this one mastered you'd never have any trouble with any pc you ever had anything to do with. And you notice my lectures tend to go toward definitions, basics, very definitely. Notice I was talking to you about Clears and clear-"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 2 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 617 HPCS ing. Well, we got the clearing technology. It's the first thing I've been trying to straighten out is what is this thing called a Clear and what is clearing and what does Clear mean. All right, now let's get into the fundamentals of an auditor's auditing, and we find we're up against this word called \"gradient.\" And you haven't got that thing grasped so that you can wrap both arms around it and say \"buddy,\" you're going to have trouble! And every student on the Saint Hill Sp... Briefing Course, and I've seen them down the time when we were – from the basement of the Manor and so forth on forward, and they're sweating and screaming and having a horrible time trying to pull somebody's overts. He wasn't having any trouble with overts. He was just having trouble with gradients, that's all. Having – not having trouble with it, he just had never learned what a gradient was. That's all. That's the principle that was missing in his auditing. A gradient. It wasn't there so he couldn't pull any overts. Elementary. So what – what you have trouble with is usually not what you're having trouble with apparently. It works in training the same way it works with the pc. The pc says, \"Oh, I'm hav-ing terrible trouble with my wife, well, you know, and my wife and I...\" Well, you process it and so forth, and the next session, why, \"I'm having terrible trouble with my wife\" and so on. And you process it, and next session, \"I'm having terrible trouble with my wife,\" and so on. You say, \"What's the matter here?\" Well, you're – one, you're not advancing his case. I call to your attention that it's stuck. [laughs, laughter] The main trouble that you're having in this particular case is – this particular case – is the fact that you're not auditing what's wrong. Otherwise something would happen. Now, there could also be a gradient error here in pc isn't having trouble with his wife, man, he's just having trouble on such a broad line so that he can't possibly orient himself and he's just merely blaming it on his wife or something like this, and he isn't then attacking that part of his life he can do something about, so he's foisting off on you the fact that he's having trouble with his wife. Well, all right, so he's having trouble with his wife. Great. But if you processed it for a session or two and nothing resolved in this particular direction then that isn't what's the trouble. That's one of the things that could be there, that isn't the trouble. The trouble must be something else because this trouble isn't folding up. And you see, you can't – you can't get somebody over a trouble he isn't having is the point I'm making. It's very hard to do. And you're up against the problem of gradient there, and it's the gradient of confront. What can he confront about his existence and so on. And he claims he can confront his wife, see. But no, he claims this, but his analysis of his case and his difficulties is just too high for what the thing is, see? Now, you ask him – if you were to ask him – let's apply a gradient to this. I've given you the other ramification, he isn't having trouble with his wife so therefore you can't do any-thing about it. He's just blaming his wife for all the trouble he's having, you see. There's – be a difference here of some kind or another. He may have attacked his case on the wrong gradi-ent. Now, there's this foolish gradient – and this is a silly one but it's a very good example – there's certain rural parts of farming districts will always breed this particular joke. And that"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 3 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 618 HPCS is if you took a calf and you lifted him every day from the time he was a tiny calf up to the time he was totally grown, why, you would eventually be able to lift a full-grown bull, of course. There's that joke, and then there's the wrong way gradient and so forth is that they're trying to cure this horse of eating by reducing his feed one straw per day, and by golly before they taught him not to eat he starved to death, you know. I mean... Silly jokes of this particu-lar character. Nevertheless, they do have something to do with gradients, even though they're wrong way to and impossible, don't you see. But they're still a gradient. Now, someplace in this fellow's existence he would be able to put his feet on the road of something he could do something about or some direction he could go and this is some-thing he could do. And then having accomplished that he would then find the little more that he could do, and then that, we would find a little more that he could do, and having found that, a little more that he could do, and find that. Now that's built in as an automaticity into many processes. \"What can you confront?\" would be a built-in automaticity here. You'd say – well, automatically if you assess the pc what he could confront you'll find out that he eventu-ally will be able to confront more and more and more, see. Do you see that? You have some fellow – well, you can see this. You can say, \"What in this room can you see?\" The fellow says, \"Well, the whole room, yes, yes, the whole room.\" \"Well, what particular point of the room could you see?\" \"Well, that and that and that and that and that and that and that,\" and all of a sudden he'll brighten up, and he will see the whole room, don't you see. So you've seen that work as a gradient, and the mind just goes in this direction so of course it very rapidly lends itself to being an automatic process, see. Automatically. If the fellow starts becoming familiar with something, he will become more familiar with more. Well, because it happens anyway and because the mind goes in this direction is no reason that you must go on leaving it on auto-matic. Do you see? I know I'm using some GPM terminology there, but you're up to it. The point – the point I'm making is here that... Yeah, \"automaticity\" is one of the – a word of that character is one of the items in the GPMs which is probably why you become very devoted to it. [laughter] But here is – here's the point: If you ask somebody to confront something they will confront a little bit and then will confront more and confront more and confront more and confront more and more and more and more and more and then he'll be able to confront a whole lot, see; that's a gradient. But just because he does that without you doing anything more about it than utter the repetitive process is no reason why you can just abandon yourself following the gradient. See, you've got to follow this gradient, you've got to make this come about. Not with that particular process, that will happen anyway, don't you see? I'm talking about the fact that your address to the case has to be planned on a gradient. You can't just say, \"Well, all these processes automatically follow gradients,\" see. No, you've got to plan the gradient. Now, he's saying, \"Well, I'm having a lot of trouble with my wife and a lot of trouble with my wife and trouble with my wife and trouble with my wife and"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 4 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 619 HPCS trouble with that.\" Well, this is a gradient. \"Well, what part of all that trouble have you felt you could do something about? What part of it?\" And he comes down to some part that he actually can confront and he can do something about and then he'll move further on into it and be able to confront the whole problem and then you'll be able to audit the whole problem. You got that? In other words, you could take some little section of this pie and address this section, and then move on into other sections. Well, you normally regard that not as a gradient but as taking a part of the whole thing. Actually, it is part of the whole thing but it's also a gradient. You're taking a little bit and going on to a little more and a little more and a little more and a little more and a little more and more and more and then you've got the whole thing. Processes are all designed on the basis of starting in with a little bit and winding up with a lot. All processes are designed that way. Classification, which I said I was going to say something about, is also designed that way. This fellow can handle a little bit or a little piece of auditing and a little bit of a pc or a – or a kind of a routine pc. He can sort of handle a pia-nola pc, you know. \"Pianola,\" an old term, plays itself. So he can handle this pc – pc would – this pc... I'll give you the gradient of pcs, you see. This pc say, \"Well, I have a headache – well, it's gone.\" See? Well, a guy at Class 0, you see, well, he could handle that. Says, \"Any-thing wrong with you?\" Person says, \"Yeah, I got a headache.\" \"Well, how do you feel now?\" \"It's gone.\" You see, he could handle a very easy pc. Well, the gradients as they go up the line progress into tougher pcs, but not – they're not graded against tougher pcs, they're graded against more of the case, don't you see? But along with this, you also get the tougher pcs. So as he goes upstairs in his classes, as he starts walking up the grade of his classes, he of course can handle more difficult pcs and he can also handle more of the pc's case. And this is what is being asked of an auditor in an advanced classification. A very early classification, we don't expect him to handle very much of a pc's case and we don't expect him to handle a very diffi-cult pc. See? The way we handle that is we don't try to train this fellow up instantly and immedi-ately and give him a full HCS Course in the next three or four minutes as we're coaching his auditing. We just say, \"Well...\" – he just isn't getting anyplace on this pc at all. We'd have to figure out what kind of a pc is he running here? Well, he's running a tough one, man. I – this... I'm – I remember this pc because this pc's given us a tough time in instruction and this pc's given us a tough time here and there, and we've got this fellow and what's his – what's his class? Well, his class is that if he's trained very, very hard and puffed his cheeks up very hard and got very red in the face he would be able to push a grain of a sand one millimeter. See? Well, we can't demand this of him. We handle the situation actually by saying some-what offhandedly and grandly, we just simply say – we don't try as the HAS Co-audit Instruc-tor to handle this case and so on, we just say, \"Well, the best thing for you to do,\" we say to the pc, \"is get some HGC auditing.\" Easy way to solve it, or \"field auditing,\" or the best thing, if we're running a field PE and so forth, \"Best thing for you to do is get some auditing over the weekends and we've got auditors who can audit you because you're difficult – more diffi-"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 5 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 620 HPCS cult case and so forth than this particular level of training calls for.\" You'll find out very amazingly this guy'll say, \"Oh, I'm something special, I'm called a difficult case.\" Well, go ahead. Remember some auditor somewhere along the line will have to run out the fact that you told him he was a difficult case. [laughter] But if you knew your gradi-ents and you knew this, then you wouldn't bang your head up against this thing of saying, \"Well, Joe Class 0, you certainly aren't handling this pc, Mr. Mountain. You certainly aren't doing a good job of itsa there because Mr. Mountain is just getting ARC broke and he's just a-blowing and he's having an awful time, so you just aren't doing a good job.\" No, he's doing a fine job of Class 0 auditing. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to do but Class 0 auditing just doesn't happen to be up to handling Mr. Mountain. You see that? All right, now supposing we ran into the HAS Co-audit – that's the difficulty of the case – now supposing we ran into the HAS Co-audit the fact that they were only going to run GPMs. Well, that would be complete psychosis, because it – you're saying to the beginning of the gradient, \"Handle the whole, total case at one fell swoop.\" Well, of course nobody'd get anyplace. Nobody'd do anything. Every once in a while you see this ambition come out all the time, somebody wants this one-shot Clear, you take a twenty-two grade horse needle or some-thing of the sort and shoot it into the gluteus maximus and this guy goes \"Spung!\" and he's instantly OT and so on. Actually, it is very nutty, but it is not unusual, because practically every psychiatrist in the world is walking around in this delusion, and there's some little outfit – I've forgotten its name; Harvard, Harvard, some little school – that sends out demands for contributions all the time because they're trying to find this magic ingredient in biochemistry. And they've got a big biochemical project going and they want lots of money in order to find the perfect bio-chemical thing that'll put everybody back to battery instantly with one shot in the gluteus maximus. And of course, they're getting that straight out of our early rumors of the one-shot Clear, this sort of thing. They probably read that and they said, \"Well, they've got something called a 'one-shot Clear' so therefore that would be a shot in the gluteus maximus, there.\" [laughter] And therefore their thinkingness, \"If we could just get together enough money and put enough people to work on it, why, then the problem would solve.\" Why, I think that's a marvelous idea they have in modern science anyway, that if you put enough money on anything and enough people on anything that it would solve. I call to your attention that it doesn't work in government! Governments are now hiring one govern-ment official per citizen. I mean that's about the ratio, and that's enough people working on something, isn't it? And let's talk about enough money, well, they're getting something like a 105 percent of everybody's paycheck, and they still haven't solved mankind or war or any-thing else. So it doesn't necessarily hold true that if you put enough money on something and enough people on something that it'll solve, see. What is true, however, is if you tackle the first fundamental that needs to be ap-proached and handled you could probably eventually handle the whole thing providing you were content to walk this grade. If you go up this gradient, step by step, take a little more in stride, if you figured out what's missing..."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 6 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 621 HPCS Well, I did an interesting one the other day. I got a long, involved letter from the Brit-ish color council. The whole world of photography is on its ear on the subject of color. And they've got it all planned out, color harmony and color this and color that. They're having an awful time. They've got some new toy called \"High-speed Ectochrome\" or something of the sort. And it'll take color. So right away they all figure they have to know more about color. Well, of course the designers and the architects and the paint companies and every-body else, these people are all interested in color. And then there must be something mysteri-ous or peculiar that they haven't known yet about this subject, so they're hammering and pounding along this line. And then in addition to that, big advertising agencies that wish to compel more sales on the part of more citizens are interested in color from the standpoint of ads and packages and so on. So color is big money these days and it's a big problem these days, and you've got a lot of bums – I mean a lot of chaps, a lot of fellows – standing around making an awful lot of money producing nothing in the line of color research. See. But what they haven't done is attack the fundamental problem that has to do with color. And the fundamental problem that has to do with color is color is essentially light wavelength and light wavelength can't be looked at by anything else. We'll go into this slowly: You cannot look at light with something else. Now, let me give you an analogy. You can look at sound. You can look at sound elec-tronically. You can take electronics and examine the living daylights out of sound. And as a matter of fact sound engineers of recent times can synthesize, put together, just out of drawing sound waves in electronic patterns can produce sound that sounds just like a piano and sounds just like a guitar, sounds just like anything. In other words, they can resynthesize the harmon-ics of any instrument and produce the instrument. And I heard a record the other day whereby they had just worked and fiddled around with electronic waves until they'd produced a whole orchestra. And somebody had really had a ball, you see, they just kept playing this tape through and adding new electronic vibrations to the thing till they had a whole symphony going on the thing. There was an earlier one called Nola. They had a piano going there playing ragtime music and that sort of thing, and of course there wasn't any piano and there hadn't been any piano. What they did was just calculate the harmonics of the sound electronically and then feed those things through an electronic recorder and mix them, and at the other end the thing sounded like a piano, you get the idea? But you were looking at sound with electronics. Well, now the wavelengths of light and the wavelengths of electronics are the same thing, see. What are we going to do here? How can we – see, what are we going to look at color with? See, sound, that's a very gross vibration. That's a big vibration. It's very easy to use light to look at sound. But you couldn't use sound to look at light. There isn't anything smaller than light with which to examine light. So of course then they can't determine what are the harmonics of light. They can measure a wavelength, they can measure this and that. But what are its harmonics? What are its disso-nances? You know, if you thought – talked of light in the same form as music, you'd say, well, music has clashes and it has counterpoint, it has this, it has that. Well, obviously the same things exist in light. But how are you going to measure them? You don't have anything"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 7 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 622 HPCS smaller with which to measure them. There's nothing to look at light with. If you don't believe it, turn out the light and try to see something. But there is something that can observe color. There is something that can observe color and can react to dissonances and clashes and smoothnesses and chords, if you want to put it into music. And that's you. See, there's a thetan. Now, he can inspect color. So when they try to work out color harmony or what color should you paint the walls, it then comes down to taste. Something we call taste. A person feels some particular way about seeing red with green polka dots, you see. He feels in some peculiar way about this, and so therefore somebody – and because he felt this way, then he decides there must be a law about it so he said, \"Red with green polka dots won't do.\" See. So then if you set up an authority like this, then the authority passes a law. And it says, \"There shall be no green polka dots mixed with red.\" But you see, they don't know. And yet the amount of money that's being spent in this area of research is fabulous. But nobody is at-tacking the basic problem of it, because you've got to have something with which to look at color which can be measured or which is capable of measuring beyond the idea of mere opin-ion. And then you could put together a science of color. Ah, but there are billions being spent on this right now. Tremendous quantities of money being spent on color. And there are more authorities walking around saying, \"Well, it's very complex of course, only an expert could understand this.\" You see, you want to be aware of these subjects where only an expert can understand them, you see. You say, \"All right...\" I'll tell you how to throw them. \"All right, I'm an expert, get me to understand it.\" [laughter] \"Well,\" they say, \"Well, you don't know this and you don't know that and you don't know something else.\" \"Well, I'm perfectly willing to learn your vocabulary and your terms, and understand it.\" This outfit will, of course, very – get very fast driven to the wall. Then, they will have something else. They will say, \"Well, you haven't gone to the right school. You may know all the subject, but you haven't gone to the right school, so therefore of course you couldn't un-derstand it.\" Where are we winding up here, see? We're just winding up into the old hedge, see. This guy is backing up. The more you say, \"Look, I'm willing to understand it, let's try to understand this situation, let's try to get a grasp on this situation,\" and so forth. Well, if they – if he doesn't immediately lead forward and try to give you the understanding that is there on it, well, you can assume then that there probably is no understanding but a great deal of fakery connected with it. I was giving you color. I hope I didn't miss any words. They're very unimportant if I did. But the whole point is the world has a craziness about this sort of thing and they will go for ages and ages and ages studying the upper story of something. They're always skipping the gradient, see. And they've got engineers that they're training right this minute, that they're training how to fix up bridges and how to supertest the high tensile strength of supersteels, you see. All of that just – you know, they're just training them within an inch of their lives, you know, that sort of thing. And they've neglected to train them such little fundamentals as what does two plus two equal. What is – what is the basic idea of stress and strain? Why do"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 8 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 623 HPCS you have stress and strains in the first place? What do these things mean? You know? What's the vocabulary of engineering? You know, I mean, little – these things – these are the things these guys have a hard time with. There they are, up there, see, \"Oh, we're going to build it. We're going to do that and so on, ruh-ruh-ruh.\" They couldn't even bend a pin! See. They just jumped this zooom! see. They're way up on top. And in the world of color here they're building this fantastic structure and they have not studied this basic area, \"What are you looking at color with? What could look at color? How could you look at color so as to produce a constant record of reaction?\" See? I mean, they're really closer into our department than they are into the department of engineering, because the only thing I know of that can look at and record color is the thetan. He has taste. He has feeling about it. He says, \"This room is very harmonious. These dark green walls with the light green striping and so forth, that makes me feel very nice.\" See? So he's measured the color harmony of the room. He says, \"Color harmony of the room, very good,\" see. He goes into this room and it's orange, it's got orange walls and the room has got an ultramarine floor, and the thing is a bright shade of lime all over the ceiling, you see, and there's magenta or purple carpets. And he walks into this room and he says – he says, \"I don't like this.\" [laughter, laughs] \"I don't like this.\" Now, that's as close as they come to it. Of course, they have certain mechanics, they find out that certain colors cancel out certain colors, and interact one way or the other in pig-ment so as to make gray and in light so as to make white. So they think they're onto some-thing. And they've found some of the harmonics of the wavelength. But I never even heard the word \"harmonic\" used amongst them. They say these are complementary and they're this and that, as though – as though a band of waves which begins with A and winds up with B is always a circle. Well, it couldn't be a circle, because it's just a stretched-out band of waves, that's all. I mean, one wave is – let's not use the color terms – but you say is one inch long and the other – next waves up the line are two inches long and the waves up the line; we get on up the line in the thing and the bands are one mile long. Well, we wouldn't then be able to join the one mile into the one inch. So it can't be a circle. I mean, these are the things that have not been examined. It isn't huge complications and millions and billions and that sort of thing. They haven't – they haven't taken a look at this thing and said, \"You know, this thing we call a color wheel doesn't always produce im-mediate and direct results, so therefore there might be something wrong with it. Let's see if we cant work on this color wheel a little bit more,\" see. Well, they go off into these terrific terms. You read a book on this subject now and it'd just crack your brains. You could just feel them crack right down the middle. I'm not kidding you. Ooh! Mireds and Greek letters, and densities and percentages of transmission and you get to looking at this thing after a while and you say, \"Boy, there must be something known here, it's so impressive. Something very impressive.\" Well, I'm afraid it's that impressive because somebody has skipped. They haven't"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 9 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 624 HPCS ever tried to come in the front door of this thing, they're still trying to get in the top of the building, see. Now, how is it that you can join up a lineal – that is to say a straight line – series of wavelengths which would run – as I'm giving you the wrong measurements, just to give the idea – from one inch to one mile, and then say the one mile one then joins up at the one inch one, that there's a one mile one right next to the one inch one. Well, you'd have to do that, you see, in order to make a color wheel. There's some place on that wheel where the wavelength is one mile joined up to one inch. And that is supposed to be the progressive point of the wheel. No, the wheel wouldn't go that way, don't you see? You couldn't possibly have this little tiny wave right next door to this great big wave and say, well, those are the adjacent waves. Couldn't be done. No stretch of the imagination. But that is such a fundamental observation that it's never been made. They don't make that fundamental type of an observation, don't you see? So the reason they're in trouble and the problems they're having is because they have never started to walk that path where it starts. They never tried to clarify, \"What problem are we having?\" They've never tried to clarify, \"What are we doing?\" They've never said, \"Well, what are we working with?\" See, just that fundamental. \"What's got to be licked around here?\" You know, this sort of thing. Instead of that, they've invented this fantastic amount of balderdash, you see, which has got all kinds of signs and symbols and laws and rules and authority and you can't read a book by Zuck because it's in contradiction with a book by the name – by Zack, you see, and he is a big authority because he studied Monet. Well, Monet didn't know anything about these things. He was a good thetan. He knew what was agreeable and what was disagreeable, don't you see? Just a good thetan on the sub-ject of color. And he also was capable of hitting an average. He not only knew what he liked, but he had a feeling for what would be liked. See, so he could register color like a lot of peo-ple could register color, don't you see? So therefore his work was pleasing. There'd be no point in studying Monet. You'd have to study Scientology, then you might get someplace. What was Monet? Now, we'd have to take Monet apart, and we'd have to admit the fact that there must be something else there besides some meat. You can take an awful lot of meat and put it up against an awful lot of color and it won't register anything. You see where I'm getting to? So here's a top-heavy subject. Now, you probably missed a lot of that, but I don't care because it's unimportant. You can get as stupid as you like on this subject because you'd just get stupid as everybody else is on it. But here's where you join up: When you don't know this thing called gradients you get into the same condition and you try to build a castle on top of a palace on top of a complica-tion that you call the pc's case; because you never walked up the gradient, then you never see the case, don't you see? You arrive instantly at the totality, and of course you can't get any right answers to this case. You might have the theoretical right answers in Scientology, but to this particular case you never get the right answers. And the reason you never get the right"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 10 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 625 HPCS answers is because you never picked up anything that was fundamental that the person could confront. You never picked up anything that the person could start with. And so, of course, neither he nor you ever observed his case. And you wind up with psychoanalysis. Or you wind up with some squirrel process. But you certainly wind up with a fantastic notion of the horrible complexities of existence. It's overpowering. I mean, you say, \"My God! That poor fellow. He's got all these problems with his wife. And he's got all these problems about his job. And he has all these psychosomatic diffi-culties. And the best thing for him is some paraglutenous magnoid shot into the rectabulous skootum.\" \"Doctor, hand me the flit.\" [laughter] You see, your answers... observations are nonsense, so therefore the solutions are go-ing to be nonsense. And you can put those things together any day of the week. And you see a bunch of nonsense solutions then you know darn well that the observation has been nonsense. Those two go hand in glove. So you sit and look at this pc and you say, \"Ron said we should observe this pc. All right, I'll sit and observe this pc. My God, problems about his wife, prob-lems about this, problems about this. Isn't he a confusion!\" Yeah. A confusion to him, too. But if you keep trying to observe the totality of the case without ever once finding one little thing you could observe about that case, you'll never get a gradient, you'll never get on the track, you'll never get the gradient that leads toward an observation of the case. Let's just look at it from the standpoint of observation. Let's take – sit and – just look at somebody for a while. \"What's this guy doing that I can understand?\" Let's take the poor auditor, not the com-plexities of the case. \"What's he doing that I can understand?\" And you actually have to take that before you can remedy a case. You see, he's \"Sooooo wwaahhll and so on and it's all ... Oh dear, and trouble with my wife, and so forth. And then there's my sciatica, and of course if I get rid of my sciatica I'll lose my bonus, and I'll lose all of this other stuff you see, but actually it was my mother and father, they fought like cats and dogs, you see, and my father was a circus animal trainer and he used to beat me all the time. And so life has been very complicated, and when I was psy-choanalyzed before I got the electric shocks...\" And you say, \"Woooow.\" Now, if your observation of this case is based on the fact that you've got to grasp all of this then you haven't started a gradient observation, and you'll never really be able to remedy a case. The Book of Remedies when it comes out will be nonsense to you. What have you got to do to start to remedy this case? Well, you have to notice something that you can understand about the case, and then you'll find something more that you can understand about the case. And then having found that that you can understand about the case, you'll now find something else you can understand about the case. And the next thing you know this case... Well, actu-ally you never do get up to understanding the complexities of the case, because if you under-stood it that far the case starts to fall apart and you haven't got this complex case sitting in front of you any longer. Do you follow this now? In other words, this person is in terrible trouble, this person is an awful state, this per-son is very complex. This person is all messed up. You give him a solution, you see. \"Well,\" you say, \"well, actually if you get a divorce, wouldn't it be mu...\""},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 11 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 626 HPCS \"Oh, no, I couldn't do that, you see, because my mother is dead against divorce; she's Catholic.\" You say, \"Well, are you a Catholic? What could you do about your mother?\" and so forth. And he says, \"Heh. Uh – um...\" You're lost. He's had you. Well, you're trying to under-stand the incomprehensible. You're trying to understand the totality. You're trying to reach out and grab everything. And you're just going to get loses all the way along the line if you do that. Well, what could you understand about this case? And you look this case over very, very hard and you look over your situation and if you remember what I'm telling you about this self-discipline on the subject of gradients you won't make this mistake. You'll say, \"What can I observe about this case? Well, he isn't getting any tone arm ac-tion. Good. All right, well, let's look it up in The Book of Remedies. 'No tone arm action ... no tone arm action ... no tone arm action ... no tone arm action and ingrown toenails!'\" [laughter] \"That's it! He's also got ingrown toenails. Therefore, we run this.\" And you run that and the case starts falling apart, see. You got the idea? You're always setting yourself to climb the whole road. That's because the pc is al-ways giving you this. Well, what state actually is the pc in? Pc is in the top of a gradient he hadn't climbed. So of course he's always inviting you to be at the top of a gradient that isn't climbed. And you get suckered in on it. Every once in a while you get pulled right in, and you say, \"All right, we will solve the whole case in the next two days.\" Well, in the next two days if you found something about the case that could be re-solved you would be making progress, wouldn't you? But if you tried to solve the whole case in the next two days, you wouldn't, would you? So the road of the gradient leads to big, per-manent wins. And jumping all the gradients leads to a total loss. Now, let's take up this whole subject of overts. And let's take up the whole subject of overts at one fell swoop and wind them up on the subject of gradients. You sit down and you say to the pc, you say, \"All right, pc, have you ever committed any crime that would land you up in jail if it were found out about?\" [laughter] I guess that's the end of that overt pulling! [laughter] We fly at once to the top of the building, ask for something that we might conceivably get after maybe fifteen or twenty hours of auditing, we ask for it right now, we don't get it, but we restimulate it. ARC break the pc nicely. Upset the thing. Then we decide that we can't pull overts. You see all the nonsense that proceeds from jumping the gradient, see. Well, what's the first thing necessary for the pulling of an overt. What's the first point of the gradient? Well, we have to consider the line that the overt is going to be pulled on. And that is normally called a communication line from the pc to the auditor. Now, if it consists of a little wire which is a ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter and you say ten thousand volts must now go over this wire, it's going to blow and break, and that's going to be the end of that wire. So there are two things you can do here actually; the thing is very susceptible to solu-tion. You can get yourself a stronger and stronger wire. Pc is more and more willing to talk to his auditor. That's because it's building up a good strong communication line, see."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 12 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 627 HPCS And then, we start feeding on this communication line some little overts that easily carry on it. And then we'll find quite wonderfully that bigger overts will follow on this. And bigger and bigger overts will follow on a bigger and bigger communication line, see? And all of a sudden, why, we're sitting there looking at somebody whose – all of whose overts are pulled. And we say, \"Well, that wasn't very tough.\" See? Do it by gradient. Now, there are two gradients involved. One is the gradient of the pc's willingness to talk to the auditor. That's one gradient, had nothing to do with overts. It's just the fact that it's got to be there before you can pull any overts. And the other is the gradient of what overt is he willing to talk to you about. Now, let's go into this a little bit further. Did you ever notice that there were people around that you were willing to say good morning to, but not to discuss how good it was. And then, there were people that you could discuss how good the morning was to, that you would not discuss personal plans with. And then there are persons that you would not discuss per-sonal plans with, you see, or say good morning to or anything else. In other words, there are different degrees of willingness to communicate. Now, here's this bloke, he sits down in the session, he's in the state of willing to say good morning to you. He's not willing to communicate any further than that to you, the audi-tor. All right, so now let's pull a big overt. Then we have the auditor practically in tears saying, \"I can't pull overts.\" Well, of course he's given us the wrong analysis of the situation. The analysis is incorrect, entirely incorrect. He hadn't got a communication line to pull overts on and he isn't trying to pull the overts that the guy can confront. So there are two things wrong here. This is no communica-tion line and no gradient of overts. So there's no gradient of communication, no gradient of overts. So of course he can't pull overts. Elementary. Now, if you merely built up the pc's communication line to the auditor and never did anything with it the pc'd feel much better and think you were a great fellow. This perhaps could be a profession in itself, but is not where auditing ceases. Having done that, then you can do things with this line. The pc along this line is then willing to communicate. But what is the pc actually willing to communicate? The pc is now willing to communicate what he, him-self, is willing to confront. It isn't whether you feel odd about it or not, it's whether he would feel strange about it or not. You see, it's the datum in his own reaction to his own data, see. We've now got it pretty well straight that he's willing to talk to you, but now we've got the factor of his own reaction to his own data. In other words, what could he confront in his own bank? What of his own misdeeds is he willing to confront? Well, that's the first overt that he will give you. And of course, having given you that one, then he's willing to confront a greater misdeed. And having given you that one then he's willing to confront a greater misdeed. See? So we build up the gradient of communication, he's willing to say good morning to you, he's willing to discuss his personal problems with you, he's willing to discuss his very intimate problems with you, see. We build that up along that gradient, and then we get what he could confront that he has done, he himself, and then we get a little bit more that he could confront, then we discover some things he's done that he didn't even remember or know he's"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 13 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 628 HPCS done. This stuff starts to fall out of the hamper, and if we handle all these things well and maintain the communication line while we're doing it, the guy unloads all of his overts, see. Well, it's – therefore, you can arrive with this thing accomplished, providing you fol-low a gradient. And of course you get nowhere by not following gradients. It's the difference between being able to walk and the difference of being – and not walking at all ever. And that's what gradients mean. Unless you walk the gradient with auditing, unless you attack the thing on a gradient scale, unless you approach these auditing activities – a little bit, is fol-lowed by a little more, is followed by a little more and a little more and a little more and more and more, and a lot and a lot and a lot more than that and the big lot and so forth – why, no-body will go up through the grades. Training, similarly, is arranged on what could the person confront as an auditor. What could the person accomplish or do as an auditor. And you can't just say, \"Well, all right, get in there and pull all of the GPMs.\" Well, my God, that – we have enough trouble with a Class IV Auditor who's been in the snake pit for many a year confronting pcs and so forth, and you should see the green look around his gills when he first starts to run some GPMs out of a pc. He looks pretty pale. His hands are pretty nervous. He starts in with this and these tigers are awfully big tigers and he then, of course, gets belted in the brisket a few times, gets restimu-lated himself, you see, and knocked in the head and so forth, and he is definitely of the opin-ion that he's handling a tiger. Well, this is somebody who's walked the trail, somebody who has had successes in au-diting, somebody who is in pretty good condition to be able to confront. And if this is his re-action on confronting, what do you suppose it would do if you started to run them on an HAS Co-audit? What would happen? Well, they wouldn't know what they were confronting, they wouldn't know anything about it, their mystery on it would be total and you'd have people curled up in a ball and chucking their cookies and winding up in the local hospital and being operated on by the local brain shrinker. Wow, see! I mean, you'd just be confronting total ca-tastrophe. You'd just wind up people in the hospitals and mortuaries and so forth just left, right and center. Bang, bang, bang! You wouldn't miss. Somebody gratuitously the other day on the west coast of the United States from here gave a lecture on Clay Table. Well now, you say, well, come off of it, Clay Table. I mean, couldn't possibly do anything on Clay Table. He managed! Somebody went home, woke up the next morning, lips all swollen up, terrible condition, so forth. Clay Table! He just showed them how you symbolize something in clay, see. Well, it was too restimulative for his audi-ence. Now, that's interesting because it would never occur to you that this would be too res-timulative for anybody. Not at your state of training. Not at your ability to – level to confront at this particular stage. Never occur to you that this would knock people in the head. Yeah, well, I invite you, I – that – at this low level, you say, \"Well, you represent stuff in clay. You just take a piece of clay, you see, and you draw up a mountain in clay, you see, and isn't that nice and so forth.\" And that's the person's present time problem. [laughter] Have somebody quietly keel over in the audience, you know? Well, you're dealing with – you're just dealing with the ability of people to confront and approach things."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 14 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 629 HPCS Well, you get around some people – you get around some people just discuss some mild locks. Think yourself of the least, you know, what you do is think of the least possible restimulative thing that would still have something to do with the bank. Not the least restimu-lative subject you could think of but the least restimulative thing that you could have to do with with the bank. And then say something about this to a green, fresh, new group of people. And exert your power of observation and look them over. Somebody there is going to turn green around the gills; if not all of them. You say, \"Well, all right, there's locks. Person has operations and so forth and later on every time they see a knife or every time they see a white basin or every time they see some-body in a white cap...\" he's giving little examples, see, \"why, they feel that their head's being operated on or drilled into, so forth. Well, now that is a lock.\" And you'll see... [shows some-thing – laughter] well, you're so accustomed to this line of thought that it would never occur to you that somebody would come dreadfully ill over this, see. That's your gradient, see. That's why on PE you must attack the gradient of definitions. Don't talk about – much about the thing that is being defined but talk about the definition. Define life, you know; what do we mean by life. Take up dictionary definitions, don't even take up Scientology definitions. You find out you'd get along fine, but you'd still be stretching – not overreaching – but you'd still, here and there in the – in an audience that you are addressing, be stretching the gradient. Life. And somebody'd be sitting there, \"Life.\" [breathes hard] You say, \"What's the matter?\" \"God, I just realized I'm alive!\" [laughter] Well, you actually have seen things like this happen in PEs and things like this. You see these – what appear to you to be totally nutty cognitions. And you look, and you say, \"What! How could this be?\" you know? Well, on a broader basis you've probably had this experience yourself in the early days. Just spot three spots in the room, three spots in the body, all of a sudden recognize that you had a body sitting there in the chair. I've had somebody emit a piercing scream! They suddenly found out that they were in a body and that there was a body there, and so forth. Well, this is – you say, wait a minute! That's the most ordinary type of a – of an action you could think of. And of course everybody in life considers it ordinary. Well, what's ordinary about it is nobody pays any attention to it and nobody confronts it. That's what's ordinary about it. And now all of a sudden you start to actually pick apart the pieces of life, and you start showing these things up on a gradient of just this is the name of. This is the name of, see. \"The thing which you have there, the arms and legs and so forth, that's a body. B – o – d – y, body.\" \"Body.\" And you – right away, you'd have some girl thinking, \"Well, you know, they're pretty nasty things.\" And somebody else will be saying something or other, and so on, somebody else will be saying, you know, \"It's this body, and they're awful heavy and get in the road and so on, I have a lot of trouble with my body these days. Body, body, you know, brrrhh.\" Locks flying off. I know it doesn't seem likely to you, see. But you blow a whole chain of locks. And"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 15 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 630 HPCS somebody goes out the door he feels wonderful! What the hell does he feel wonderful about? He realized all those people around him had bodies. And you look at this and you say, \"How could he be so far out that that would be terribly significant? That this would be an upscale walk for him?\" Well, it's just how far out he is. See? What is the gradient you've got to start with in addressing people or addressing a sub-ject? And of course, the top gradient that – I mean the – pardon me – the gradient that you could approach – about the bottom gradient that you could approach is thought. People can confront thought, oddly enough, more easily. You know, they can confront think or signifi-cance, to give you some other words for it. They can confront that more easily than they can confront masses or things. So if you give them definitions about think then these will be the easiest things there are to confront and that will gradually walk forward to a definition about a mass. And they can get a definition about a mass. But the reason they don't grasp definitions about masses is they're actually upscale. You start telling somebody, \"This is an E-Meter, this is a table, this is a floor.\" You can get them to notice and ask them where these things are and so forth, \"But this is the definition. Now, why do you suppose this is called an E-Meter?\" and so forth, and start concentrating their attention on that sort of thing. You can get much further by saying, \"Now, worry is the condition you see, by which an individual becomes and feels confused, his survival is threatened, he conceives his survival is threatened, and he worries. And you will very often see people worrying. And they worry for various reasons. But actually nobody worries unless he is – feels that his survival or the survival of something that he is very interested in is threatened.\" And people say, \"Wow!\" What you – what you've done there is you've entered up – close as you came to mass is the survival of things, you see, but they kind of brushed off, they're just all whole masses, you know, they're all indefinite, they don't have to be real and that sort of thing. But you've got this thing called worry. He's very accustomed to worry – this worry. And he right away says, \"Tsk tsk! Three cheers.\" You know. \"Worry. I know what worry is.\" He'll go out of that course thinking, \"Beautiful, beautiful, absolutely beautiful, I know what worry is. Somebody thinks he's threatened. Something's threatening him. Therefore he worries about it. He is seek-ing to figure out what to do about something that is threatening him, so that is worry. And when somebody is worrying, then he feels he is being threatened or that something else is being threatened in his vicinity. Yes.\" They'll go in the next morning to their boss, and they'll see the boss sitting there, you know, worried like that. And they will say to the boss quite brightly, \"What do you think is threatening? Is it you or the organization that you think something is threatening you or the organization? Now, what do you think the threat would be?\" And the boss says, \"Well, so-and-so and so-and-so,\" and of course it isn't a very steep gradient, it isn't very much, there's not very much relief to be gotten out. \"Well,\" he says, \"Well, if you think of it that way, that's pretty – this Blitzen Company with that new machine that they put on the market, man, that's going to cause us a lot of marketing, and so on. Yeah. Yeah, I've been worried about Blitzen Company. I feel better,\" fellow will say. Yeah, because"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 16 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 631 HPCS he's – what he's done is make the person perceive what the person's action in this particular department was, you see, and so he's had a win. You get the idea? In other words, he can then see how to apply the data that you're giving him, because he himself can see the data you're giving him. But when he can't see the data you're giving him, he can't apply it. And he flies up into the top floor of the building and adds a bunch more complexities to this data and consid-ers that it's very complex and that there's no fundamental there, don't you see? So he invents a whole bunch of nonsense with regard to this thing and misses it entirely and never gets any result with it, do you see that? So you have to be very careful about gradients when you're training. Now, in auditing a pc, if you ask a pc, \"Well, what in life do you think you could – have been successful in handling?\" you're liable to get yourself an hour or two comm lag. Because the idea of having been successful at handling anything is quite foreign. This he has never had as a cognition. He has never thought of himself as having been the successful in handling anything. And he gets a long comm lag. And he goes over this and over this and over this and he'll finally give you an answer. And he'll very often feel lots better for having given you the answer and for having asked the question. I'm not saying that's too steep a gradient, don't you see? But that gradient would just be an upper border. It takes him a long time to answer it, don't you see. He has to grapple with this thing for quite a while before it comes home to him. Then finally, why, he comes to a conclusion about it or he gives you an answer to it. Well, that's not bad, when you run into that. What you want to be afraid of is glibidity. You haven't had any new words lately; I've been very nice. And that isn't a new word; I've used it before. He gives you very glib answers. And you very often run into this in pcs and you wonder, \"Well, this fellow is so good that I couldn't possibly process him upstairs any place because he's there.\" You get glib. You say, \"Well, what could you do?\" \"Oh well, I could build the Empire State Building.\" \"Well, what could you do?\" \"Well, I could move Earth.\" \"Well, what could you do?\" \"Well, I could turn the sun off and on at will.\" \"Ah, what could you do?\" \"Well, I could collapse the universe,\" and so forth. No comm lag. And he'd explain to you also quite glibly if you ask him, \"If – well, all right, if you can do all of these things, why are you getting audited?\" \"Ah, well, trying to teach you how to audit.\" Or something like that. You'll get – you'll get various responses. All unreal. It's nowhere. Now, trying to find a gradient for that fellow to enter in on, because he's already stuck on the top floor. Now, trying to find a gradient that he can enter in upon, approach and go forward in life, I mean in processing and so forth, is fantastic. Because it'll be the size of the reduced image of the shadow of a grain of a molecule. Small. See, tiny. You actually have to fight around for a while before you can find your first gradient in because obviously nothing"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 17 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 632 HPCS is real to this person. You sometimes find out a guy walks in; he's only got one leg; his ambi-tion is to be a ballet dancer. You'll run into this once in a while in Clay Table Clearing. [laughter] It's not for you, man, it's not for you to question this ambition. But you certainly better recognize that your gradient on this must be a very slow, low approach. So right away there's something to understand about the case. If you listen, why, you can always find something to understand about the case and enter in on a gradient of solution to the case. Your gradient of solving the case, of course, is finding something about the case that you can grasp yourself. See? Not try to find something the pc can grasp. Let's not be so introverted as – and trans-ferred or whatever you call it, and then go ahead along the line and see some progress. Sometimes you undercut a case too far and the case is insulted. But that's only when you undercut it on the basis of sanity or some other unreal measure. You're not undercutting on the basis of sanity, you're undercutting – or insanity – you're undercutting on the basis of ability. Let's find out what the guy can do and then let's get him to do it better. That was the old line. But that first one: let's find out what he can do. That's easily missed because if you listen to the pc, very often he can do everything, you see. But he can't do any of these things, and so we really miss, we're thrown. All right, now the only time you really have to start investigating a case and looking it over real hard is when the case isn't making an expected line of advance. Case isn't going along and getting better and feeling happier and more cheerful and so forth. Well, about that time you'd better start looking. You'd better start looking. And you'd better find something about the case that you can grasp. And along about that moment you'll say, \"Well, he isn't getting any TA. I can certainly understand that about him.\" All right, well, let's solve that one before we go on doing something else. Obviously no TA, got a present time problem or some-thing of the sort. Next time you start to pull an overt on somebody and you feel queasy about asking this person for overts and so forth, well, just sum it up. Where are you entering the gradient? One, have you got a communication line with this person? Is he in a state of being able to say good morning to you? Is he in a state of telling you about his personal affairs? Would he natu-rally and promptly confide to you some of his deeper secrets? Well, if the answer to all of those things is no, you certainly had better build yourself a communication line. When you haven't got – do anything else but build a communication line, that's the only thing you're go-ing to do; you're not going to pull any overts. What you going to pull them on? There's no line. What are they all going to do, magically and mystically develop because you think a thought in some yogi position? No. You got to have a communication line. Then, now – now that you've got that one licked, recognize that you've now got your next stages which is what can the guy himself confront? Now, you got to start there and that might be very small indeed. And you start asking, \"What have you done?\" And there's various ways of approaching this sort of thing. \"What have you done?\" Well, he can't confront having done that so you can ask the reverse question, like justifications, don't you see? \"Well, why wasn't that an overt?\" He's got it all explained. Well, that you'd – that – you got that one from him in the first place, you got that \"done,\" what he said he did, that he then had justifications"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 18 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 633 HPCS for, showed you that he himself was not capable of confronting what he had done. So there-fore, you got – what you've got to find out is something he will tell you that he has done that he can confront having done. So that is your next action in the pulling of overts. You not only get a line to pull them on, and that itself is a long gradient, but now you've got the next line and so forth. What does he confront that he can tell you about? Now that you've got a nice line there. Then you have to keep the line in and – while you're pulling overts. And how do you do this? How do you do this? Well, that again is very elementary. It is a problem of overts – just a problem of gradients, gradient overts. You're sitting there and you're saying, \"Well, you say you upset a cup of coffee. All right, thank you very much. Now tell me this, 'Have you ever tortured animals for the fun of it?'\" There goes your communication line, man, you can just hear it snap. Why? Well, the first place you – he may have, and you restimulated the living daylights out of him. You've ARC broke him. He doesn't consider you real, his reality drops and everything else. Well, it isn't anything that you've asked him that's socially incorrect – is you just asked him for more than he himself could confront if he had done it. See, that's the problem. So it actually isn't a problem of being polite or holding your finger right or smiling in a certain way while you're asking the E-Meters or being pleasant to the pc or... That is not the problem at all. It's just simply the problem of asking the guy for overts that he can confront on the gradient that he can confront them. And you ask him for these things and you'll find out that it'll build up on a nice, smooth gradient and he'll give you more and more and more overts and you'll find out as long as you're doing that your communication line doesn't snap and your actual attitude has nothing to do with it. And the communication line itself won't even quiver, as long as you don't jump this thing. But you instantly, having given him some very easy ones to answer, you all of a sud-den ask him something that he has been hiding from himself for a very long time and you ask him for it suddenly, quickly, without any gradient whatsoever with no approach and so forth, communication line itself will snap, too. Now you've really got a job on your hands; you've got what's known as an ARC break. And that's either a session ARC break or it's something of that sort, and you get ahold of it, but you've restimulated some bypassed charge and however you get it off you get it off. Or you get somebody around that can do it to get it off. Now, the point I'm making here... I mean, that's only for a very lower scale auditor. He shouldn't be permitted to handle ARC breaks because, of course, his gradient of training is such that he hasn't got the data of how you handle ARC breaks, so he starts handling ARC breaks and all he does then is re-ARC break the pc, so now he has two ARC breaks where he only had one. Now he starts to handle these two, don't you see, and he's going to have four, and then he's going to have eight, and he's just heading for the long chute. So he should find somebody who knows how to handle an ARC break and get them to do the ARC break as-sessment, and then he can go on with it. Do you see, it's a matter of gradients? Male voice: Yes."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 19 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 634 HPCS This is where it goes. Now, in training, similarly, you start pushing too much in on a person too fast and too suddenly that they cannot confront or have anything to do with, you also have a jumped – a gradient on learning. And they get very, very confused. The fastest way to jump a gradient on learning is to, for instance, teach somebody to read a foreign lan-guage which you haven't taught them to read the alphabet of. I think that would be a marvel-ous way to jump a gradient. Not let them define any of the letters that mean any of the words. You haven't taught them any ABCs, you see. And just say, \"Well, there's that squiggle-wop with a curly tail, and so forth. Now, explain to me what that word is. Explain to me what the word is.\" \"Oh, I can't pronounce it. I don't know what word it is.\" \"Well, you should know the word, you've been studying Arabic now for a month.\" He'll miss, very often miss, and not see how the gradient is being shoved. See, he'll not see how we're jumping the gradient, and he just ARC breaks on it. He thinks we're being ter-ribly unreasonable. We're actually not being unreasonable, we're just being out of gradient. We didn't teach him the alphabet; we don't – he doesn't know how those words sound, be-cause he doesn't know how those symbols that represent the sounds are. He doesn't know how they're pronounced. So therefore he can't add it up to the sound of a word. Now, if he could add it up to the sound of a word he might possibly then remember having heard the word or knowing what letter comes first, he could at least look it up in the English-Arabic dictionary. See, he could do something about it if he had the alphabet. But let's take some poor bloke and let's teach him German. And never point out to him that the German language, which looks very, very similar to English in its – very similar, but it isn't the same. And not point out to him that that particular type of use of letters and that sort of thing are different, and let him get no familiarity with these letters and how they're formed and how they're pronounced. And then all of a sudden start taking up \"hausfrau\" and this sort of thing with him. Then we wonder why he can never make any progress in German. Well, you're never going to make any progress in German. He's going to – he could go to school for years without making any progress in German. Then if nobody came along and pointed out the fact that he had never learned the German alphabet he would simply be telling you the rest of his life, \"Well, I tried to understand German once, but I wasn't good at it.\" This is as close as he got to understanding what was wrong between him and German, see. \"I was-n't good at it.\" Well, I don't know, he can learn a new word out here, somebody drives up and says, \"This is a new Spitzburgen type super snap,\" you know, drives it up, \"A new Spitzburgen type super snap. It's got twelve roarers inside.\" And he says, \"Roarers? What the hell are those?\" \"Well, that's a new capping device that goes on the cylinder. It presses the fuel down hard and it actually injects solid fuel. And that's what they call roarers, you know?\" Some crazy word like this. \"Roarers? Is that so?\" And you find him next day, using it like that. But he tells you, \"I couldn't understand German.\" Well, what was German but a whole bunch of \"roarers,\" see? See? So there must be something peculiar going on here that he can't get on to a – he can't speak German, and the only thing peculiar about it is, is he never walked the gradient neces-"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 20 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 635 HPCS sary to learn German. He didn't walk that gradient. And not having walked the gradient he then walk – wer... wounds up in the upper story with the conviction that he can't speak Ger-man. See, he never analyses it, so we have this person out here who is having an awful time in life. And he's never walked a gradient toward livingness. See? He went in over his head someplace. And he never passed that point of the gradient. Man, he's still there. And when we pick up those points of the gradient he has bypassed and get him to understand them and so forth, we call this clearing. Because at those points of the line he had wrong answers or he had omissions or something of the sort, and when we've got those cleared up, of course, then he can live life, because he has wound up on the gradient to the point where life can be han-dled and confronted. Very easy. Now, that doesn't mean that you always have to approach things slowly. You very of-ten will find a student in school and he'll say, \"Oh, this is arithmetic.\" And you're getting – opening your mouth to say, \"Well, you see, that's a 2, and that's a 2, and when those two things are added together you get 4.\" And he's already been scanning the textbook while you were talking and so forth, and he says, \"Yeah, it's also the square root.\" Now, we mustn't become so dedicated to the gradi-ent that we say, \"No, you're not ready for that yet.\" He just happened to – what throws us in education, why we have very little good experience on the subject of education, I mean we have very little purely-viewed data on the subject, you see – we have in Scientology now, but I mean the world at large – is because they never recognized that people have been educated before. People are up against all sorts of back-pattern jams on the subject of education, and also back-pattern educational things. For instance, we've got a carpenter out here now, he was raising chickens and having an awful time. One day he picked up tools and all of a sudden found out that he could – he could make most anything he laid his hand to. And he could use all the tools and it was all very simple, so he went on using tools and he has been a carpenter ever since. A gradient of exactly nothing. Well, the way life explains this – people explain this – they say he had a talent for it. [laughter] He didn't have any talent for it! They had a staff auditor here one time, old Robin, she was auditing him busily and so forth and, my God, they picked up more deaths as a ship's carpenter than you could shake a stick at, and they even found his last grave down here and a few little things like this. Very unacceptable data to society at large because it restimulates them. But nevertheless here's this fellow's – this fellow's accidental talent, you see, and ship carpentry was based upon, well, probably ages and ages and ages of carpentry. He had also, must have been based on the fact that he had walked a smooth gradient on the subject of car-pentry. He hadn't done many other subjects, but carpentry, he at one time or another, whether in the Roman republic or some place, had learned carpentry right. Somebody had said, \"Now, this is – this is a hammer. And you hold it and you bang it down, and so forth, and that's what that is for. And this is a...\" – we'll go back earlier – \"...piece of flint. And this flint when rubbed over a stick will cut shavings off of it. Now, let's see if you can do that,\" see. They didn't come in to him and say, \"All right, now, we've got a new palace to be built out of san-"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 21 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 636 HPCS dalwood here – and you've just started in on this job and so forth – we've got this new palace, it's all supposed to be carved and gilded and so forth. And there's very careful joisting and fitting that goes into this place, and I want to make sure you've got it right, now finish it up tomorrow.\" The usual gradient run in life. There he would stand, you see, and that would have been the end of his carpentry. But a gradient started right is running right. Now, you've noticed that if you start auditing a pc with some little wins and the gradient is correct and so forth, the pc goes on up the line, and you keep that measured well, you keep the pc winning, little wins as he goes along, and so forth. You notice the pc just gets better and better and better and everything seems to run all right and you don't run into any trouble. Next pc, he didn't get started right, started by some-body else, of course, and he has just been running wrong ever since. Well, if you straightened out his auditing, it's not... this is why you get education mixed up with auditing. He thought something about a session which wasn't right. In other words, he thought something was true of auditing which wasn't true or he had auditing added up in some way that had nothing to do with auditing. And as elementary a thing as that could prevent him from ever going into session. Considerations he has had about auditing, almost an itsa process, might straighten these things out, wham. And all of a sudden put him right straight back in the groove. Of course, he's had enough experience since to learn that what he thought earlier wasn't true but he's never reanalyzed what he thought earlier. He'd never collided with this. So all of a sudden you can turn a pc from a fast progress – from a slow progress pc to a fast progress pc. Now what is the total thing you're using in any one of these cases? You're just using gradients. Whether you're training somebody, whether you're processing somebody on a rou-tine approach to auditing, whether or not you're trying to remedy or straighten out a case, fix up a case that wasn't running well, whether you are trying to pull overts, whether you are try-ing to get PTPs and so forth, they're gradients. It's what can be done that will be real, what can be accomplished, what can be confronted, what part of this fundamental situation do we have to know about in order to resolve the rest of the situation. How do we take this problem apart so that it can be approached. This is the whole – the whole think on the subject of gradients. And if you haven't got that pretty well taped, sooner or later you're going to say, \"Oh, my goodness, I can't pull overts.\" Or \"Something is wrong with my auditing in this particular quarter or that particular quarter and so forth.\" And I think you almost inevitably find that it would boil down to a failure on gradients. Either your own gradient of training was jumped too quick at some point or another or you're jumping this pc too quick or you had several pcs that you've made gradient mistakes on so you began to get a new notion about what pcs are like whereas actually you just keep making the same gradient mistake, see? You try to pull overts before the pc is in communication with you, you see. If you kept making that, pc after pc, you'd only audit four or five pcs to suddenly decide that you couldn't pull overts. See, you'd have new false conclusions. And those false conclusions come into being only because you had jumped a gradient. The early training somebody gets in Scientology is doubly – trebly important to what it ever was before. But we haven't actually done too badly in this. We have made a few mis-"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"GRADIENTS 22 SHSBC-404 – 29.9.64 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 637 HPCS takes here and there inevitably, but I think we have done pretty well. And Mary Sue was go-ing over – as far as gradients are concerned in this society at large – Mary Sue was going over Founding Scientology reports and letters from people and so forth last night, and she was quite astonished at the tremendous number of wins and so forth on the part of people who had only read a textbook or who had only read this or read that. They had approached the thing at the proper gradient. Those people who didn't approach it at a proper gradient or weren't steered on a proper gradient into their studies, didn't make it, didn't have those successes, you see, and so forth, and they're no longer with us. So in the future, all we have to do to swell up the ranks of Scientology and so forth is just remember that in training, auditing, and the intro-duction of the work and so forth to hit it on a proper gradient. And we've got it made all the way. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 638 HPCS HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 24 MAY 1968 Remimeo COACHING In order to help you to do the best you possibly can in the course as far as being a coach is concerned, below you will find a few data that will assist you: 1. Coach with a purpose. Have for your goal when you are coaching that the student is going to get the training drill correct; be purposeful in working toward obtaining this goal. Whenever you correct the student as a coach just don't do it with no reason, with no purpose. Have the purpose in mind for the student to get a better understanding of the training drill and to do it to the best of his ability. 2. Coach with reality. Be realistic in your coaching. When you give an origination to a student really make it an origination, not just something that the sheet said you should say; so that it is as if the stu-dent was having to handle it exactly as you say under real conditions and circumstances. This does not mean, however, that you really feel the things that you are giving the student, such as saying to him, \"My leg hurts.\" This does not mean that your leg should hurt, but you should say it in such a manner as to convey to the student that your leg hurts. Another thing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with. Be inventive in present time. 3. Coach with an intention. Behind all your coaching should be your intention that by the end of the session your student will be aware that he is doing better at the end of it than he did at the beginning. The student must have a feeling that he has accomplished something in the training step, no matter how small it is. It is your intention and always should be while coaching that the student you are coaching be a more able person and have a greater understanding of that on which he is being coached. 4. In coaching take up only one thing at a time. For example: Using TR 4, if the student arrives at the goal set up for TR 4 then check over, one at a time, the earlier TRs. Is he confronting you? Does he originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really intend for you to receive it? Are his acknowledg-ments ending the cycles of communication, etc. But only coach these things one at a time; never two or more at a time. Make sure that the student does each thing you coach him on correctly before going on to the next training step. The better a student gets at a particular"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"COACHING   2   HCOB   24.5.68   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 639 HPCS drill or a particular part of a drill you should demand, as a coach, a higher standard of ability. This does not mean that you should be \"never satisfied\". It does mean that a person can al-ways get better and once you have reached a certain plateau of ability then work toward a new plateau. As a coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coach-ing. Never allow yourself to do a sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your student a disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice. If you are ever in doubt about the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing, then the best thing is to ask the supervisor. He will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct ma-terials. In coaching never give an opinion, as such, but always give your directions as a direct statement, rather than saying \"I think\" or \"Well, maybe it might be this way,\" etc. As a coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are ob-tained on the student. This does not mean, of course, that you are totally responsible but that you do have a responsibility toward the student and the session. Make sure you always run good control on the student and give him good directions. Once in a while the student will start to rationalize and justify what he is doing if he is doing something wrong. He will give you reasons why and becauses. Talking about such things at great length does not accomplish very much. The only thing that does accomplish the goals of the TR and resolves any differences is doing the training drill. You will get fur-ther by doing it than by talking about it. In the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under \"Training Stress\" and \"Purpose\" on the training sheet. These training drills occasionally have a tendency to upset the student. There is a pos-sibility that during a drill a student may become angry or extremely upset or experience some misemotion. Should this occur the coach must not \"back off\". He should continue the training drill until he can do it without stress or duress and he feels \"good about it\". So, don't \"back off\" but push the student through whatever difficulty he may be having. There is a small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when he has gotten the drill right or he has done a good job on a particular step. Besides correcting wrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness. You very definitely \"flunk\" the student for anything that amounts to \"self-coaching\". The reason for this is that the student will tend to introvert and will look too much at how he is doing and what he is doing rather than just doing it. As a coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and don't become so interested in what you yourself are doing that you neglect the student and are unaware of his ability or inability to do the drill correctly. It is easy to become \"interesting\" to a student; to make him laugh and act up a bit. But your main job as a coach is to see how good he can get in each training drill and that is what you should have your attention on; that, and how well he is doing."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"COACHING   3   HCOB   24.5.68   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 640 HPCS To a large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coach-ing.

Axioms, rules, stable data in capitals and patter must be duplicated word for word and under-stood. Definitions must be closely duplicated and understood. General theory and examples must be understood. If you are in doubt whether the student has duplicated the data well enough continue the drill. This coaching method works well only if it is tightly muzzled. Any extra questions or additives to the exact procedure of Steps One, Two and Three are destructive. The coach may understand and acknowledge student originations, but he must do nothing else not designated in the Drill. Coaches will find that some students may spend some time on the first few bulletins coached in this manner. However, the student's ability to duplicate and understand will im-prove rapidly and his learning rate will come way up. If the student has too much difficulty doing this drill, run Reach and Withdraw on the material to be learned to a flat point and re-turn to the drill. If you haven't done this drill you won't know that it works. Do it, do it exactly as writ-ten, and you'll be winning from there on out in learning Theory.

Make the coach who caused it retrieve any student who blows. 7. An Instructor's sole purpose is not to make a student blow. The main goal of an In-structor is to make a better auditor. This then must apply to coaches. 8. Always answer your students' questions as per the Instructor's Code. An Instructor should not withhold communication from students when the student needs communi-cation. 9. Run good 8-C on students with lots of ARC. Stress good 8-C more than ARC. 10. The most important thing an Instructor should do is to make a good auditor out of every student. This means making good coaches. This means wins. This means being-ness.

Cognition's are the milestones of case gain. Rough TRs, rough metering, Out Code and a distractive auditor then make no case gain. When an auditor has smooth, usual TRs, does his metering expertly and without at-tracting the pc's attention, when he follows the Auditor's Code (particularly regarding Evalua-tion and Invalidation) and when he is interested, not interesting as an auditor, the pc cognites and makes case gains. Further, according to the axioms, a bank straightens out by as-ising its content. If the pc's attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so As-Ising cannot occur. The definition of In Session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor. When this definition describes the session in progress, then of course the pc will be able to as-is and will cognite. By THE ORIGINAL THESIS, the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pc's bank. When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can't be heard, doesn't ack, doesn't give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has out-TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over-acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc's attention onto himself. So the pc's attention, not being on his bank, doesn't as-is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by-passes F/Ns or calls F/Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc \"That reads\" \"That blew down\" etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of In-Session. The pc's attention goes to the meter, not his bank, so he doesn't as-is or cognite."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"TRS AND COGNITION’S 2 HCOB 26.4.71 I PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 653 HPCS Auditor Invalidation and Evaluation is just plain villainy.

TRs DEFINITION The term \"TRs\" is an abbreviation for Training Regimen or Routine. TRs are also of-ten referred to as Training Drills. While each individual TR drill has its own specific purpose, the overall purpose and definition of TRs is given here fully and finally: TRs are methods of drilling the communication formula and be-coming expert in its handling and use. That definition applies to any TR. At times over the years when it has been dropped out or obscured or misunderstood, auditor training quality and results have suffered."},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  2  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 655 HPCS Therefore, this full and final definition is to be posted in large letters in any course room where Professional TRs are taught. It should be emblazoned upon the foreheads and minds of TR Course Supervisors and all students on TRs Courses in training to become audi-tors. It should be known broadly and understood and emphasized. In 1971, due to the following factors, I found it necessary to modernize TRs 0 to 4. 1. The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs. 2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit. 3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their sub-jects but TRs. 4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic proc-esses stem directly from inability to do the TRs. 5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further. 6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. The preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubs without ARC breaks. These factors hold very true today and always will. Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. Profes-sional TRs Courses are not a tea party. The TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy and HGC and in the future should never be relaxed. A more gradient approach to TRs is taught on specially packaged co-audits for those with no prior technical training, where the same degree of flawlessness and skill demanded of a professional auditor is not demanded of the untrained co-auditor. And there is still another gradient of TRs found on courses for new public in Division 6, where the person is getting his first experience in handling communication in his life and livingness. But on a Professional TRs Course for auditors absolutely no standards are lowered. Professional auditors in training are given real TRs – rough, tough and hard. To do oth-erwise is to lose 90% of the results. There is nothing pale and patty-cake about TRs. This HCOB means what it says. It does not mean something else. It does not im-ply another meaning. It is not open to interpretation from another source. THE A-R-C TRIANGLE As TRs are methods of drilling the communication cycle, one cannot expect to master TRs without familiarity with that cycle. And basic to the drilling or any real use of the comm"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  3  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 656 HPCS cycle is an understanding of Affinity, Reality and Communication, which make up the ARC Triangle. There is no attempt here to repeat all of the existing data on the ARC Triangle and its use. Any student put on TRs must first have done a sound study of this theory. The data exists in the books: THE PROBLEMS OF WORK, Chapter 6: Affinity, Reality and Communication THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THOUGHT, Chapter 5: The ARC Triangle DIANETICS 55! and in various HCOB Bulletins in the Technical Volumes. A student ready for TR drills would know and would have demonstrated how Affinity, Reality and Communication interrelate. He would be familiar with how one improves the level of ARC by first raising one side of this important triangle in order to raise the next side and the next, and how ARC brings about Understanding. When he has that data he's better prepared to handle the comm cycle. THE FULL CYCLE OF COMMUNICATION Communication Defined If one were to put it very simply, it could be said, correctly, that communication is the interchange of ideas across space. A finer statement of this is given in the following definition from Axiom 28: Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or parti-cle from source-point across a distance to receipt-point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt-point a duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source-point. The simplest statement of the formula of communication is Cause-Distance-Effect. When we do a close inspection of this formula and the cycle involved, its many ele-ments come to view. The Parts Of The Full Communication Cycle The full cycle of communication is made up of these components: Observation, Confront, Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Par-ticle or Impulse or Message, Distance, Estimation of Distance, Control (Start-Change-Continue-Stop), Direction, Time and Timing, Velocity, Volume, Clarity, Interest, Impinge-ment, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Answer, Acknowledgement, Understanding. It also includes Nothingness or Somethingness."},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  4  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 657 HPCS Each TR drill is designed to train the student in one or more of these various compo-nents, until he has become expert in handling each part of the communication cycle and the communication cycle as a whole. When a student understands and has fully demonstrated the basic theory of communi-cation in clay, including the theory of the ARC Triangle and how it works in practice and the use of the communication cycle and all of its parts, he is well equipped to begin his training in TRs. DRILLING TRS ON A PROFESSIONAL TRS COURSE The student first studies the TR, clears any misunderstood words in it and makes sure he understands it. Then he drills it. He must do TRs. If during the drilling he has questions about the TR, he restudies it and gets right back onto drilling it. At no time may a coach or supervisor give a verbal interpretation of the HCOB. All queries and questions are handled by referring the student to the HCOB, getting him to restudy or re-word clear the drill. Then getting him to do the drill. In addition to this Bulletin, the supervisor may have the student and his twin study, in HCOB 18 Apr 80 TR CRITICISM, the section on the specific TR drill they are trying to do. On professional TRs, done the hard way, students drill each TR to a pass, one at a time. This is the rough, tough way it was done earlier, in the '60s, with results. The earlier action of getting a student through each TR itself, one at a time, and increasing the gradient of toughness as he does that TR, is what has proven successful. If a student has trouble and hangs up and can't pass an upper TR, he hasn't made it on the lower TRs. This has been proven conclusively. Start him back at the be-ginning of the TRs again. He re-drills each TR until he does it competently to a pass. If he then hangs up on the lower TRs, you would put him all the way back to restudy ARC and the cycle of communication, as there will be something there he hasn't grasped. TRs are coached and supervised with attention and with the intention of getting the student to win. By win we mean honestly mastering each TR as he goes. There's got to be a supervisor there to ensure this occurs. Lax, permissive coaching or lax, permissive supervision have no place on a Profes-sional TRs Course. They are simply an extension of the permissiveness of modern education where nobody winds up educated. This is not how we train. Permissiveness is nothing more than a symptom of the inability to confront. A professional TRs Course is taught and taught hard, not permissively. The above points are those which make up the expertise of how it is done. There are not many of these points but they have to be emphasized."},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  5  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 658 HPCS TRAINING DRILLS 0-4 These TRs are done exactly per this HCOB without added actions or change. NUMBER: OT TR 0 1971 REVISED 1980 NAME: Operating Thetan Being There THEORY: OT TR 0 is the drill which provides an undercut to the actual use of the communi-cation formula. For any communication to take place, it requires somebody there. On OT TR 0 the student is drilling simply being there as potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Receipt-point. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Two students sit facing each other with eyes closed, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train the student simply to be there comfortably. The idea is to get the student able to BE there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there and not do anything else but be there. TRAINING STRESS: Students sit facing each other with eyes closed. There is no conversa-tion. This is a silent drill. There is no twitching, moving, confronting with a body part, \"sys-tem\" or vias used or anything else added to be there. One will usually see blackness or an area of the room when one's eyes are closed. Be there, comfortably. This does not mean the stu-dent is supposed to be completely unfeeling or unaware. And he does not get into a figure-figure or go into weird additives or considerations. There is no complexity to this drill. It means exactly what it says – simply be there, comfortably. Students do not coach each other on OT TR 0. The Supervisor does the coaching, covering the whole classroom, spotting any twitches, squirming, etc., and flunking them. If a student goes to sleep or starts boiling off, the supervisor gets him back onto the drill. He simply keeps the students at it. PATTER: None for students. Supervisor starts the drill with \"Start\" and uses\"That's it\" to ter-minate the drill. When he needs to flunk a student he uses \"Flunk\" and indicates what the flunk is on. When a student can BE there comfortably for some time, the drill is passed. NOTE: OT TR 0 would only be coached on a student by his twin if the student had flunked a later TR and been put back onto OT TR 0. It is then up to his twin to get him through, coach-ing him as the supervisor would, with the supervisor also keeping an eye on it. This means the student coach (who would have his eyes open for this coaching) sits across from the student who is doing OT TR 0, observing him and flunking twitches, squirming, etc. During this coaching, the coach would use \"Start\" \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\" as given in the Patter section above.

NUMBER: TR 0 CONFRONTING REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting. THEORY: On TR 0, in addition to potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Re-ceipt-point, the following parts of the comm cycle are entered in: Observation, Distance, Con-sideration, Attention, Confront. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other with eyes open, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront another person with auditing only or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there comfortably and confront and not do anything else but be there and confront TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making any con-versation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and do noth-ing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle, be embarrassed or anaten, or ex-hibit any reactive body motion which would be distractive to a preclear. TR 0 requires some coaching. It can be done uncoached for an initial period to accustom stu-dents to confronting and to permit some time for student to get through the initial manifesta-tions he may encounter when first doing the drills. Thereafter, the drill is coached on a student by his twin, and vice versa, on a turnabout basis. It will be found the student tends to confront with a body part, rather than just confront, or tends to use a system of confronting rather than just be there. This can show up in any number of ways including fidgeting, giggling, twitching, or any distractive motion or manifestation. Flunks are given for those as they are indications of non-confront, and they would be taken up and coached on the drill. Automatic body functions which are not distractive, such as normal breathing, swallowing, blinking, are not taken up by the coach or the supervisor. To clarify what has been known in the past as \"Blinkless TR 0\", the statement should be made that this does not mean the person never blinks. It is defined here finally and in full to mean that when a person's TR 0 is in he doesn't exhibit manifestations of inability to confront, in-cluding blinking nervously or flinching or doing anything else that would be distractive to a pc and shows a non-confront. PATTER: When TR 0 is coached, coach uses \"Start\" to begin the coaching period. He uses \"Flunk\" when the student shows any manifestation of non-confront, indicates what the non-confront is, and uses \"Start\" to begin the drill again. \"That's it\" is used to terminate the drill."},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  7  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 660 HPCS NOTE: The drill is mis-named if Confronting means to do something to the person. The whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of another person without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self. Confront-ing with a body part can cause somatics in that body part being used to confront. The solution is just to be there and confront. On a Professional TRs Course the student passes when he can just be there and do a straight, uninterrupted 2 hours of good, acceptable confront. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\".

NUMBER: TR 0 BULLBAIT REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting Preclear Bullbaited. THEORY: On TR 0 Bullbaited the student drills being there as potential Cause or Source-point and being there as Effect or Receipt-point, with Duplication. He is also drilling Obser-vation, Distance, Consideration, Attention, Confront and particularly confronting a preclear who is being Cause or Source-point. The gradient of confront is increased on this drill, with emphasis on the fact that the student is confronting a preclear no matter what the preclear says or does. COMMANDS: Coach: \"Start\" \"That's it\" \"Flunk\". POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably and confront a preclear in a position three feet in front of the preclear without being thrown off, distracted or reacting in any way to what the preclear says or does. It is on TR 0 Bullbaited that the student learns to confront a preclear. TRAINING STRESS: After the student has passed TR 0 and he can just BE there comfortably and confront, \"bull baiting\" can begin. Anything added to being there and confronting the preclear is sharply flunked by the coach. Twitches, sighs, fidgets, anything except just being there is promptly flunked, with the reason why. PATTER: Student coughs. Coach: \"Flunk! You coughed. Start.\" This is the whole of the coach's patter as a coach. Coach then repeats whatever he had said or done that caused the student to react. He continues to coach the student on that \"button\", flattening it to a win for the student before going on to another button or other bullbaiting."},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  8  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 661 HPCS Button: An item, word, phrase, subject, voice tone, mannerism, anything that causes a person to react, causes him discomfort, embarrassment, upset or to laugh uncontrollably, etc. It is called a \"button\" because when you push it you get a reaction. PATTER AS A CONFRONTED SUBJECT: Bullbaiting is done on a gradient, giving the stu-dent lighter situations to begin with so student is not plunged into overwhelm at the start. Coach gets the student through the lighter situations and confronting those, then gradually stiffens the gradient, giving the student more and more to confront. The coach may say any-thing or do anything except leave the chair. The student's \"buttons\" should be found (these will be spotted by the coach during drilling) and each button flattened before it is left. A but-ton is never left unflat. Any words that are not coaching words may receive no response from the student. If the student responds, the coach is instantly a coach (see patter above). Student passes when he can BE there comfortably and confront a preclear without being thrown off or distracted or reacting in any way to anything the coach says or does. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be \"interesting\".

NUMBER: TR-1 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Dear Alice THEORY: On TR 1, the student is using Observation, Consideration and confront as previ-ously drilled. He is also drilling being Cause or Source-point, awareness or Effect of Receipt-Point, and as Cause getting a Message (or Impulse or Particle) across a Distance to Receipt-point with Attention, Interest, Control, correct Direction, correct estimation of Distance, Time and correct Timing, correct Velocity, correct Volume, Clarity and Impingement, and with the Intention that it is received and duplicated at Receipt-point. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver a command newly and in a new unit of time to a preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using a via, and to deliver a command with the intention that it is received. COMMANDS: A phrase (with the \"he said\" omitted) is picked out of the book Alice in Won-derland and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where he is. In other words it must be received by the coach. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to the coach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural not artificial. Diction and elocution have no part in it. Loudness may have."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  9  HCOB  16.8.71RA  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 662 HPCS The coach must have received the command (or question) clearly and have understood it be-fore he says \"Good\". The operative word here is received. The communication must be re-ceived at Receipt-point as when that has occurred duplication can take place. Any datum that every command must sound exactly like the last command is false. Each question or command is delivered in a new unit of time. When that does not occur the same tonality will be noted, command after command, and the student appears robotic. A command delivered naturally is one that is delivered newly in a new unit of time. Don't buy an unchanging student or a wrongly done TR. If a student is unchanging (delivers 3 or 4 robotic TR-1s in a row) flunk him, coax him to do it correctly, make sure he knows and understands the drill and do all possible to get him de-livering a command naturally that arrives. But if there is still no change, put him back on OT TR 0 as he hasn't made it on his lower TRs. PATTER: The coach says \"Start\", says \"Good\" without a new start if the command is re-ceived. He says \"Flunk\" if the command is not received. \"Start\" is not used again. \"That's it\" is used to end the activity or to terminate for a brief discussion. Any discussion is kept to a minimum. If student has a question it is acknowledged, student studies the TR again for any necessary clarification and is put back on the drill. If session is terminated for a discussion, coach must say \"Start\" again before it resumes. This drill is passed only when the student can put across a command naturally, without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures, and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly. When the coach thinks the student has done it he asks the student if he has done it. If the coach is satisfied that he is receiving the commands, each newly in a new unit of time, and the student is satisfied that he has done it, he passes on to the next TR. HISTORY: Developed by L.

He is also drilling switching from Cause (Source-point) to Effect (Receipt-point) in order to receive, Understand and Duplicate the preclear's Answer, and then back to Cause to give the Acknowledgement. The real emphasis here is on the drilling of Control (the Start-Change-Stop of a communica-tion), as he uses the Acknowledgement to bring the communication to a full stop. Timing, Velocity, Volume and Impingement also enter into this drill.

Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle of communica-tion or an encouragement to the preclear to go on and that an acknowledgement must be ap-propriate for the pc's comm. The student must be broken of the habit of robotically using \"Good\", \"Thank you\" as the only acks. To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc with an acknowledgement or can take a pc's head off with an acknowledgement.

To teach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked. COMMANDS: \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone be-fore. Duplicating the auditing question without variation in a new unit of time does not mean a robotic duplication of tone of voice, command after command. It means that the original ques-tion asked is asked in a new unit of time without variation of the question. Any idea that the student must give every command sounding exactly like the last command is a false datum and only serves to mis-train the student into robotic delivery. The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time. The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she fails to repeat the exact questions, if he or she \"Q and As\" with excursions taken by the coach. Q and A means: Asking a question that is based on the last answer. It never completes any cycle. (REF: HCOB 5 APR 1980, Q & A, THE REAL DEFINITION.) The student is also flunked for ro-botic delivery of the question or command. PATTER: The coach uses \"Start\" and \"Flunk\". \"That's it\" is used to terminate the session. \"Start\" must be used to begin a coaching session again after a \"That's it\". The coach is not bound after starting to answer the student's question but may comm lag or give a commenting type answer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer. Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the stu-dent. Example:"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 12 HCOB 16.8.71RA PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 665 HPCS Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Yes\" Student: \"Good\" Student: \"Do fish swim?\" Coach: \"Aren't you hungry?\" Student: \"Yes.\" Coach: \"Flunk\" When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, \"I'll repeat the auditing ques-tion\", and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgement and as needed, the repeat statement is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A is flunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utter the next com-mand (or with a long comm lag) is flunked. A choppy or premature acknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) is flunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" or \"That's it\" should have no influence on the student except to get him to give a repeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, \"I'll repeat the auditing command.\" \"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"Good\" and \"That's it\" may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Any other statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If he succeeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as \"I just had a cognition.\" 'Coach divertive' statements should all concern the student, and should be de-signed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing. The student's job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, using only command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or her hands to prevent a 'Blow' (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than the above, it is a flunk and the coach must say so. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is no longer needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. This TR was redesigned to improve that frailty. Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to in-clude the definition of Q and A, flunks for robotic delivery of question, and to include theory on the comm cycle. NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Preclear Originations. THEORY: On TR 4 the student drills handling another's origination of a communication cycle as well as handling his own cycle of communication, and ensuring that both of these cycles are completed. All the parts of the cycle of communication come into play in this drill."},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 13 HCOB 16.8.71RA PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 666 HPCS PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination. COMMANDS: The student runs \"Do fish swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" on coach. Coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list (see Attachment of this HCOB, taken from the Preclear Origination Sheet at the back of The Book of E-Meter Drills). Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1. Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he cor-rects the student into better handling. PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concern the auditor. Otherwise the coach's patter is the same as in TR 3 (\"Start\", \"Flunk\", \"That's it\" and \"Start\" to resume the coaching session after a \"That's it\"). The student's patter is governed by: 1. Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving the repeat statement \"I'll repeat the auditing command\", and then giving it. Anything else is a flunk. The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem that concerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3.) Flunks are given if the student does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session. Flunks are also given for too abrupt a shift of attention or too slow a shift of attention back to the session, or for failure to return the pc to session at all. Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student's failure to differentiate between these (by trying to handle them) and coach's remarks about self as \"pc\" is a flunk. Student's failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should not always read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. By Originate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. By Comment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations are handled, Comments are disregarded by the student."},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 14 HCOB 16.8.71RA PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 667 HPCS The coach uses the Comments & Originations Sheet, attached to this issue, choosing items at random to drill the student in handling. When the student has mastered 1. Understanding; 2. Acknowledging; 3. Returning pc to session, the gradient is upped and the student is flunked for any part of the comm cycle being out. This would include non-confront, failure to get a communication across, using a half acknowl-edgement improperly (and thus inviting the pc to continue endlessly when the pc isn't even answering the question asked) when a full stop acknowledgement is required, failure to en-courage the pc to continue when it is necessary, failure to get the question answered or to de-liver each command in a new unit of time, as well as any flub in handling preclear origina-tions. The drill is passed when the student can handle cycles of communication smoothly and natu-rally. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks, Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the comm course TRs despite its appearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors. ROBOTIC TRS Stiff, unnatural TRs are robotic TRs. Students and auditors who haven't mastered the TRs will handle communication robotically. Anatomy Of A Robot It can be said of robots that: 1. They don't know what a comm cycle is. 2. They have never really passed OT TR 0. 3. They have never really passed TR 0. 4. They have never really passed TR 0 Bullbait. 5. They don't do TR 1 in a new unit of time each time they give it, so they all sound alike and they probably have TR 3 mixed up with TR 1, or they are stuck in an unflat 0 Se-ries (OT TR 0, TR 0, TR 0 BB)."},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 15 HCOB 16.8.71RA PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 668 HPCS 6. They don't realize their TRs are addressed to the person in front of them but are probably addressed to the instructors for a pass. And so, with a combination of the above, these students and auditors will look like robots. They would never get the product of a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. And it's possible that they don't know that that is their product. The point is, however, that it would be almost impossible for any student or auditor to go on looking like a robot if he actually did the TRs. The remedy for robotic TRs is to put the student back onto restudy of the basics, the ARC Triangle and the cycle of communication, and then to re-drill the TRs from OT TR 0 on up, each one this time to a real pass. With these standard actions done he will reach the EP and wind up a Valuable Final Product. VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCT AND END PHENOMENON OF TRS ON A PROFESSIONAL TRS COURSE The Primary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A Professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. The Secondary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A person with the session and social presence of a professional auditor and that pres-ence can be summed up as a being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation no matter how rough. The End Phenomenon of TRs is: A being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out. With honest drilling of the cycle of communication on TRs these skills are fully achievable. And any being mastering these skills is capable in the extreme. L.

Remimeo (Corrections in this type style.) Study Series 2 CONFRONTING The first requisite of any subject is the ability to confront the various components (things) (parts) (divisions) of the subject itself. All misunderstoods, confusions, omissions, alterations of a subject begin with failures or unwillingness to confront. The difference between a good pilot and a bad pilot depends of course on consistent study and practice, but underlying this, determining whether the person will study and prac-tice, is the ability to confront the components of study and airplanes. A \"quick study\", by which is meant a student who learns rapidly or a person who grasps a subject quickly, has a high ability to confront that subject. In a dramatic profession, the wild animal trainer who could confront wild animals re-mained alive. The one who couldn't confront was too slow of perception to live long. In a more common line of work, the fast typist could confront study and typing in the first place and the slow typist couldn't and can't. The confusions about \"talent\" and \"native ability\" and such are resolved to no small extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront. Basically, if one can just be there with it, he can then achieve the skill of communicat-ing with whatever \"it\" is and handling it. Thus, before communicating with the components of a subject can properly begin, one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject. All power depends upon the ability to hold a location. To communicate one must be able to hold to a location. This is even true in the physical universe. You can't move a chair unless you can hold a position yourself near the chair. If you don't believe it, try it."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 2 HCOB 2.6.71 I PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 675 HPCS Thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle. But before one can communicate with something one must be able to be in a location near it. The age-old puzzle of how some scholars can get \"A\" on a subject they have studied and then not be able to apply even a scrap of the data is resolved by this fact of confronting. They can confront the book, the class and the thought. But they haven't attained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject. At least such \"glib\" students can confront the book, the paper, the thought. They are partway there. Now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which the subject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know. Some people are not so lucky as to be \"glib\" students. They have to work up to \"being there\" with the book, paper, classroom and teacher. Thus \"confronting\" is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive. Amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this. Dullness, percep-tion trouble, fogginess, sleep and even pains, emotions and convulsions can occur when one knowingly sets out to be there and comfortably perceive with the various parts of a subject. These reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres (continues) and at last, some-times soon, sometimes after a long while, one can be there and perceive the component. As one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront other compo-nents. People have mental tricks they use to get around actual confronting—to be disinter-ested, to realize it's not important, to be sort of half dead, etc—but these discharge (run out) as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortably perceive. Eye blinks, swallows, twitches, aches, pains, are all systems of interrupting confront-ing and are the symptoms of discomfort. There are many of these. If they are present then one is not just being there and perceiving. Confronting on a via (using a relay point) is another method of ducking out of it. The worst off cannot even tolerate the idea of being there and perceiving anything. They run away, even go into emotional fits rather than be there and perceive. Such people's lives are a system of interruptions and vias, all substitutes for confronting. They are not very successful. For success in life depends not on running away from it but by being there and perceiving it and then being able to communicate with it and handle it. TERMS \"A gradient scale\" means a gradual increasing condition of, or a little more of, little by little."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 3 HCOB 2.6.71 I PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 676 HPCS A \"skipped gradient\" means taking on a higher degree or amount before a lesser de-gree of it has been handled. One has to go back and handle the missed degree or thing or else one will have just losses on a subject thereafter. \"Flattening\" something means to do it until it no longer produces a reaction. \"Overrunning\" something means accumulating protests and upsets about it until it is just a mass of stops. Anyone can do anything forever unless he begins to stop it. \"Invalidation\" means a refuting or degrading or discrediting or denying something someone else considers to be a fact. GRADIENTS Some of the things one would have to be able to be there and perceive in order to study, placed on a graduated scale of increasing difficulty are:  Beginning at all.  The classroom or work space.  Paper.  Books.  Writing materials.  Sounds.  A Student.  The Supervisor.  The area of the study subject's physical components.  The motionless equipment of the subject.  The moving equipment of the subject.  Masses connected with the subject.  The subject as a whole. ————— "},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 4 HCOB 2.6.71 I PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 677 HPCS The next stages would have to be confronting while moving. This requires a consecu-tive being there and perceiving even though one is occupying different locations. The next stages would be confronting selectively while moving despite other things seeking to distract. ————— This Bulletin is not an effort to set out the numerous confronting drills. It is intended to set out the various axioms or laws necessary to an understanding of the subject of confront-ing itself. From these brief notes all the axioms can be derived. The fundamental and basic simplicities of confronting itself is the first thing that must be grasped. All complexity surrounding any subject or action is derived (comes from) a greater or lesser inability to confront. L.

TR One must be done so the pc can hear and understand the auditor (without blowing the pc's head off either). TR Two must be done so that the pc gets acknowledged. This can be so corrupted that the auditor doesn't ack at all but gives the pc meter reads! Instead of acks! Or keeps saying, \"I didn't understand you,\" etc. TR Three basically existed so that the auditor would continue to give the pc com-mands and not squirrel off or pack up with total silence. TR Four exists so that the pc's origins are accepted and not Qed and Aed with or in-validated. And, surprise, surprise, TRs are for use in the session itself, not just a drill. They are how one runs a session. An auditor can miss by calling \"F/Ns\" with high or low TA. And one never feeds me-ter data to the pc: \"That read,\" \"That didn't read,\" \"That blew down,\" just must not exist in session patter. \"Thank you. That F/Ned,\" is as far as an auditor goes. And that's the end of the cycle and says so. Erasure can be overlooked by an auditor. In Dianetics this fault is fatal."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   2   HCOB   21.4.71RC   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 679 HPCS Auditor's Code must be in on all points and particularly invalidation. Pc says, \"That's so and so.\" An auditor who says, \"I'm sorry. You are wrong,\" or any other invalidation is go-ing to wreck a pc's case. A full knowledge of the Auditor's Code and actually applying it saves endless troubles. It is an auditing tool, not just a nice idea. REHABBING CHAINS One rehabs a Dianetic chain that, according to a previous worksheet, erased by saying, \"According to session records (flow direction) (item) erased.\" That's all. One does not say, \"Did the chain giving others a headache erase?\" One does not run it again to find out. One does not run a single command \"to see if it F/Ns again.\" One can say, \"Do you agree that the chain giving another a headache erased?\" But the more you ask the pc to look for an erased chain the more messed up things will get. It isn't there. But the auditor by his action can imply it should be there or might be there. A totally wrong approach would be \"Look around your bank and see if what isn't there any more isn't there.\" Dianetics is not Scientology. A Dianetic chain is not a release. If you try to use Scien-tology rehab tech on a Dianetic chain, you have had it. It isn't a \"release\" (which is a key-out). A Dianetic chain is an erasure. You can't rehab erasures with \"How many times?\", etc. The test of this is the doing. If you try to use Scn rehab on Dianetic chains, the pc might try to find something. This causes him to key-in other unrun or similar items. It is a dangerous action at best to try to handle old erased chains. The best you can do is to tell the pc what the old W/S said. If no W/S exists leave the already erased flows alone! FLUBBED CHAINS Many times, a Folder Error Summary will give a flubbed chain and then fail to note it was repaired in the next session! A C/S and auditor would have been pretty irresponsible to just go on auditing past flubbed chains. The only safe way to handle some previous flubbed chain is to: (a) Verify in the folder if it was repaired. (b) If still unrepaired assess the L3RE on it and handle according to the L3RE. L3RE Using the new L3RE (HCOB 11 Apr 71RB) is a Dianetic action. A Scientology auditor erroneously can try to use it as a two-way comm type of list. If a chain needed one more DEF, then two-way comm on it with no DEF is not going to com-plete it."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   3   HCOB   21.4.71RC   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 680 HPCS L3RE has its own directions. Questions not marked with directions are used to indi-cate the fact. This can amount to two-way comm as the pc chews it over. But L3RE where marked is handled by Dianetics actions. Look over the list and its directions for each question and you will see that some are given directions that are NOT 2WC. Example: \"Earlier beginning\" reads. You can't just say, \"The incident had an earlier beginning,\" and you can't say, \"Tell me about the earlier beginning.\" The pc will go up the wall. There'll be no erasure. You have to use R3M and get him to the earlier beginning and then run it and if it still doesn't erase, get him to an earlier similar and erase that. L3RE is a Dianetics list. It is not a Scientology list that is cleared each question to F/N by 2-way comm. OVERRUN Overruns are demonstrated by a rising TA. If as you seek to get in Full Flow Dianetics (Ref: HCOB 7 Mar 71R Rev 25 July 78 C/S Series 28RA-1R USE OF QUADRUPLE DIANETICS. HCOB 4 Apr 71-1RA Rev 25 July 78 C/S Series 32RA-1RA USE OF QUAD DIANETICS. HCOB 5 Apr 71 Reissued 13 Jan 75 C/S Series 33R-1 TRIPLE AND QUAD RERUNS (page 380 Tech Vol VIII)) the pc's TA begins to average higher, overrun is occurring. Example: While doing FFD pc's TA has been riding at 2.2 and F/Ns. After a new FFD action it begins to ride at 2.5 and F/Ns. Something is being overrun. Find it and indicate it. And cease to stir the bank up so much! The fault is going over items already run. In doing a Full Flow Table you often find that the same or similar have been run in the past. Sometimes you find that a previous attempt to run the item a second or third time has resulted in an ARC break, the reason for which was never detected. The right action is to note the session date it was first run and just tell the pc, \"Feeling surprised was run three times. On (first date it was erased) it was erased. When later run it was an overrun.\" This tends to blow the later charge laid in by trying to run the same item again. It sounds so strange that erased chains can be overrun. But it is true. What happens is that pcs try to cooperate and put something there. FIREFIGHTS The action of a quarrel between an auditor and a pc is called a firefight. Restimulating earlier unrun engrams or overrunning chains upsets a pc. The best ac-tion, as soon as a pc is disturbed, is to do an L3RE fast and handle what reads the way it should be handled according to the L3RE. The wrong way is to argue or try to go on."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   4   HCOB   21.4.71RC   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 681 HPCS The pc does not know what it is. He just feels awful. He tries to guess. He will ARC Brk or get sad if the auditor continues. The correct action is an L3RE. L1C is not of great use in a Dianetic ARC Brk. L3RE is. If the pc remains ARC broken, try L3RE again, particularly the whole L3RE. A Scientology session would be handled with some other list (L1C, L4BRA, etc.). A Dianetic session, including and especially FFD, is handled with L3RE. You NEVER prepcheck while doing Dianetics. This mushes up the engrams. INTERIORIZATION ALL these cautions apply as well to an Interiorization-Exteriorization Rundown, when restim occurs one uses an L3RE quickly. Int-Ext RD is essentially a Dianetic, not a Scientology, action. SAFE ACTIONS A fully genned-in auditor, well crammed, well drilled, well skilled, can be trusted with Dianetics, Dianetic Quads and an Int-Ext RD. Auditors not so handled can get pcs into seri-ous trouble with these things. A safe course is to use Quads on new, never audited before pcs. Those begun on Quads use then only Quad flows. C/S RESPONSIBILITY Any trouble a C/S is running into comes from the factors of TRs, metering, Code and incomplete or false auditors' reports. If when I am C/Sing I ever find an auditor has omitted key session actions or has falsi-fied a report, I order that auditor not to Cramming but a full retrain of the Hubbard New Era Dianetics Course right on up. A C/S does not see these points. He can get the pc asked what the auditor is doing or did. He can get sessions monitored. This helps him fill this gap in his data. It's what isn't in the auditor's report that is often the trouble. Auditors omit what they said, omit the firefight, omit session alter-is in their worksheets. All this sticks the C/S's neck out for the axe of failure. So particularly in FFD, Int-Ext and other such actions, a C/S has to act to obtain con-fidence in the auditor's TRs, metering, Code use and accurate worksheets."},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   5   HCOB   21.4.71RC   PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 682 HPCS RISK In FFD, Int-Ext RD and Power, experience has proven that if the auditor is not top grade, if the C/S is not alert, we put a pc at risk.

INTRODUCING FFD FFD (like the Int-Ext RD) requires flawless C/Sing and auditing or the case goes wrong. When these actions were introduced they showed up any flaws in case studying, TRs, metering, Code and worksheets. There are two ways to handle. (a) Cancel FFD and Int-Ext as actions.

The Interne Supervisor is responsible for forcing in daily TRs on Auditors, Internes, C/Ses, Cramming Officer, Pc Examiner, Word Clearers, Basic Courses Supervisors, Success Officer, D of P and D of T. Auditors and Internes get their TRs training done outside of production hours and time must be provided daily for this to be done. Each personnel may not be prevented from doing daily TRs. Technical reports show that some Auditors do not get in their minimum 25 WD hours showing the vital need for lots of TRs to be done. Poor scheduling keeps Auditors wait-ing, and unnecessarily lengthens their auditing day, leaving no time for daily TRs. Daily TRs and Auditor and Interne training times actually reduce time in Cramming. Auditors and Su-pervisors do not have cases and are expected to work on their TRs daily.

Certainty. 2) Student B (A Key SCN Exec with former case trouble) – Went through a very heavy body motion thing for six days – severe jerking of the shoulders – almost like a coma. Yesterday he come out of it with tremendous Cogs. Said he felt great and his machin-ery was broken down. 3) Student C (An FEBC Grad) – Took off his glasses, and has not put them back on, said he didn't need them. Looks extremely bright.

They are practical demonstrations of real live TRs. Some orgs have their own ideas about TRs, consider TRs as demonstrated in those tapes to be \"old – we don't do it that way any more\" and have substituted their own versions such as a rote TR-4 \"Thank you I'll repeat the auditing command.\" Thank you I'll repeat the auditing command.\" That is not TR-4.

It's all in the HCOB and correctly demonstrated in the LRH Model Auditing tapes. So how about getting them read, listen to and applied and watch the resulting upsurge in person-nel effectiveness and soaring student and auditing stats! TARGETS 1. Get all auditors, internes, and supervisors onto daily drilling of TRs done correctly per the HCOB and the LRH Model tapes. Study the TRs from the 16 Aug 71 HCOB, M4 and clean up any misunderstoods, listen carefully to the LRH Model Tapes, do the drilling. Note that auditors and supervisors do not have cases. There is no valid rea-son for any auditor or supervisor not doing TRs. (Including Public Course Supervi-sors, Interne Supervisors, Cramming Officers and C/Ses.) 2. If your org does not have the LRH Model Tapes order them immediately from Pubs Org DK. Don't wait for them before proceeding with target done above. Any org re-quire a minimum of three sets. One for the TRs Course, one for the Academy, one for Qual. FP may not be used as an excuse for an org having no copies of these tapes. 3. Add the LRH Model Auditing Tapes to the master checksheet of the TRs Course, and each course checksheet which includes TRs (which is every major checksheet whether tech or admin – only a few mini checksheets omit TRs). One tape goes on each check-sheet, rotated through the levels, a different tape on each level, all five tapes on the SHSBC. 4. Add the tapes in accordance with the master checksheets, to each checksheet before issue to a student newly starting on any course. 5. Get in a program to get all staff through a full and proper TRs Course (including Up-per Indoc TRs). Staff, other than auditors and supervisors, to do this at the first appro-priate rest pointing their auditing program and is part of basic training for all new re-cruits. 6. Report to ethics anyone who gives interpretations of TRs, infers that LRH Model Au-diting Tapes are \"old\" or \"not the way we do it now\" or stops this program in any way. Ethics to convene a Committee of Evidence on any such persons. The charge is sup-pression of tech. If ethics fails to handle report the matter to Flag. 7.

In correcting TRs, concentrate on one TR (or weak point) at a time. For example: TR 2 is weak. a. Look for and handle any misunderstood words on the TRs HCOB or other mate-rials already studied on TR 2. b. If necessary, find additional HCOBs and use the TR Booklet from Flag to supply any missing data on TR 2. c. Listen to an LRH Demo Tape concentrating on his TR 2. d. Then drill TR 2.

It is easier to get those in and then re-tape and pick up any other points persisting than try to get them all in at once. 7. Sometimes a person will not be able to hear his own TR outnesses. In such cases the Supervisor should have the person's tape set up beside an LRH demo tape. Tell the person what point to listen for. Play a little of the LRH tape listening for that one thing. Then play a little of the person's tape and have him listen for the same point. Do this back and forth on that one point until the person can hear it fully himself. 8.

MORE CONFRONTING L. Ron Hubbard That which a person can confront, he can handle. The first step of handling anything is gaining an ability to face it. It could be said that war continues as a threat to Man because Man cannot confront war. The idea of making war so terrible that no one will be able to fight it is the exact reverse of fact – if one wishes to end war. The invention of the longbow, gunpowder, heavy naval cannon, machine guns, liquid fire, and the hydrogen bomb add only more and more certainty that war will continue. As each new element which Man cannot confront is added to elements he has not been able to confront so far, Man engages himself upon a decreasing ability to handle war. We are looking here at the basic anatomy of all problems. Problems start with an in-ability to confront anything. Whether we apply this to domestic quarrels or to insects, to gar-bage dumps or Picasso, one can always trace the beginning of any existing problem to an un-willingness to confront. Let us take a domestic scene. The husband or the wife cannot confront the other, can-not confront second dynamic consequences, cannot confront the economic burdens, and so we have domestic strife. The less any of these actually are confronted the more problem they will become. It is a truism that one never solves anything by running away from it. Of course, one might also say that one never solves cannonballs by baring his breast to them. But I assure you that if nobody cared whether cannonballs were fired or not, control of people by threat of cannonballs would cease. Down on skid row where flotsam and jetsam exist to keep the police busy, we could not find one man whose basic difficulties, whose downfall could not be traced at once to an inability to confront. A criminal once came to me whose entire right side was paralyzed. Yet, this man made his living by walking up to people in alleys, striking them and robbing them. Why he struck people he could not connect with his paralyzed side and arm. From his infancy"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"MORE CONFRONTING 2 ABILITY 54, SEPTEMBER 57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 699 HPCS he had been educated not to confront men. The nearest he could come to confronting men was to strike them, and so his criminal career. The more the horribleness of crime is deified by television and public press, the less the society will be able to handle crime. The more formidable is made the juvenile delinquent, the less the society will be able to handle the juvenile delinquent. In education, the more esoteric and difficult a subject is made, the less the student will be able to handle the subject. When a subject is made too formidable by an instructor, the more the student retreats from it. There were, for instance, some early European mental stud-ies which were so complicated and so incomprehensible and which were sown with such lack of understanding of Man that no student could possibly confront them. In Scientology when we have a student who has been educated basically in the idea that the mind is so formidable and so complicated that none could confront it, or perhaps so bestial and degraded that no one would want to, we have a student who cannot learn Scientology. He has confused Scientology with his earlier training, and his difficulty is that he cannot be made to confront the subject of the mind. Man at large today is in this state with regard to the human spirit. For centuries Man was educated to believe in demons, ghouls, and things that went boomp in the night. There was an organization in southern Europe which capitalized upon this terror and made demons and devils so formidable that at length Man could not even face the fact that any of his fel-lows had souls. And thus we entered an entirely materialistic age. With the background teach-ing that no one can confront the \"invisible,\" vengeful religions sought to move forward into a foremost place of control. Naturally, it failed to achieve its goal and irreligion became the order of the day, thus opening the door for Communism and other idiocies. Although it might seem true that one cannot confront the invisible, who said that a spirit was always invisible? Rather let us say that it is impossible for Man or anything else to confront the nonexistent and thus when nonexistent gods are invented and are given more roles in the society, we discover Man becomes so degraded that he cannot even confront the spirit in his fellows, much less become moral. Confronting as a subject in itself is intensely interesting. Indeed, there is some evi-dence that mental image pictures occur only when the individual is unable to confront the circumstances of the picture. When this compounds and Man is unable to confront anything anywhere, he might be considered to have pictures of everything everywhere. This is proven by a rather interesting test made in 1947 by myself when it was discovered that if an individ-ual could be made to \"run a lock\" of something he had just seen, run another lock on some-thing he had just heard, and run an additional lock on something he had just felt, he would at length be able to handle much more serious pictures in his mind. I discovered, although I did not entirely interpret it at the time, that an individual has no further pictures when he can con-front all pictures; thus being able to confront everything he has done, he is no longer troubled with the things he has done. Supporting this, it will be discovered that individuals who pro-gress in an ability to handle pictures eventually have no pictures at all. This we call a Clear. A Clear in an absolute sense would be someone who could confront anything and eve-rything in the past, present and future."},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"MORE CONFRONTING 3 ABILITY 54, SEPTEMBER 57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 700 HPCS Unfortunately for the world of action, it will be discovered that one who can confront everything does not have to handle anything. In support of this is offered that Scientology process, Problems of Comparable Magnitude. In this particular process the individual being processed is asked to select a terminal with which he has had difficulty. In that the definition of a terminal is a \"live mass\" or something that is capable of causing, receiving or relaying communication, it will be seen that terminals are quite ordinarily people in the problem cate-gory of anyone's bank. The person is then asked to invent a problem of comparable magnitude to that person. He is asked to do this many, many times. It will be found midway in the proc-ess that he is willing to do something now about the problems he is having with that person. But at the end of the process a new and strange thing is found to occur. The individual no longer feels that he must do something about the problem. Indeed, he can simply confront or regard or view the problem with complete equanimity. Now an almost mystic quality enters this when it is discovered that the problem in the physical universe about which he has been worried often ceases to exist out there. In other words, the handling of a problem seems to be simply the increase of ability to confront the problem and when the problem can be totally confronted it no longer exists. This is strange and miraculous. It is hard to believe that an individual who has a drunken husband could cure that in-dividual of drink simply by processing out the problem of having a drunken husband, and yet this has occurred. I am not saying here that all the problems of the world could be vanquished simply by running Problems of Comparable Magnitude on a few people, but neither am I say-ing that all the problems of the world could not be handled by Problems of Comparable Mag-nitude on a few people, and indeed I am at this time undertaking an experiment in this direc-tion on the subject of the atomic bomb. It is an oddity that the longer this experiment is con-tinued, the less responsive these bombs are to test firing. Perhaps it could be said, however, that if there existed one person in the entire uni-verse who could confront all of the universe, the problems of the universe for all would dein-tensify enormously. Man's difficulties are a compound of his cowardices. To have difficulties in life, all it is necessary to do is to start running away from the business of livingness. After that, prob-lems of unsolvable magnitude are assured. When individuals are restrained from confronting life they accrue a vast ability to have difficulties with it. There are many other things about confronting which are intensely interesting but these we will take up in a later issue. An earlier issue of Ability carried in it a full resume of Training 0, the name of which is Confronting. This drill, done for a great many hours, will be found intensely efficacious in the handling of life. A wife and a husband whose way has not been too smooth would find it extremely interesting in terms of resolution of domestic difficulties to co-audit with this train-ing drill alone, each one running it upon the other for at least 25 hours. This would have to be done, of course, on a turnabout basis of not more than 2 hours on one and then a switch from \"coach\" to \"auditor.\" To run Confronting in this fashion and with considerable gain, it would be necessary to have some understanding of what a \"coach\" is and, in one of these co-auditing teams, what"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"MORE CONFRONTING 4 ABILITY 54, SEPTEMBER 57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 701 HPCS an \"auditor\" is.

Every time the auditor falls from grace, does not hold his position, slumps, goes anaten (un-conscious), twitches, starts his eyes wandering, or in any way demonstrates an incorrect posi-tion, the coach says \"Flunk\" and corrects the difficulty. He then says \"Start\" again and the session goes on. When the person in the role of \"auditor\" has been extremely successful over a period of time the coach can say \"Win\" and then again \"Start.\" When the coach wishes to make some comments or give some advice the coach says \"That's it,\" straightens up this point and then again says \"Start.\" In the coaching itself only these terms are employed: \"Start,\" \"Flunk,\" \"Win,\" \"That's it.\" Anything else the coach does or says is disregarded by the \"auditor\" unless the coach has said \"That's it\" and has then advised on a point and then has started again. The coach would be at liberty to do anything he wished, short of physical violence, to make the auditor nervous or upset him. The coach could say anything he wished between a \"start\" and another com-mand as above, and the auditor would flunk if he paid any attention or did otherwise than simply confronted. Ordinarily all the coach does is make sure that the auditor goes on confronting. How-ever, it should be understood that the drill can be toughened up considerably. The coach can do anything to throw the auditor off the simple business of confronting. If the auditor so much as twitches a smile, looks embarrassed, clears his throat or in any other way falls off from plain and ordinary confronting, it is, of course, always a \"flunk.\" It should be understood that drill sessions are not auditing sessions. In a drill session the entire session is in the hands of the coach, who is only in a vague way the \"preclear\" of the session. In an auditing session the entire session is in the hands of the auditor. There is a basic rule here. Anything which the \"auditor\" or \"student,\" as he is called in the drills, is holding tense, is the thing with which he is confronting. If the \"auditor's\" eyes begin to smart, he is confronting with them. If his stomach begins to protrude and becomes tense he is confronting with his stomach. If his shoulders or even the back of his head become tense, then he is confronting with the shoulders or the back of his head. A coach who becomes very expert in this can spot these things at once and would in this case give a \"That's it,\" straighten the auditor out on it and would then start the session anew. It is interesting that the drill does not consist of confronting with something. The drill consists only of confronting; therefore, confronting with is a \"flunk.\" Various nervous traits can be traced at once to trying to confront with something which insists on running away. A nervous hand, for instance, would be a hand with which the individual is trying to confront something. The forward motion of the nervousness would be"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"MORE CONFRONTING 5 ABILITY 54, SEPTEMBER 57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 702 HPCS the effort to make it confront, the backward motion of it would be its refusal to confront. Of course, the basic error is confronting with the hand. The world is never bright to those who cannot confront it. Everything is a dull gray to a defeated army. The whole trick of somebody telling you \"It's all bad over there,\" is con-tained in the fact that he is trying to keep you from confronting something and thus make you retreat from life. Eyeglasses, nervous twitches, tensions, all of these things stem from an un-willingness to confront. When that willingness is repaired, these disabilities tend to disappear. Of course, tumultuously married couples may encounter some knock-down and drag-out moments in doing this confronting drill. However, it should be kept in mind that it is the coach in these training drills who is bound by the Instructor's Code and that the only harm that can result would come about if the \"auditor\" were permitted to \"blow\" (leave) the session without the coach, even with manhandling, getting the auditor back into the drill. It will be found that these \"blows\" occur most frequently when the person being coached, in other words the \"auditor,\" is being given too few wins and is being discouraged by the coach. Of course, things he does wrong should be flunked, but it will be found that the way is paved to success with wins; therefore, when he does it well for a period of time, the \"auditor\" should be told so. Go into this drill expecting explosions and upsets and simply refuse to give up if they occur and you will have it whipped in short order. Go into it expecting that all will be sweetness and light and everyone should be a little gentleman and a little lady and disaster will loom. Neither I nor the management are responsible for cuts, contusions, violent words, or divorces resulting from attempts to run confrontingness drills by husbands and wives on each other.

Ron Hubbard This article is a transcription of an important preliminary discussion by Ron of his in-vestigations out of which have come very practical advances in the handling of communica-tion and the discovery of the preclear's level of reality in processing. The talk was given at a Staff Auditor-ACC Conference of April 4, 1955. ... I'll give you a quick rundown on some data which has just materialized here – it's an experimental scale and this experimental scale is quite interesting. It really is a Scale of Awareness. A scale of awareness would begin at the top with, of course, aware of being aware. If a person were really aware of being aware it would be sufficient communication for him merely to be aware of the existing environment. If he were simply aware of the existing environment he would feel he was in communication and would feel very good – he wouldn't have to talk about it. You get that level? All right now, we drop down from there and it's easier to describe from the bottom up. On the bottom is communication with self with significance. Worry. He can communicate with himself and he can worry. Now that isn't the exact bottom of the scale, but the next lower level – and that's unconsciousness – becomes questionable as a communication level. But nevertheless, it really belongs with this scale. So we look at this and we find out that the guy could be aware of thinking a thought containing much significance, but not expressing it. Im-mediately below this level, as I say, is unconsciousness, which, of course, goes off the aware-ness scale and is the reverse of awareness. But, as we work up from absolute unconsciousness we find unconsciousness is the only thing which each higher step has in common with the last step until we get to total awareness of awareness. So each one of these steps is to some degree salted with uncon-sciousness, and up to the moment when you would get to absolute, complete unconscious-ness, every one of these steps would have some unconsciousness in it. But, absolute, complete unconsciousness happens to be an absolute. It happens to be unobtainable. Complete uncon-"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"SCALE OF AWARENESS 2 ABILITY MINOR 4 – MAY 1955 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 705 HPCS sciousness is not obtainable. Nobody has ever been or ever will be completely unconscious. And this is a fact, because processes do work out on unconsciousness, so the bottom of the scale would be absolute, complete unconsciousness, but it's not the bottom of the scale, be-cause that can't exist. So we would go up there to lesser and lesser degrees of unconsciousness and greater and greater degrees of consciousness. Now one of the best descriptions around that I have written on this unconsciousness business is Self Analysis. The first few chapters on Self Analysis is a discussion of unconsciousness. And when we consider alertness, we are consid-ering ability. Now, we've been talking about this for some time. We consider alertness, then we consider ability. Awareness. If a person is aware of something he normally can control it. All right, we look this over, and we find out that the place for a person to be on the tone scale would be at awareness of awareness and we find out that he, there, would have sufficient communication just with his environment to stay cleared. Get that? He could stay cleared. But, now let's start out from this level of complete unconsciousness – let's go into the first point on the scale which is actually there on the scale. Some small, no matter how small, awareness that he is thinking a thought and communicating with the thought he is thinking. And that level includes the deepest anaesthetic possible, and it includes death. He always has some tiny little spark of awareness there, in spite of the ambition of the medico, the anaesthe-tist, etc. He is aware that he is thinking something, no matter whether he thinks that it's some-body else's thinking or not. He's just aware of some thinking. The next broad level here is communication with significance. (Of course, in be-tween, thinking a thought and thinking it to himself we get gradients of that, so the individual knows when he is thinking a thought, and knows when he's not thinking a thought. Naturally that's part of that same scale.) The next broad level is this: communication with significance with somebody else. You know what we mean, \"with significance,\" it's got to have a reason, it's got to have mean-ing, there has to be an intent. The next big broad scale that's parked right up above this is simply communication, with intent to communicate. The next broad level up above this simply requires that one knows of the existence of communication. And the next level above that is simply awareness of an environment as sufficient communication. Now, as we go down from that to the bottom we find out we are more and more fixed and less and less capable of spanning attention. So let's look at communication between two people as a fixed double-terminal affair. The individual is less aware of his immediate envi-ronment. At Communication with Self he's not aware of his environment out here at all. And so we get the contracting perimeter of the dynamics, which we've discussed before. As we go down this Awareness Scale, which is also Communication Scale, we get the individual closer and closer in until – one of the early symptoms of it – he doesn't think anybody could possibly hear him unless he's standing with his face right in their face. And the next spot below that is"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"SCALE OF AWARENESS 3 ABILITY MINOR 4 – MAY 1955 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 706 HPCS real worry. Now this individual may be across the room. It doesn't matter. Now let's add to this, and we get the actual name of this scale. And it is the Scale of Reality. That is the name of the scale. Now this seems strange, if it has to do with awareness and communication, that we call it the Scale of Reality, because it is the scale, a practical scale which is useful in proc-essing. Now, how is it useful in processing? We're looking at a preclear that can't find any-thing real very easily. We suspect he doesn't even know he can't find anything real. You know, it's just the way the case behaves – it's kind of spooky. Well, this guy, the realest thing he could do would be to think a thought and know that he thought the thought. That's the real-est thing the guy could do. Now, if you were to graduate him upscale from this, the next thing he could do that would be real to him would be to get the idea of saying something to some-body that has lots of significance to it, and having that person say something to him. Mythical personnel. And that's their reality. With significance. Now we go up above this, and we find out that the individual could have something real just by \"hello\" and \"O.K.\" And one of the reasons we're using hello and O.K. is that it is an unreal communication. If a preclear can handle hello and O.K. without balking and con-sider it a real communication, this preclear is at that band. If he insists that that's a bad reply – you know, he \"really wouldn't say hello\" and then somebody else \"wouldn't say O.K.\" – he would go at it possibly on hello's back and forth, but he would go on it much better with sig-nificances. \"What could you say to Pop?\" \"What could you say to your Mother?\" And he'd give you significances. \"Now, what could your Mother say to you?\" The funny thing about this is the way this scale was traced out. It's very interesting. It was traced out by watching the separation of universes, and when these universes come apart they first come apart as a worry, worry – then, \"Think a thought\" – \"Think a thought the other fellow would think\" – \"Think a thought that you would think\" – \"Think a thought that the other fellow would think,\" and all of a sudden the individual differentiates between the kind of things the other universe thinks and the kind of things that his universe thinks. So we get this differentiation. Our next differentiation up the line would be something you could say to that other universe and something it could say to you. And significance, significance, significance, and then I discovered that we had a point in the separation of each one of these universes when hello, hello, hello, with the answer hello was real. Perfectly real and acceptable. The preclear was not even vaguely uncomfortable about it. And then hello and O.K. – a perfectly real communication. And then, the fact that the person existed was itself communication, and then the fact that the universe existed and the rest of the environment existed, too, was a sufficient cognition without any further processing. When you start to pull universes apart on the individual, these universes have a ten-dency to go through that span, and the universes we don't see are the universes which are to-tally introverted. An individual is actually being his body, you see. He is in his body. He is actually, really being his body, and then his body is being his father's universe. We could start in by thinking that the most basic universe to separate would be father and mother from him, but this isn't the case at all. It would really be the thetan. So you could separate these other"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"SCALE OF AWARENESS 4 ABILITY MINOR 4 – MAY 1955 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 707 HPCS universes, but don't forget that we have an artificial enclosure of universe with the thetan in the body and here we're immediately talking about exteriorization, aren't we? So you could be almost any one of these universes. You'd find you'd go up on this gradient of reality. At first you could have the preclear think a thought and think a thought and think a thought, you of course making him express a thought, you're making him commu-nicate with you, but he doesn't notice that. And think another thought, think another thought. Now, what kind of a thought could this other universe think? Another thought the other uni-verse could think, another thought. When these become at last flat and squared away you've got these universes well on the way towards separation and then you can go into communica-tion and separate them. Now, this is not a hard and fast rule because I have to do considerable more experimentation on it. I'm just letting you in on a particular echelon of the spirit. This might not hold true, we might be able to separate them all, all the way up the line, by simply thought, thought, \"Think a thought,\" \"What kind of a thought would the other person think?\" \"What kind of a thought would you think?\" The way I've been doing it with great success has been just: ask the individual what he could then SAY to his father. Now, he has just discovered he can separate out his father's pat-tern of thinking from his own pattern of thinking. Now, it's time to communicate. Now we've got a distance, so we get \"What could you say to your father?\" Well, have him say, \"Okay.\" \"That's fine. Now, what else could you say to your father?\" etc., and then you get this very flat. In its turn Thinking A Thought itself became flat, Thinking His Father's Thoughts became flat, and then we got Communication With Significance flat and then we got both ways flat on that, and then we got to this point where it is enough for him to say \"hello\" or have his father say hello. And he says hello and his father says hello; he says hello and his father says hello, and then you could – you don't have to – move him out of that bracket and have him say hello and his father say O.K. And this is still real, good communication and then he becomes aware of where his father is and at that moment you run into Spotting Spots. Got this? Up to this time all spots are misplaced with connection with this person. But, right about that time the spots start to go into their proper places. The same phenomenon occurs somewhere in that band of \"Hello and O.K. with Pop\" if it's sneaked up on in this fashion as occurred in running 8-D in a limited number of cases, and all of a sudden his universe starts to un-spin and he's aware of this and aware of that and aware of where his father has been and aware of where he has been in regard to his father, and he starts to get directionally accurate. directionally and distantly accurate. And up to that time it's just enough to be aware, as far as his father's concerned just be aware of existence of father and not aware. That's enough, that's a cleared sphere. Now, do you see where we sneak up on something like this? Well, that's an interesting scale. It's a scale of reality. I've been working for some time trying to get some way to sneak up on reality. Now, how does this fit in with the real universe and objects? Well, there's a little kicker in here. Along about the time of \"What could you say to your father?\" and \"What could"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"SCALE OF AWARENESS 5 ABILITY MINOR 4 – MAY 1955 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 708 HPCS your father say to you?\" and \"What could you say to your mother?\" \"What could your mother say to you?\" – in other words, separating part of these universes – we know that sooner or later we would take up \"What could you say to a body?\" \"What could a body say to you?\" We know we will run into that one, but that's not so real sometimes. We've got to get him out of some other universes before we get him out of the body's universe. Right about the point where we would pass from that into communication by hello-hello, the individual on an 8-C level can spot unrealities. Isn't that good. He can spot unreal-ity. Your pc today, Crystal, was just about ready to take a look at the environment. But, he could spot unrealities much faster than he could spot realities. Now, you know what I mean by unreality. Supposing you ran 8-C on unrealities. It's along about that point you could take up something like this if you wanted to. You'd run 8C – \"Spot something unreal in this room,\" \"Spot something else unreal in this room.\" Then the individual would spot a lot of things, the wall behind him might be unreal, or something like that, you see, and he'll get out to a point where he'll recognize that his sight line to the horizon is real, but beyond that it's unreal, and he gets the idea of sort of living on a saucer. It's a little saucer which goes exactly out to the horizon and no further, and everything beyond that is unreal. Ask him to spot some unrealities in his environment until it's real to him. It sneaks up on the preclear after a while because he finds out things are getting less and less unreal. It's as-ising unreality. When we're graduating a pc up the line it is very easy for the auditor to monitor the pc so that the pc can apparently run the most impossible, complex, the most advanced processes you ever heard of and just stall right there. The pc goes right on running them, \"It's all unreal and it doesn't matter anyway,\" and he just goes on through it and the auditor kind of monitors the preclear in every step and sneeze if we just keep on going. Well, there is where we some-times come a cropper in auditing. We audit somebody in a rather advanced process and it's unreal. Now, we've just had an experience of this happening. The guy apparently was just going bangity, bangity, bang, and yet it wasn't real. Well, it won't do them any good unless it's real. This is the way to sneak up, then, on a preclear and make sure it's real all the way. ◊"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 710 HPCS SCALE OF CONFRONT Excerpt of HCOB 16 Feb 1959 Now the undercuts of cases became a vital necessity. This whole ACC was devoted to the R factor plus Engram Running. It was discovered that the thing that keeps individuals from running engrams adequately was their R factor, and when their R factor was very poor they could not run an engram adequately. Now the funny part of it is that an engram can be contacted and run and, if done persistently and well without ARC breaks, can run the follow-ing Scale of Confront. Here is the Scale of Confront, just to refresh your minds: Dub-In: Lowest scale. This scale could possibly invert, and down below that you might have a black dub-in. Once you had run blackness, you would find a dub-in case. But the scale we are mostly interested in, because that is the one we most commonly see, begins at the bottom with dub-in, runs up, turns Black. Runs through blackness, turns Invisible. Runs from invisible to Elsewhere – a desire to be elsewhere. The way they solve things is elsewhereness. Runs up from elsewhereness to Ability to Confront. Runs from confront to Experience or Participate. And only then are you up to Beingness. Now this is the Confront Scale, and it is the scale of disintegrating Reality. It is how a person handles terminals or a situation. A person handles terminals and situations above all this by not having to participate, by not having to confront, finding no necessity to do any-thing about it unless he chooses so on his own determination; and if he did so, could do so with no personal liability. He could experience or not as the case may be. Now you'll find a lower harmonic on this in some philosophic level of somebody saying, \"Yap, yap, well, I could, or I couldn't, and that's my choice,\" etc, well, he hasn't got any power of choice. He's just using this as the final escape mechanism – a philosophic escape mechanism. If I said \"bottom\" – the bottom mechanism – it would be the one most commonly con-tacted. But you are apt to get a mechanism which is philosophic, which is simply a figure-figure mechanism about a situation, and the individual feels that if he could just figure it out he would be all right. In other words, this is a thought-thinkingness figure-figure, and he not-ises by figure-figure. Such a case, not-ising by figure-figure, will turn into a dub-in case as soon as you start curing his figure-figure; would turn into a black case; would turn into an invisible case; would turn into a confront case; would turn into an experience case. Which is quite interesting. Now it is true that an engram could be found, started, and, if the auditor were good and held the individual right on the time period and had the time period well spotted, and had the overt and motivator, no matter how crazy they seemed or sounded, contacted, he could"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"SCALE OF CONFRONT 2 EXCERPT OF HCOB 16.02.59 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 711 HPCS theoretically, just by running that engram, run a person through the totality of this Reality Scale. See? So there's another approach here. You get a guy who is figure-figure, find the engram necessary to resolve the case. First he figure-figures about it, and he'll run it, and run it just with the auditing commands – the five auditing commands to run an engram – he fig-ure-figures about it, then after a while he dubs-in about it, then after a while it all goes black; and then after a while it eases into an invisibility – it's just not there – somatics are, and dis-comfort and other things are, but it's not there – and its not-thereness suddenly turns into little flicks – little flicks of confront. And boy, he goes elsewhere. It just starts to turn on and he gets it for the least little Flick and he goes elsewhere. And then pretty soon he can confront the thing; then pretty soon he can participate – he can run it in valence, squarely in valence, right in its moment of time, at which time it becomes pretty damn real. And then he goes to being able to put it there or not put it there, and its importance-unimportance factor flattens out so that it's neither important nor unimportant. And that engram is licked. Theoretically, this could happen. That is actually the way I run engrams. But you will find in auditing in the HGC that the public expects of you a different thing than is expected of you by students. And that's why I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes. They expect a dif-ferent thing. They expect you to be interested in their case. And that is quite amusing – be-cause it's your job to get them interested in their case. But they want you to be interested in their case. All right, any case is interesting, so that's a pretty easy one. But you can get so in-terested in their case that you do a lot of talking to them and burn up an awful lot of auditing time. So there is some point where your interest becomes an indulgence, and on the happier side of that, where the pc is pleased you're interested in his case, and that's enough.

I think this is the 30th of June and 61, Briefing Course Saint Hill. The first item that we should discuss today is the fact that I'm going to give you lec-tures after this on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday because you look so exhausted, you know. You look so exhausted come Friday that it's actually very – hard talking to you, you know. The CCHs are what are getting to you, I think, and – not so much receiving them, but doing them on people. The Security Checks, they're probably the most exhausting. They ex-haust all sorts of charge on cases. Anyhow, all joking aside, I'll be lecturing on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursday afternoons. Oh, yes, I have a news item. I have ceased to own two boats in the last twenty-four hours. Not having gotten my hands on them very solidly, and apparently have gotten hold of the – a Fairmile B., an old antisubmarine warfare vessel, 116 feet. They're good, solid weather boats – they were in their day. But the luck of the Irish, it's very interesting. I mean, it's the middle of the year, you see, it's way off season, and the most fantastic buys are just going begging, you see. So I couldn't resist one. We need one anyhow for this expedition. That's what I've been trying to find. So I finally connected with this boat, and you'll be hearing more about it. Matter of fact, it has enough staterooms on it to set up an HGC. [laughter] Yeah. But don't worry. Of course, if you got audited under those circumstances, about the middle of the session you'd hear a howl coming through the loudspeaker system, you know, \"Now hear this!\" – I wouldn't be able to keep out of that valence, you see. Well, anyway, I think you're making pretty good progress; by and large, making pretty good progress. I notice one or two of you are changing your minds about things anyway. Life should be looking a little easier, and if you're doing your Security Checks in this mood that I've been telling you about – of course, it's the technical precision, but there's a mood goes along with it. And that's practically the first time I've ever introduced, to amount to anything, for many years the subject of mood in auditing. And you can classify it now precisely as a technical asset. The medicos never did that. They just said a doctor had a bedside manner or he didn't have a bedside manner, and he would be a good doctor or he wouldn't be a good doctor, and that was the end of the descrip-tion, see. But you can say that an auditor who does not encourage the pc to overwhump his reactive bank and remember things and so forth has a poor auditing manner. But what is it? It's just encourage the pc to overcome his aberrations and surmount them and get the show on the road, you see. I'm not talking about, now you tell him to invali-datively or something of that sort, but you audit him encouragingly.

Now you enter those three elements into the session, and it becomes comprehensible what we're talking about. And as soon as you enter those in, you'll find the pc runs faster, considerably – completely aside from anything else. All right. Well, you now probably have a much deeper insight into the TRs. Do you have any insight into the TRs? [Audience: Oh, yes!] You think you can do these? I'll give you a note here in passing. Time after time you're going to find somebody in organizations or something trying to teach the TRs this way: Go on to TR 0 and stick. And now it's – eight months from now, we'll still be doing TR 0. You got that? You're going to find that consistently because the element of endure enters into it, see? Now, that is improper. Here is the way you do the TRs, and that's probably – you'll find very valuable. You do TR 0, flunking only TR 0. You do TR 1. The guy didn't pass TR 0, see. He just got accustomed to it a little bit. TR 1: You do TR 1 flunking only TR 1. Don't flunk anything else. TR 2: Flunk only TR 2. TR 3: Flunk only TR 3. TR 4: Flunk only TR 4. You got the idea? Now come back to TR 0. Get the guy better at TR 0, and go on through it again, flunk-ing only the TR they are on. You got it? It's kind of like running the CCHs. You get a better idea of it, you know. They get a little bit of a win at it, and you go on to the next one. You got the idea? Now you go back, and maybe the third, maybe the fifth run through, according to your judgment, you start TR 0 and you insist that it's pretty good. And there's another element I've just missed. About the third run through you should really start cuffing them around. Flunk only the one they're on, but start cuffing them around hard, see. Give them the business. Give them things they can't possibly confront, you know. Try to shake them up. Let them coast in on it easy. I better review that so that you don't get a double confusion.

Flunk everything in that battery of TRs. You got it? If you do that, you shorten the time it takes to learn the TRs considerably. You see how this is? In other words, you approach this with a gradient scale. We did learn about gradient scales many years ago. Now we should continue to apply that knowledge. Let the guy get used to it, and you'll find out they progress much faster if you do it that way. Now, learning Model Session. Model Session actually can be learned concurrently with learning the TRs, but for a while just let them learn Model Session. When you've got somebody that's got all of his TRs pretty good, make them do Model Session, which they've already learned and they can rattle it off and all that sort of thing They've got it letter perfect, you understand. Now there's another Model Session. And that's Model Session with all the TRs in. They can do Model Session, you see. Is it all right if I don't bat this pc's ears off or something of that sort? They can run this off, see, rapidly. And then when they've got their TRs flat, your next gradient step on TRs is Model Session. You run the TRs with Model Session. And you let them go through it with Model Session, sitting back, not giving them a bad time but just letting them go through it but flunk-ing all the TRs, 0 to 4. Just flunk those TRs. Let them go through the Model Session. You see, they already learned the Model Session, probably while they were doing their TRs. And now you put them over the jumps, flunking each TR from 0 to 4 inclusive that they flop on. Give them the business, you see. Just flunk them on these things as you're doing the Model Session. Now step it up. And give them a lot of trouble as they're doing the Model Sessions, and flunk all TRs. You got the idea? Long since, you should have finished flunking Model Session flubs. They should be – before you begin any of this, you see, they should be in a position where they can go over the Model Session without laying eggs or flubbing, you see. So now when you're giving them the business up along the line – you see, you just flunked TRs while they were doing the Model Session. All right. Increase the tempo. That is to say, give them a bad time while they're trying to do the Model Session and flunk all the TRs that they flub, see. Because – but now they're going to start flunking on the Model Ses-sion too, because it'll rattle them. Got the idea?"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 4 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 715 HPCS So you flunk the rattles and you flunk the TRs, and you flunk the lot, and eventually you get a guy up to a point, no matter what button you push, no matter what you do to him, his TRs don't go out and he can continue to do the Model Session. And boy, he's got it made. It gives an auditing presence that is utterly awesome. But the steps I've just given you here are probably the steps which you should use in teaching staff auditors and people around, field auditors and so forth, to do it. And if you fol-low those steps and insist they work at it, why, you'll get there, but if you insist that they sit and grind on nothing but \"Model Session\" (quote), you see, or you sit – they sit and grind on nothing but TR 0, or you know, you just stop the whole thing. Actually, you in effect stop their learning. They sit on to an endure. It's just like you wouldn't run a CCH after it was flat, see. It's what you're doing. See, you run TR 0 and the guy has gotten a couple of jolts out of it, and he's uuunh, and he's this way, and he's that way. And then all of a sudden, why, he can do it kind of, you know. Well, that's it. That's it, you know. Knock it off then, and go on to TR 1. Got the idea? So you're running on a gradient scale of wins and you don't keep giving him loses all the time, and he'll eventually get up to where he has a professional presence which is awe-some to regard, you know. The room blows up, and he says, \"I'll repeat the auditing ques-tion\", you know. And anything happens, why, he's competent to take care of it. He doesn't get thrown out of session himself, then, just because some extraordinary emergency occurs, you see. He's not so nervous about the way he's running a session that he can't handle a session, you see? Hm? There are no TRs for the – as such, tailor-made so that the person will just sit there and give the auditing command in the CCHs. But remember that the balance of the TRs which are taught in Upper Indoc are there to back up the CCHs. And you can do those much the same way by gradient scale. Got it? Of course, it really gets something. You get probably far too complicated when you start doing Upper Indoc TRs, you see, and flunking the lower TRs. That sounds a little bit complicated. You know what I mean, you know? A guy is wrestling around madly with you and so forth, and you all of a sudden flunk him on TR 0. As a matter of fact, it'd be a good gag to pull on somebody, you know. But it shouldn't have any part of the training program. All right. That should – that should get you over the hump in teaching large numbers of people to do the TRs. If you follow that type of gradient, why, you'll find that you'll be very successful with it. Okay? All right. Now, what burning question do we have today? ... You mean nobody in this – all right, Reg. Male voice: Routine 1, CCHs – what is the guiding factor when you come off Routine 1?

That's your main criteria. The time to take them off, and the only time you can take them off, is when you have gone over CCH 1, 2, 3, 4, and they are, all of them, temporarily flat. You could take the pc off at that time. You could. But the best time to take them off is when they're going through them, not at the beginning of the run when they're not getting any reaction and before you get into the reaction stage of the case. You know, twenty minutes, no change. Twenty minutes, no change. Twenty minutes, no change. Twenty minutes, no change. \"Well, we've done the CCHs.\" Like hell we have. You've got to go over them a few times and run through that gamut a few times and all of a sudden gog! you know, and whew! and zoog! and so forth. Now, when you've got that out of the road, you'll find out that the CCHs have bitten. That's the criteria, you know. Have the CCHs bitten on this pc at all? All right. If they've bitten, then you'd run it up to a point where you are actually back to – this is the theoretical perfect end of the CCHs – where they were all running routinely twenty minutes apiece, without any change. And of course, it would be a break of the Audi-tor's Code to run them any longer. After you've gone through them maybe three times with no marked changes, man, the CCHs are flat – with the proviso that they have actually bitten, while being run. Okay? Does that answer the question? Male voice: Yes, it does. Good. Security Check, by the way, has nothing to do with it. It is not an influencing factor because it's carried on over into Routine 2 and Routine 3. Just the CCHs influence it. Okay. Any other questions? Yes, Ken? Male voice: A run-through of Routine 2. I'd like a run-through of 2 – Routine 2. You'd like a run through of it? Male voice: Yeah. In what respect, beyond what's in the bulletin? Male voice: The scale itself, primary. The what? Male voice: The Primary Scale. Yeah. Male voice: How is that exactly run? I've heard two ways: run generally through it, just naming off the various different items, levels. And using the terminal.

Male voice: we don't have any terminal."},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 6 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 717 HPCS That's right. How could you name a terminal? I see where his confusion is. Male voice: Ah, okay. He's got Routine 2 and Routine 3, and where he has come across the crossroads here is that he's heard that in Routine 2, you can run Prehav 13* which, of course, gives you a list of terminals over in the chronic PTP of the pc. Male voice: Ah. So, you see, that could slop over into Routine 2. Male voice: Okay. All right. So therefore, you would have a terminal in Routine 2. There's where that is, but you wouldn't name a terminal unless you were doing Prehav 13 or the fellow has always had trouble with his leg and he just has an awful time with his leg – You can, by the way, take anything like this. You do an assessment. Actually, Routine 2 general runs encroach on goals, but you shouldn't get them confused. They're distinctly different because you're only giving Routine 2 terminals a lick and a promise. You're not doing anything with them to amount to anything. Nothing serious. So what do you get here? You say to this – you never run a terminal without doing a Terminal Assessment. Always a Terminal Assessment. This individual just keeps telling you, \"Well, the reason I want to be audited is because I have this ringing sound all the time in my ears\", see. He keeps telling you this, and this is his hidden standard and a bunch of other things, you know. And so you say, well, let's do something about this ringing sound in his ears. It's even coming up as a present time problem. It's getting in our road, something fierce. The corollary is, every time you come into session, they have a big problem, present time problem with the husband. And it takes forty-five minutes of the session to clean this up, ses-sion after session. Well, you say, \"to hell with this\", because \"What part of that husband have you been responsible for?\" is not about to clean up everything there is to clean up about hus-bands. You got the idea? Similarly, by the way, the confusion area here is that sometimes a pc on a Goals As-sessment assesses out to his present time problem, but you're still running SOP Goals, you see. I'm talking about this other thing. This pc just keeps having this present time problem, present time problem, and it keeps getting in your hair. Or the pc has a hidden standard. Just these two conditions. The pc has a hidden standard, hidden standard, hidden standard. What auditing result do you expect? You know, he keeps crabbing, \"No results, no results.\" What's he mean? Let's clarify it. And he says, \"Well, well, doesn't mean anything. I'm just not getting any results.\" \"Well, what would have to happen for you to know that Scientology worked?\" That is the golden question.   * Editor's note: Prehav 13, see definition and description further down in the text"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 7 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 718 HPCS And he says, \"Well, the ringing would have to stop in my ears, of course. And I know whether auditing has worked, you see, as to whether the ringing in my ears gets louder or softer. And sometimes it hits high C and I know I've had a good session\", and so on. You can find all kinds of weird things like this going on, see. All right. Now let's do an assessment on the ringing in his ears. What is it? Is it ears? Is it ringing? Is it heads? You know, what is this difficulty? And we just make him keep say-ing terminals, terminals, terminals, terminals, terminals. You get the idea? We keep writing them down, writing them down, writing them down. We get a whole bunch of terminals for this ringing in the ears, you know. A whole gang of them. And if it hasn't disappeared in getting the terminals, which it very often does, then you turn around and you run an assessment on these terminals. Find one which falls the most. You don't have to do it by elimination, by the way. That's just getting just a little bit too purposeful. Just take the one that seems to be the most reactive in that list, gives the most change, you see. We take that and we assess it on the Prehav Scale. It's a kind of a mockery, you know, of SOP Goals, and we assess it on the Prehav Scale, same way. We give it great seriousness. We run it. We run it, see, on the Prehav Scale, but you'll find out that very often you have to run it by the needle. The level doesn't last long enough. And sometimes it grinds out longer than you would think, and you'll be quite surprised, but keep it going. And get it a bit flat. Sometimes it might take you two or three sessions, or something like this to get this thing really flat. When it seems to flatten, by any criteria, assess it again on the Primary Scale. Don't bother with Secondary Scales. Not for something like this. And assess it again and run it again. And maybe you might have to assess it again and run it again. But that time's [it's] gone. Now you've gotten the chronic present time problem that you were handling session after session wasting time on, with a poor process, see, with a rudiments process, and it was a very weak process. Well, let's get in there and pitch. See. All right. The Prehav Scale opens up. You can run this particular terminal. You can run it ragged. If it goes more than three or four sessions though, you'd better ask yourself if you're doing right, you know. Something wrong here. I'd do it all over again. Do a Terminals Assessment on it all over again or something. It's going too long. All right. Now the other operation, that's the PT problem sort of thing. That's PT problem of long duration to be absolutely technical. A person's had this for a number of years but not more than one lifetime, see. You do the same thing with Prehav 13, which is pretty gorgeous, by the way. That's a pretty gorgeous one. You – you just better get that in your working kit because it'll run on practically anybody under the sun. And it just is marvelous. So far, all the reports I've had on Prehav 13 were utterly rave reports. So it's got lots of velocity. And it's called 13 not because of the position on the Primary Scale, which is what you're liable to con-fuse it with, because it's a successor to Formula 13. And what you do, the way it's done is very easy. All you do is make a long list of eve-rybody the preclear knows, even faintly, but personally, in his whole lifetime, this whole life-time. Just keep putting down names. Now, as the pc runs along, he's also going to think of other names, and every time you do an assessment on this list, he's going to think of more names. Well, you add those to the"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 8 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 719 HPCS end of the list. You don't assess them when they came up. You got the idea? Don't Q-and-A with it. Just keep putting these new names he thinks of on the end of the list. In other words, there's just a stable datum there that every time he thinks of a new name after he's ended his list – you know, the list is over. \"That's everybody I know.\" Now he thinks of twelve new names, see. You add those to the end of the list. You don't assess them at the time he gives them to you. You just assess them in turn. You got it? All right. You take this list and it'll be a rather imposing, overwhelming affair, and you're liable to think the first time you ever do this, \"Good heavens, we're going to spend the next 875 hours of auditing doing nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, but go over this list, list, list, nothing. Kawow!\" Well, that isn't true. As you do the assessment and try to find out which person it is, and as you pick one of these names because of its greater reaction... By the way, you – you assess down the list – you could assess something on the order of taking twenty of the names as a block, and just assess that twenty, and find the person in that block of twenty that has the deepest fall, you see. You don't have to assess the whole list like you would in SOP Goals. It actually doesn't much matter how you do it, you got it? You're straining at gnats; you're the ensign out there on the bridge, looking through the sextant with chewing gum in the eyepiece and pointing it and taking a very fine meridian altitude on the truck light. And then he goes below and spends the next seven or eight hours, you see, figuring it all out to the ninety-fifth decimal point, you see? So he figures out – the point he finally arrives at was – is actually far smaller than a pin punched in the ocean, you know. The accuracy of his action is, however, anything that would put him anywhere on this planet with a sextant. You got the idea? I mean, this is a standard one. It's one I joke about because frankly it's one I've seen many times. This tremen-dous – I've seen engineers do this, you know. I've had engineers – well, you've seen them, too. It's just horrifying. And sometimes these guys will be horrified at what you're doing, you know. And you say, \"Well, we're going to throw this bridge across this stream here. We've got to fix up this – this steel column here so it's going to support the roof\", you know, and golly, you throw in all of these factors. You think it over, you know, and you say, \"Well, let's see, there's going to be a lot of tonnage up there, and then there'd be tonnage moving in and out. And there'd be this and there'd be that. And the mass of the roof is so forth, and our factor of safety, let's call it 5, and so forth.\" And you say, \"Well, let's make the thing so it'll hold up 192 tons.\" And this fellow you're working with says, \"Aren't you going to measure it?\" you know. And you say, \"Measure it, why?\" \"Well, well, I know, but good heavens, such inaccuracy you know?\" And you look at him and you say, \"But there isn't any way to get a totally accurate down-to-the-last-ounce weight on any building. The wind blows, people move a machine up-stairs. After you've built the building, why, they drag in another machine, and they overstress the area and they understress it, and during certain times of the day it has lots of foot traffic,"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 9 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 720 HPCS and other times it has none. How are you going to stabilize the load on this beam? There is no such thing as a constant load on ...\" \"Oh, well, yes, there is, you know.\" And they just believe this so implicitly, it's pa-thetic, you know. And half the time those guys will put up a beam, and you'll put one small electric motor or something up above this beam, and it crumples, you know, like a piece of taffy. But, boy, have they figured it. Man, they've got the last piece of gravel that is going to be on the roof, you know. They have figured out even the weight of the seeds of dandelions that are going to blow, you know, and touch the top of the building. [laughter] They got them all. And then they'll frankly go on by the hour, and they will take this figure – which is at best a very rough, rough guesstimate, see – and then they'll take this figure and with what agony will they reduce it to what accuracy. See? And golly, you watch this. But they watch you equally in horror, you see, as you're doing an inexact operation. For instance, I happen to know that the stresses on a helicopter airfoil had never been measured. Nobody has ever measured one because we don't have men that endure enough to get out there on an actual helicopter blade, you see, and put spring balances on them this way and that. And a slow motion picture demonstrates that a helicopter wing, while spinning – they're wings really – they've got a twist in them as much as thirty-five to fifty degrees. And you'll see this – this blade going this way and this way under actual use. It's the most horrify-ing thing to watch. You say, \"How can any piece of material ever do this\", see? And as the helicopter wing swings forward, it's got one set of stresses, and then as it goes around past the nacelle and goes back, it's got another set of stresses entirely different. And somebody's going to calculate this? Man, that is just unimaginable. After they've calculated it, you see, what have they got to do? They've got to carve out a helicopter blade and swing it around to find out what it's going to do in actual service, and then make it a bit stronger, and they've got it. And that's the way it's normally done anyhow. So I don't want in any respect to give you any idea that an exact formula, you see, ex-ists in an area where the most wild, rough, slapdash is going to do some good, don't you see. Now, it's quite one thing with what precision – because boy, it is precise if you do it right. And a lot of you have got reality on it, when you've run out all the guy's goals and you've got all of his terminals flat, man, the final one is just sitting there, and it's inevitable, and explains everything that's been going on and so on, and there it is. In other words, you're up with a single answer because you're trying to achieve this single answer, you see. And there isn't any other answer. It isn't a dozen answers. It's just one. Well now, that's quite a precise activity, and you then assess this particular one answer on the Prehav Scale and you're running for blood because you're running the fellow's whole track. Well, you have to do it pretty precisely. You have to make sure that's the right level, after making very sure that it's the right terminal. Oh, yeah, a very precise activity. But look-a-here: Prehav 13? Look, for heaven's sakes, there is no way to determine how fast these things are going to disappear. They may disappear on his mentioning having remembered them. They may disappear on charge on having them included in the list and read a couple of times as you're going over assessments."},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 10 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 721 HPCS They may disappear on the basis of you're – you've just got them, and you say, \"All right. Now we're going to take Joe Jones, and we're going to run him on the Prehav Scale. Now, would Joe Jones be Cause?\" You know, and here we go, you know, anything on the Prehav Scale, and all of a sudden we're looking at the Prehav Scale, we're trying to assess Joe Jones, you know. Oh, we got a fall, you see, at Cause, and a tick at Faith. And we go back to those, and we can't get any reaction. No, you blew Joe Jones in the process of trying to get him on the Prehav Scale. All right. Let's say we've got Minnie Gulch. And Minnie Gulch is over here, and we get her, see, on the Prehav Scale. And we actually find a level and it assesses out beautifully. And Minnie is sitting right there at Withheld Effect or something, and here she is. Man, we're all set, and we're forming the auditing command, and we're all set. There's no reaction on this thing, let's see now. She's gone. And then you're suddenly startled out of your wits by having Mr. Zilch suddenly turn up on the case and not only hold good for a whole assessment, but hold good for the whole of the formation of an auditing command and hold good for about five hours of auditing Kawow! See? This throws you out of balance totally. So every time you have to go through the same action. But don't expect that there's go-ing to be anything very definite about how long that name is going to stay hot, because it isn't going to stay hot in some cases and it is in others, and it's very inexact. Well, in view of the fact that you've got this many vagaries of behavior of the list – yes, it is done precisely the same way every time, but it doesn't much matter whether you assess the whole list or assess part of the list or do what. It's all in what would be the most effective or efficient on how you handle this list – actually, how you assembled the list and so on. This is rough because you're doing a very inexact thing And I'll tell you why it's very inexact. Do you think there's a single person on that list that he's going over that had actually power enough to aberrate him the way he is? So if you make the mistake of believing you were doing anything else but making the case happier or easier to run and getting all the present time problems out of the road, taking these people off as locks. You're just making things easier for yourself, you see. That's the only reason you're doing Prehav 13. In spite of the fact that it makes the preclear happy, it isn't going to do a great deal for his case at large. It's just going to make him easier to audit. You haven't gotten any of his major aberrations out of the road. If you got one out of the road, don't get silly and believe that you've done something fabulous for this case because, let me tell you, you haven't. There isn't anybody on the list he'll give you for this lifetime that had power enough to aberrate him. Not a single soul. And this guy says all of a sudden, \"Oh, I just had this wonderful result and thank heavens you finally found out the fact that my father used to beat me every evening, and I never forgave him for this.

Of course, you wouldn't use that until the person had some kind of an idea that he'd had a past. I imagine it's quite something to struggle with, isn't it? Well, don't take it unless it falls. Unless you get an instant fall, don't pay any attention to it. A lot of these things are in-triguing, you know. And you could wind the pc up just bragging. [laughter] Here's this other Prehav 13 though. Well, you're just smoothing out the auditing and you're smoothing out his life, and you're keeping him from getting rudiments out while you're auditing him. Now, don't mistake it. This is very valuable. But that's all you're doing. So to lay you down any precise estimate of \"For 3 minutes and 57 seconds point 9 if the tone arm is registering at 7.1, but preferably if it is registering at 7.199264\", [laughter] \"this you do and that you do and so forth. And then it's this way and it's that-a-way and so forth.\" No, it's just one of these crude, rough, kick it over, let's find out what's biting him. Let's get these PT problems all out of the road effectively on the Prehav Scale, you see (which is pretty power-ful), instead of kicking them in to sessions and having to get rid of them in rudiments all the time. That's actually the basic use of Prehav 13, is keep yourself from being messed up all the time by having the rudiments out, you see. That's its basic use. And its auditing value? The pc'll think it's marvelous – actually very slight. Compared to a Security Check, it's nothing. Therefore, this type of action gives you all of the latitude in the world. How do you find all these people? Well, if you just took every-body you knew and took them one after the other, crudely, and assessed them on the Prehav Scale, most of them would blow out. Oh, you leave five hot. So what! They didn't do anything to him, anyhow. Got the idea? See, its a very highly imprecise action. It's just something that you get out of the road. You can go over this list. You'd end it when you could go over the list without getting any kicks on the needle. That's all. Not even with a very high sensitivity, you know. You know, third-of-a-dial drop. Oh, I got a joke on somebody on sensitivity. I told you Herbie was having trouble, and I put him back on the line, and I had it put up on the board here. But he says, \"Sure enough.\" Only, it was – surprised me, the observer on the ground found something that I didn't neces-sarily predict, see. I thought that he'd find that they were setting the sensitivity knob too high while they were doing rudiments. This isn't what he found. Being right on the ground, he had an opportunity to observe it. No. None of them knew what a third-of-a-dial drop was. [laugh-ter] You see? Remember what I was telling you. It's just fantastic. It's just the unguessable. [laugh-ter] Don't bother to guess it. Just look. We used to have a slogan: Look. Don't think. And it sure applies to this kind of thing, you know.

The running of Prehav 13, the running a PT problems on a goals-type as-sessment, are done in Routine 2. And Routine 3 isn't clobbered up with this stuff at all. And there's where you got your crisscross. Now, when you're just doing a general run as called for in Routine 2, you do your as-sessments just as you would assess for a terminal, but you certainly aren't mentioning any terminals. And you just go down the line. Same way. What I do is I take the list from the bot-tom and I run on up toward the top until the needle starts rising consistently. I do use a needle rise. And when it starts rising, I say, well, why go any higher, you know. And as I've gone up, I simply make a mark after the Prehav level that reacted. Every one that reacted. I didn't linger around on it. You never repeat Prehav levels. You just say them, and it reacts, and you go on to the next one. And then pretty soon you'll find the needle starts climbing and climbing, and you say, \"Well, we've hit the end of this fellow's reality.\" All right. So we start back down again, and now we only take those points that we have a mark after. And we read those over once and find which one of those is still live. Any one of those that's still live, we make the same mark after it. Now you've got about two, three levels, or something like this you've got, with two marks after them. Now, you read that second-mark level again to the pc, you see. You know, the one that got the reaction again, and you read those three over. And one of them falls out, and then you play the two against each other that remain. And one of those will fall out, and that is the level. And that is the fastest, most accurate way I know of, of doing a Prehav Assessment with a terminal, with a general level or anything else. If you were to find that – while you were running SOP Goals – I'll make this comment because it – there were several checks here as to whether or not you're on the right track and you're doing all right as an auditor. I'd better mention them. One of them is you do – this is about the third time – second or third time you've as-sessed this pc – preferably about the third time – on an SOP Goals run, and you're assessing this terminal which you have long since established on the Prehav Scale the third time, you see. You've already gotten rid of a couple of levels. You've run them. And all of a sudden you find twelve, fifteen levels of the Prehav Scale are alive. Uh-uh-uh, oh-oh, mm-mm, da-dadat-dat. Wrong terminal. Wrong terminal. You goofed. And the thing to do is to end the assess-ment there. Right now. Don't go on with it. You've got twelve, fifteen levels live. Something is awfully wrong. First find out what's been going on. Has the pc been selfauditing this thing? Has he been auditing some other terminal to himself? Has somebody else been running him, you know? Ask the obvious questions. No. None of these things. So you sort of assume, well, I've goofed. So let's go back to the terminals list, and let's take the whole terminals list that we had, and let's read it all over again to the pc and find out what's wrong with it. And we may find that we have bought a cognition surge or something like this, and we selected that terminal too rapidly or something of the sort. Let's go back, because now we will find, possibly, that it wasn't quite the right terminal. Now we get the"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 13 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 724 HPCS right terminal. Now just go on and run. Don't bother to go back to check your goal. That's certainly not going to be out. Your goal is kind of uncheckable anyhow, because the moment the pc's attention is put on terminals for the goal, the goal desensitises. All right. So that's the – that's one test as to whether or not in Routine 3 you're on the right track. There is another test of similar validity. And when you're doing a level and, with-out being even questionably flat, the tone arm just goes up, particularly between sessions – the tone arm just goes up. This doesn't happen every time, but between sessions, you know. He left reading at 3.5 and he comes back in reading at 6.0. Or you're running him, and fantas-tically you've got a tone arm which goes – it's been running between 3.0 and 4.0, and all of a sudden it starts to run between 4.0 and 5.0, and then starts to run between 5.0 and 6.0. Well, that's another check. Your rudiments are out. That's all that means. Your rudiments have gone out somewhere along the line, see. The pc's got a withhold from you. The pc's got a present time problem. The pc's got something or other. Now, this is a little bit confusing to read because toward the end of a line, just before the level gets flat on a terminal, this also happens – to a slighter degree, but it also happens. Your level is just about going to get flat, and the tone arm will go up half a point, and it kind of gets sticky and goes up and so forth. Well, so naturally, the best way to get around this is to check the rudiments before you reassess. If you think something is flat, your end rudiments should be very thorough. You think something is flat, you should end the session and hit those end rudiments very thoroughly, before you do your next assessment. And of course, you've got another crack at it in your beginning rudiments. Now do your assessment, and if the level that you have been running is still alive and it was only an ARC break, it'll become obvious to you because the rudiments were badly out. You understand? And if the thing appeared flat, but then you went into the end rudiments, and the rudiments were very badly out, you would then assume that it really wasn't flat. And the – really the safe thing to do even before you reassess or test anything or anything else is, run another twenty minutes of it. See, after you've got the rudiments straightened up, run another twenty minutes before you finally get down to assessments. You see that? That's the careful auditor. You won't make any goofs this way. A pc can go out of ses-sion, and the level you're running on SOP Goals appears to be flat. This is normally signalized by – when it's apparently flat, but reason is an ARC break or something, the tone arm is going to go pretty well up before it flattens. It's going to go pretty well up. So as I say, in – before you assess again, you should run those end rudiments, run some beginning rudiments, and if you found the rudiments were wildly out, just assume that thing wasn't flat and run another twenty minutes of it. Another test, in other words. Now, this is – works exactly the same way in running Routine 2 on general runs. That general run is a highly precise action. And all of a sudden you're running Failed Leave on the pc, and you're running it and run it and running it and running it and running it and run it and run it and run it and run it. And all of a sudden the tone arm goes up about two dial-divisions. And all of a sudden there's no motion. Well, one of two things could be the case. Case 1: It's flat. And Case 2: He's gotten a violent ARC break or a violent PT problem or something else has happened, very harsh, very rough on the case. And in either case,"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 14 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 725 HPCS whether running Routine 2 or Routine 3, you should make a very careful rudiments check. So therefore, you end the session. You don't say \"Well, that process is flat. We're going to reas-sess for a new process.\" No, sir. That'd be a bum one to do. What you do is go over those end rudiments. Now see if they were wildly out. You know, he had a PT problem. He had an ARC break. He had a withhold. I mean, you know, wow! See? And you notice while you're doing this that the tone arm comes down. You'll see that happen, if this is the case, you see. And don't ever make the mistake of thinking the level you were running was flat because it isn't. And the safe thing to do is to, of course, give it another twenty minutes. Now, if it is flat, of course, it'll remain flat. There isn't anything mysterious going to happen here. Nothing is going to unflatten it. There isn't any walking on the thin edge of any-thing. Go ahead. Test it again. So you might say, to absolutely guarantee the results you're going to get, the proper thing to do is, when a level is flat – whether Routine 2 or Routine 3 – the proper thing to do is to run end rudiments, beginning rudiments, and if these things mark-edly shifted the tone arm down, run it for another twenty minutes to find out if it was flat. Okay? Of course, this even means an ARC break for the pc sometimes. But so what? I'll tell you this. I've never had it fail that when a preclear was ARC breaking on the basis of \"You are running this level, and this level has long since been flat!\" and so forth, and I have never seen it otherwise in the case that the level was just about as flat as the Tasmanian Sea, which everybody knows measures waves seventy feet between trough and crest. Not flat. Just the fact that the pc is saying, \"Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow. And I know it's flat, and I'm tired of it, and I want to get off of this, and you just keep running it. And ac-tually it's killing me because you're bringing in these other masses on me, you see. And it's all very ruinous and yippety-yap, yippety-yap, yippety-yap.\" I don't even look at an E-Meter. I just go on running it. Not to punish the pc, but I know the pc is just on the verge of a startling and horrendous gain, and sure enough you'll see it every time. The pc will all of a sudden say, \"Oh, well, what do you know. Gee. Wow, uh-huh-huh! Hearh!\" They never tell you though, \"Boy, it's lucky you kept on running that, man.\" They never say that. I never heard them say it anyhow. They only say, \"Yow, yow, yow, and it's flat, and you know it's flat, and you're just running it to punish me. You're just running it be-cause I said I didn't want to run it. That's why you're running it.\" It's like the CCHs. When anybody says, \"No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No! No! No CCHs. That's only for nuts, psychotics. That's for bums. My case isn't in that bad shape. Actually, I had the CCHs totally flattened in 1952.\" [laughter] And, oh boy, is that a good enough reason to run them. I mean, it's a perfect assessment. Something is overwhumping the pc here. Because a fellow, let me tell you, that has the CCHs flat will simply sit down and run the CCHs, bang! There's nothing to it, see. You just sit down, he'll run the CCHs. You got a reality on that now, I'm sure. They sit down, they run the CCHs. So what's that? That's noth-ing very drastic. The auditor will find out in exactly eighty minutes that they are flat. All right. Good. Of course, if the pc asks you to put it in writing so that it won't hap-pen again, [laughter] once more we have another test. The only place that the CCHs can really"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"TRAINING ON TRS, TALK ON AUDITING 15 SHSBC-026 – 30.6.61 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 726 HPCS fool you is on the beginning of the run, and that's the only place a level can really fool an auditor. There is no telling at the beginning on many cases, whether the CCHs are flat or the level is flat. Because in one case the pc has no reaction; in the other case, the E-Meter has no reaction. You don't get any reaction out of the pc in the CCHs. You don't get any reaction out of the meter on the level. And you go on. You run it and you run it and you run it, and you go through them once, and you go through them twice, and you go through them again. Aaaahhhhh. Nothing happening here, and all of a sudden the pc says, \"Thuuuup!\" Thud! And then they get liver, and they get liver, and they get liver and liver, and then they're getting real hot, and the pc's going along just dandy, and everything is fine, and only after they've hit a peak of some kind, do they then cool off. Similarly, with a level: you take some case, particularly that has to have a high sensi-tivity knob setting. And you start to run this level, and it's Failed Cause or something, you know. And here you go. \"What have you done to the Confederacy? What has the Confederacy done to you?\" Failed Cause, something of that sort. [laughter] And you get to run it along, and here you go. And you're getting an eighth-of-a-dial tone arm motion. Eighth-of-a-dial tone arm motion. Eighth-of-a-dial tone arm motion. Every twenty minutes it shifts a sixteenth of a division, you know, that kind of thing, you know. And it'll shift an eighth of a division, and then it'll shift a quarter of a division. Then it'll shift a half a division, and then it'll shift a division, then it'll shift two divisions, and it looks like it's doing a rock slam over on the tone arm read, see. And then it's hot, hot, hot, hot. And it runs hot. And it runs for a long time, and then it starts running cool, cooler, cooler, cooler, cooler, cooler, flat. And you can expect this cycle of action to occur on the unflatness of any process in the three routines. That can happen anyplace in the three routines. The person is getting no reaction to something at all. And then the reaction suddenly increases. Okay? All right. Is there – are there any other questions? I answered that one rather obliquely, but it's some data I thought you ought to have. Is there any other question? ... Okay. Well then, you've had a successful week, have you? Audience: Yes. All right. Now, on this weekend, you're not going to have anything to do this week-end.

This is the 16th of January, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Well, let's give all those coaches some applause, huh? [applause] And let's give the students some applause. [applause] Thank you. I don't know if you noticed it, but the upper unit student confront comparison with the newer student confront, well, was quite marked, wasn't it? Audience: Yes. I thought it would be something like that. That's why I chose them up that way. Now, you know the rules about TV. You know, if you've been on TV, you know, it's popularly believed, if you've been on TV, then you're not on TV again. [laughter] That's – that's normally believed. But actually that's only if you're cancelled before the program. You probably didn't know that part of the rule. A lot of rules about it. They change from week to week. [laughter, laughs] You might as well get used to it because TV-type training is going into Central Orgs and you'll find out it's very beneficial. TR 0, the original TR 0, was simply to be there and be aware, and that wa – that was all there was to it. And in actual fact, apparently people have begun to confront with that definition. See, if you don't let them confront with their noses or their big toes or stomachs or something like that, they can always confront with that definiti-on. These are – nevertheless, the definition is still valid and the original TR 0 is still valid, but there's some other things that have been added in on top of it. The – you can make some-body confront with a professional attitude. And usually, you find every here and there that some student's got a real professional attitude that he is confronting with and see, it's a con-front with – that's the trouble with it. And an auditing attitude and an interested attitude and so forth, these things are all fine, as long as they're run out. And the trick in coaching TR 0 – it all depends on a good coach – is spotting some-thing the student is doing, getting him to be aware of it and run it out. That's in actual fact, the system – all there is to the system of coaching. But, of course, you can give a student so many flunks that he just caves in. He – \"So what, you can't win anyhow,\" and goes into apathy."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 2 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 731 HPCS Now, you can give a student so many wins that he never learns how to confront. I mean, you can do this both ways, too. Takes a little wisdom in the matter. But what you're actually trying to get him to do is to stand up to the duress of auditing. Let's get off of our basic definitions and let's get into a little bit of the whys and wheres of TR 0. I well recall one of the Upper Indoc TRs that somebody was trying to teach somebody in an ACC, and it was the one that teaches 8-C with violence – you remember that old one – you know. And all of a sudden the student quit. The student quit and walked out and an In-structor stopped the student and said, \"Why, what's the matter?\" And very, very grimly and primly the student said, \"Pcs never act like that.\" See, she... the coach had actually been giving this student a bad time, you know. And, well, just – people just don't act like that. Well, a couple of years went by and this student showed up for a retread in the Academy or something of this sort, but – or it was for some auditing – and came around and had an apology to make on the subject. She had audited an actual pc who had acted much worse. [laughter] So, pcs did act like that. Well, in actual fact, in actual fact, one of the things that is most disturbing to a pc is to have an auditor whose confront is corned up in some way – is a very unnatural confront – and who shatters under an upset in the session. Well, normally these upsets are assignable to TR 4 and nearly everybody gives TR 4 the medal for auditor upset, don't you see? I mean, the audi-tor Qs-and-As and Qs-and-As. Every time you Q-and-A, you see, you make the student miss a withhold – I mean, make the pc miss a withhold, see. One Q and A – one missed withhold, see. So, therefore an ARC break gets worse and worse and worse when an auditor Qs-and-As. Very, very simple mechanism goes on there. The pc says – in answer to some question or in origin – \"Well, I thought a moment ago that you were nulling too fast.\" And the auditor says, \"All right. I'll null more slowly.\" Now, you see it isn't the actual fact that the auditor has followed the order of the pc, in TR 4, that's not what is important. What is important is that he's failed to acknowledge an answer to an origin or an auditing command, you see. He's failed to acknowledge that answer. And with some auditors, you work and work and work and work and work to stop them from Q-and-Aing. It's so bad that the auditor says, \"In this session is there anything you suppressed?\" And the student says, \"Well, I suppressed thinking that you were a bit untidy with your paper.\" And the auditor says, \"Okay, I'll straighten it up.\" Well, of course, that's a missed withhold at once. Now, the student is... I mean the pc can't get this off because every time the pc tries to repeat this answer, the auditor starts argu-ing that he's perfectly willing to tidy up his papers, you get the idea?"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 3 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 732 HPCS Now, let's look at – let's look at why an auditor very often – and some auditors do – take a long time to get up to a point where they never Q-and-A. And it isn't in actual fact the TR 4. It's the TR 0 that is shot. This auditor can't stand up to an auditing session with TR 0 and is so, in that fashion, on a sort of an inflow or something, you see, and isn't really there and being aware, but re-treats any time anything looks like it's a little bit odd in the session – the auditor retreats and that's the basic sin. Well, you can see these Upper Indoc drills they – somebody knocks the student all over the place. The coach knocks the student around and the student has to stand up to it and retain control of the situation if he can. You know, we can see that. That's all very visible. But those same mechanisms are present in TR 0. Exactly those same mechanisms are present. Now, what we've seen in demonstration here is a rather smoothly polished TR 0. Two people who have had quite a bit of TR 0 run already can be polished further. But there's this additional element which isn't on those demonstrations – is pushing buttons. And finally a person will harden into it and then lose the hardening and then find out he can do it, you know. And he'll be able, actually, to sit there with an auditing presence and have a pc blowing up without getting rattled. Pc starts to have an ARC break, the auditor doesn't go into an instant lost TR 0, see. TR 0 doesn't go up the spout. Now, therefore, TR 0 can also – after you've led a person forward to getting rid of all the junk – can be stepped up, can be stepped up. You can start to rough it up. And this is par-ticularly what I wanted to add to this, not talk more about the demonstrations but to show you that there's an additional step you can use. Now, it requires a considerable perception on the part of the coach in order to step this up accurately. And you had one example of a step-up. Now, I was actually stepping it up on Norman's dander when he was the student there. He was blowing up. See, but he settled back down into it and it was okay. But in actual fact, do you see there – do you see, he was break-ing his confront. Do you see that? Now, you can lead on that type of a gradient to higher and higher stepups. You get him just fine so he can stand up to that and then you'd uncork something else. But let's look at something they're doing or something that they are incipiently doing and start punching the button and get the person to explain it – explain how he's doing it and then he starts to as-is it, don't you see? He becomes aware of it and in essence takes over the automaticity of it. And you can keep leading out that way further and further and further, well, until it'd be a matter of the coach jumping up and poking the chair, you see, at the student to get him to break his confront. Do you see how – to the degree that that could be stepped up? I've noticed that in the presence of an ARC break, Q and A becomes very, very grim. This auditor never Qs-and-As but in the presence of an ARC break, Qs-and-As. And I'm pointing this out to you: the reason he Qs-and-As is not that his TR 4 goes to pieces but his TR 0 goes to pieces."},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 4 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 733 HPCS So therefore, there is a great deal that can be said for stepping up what there is there to be confronted. Now, anybody can confront a completely motionless pc. See, anybody can confront a motionless pc. But how about confronting a pc in motion? Well, the first thing you would think of is somebody shaking his hand in front of the student's eyes. The coach shaking his hand in front of the student's eye and get the student to stop flinching. See, that would be a very easy gradient on the thing, you know. But how about dodging E-Meter cans? [laughter] Hm? Do you realize that in general practice, particularly due to the ARC breaks which can sometimes come up under Routine 2-12, that I would say if you went six months without having a pc throw the cans down, why, you – you must be either very, very lucky or have very apathetic pcs. [laughs] And I'd say once a year, an auditor can certainly expect to get the cans in his chest. Now, you don't want to train an auditor to a point where he doesn't dodge the cans, [laughter] but you certainly want him trained to the point where the cans do not interrupt his command of the session. See, that his action of dodging doesn't interrupt the command of the session. Now, this gets pretty grim after a while. You see, it's just – the sky's the limit. It gets up to one of these Tom and Jerry cartoons, you know – buildings falling down and holes go-ing through the center of the Earth. But the main thing I'm trying to put across is that your gradient is what there is there to confront. See, you could add more things to confront and get him to analyze what he was doing. You could actually take an old E-Meter can and throw it into his chest, you know, and get him so he would take care of the E-Meter can, you see, and still be able to confront the pc. Auditors do very interesting things. Not good auditors – but I've seen very interesting things happen in auditing sessions. I have seen a person go into total silence. This is more common than you would think. Pc all of a sudden seems to be in trouble and the auditor goes into total silence. That is about the grimmest thing that can happen to a pc. That's no auditing with an exclamation point. It's actually worse than Q and A. The pc has just lost his auditor. That is it. Well, now, it normally happens on a freeze. In other words, the auditor freezes; be-comes incapable of confronting and just goes into wood. Now, this is a much more insidious type of thing to break than action. See, you wouldn't want to specialize in your coaching your TR 0 in the fellow blinking, the fellow twitching, the fellow moving, so forth. Don't specialize in that. Let's give at least 50 percent of our coaching to the fellow going into wood. You see what I mean there? Audience: Yeah. As you go up in upper drills, if he's liable to clam up on a pc, you can also make him do it on TR 1. Now, that... it's an odd mechanism – this one of just freezing – just goes into wood. Now, a good coach can recognize the fact that he hasn't got a confronting pc, that he's just got a solid piece of granite in front of him. And remember, that person who thinks that con-frontingness is just becoming a solid piece of granite may some day merely stop auditing in"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 5 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 734 HPCS the auditing session and just say nothing. And that's just about the grimmest thing that can happen. All right. Now, your next action on this is an actual flee by the auditor. That's not as bad as a total clam up, but it amounts to the same thing. You see, the worst... Frankly, the more motionless or inactive a person is, the worse off he is, but that doesn't mean that the more active he is the better off he is. You see that. You – you take uh – you take the \"p-sy-atrist,\" the \"p-sy-atrist\" – he hasn't got the faintest grip on this. He hasn't a clue about this. This has totally escaped him. He's always trying to put people into apathy so they will look all right. Now, he's totally sold on the idea of insanity is motion. Where, as a matter of fact, it's far more often no action at all, see. It's much harder, now, hear me now, it's much harder to do something for a very apathetic case than it is an angry one, see. Your Tone Scale tells you that, of course, and you've known that for a long time. But I'm pointing that out in TR 0 that you can very easily, very easily slip a cogwheel here. And just because the guy is sitting there in a total apathy, think that he's doing TR 0. And let only the very apathetic and the very granitesque student get by, see. That's not the case at all. So you might as well add something to it: look alive. Does he look alive? You can add that, you know, be there and be aware, but that awareness, let's color that with a definition of – let's have him be alive, too, you know. Have the blood flowing in his veins. That's an impor-tant thing. And actually that one little point is the one which would be most often missed by a coach. He can spot the fellow who goes dzzzu-u-u-uh, see. He can spot the fellow who's go-ing, \"Huh, huh, huh,\" you know. He can spot that dead easy. But the guy who's going [dem-onstrates something, laughter] – doesn't spot that, see. Well, it's all right, he's sitting there quietly, see. He's made a \"p-sy-chiatric\" mistake. And this is a mistake that he's made. And you got to keep pointing that little point up when you're training people because it's a natural thing, apparently, to think that something is quiet is safe. Now, of course, the \"p-sy-atrist\" is simply trying to make his patient safe. See, he's operating totally on the third dynamic and he's trying to protect the third dynamic, you see, from the first. What's bad is the first dynamic, see. That's why you don't easily understand this \"p-sy-atrist,\" because he's not trying to make anybody any better. See, he's trying to make the third dynamic safe. So therefore, his (quote) \"cures\" are all cures which apparently are sup-posed to benefit the third dynamic. None of his (quote) \"cures\" are ever supposed to benefit the patient. He doesn't even think so! You ask him, \"Have you ever cured anybody?\" and he will say immediately, \"Yes.\" But you've never asked him probably, \"What have you cured him of?\" And if he doesn't give you some long imaginary name that was dreamed up by Kraepelin over in Germany and you get him down to it, he's cured somebody of being in motion. That's what he's cured somebody of, and that's all. So, this is very important to point up. This is very important to point up because you'll find as you look down a whole row of people who are doing TR 0 that a certain number of them have gone to granite and dropped out the bottom and something like this. You want to"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 6 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 735 HPCS know what their auditing responses are at that particular time, and so forth, and of course, they're zero. They get into a session auditing somebody, something happens, they go into inaction because they're not confronting. They can't confront. This idea of the total withdraw, see. [demonstrates something, laughter] Watch it. You could actually put some kind of a meter on the back of the chair to find how hard the student was pressing the back of the chair and you would get an accurate measurement of how little he was confronting, because the more weight that goes against the back of the chair, the more he's trying to get out of there, man. Now, this will go into a total apathy of \"can't get away\" and \"can't speak\" in a situation of duress. It'll go to... actually that's very lowscale. Upperscale is, the auditor will actually run away. Flee. Flee the session. Get out of there. Now, where good auditing shows up as different than bad auditing is in moments of duress. And somebody will get along beautifully auditing some chipper lady that isn't causing any trouble, at all and he luckily got on the right lines and he hasn't made any mistakes and so forth. And you look at him and you say, \"Well, he can really audit. He's just doing fine,\" see. Well, to really know this auditor, you have to see him in a moment of duress. What happens in that moment of duress to his TR 0? That's the first thing to go – TR 0. He'll start making mistakes and of course that's the one thing you mustn't make. Whether he makes the mistake of shutting up or the mistake of running away or simply the mistake of bungling the auditing commands or the mistake of suddenly transferring over to a new list, you got that one? Pc ARC broke so must be the wrong list, so well abandon it. And then we wonder why day after day thereafter the pc makes no recovery. Well, of course, he's ARC broke because the list was not finished, see. List was abandoned. But he'll make a wrong judgment, no matter how well he's taught. If his TR 0 is terri-bly bad under duress, he'll make a wrong judgment. So you might say there are two or three TR 0s. There's the TR 0 of the fellow doing the drill. Let's take that one as the first one. He isn't – hasn't anything to do with auditing, hasn't anything to do with anything else, it's some-thing that the Instructor or the coach told him to do, so he's doing it. You got that? It's not associated with anything. All right, your next one is the person who clams up and actively can't act. And your next grade up the line is somebody who goes into an obsessive motion as a sort of a Q and A. Take that as three grades of things which you have to cure when you're coaching TR 0. And if you're going to do a thorough job, cure all of them. Just take them in sections. Now, he's – this first one that we're doing which is just sitting there and confronting, when you add to that confronting in certain ways, you're clearing up the first one. Well, you're curing up the second one, too, when you're doing that. But, no, very few drills go into a cure-up of this dispersal in action. But those drills are very easy for a coach to figure out."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 7 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 736 HPCS One of the things is, you know that there are some auditors around who will obses-sively laugh. Something goes off the rails, or something like that, they will actually laugh. They'll laugh in the wrong places in the session, too, I guarantee you. They've got an incipient laugh and you can break them up. Well, you just go ahead breaking them up until they don't have to. It's all a system of taking over the automaticity. And you might practice someday just throwing E-Meter cans at their chest, see. And see if they can't keep on confronting while ducking. I don't care how you do this. I'm just giving you an action level, you see. Now, one of the ways of doing this is a talking confront. You never heard of this be-fore because it's normally TR 1 and 2, but TR 1 and 2 are, in actual fact, simply actions which get a command across to the pc and acknowledge what the pc said. Those are the purposes of those two. So you can have a counting confront. Can the fellow go on counting while you're throwing E-Meter cans at his chest or does he lose track of his numbers? You see how he could do it? You could actually have a talking confront. He isn't trying to reach anybody with this. You're just using this as an index. Now, there are various things then that you could do, but I've given you the three zones that you actually have to cure if you're really going to cure up an auditor of doing something weird because the session goes awry. Now, today it would be to our great interest to beef up this one point. To make it stronger, to strengthen it up and hit it harder, because let me assure you that auditors are go-ing to get more ARC breaks than ever before. At the same time they're going to get more re-wards than ever before, but they're also going to get more ARC breaks than ever before. So, you're going to have to train people to expect ARC breaks and to keep on going. Now, I recently had an ARC break in an auditing session that had me very puzzled. I went on and handled the situation, of course, but I was very interested afterwards that the ARC break had made me think less fast. I was aware of having thought less fast in that ARC break than I ordinarily would have. It was, basically, just get out of the habit of having ARC breaks. Now, oh, I picked up the ball and kept it rolling, but I was – I was aware of thinking less swiftly, and realized that the mechanism involved was – is I didn't want to confront this, because you see it was not my intention to make this pc splatter over the ceiling. And this particular pc was splattering over the ceiling. Wasn't my intention. So, it was counter to what I was trying to do in the session. So, there was a small impulse there not to confront it. Do you see? So I myself got a good subjective reality on what this is all about. It was a good subjective reality. And I said, now, all I have to do is multiply that subjective reality up to a point where I just stopped thinking, you see, and one would have goofed at that point. I didn't goof, but I was aware of the fact that, you know, what the hell am I doing, you know. What's the thing to tell this pc? All that just slowed right on down. What do I do now? It was rather rough because three lists were in question. I was simply trying to straighten out a pc on lists, see. And three lists were in question. I couldn't tell which one of them the pc was ARC breaking on. Because the ARC"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 8 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 737 HPCS break suddenly distributed over all three lists and it just got worse. Oh, I wasn't trying to make the pc worse, so my confrontingness dropped. So, actually keeping the thing going, I mentally sat back and confronted the situation and picked it up and kept it rolling. But I could see exactly what happens. I see somebody who's – who's got a pc, everything has been... Because these R2-12 ARC breaks are sudden, man. They can be sudden and catastrophic when you run into them. And apparently inexpli-cable. And you're running along and everything's fine and in the best of all possible worlds you are nulling the best of all possible lists and you look up and you say to the pc, \"All right, we got your item now. Ha-ha. It is 'willow wand,'\" and watch the pc carefully and everything seems to be all right, you know. And the pc even has a bit of a cognition, we're being very smug about everything, and aren't we good, and we pick up our pencil to finish off our audi-tor's report and there come the E-Meter cans. What the hell, you know. What happened? Well, you just picked the wrong item. You should go on listing a little bit further; that's the motto. And the faster you say, \"All right, that's not your item, thank you very much. Now we're going to list a little bit further,\" and push the auditor's report out from underneath your paw and push the list under it and start listing, your pc will start listing instantly. All right, that, or for other reasons, these ARC breaks rather take you aback, because they're quite violent. The slow-burning ARC break, the corroding type of all of this would hit somebody who tended to go numb in a most horrible way. The corroding type of ARC break is that you have successfully listed something, everything was fine and the next session you have trouble getting the pc into session and the pc is full of despair and it's all just despair and hopelessness and you try to spot where this began, you know, and you can't quite spot where it began, but there is the pc being rather critically hopeless, if you get the idea. And you didn't intend to do this, so your intention is off. Your confront then, bow, there it goes, right there. So, TR 0 should get a lot of attention from us in Academies. If we're going to take HPA students and get them to do R2-12, then we've got to beef up TR 0, that's the conclusion I've come to on it. And we treat these people as though they fall into all three of these grades, you see. We treat them as though they'll go into a total wooden nowhere and that they'll flee and that they will go into violent motion. Treat them in all three grades, see where they break up and keep cracking the buttons until they – all of a sudden they're able to pull through it. It's a sort of an Upper Indoc TR 0. I don't care what you do with the pc as long as you give him enough wins – I mean a student – as long as you give him enough wins to keep him going. That's how many wins you give one. You don't ever give them as many as they earn; that would be too reasonable. Just give them enough to keep them going and don't give them so many that they think they can do it. Because the actual fact is, they have to come to the independent opinion that they can do it. How much and how long should you run TR 0? Well, actually until the person, while doing all other actions and TRs, can keep up his TR 0. And where he can keep it up under things going wrong and duress – keep up his TR 0 with Kipling's \"If,\" you know, \"If you can"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 9 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 738 HPCS keep your head when all pcs about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you...\" [laughs, laughter] So, we actually are moving up into a higher grade requirement, and I think it would be greatly to our interests in all courses that you teach, to the interest of pcs and protection of things, to give a higher level of expectancy. Now, we know what 2-12 is liable to uncork in our faces, well, all right, let's beef up the training drills to match it. And we'll lose less pcs that way. They won't be going out and dropping off the Bridge before somebody hears about it, you know. Funny part of it is the pc usually doesn't fall off the Bridge. We had an interesting... He usually comes back for more auditing even when he's so ARC broke. But the funny part of it is I had a – had a pc today – I had a pc today that was in an ARC break that was just doing a total suppress – was doing a big suppress and was in violent argument with a wrong item and so forth. Little Diana, she's ten. Very amusing. Suzie brought her down to get the item checked mainly so that I could see that a pc at ten would ARC break just as hard on a wrong item as a pc of fifty. I tried to get her to treat it as an oppterm and tried to get the rock slam to turn on and that sort of thing and... For her, she had some pretty nasty things to say about the item and the whole thing. She didn't want that item, see. It was a wrong item on the list. Rock slamming item. It was very interesting to watch this. And also to watch the complete brighten-up that occurred the moment I said, \"Well, all right, that's not your item.\" She brightened right up and was very pleased and went right back upstairs and went on listing and so forth. That was it. It was interesting that you get this same pattern response. The list was not quite long enough to have the right item on it. Well now, if this is going to happen invariable and inevitably, all you've got to do is flub a little bit or be auditing a pc who already has PT problems from some other quarter or is under a little stress or duress, make an accidental Q and A right at the exact moment, they blow their skulls all over the ceiling. It's very interesting then, TR 0 ought to be pretty good. Because bad TR 0 will lead to immediate Q and A, it leads to a lack of comprehension of what is going on – main thing it leads to – and it leads to a pc who is getting no auditing. And it might even lead to an auditor flying down the hall. Now, actually, it's a big win for an auditor sometimes when they confront an ARC break and a lot of insults from the pc and all that sort of thing, to find out they have gotten through it, even though the tears were coming out of their own eyes and they were terribly upset, they were misemotional about the whole thing, but they somehow or other brought it off. They do one or two of those and they get lots of confidence on it. Well, why, should they have to gain all that confidence in the session? Now, it actu-ally takes a certain amount of time to get R2-12 down – actually takes a certain amount of time. The experience of delivery of Routine 2-12 is considerably desirable. You get so that you know more and more about it and feel more and more confident of what you're doing and so forth. But it takes a while. Now, if a person, while learning 2-12, is also learning his TRs, you're liable to have quite a mess on your hands. Now, you can have somebody under guidance auditing 2-10 in"},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 10 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 739 HPCS the co-audit unit, something like that, but they're under such stringent guidance, that some-body's there to pick them up if they drop the ball. They're actually auditing with very little responsibility and frankly they learn only that the technique works or is violent. But before they can independently run 2-12 and so forth, why they ought to have their TRs. And those TRs ought to be matched up to running such a process. And that means that what's expected of TR 0 has to be upgraded. Now, I suppose that part of the training is you get a tape recorder – we're talking about TR 1 now – you see, and you go down to the zoo and throw rocks at the lion until he gets real mad or something like that; or go down on Sunday when he's just seen too many people and get a darn good recording of all of this, don't you see, and then put it on a high volume hi-fi system and have the student stand there putting intention into the middle of the speaker. You see, that would be... You get so that you could insert the auditing command into the pc's skull and get him to comply with it regardless of the volume of sound you were being greeted with. You see, that's another barrier that you'll find necessary. But if you don't handle 2-12, if you don't handle the ARC break, if you don't keep on doing the right action, if you don't carry on with it, boy you got somebody who's splattered all over the room and it just isn't necessary for a pc to get that splattered. Actually, the splattering is in direct proportion to the confront of the auditor. It would-n't be a very bad ARC break if it hadn't been accompanied by a no confront of the situation, a Q and A, don't you see, a drop the ball all over the place. Well, each one of these auditor flubs throws an actual auditing reason for an ARC break in on top of the basic reason for the ARC break and they don't just wrap it around the telephone pole once, you see. They practically put it in around the Telephone pole braided. There it goes. And the degree then of the ARC break the pc will have on Routine 2-12 is directly proportional to the TRs of the auditor. Do you see that? You'll see it borne out if you haven't noticed it up to this time, why, you'll probably see it around. You'll certainly see it around training somebody in an Academy with this or something like that. You'll notice that some-body's TRs are very bad and they have much worse ARC breaks, their pcs ARC break worse. Any pc will ARC break on wrong items and that sort of thing. But of course, the swiftness with which the cause of the ARC break is being handled is only part of it. In actual fact a Q and A on top of the bad Routine 2 flub, blarr, see, and then a mistake on top of that, you see, and blarrrr, and then a decision on the part of the auditor to go back and relist \"Where do cats come from?\" which was eight years ago that it was run, you see. Blaaaaaa! All it is is an incomplete list and it needed another page or something like this, don't you see? Easily remediable, but the auditor is liable to run all the way down to the earli-est beginnings of the case, you see, rather than simply complete the list that was right in front of him. His judgment goes. So, the judgment of the auditor must be good in this particular spot and if his TRs are bad, his judgment is going to be bad. Do you see what you're dealing with here? I've often noticed that I... a perfect \"auditor\" as long as everything was all right. Somebody is a perfect auditor as long as everything was all right. But the moment the least little thing went wrong, that auditor suddenly became one of the world's worst auditors to a"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"TR 0 LECTURE 11 SHSBC-260 – 16.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 740 HPCS point of just sitting there, uhhhh. Finally the pc, you know, shake him, you know, tell him he needs a session. Well, now those are the modern purposes of TR 0 and I think that all of your training in this direction couldn't be better than matched up against the necessities of Routine 2 at this particular time, because it will make Routine 2 that much easier on one and all, including the auditor. If his TRs are almost perfect, you know, he'll never have to use them. It's something like the fellow who walks out every night, he's got a gun and he never runs into any trouble. And one night he doesn't have a gun and everybody jumps him. See, this kind of an action. If his TRs are weak, why, he's got no gun. But he'll get very severe ARC breaks and you can trace back the pc – the severely ARC breaking pc – to the non-confront and the Q and A and the out-TRs in general of the auditor. The worse these TRs are, the harder the pc will ARC break, and the first that goes out is TR 0. Okay? Thank you very much. Good night. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 742 HPCS TV DEMO: TR 0 DEMONSTRATION A TR demonstration given on 16 January 1963 LRH: This is Ron and we're going to do a series of demonstrations tonight of TR 0. And these demonstrations are made with the coach, who is a senior student, and a stu-dent in the thing is the newcomer. Now, your attention is put on this because the teaching of TR 0 is quite important. It's the number of TR 1, 2, 3 and 4 that a person does, actually, which makes his au-diting presence. And it's the best way we've ever found to make auditing presence and so this is the way we make auditing presence. And you should get used to these because you will be taking back to your area a good concept of what the TRs are all about. We'll – probably at a later date we'll work hard on the CCHs so that we can give you those as well. The essence of TR 0 is to teach a natural confrontingness. You go into an Academy where new students are first beginning to audit and you will see a tremendous stiff-ness, a fantastic stiffness. Now, actually, it goes this way: They go into the co-audit and they are not so stiff, they don't seem to be so stiff. They seem to be more re-laxed. But, nevertheless, you will see them sort of lose their grip on their confront because it isn't indoctrinated into them. And it's like golf. Very often a brand-new golfer goes out, picks up some golf clubs and away he goes and he starts making holes in one and so forth. And then he, all of a sudden, cracks up and he's totally incapable of striking a single stroke; it's not possible. And from that point on he has to be taught. And for quite a little time then he's a complete duffer. He's become self-conscious about his grip, he's become, oh, all kinds of mechanisms he's learned and all this sort of thing. Well, actually, our present TRs are calculated to bring a person up through this with the greatest possible rapidity. Now, the basis of the TR is simply to get the person to sit there and confront. You ordinarily find out he confronts with something. He's confronting with his belly, he's confronting with his nose, he's confronting with his hands, he's doing every-thing else."},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"TV DEMO: TR 0 DEMONSTRATION 2 SHSBC-259 – 19.1.63 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 743 HPCS A little bit later stage, why, you've got him confronting with a professional attitude and an interested attitude and, other things of this character.

No. 147 PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR'S BULLETIN The Oldest Continuous Publication in Dianetics and Scientology From L. RON HUBBARD Via Hubbard Communications Office 35/37 Fitzroy Street, London W.1 _____________________________________________________________________ l November 1958 COMMUNICATION COURSE I want to welcome you to the Communication Course. It seems that a Communication Course is necessary as the first step to an auditor. And if an auditor doesn't successfully pass the Communication Course, then to the end of any curve he has as an auditor, there will be something wrong with his auditing. It is very odd that one of the highest levels of indoctrination, Tone 40 on an Object, is most often unsuccessfully approached by a student at the HPA or HCA level when he has flunked the one I am going to talk about right now, which is a newcomer's first look inside the Academy at communication. And that is Dear Alice, part A. It would have amused you the other day to have found a former Director of Training of an organization being sent back by the HCO Board of Review coach in his coaching to Dear Alice so that he could get good enough to pass Tone 40 on an Object. But it was abso-lutely necessary that this happen, because he had for some reason or another, being an old-timer and having been in it for a long time, never hit Dear Alice. It had been omitted from his training. In spite of all the auditing he had done and all the experience he had had, at the end of this time we find him sitting up in the coaching room, good as gold, perfectly comprehen-sible, doing Dear Alice, part A – a man who has probably audited two or three thousand hours' worth. But everywhere he had difficulty with a preclear, that difficulty stemmed from an inability to do Dear Alice, part A, which is in effect to deliver an auditing command in a unit of time as a completed cycle of action – he delivered an auditing command. Well now you have to get up to step 2 and even step 3 before you can call it a full cy-cle of action. But as far as the auditor is concerned in Dear Alice, part A, only, his job is done when he has delivered an auditing command to a preclear. He didn't deliver it over the hills and far away or to the window; he delivered it to a being and he delivered it from where he was to where the preclear was – and it's so easy."},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION COURSE 2 PAB 147 – 1.11.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 777 HPCS Anyone to whom this was described briefly, insufficiently, out in the street would, flunking it at the same time, tell you, \"Of course I can communicate to people! Well, yes! There's nothing to it. I'm a salesman, you know. I run the Atomic Energy Omission. I'm a big man! Of course I communicate to anyone.\" We look in that man's vicinity and nobody's heard anything he's said since the days of Noah's Ark. He never said it to anybody in the first place. He sort of throws things out, you know, and he just hopes they land. Well, that's what passes for communication, and it isn't by a long ways-he throws out a statement of some sort or an-other and he thinks he's communicating with somebody. It's a great oddity, but I must confess to you at this moment that the third dynamic is simply an agreement. It is an agreement which people have agreed to and therefore it has an existence and we certainly cannot live in this world without it, but it's a violation of the com-munication formula. A violation of it. The only thing that you can talk to in the final analysis is a living being, and all third dynamics are composed of individual dynamics. And you can summate them and you can say this is a third dynamic, and that is the agreement on which we go, and it is quite factual and they are quite actual unless we stress them with the communica-tion formula – so that you don't talk to all preclears, you talk to a preclear. There was a fellow by the name of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that never talked to the nation – he never talked to the nation – he talked to an individual citizen. And therefore he communicated. There was another fellow who spoke the most beautiful English I have ever heard, al-most incomprehensibly parsed. Perfect. Would have passed any Oxford English Professor's most critical look, and that was Herbert Hoover. And I don't think Herbert Hoover ever said hello to a dog. I don't think in his whole life he ever said anything to anybody anywhere. And when this man uttered pronunciamentos they pronounced nothing to anybody anywhere. And therefore he couldn't lead a nation out of a depression. He couldn't lead anything for an excel-lent reason. He had no concept in the final analysis of talking to an individual, of getting his communication to land right there. Now this is a touchy point that I open up. You say, \"Well, how about you, Ron? You talk to an awful lot of people.\" Well, that's the whole secret of Scientology-I don't talk to an awful lot of people – I talk to you. I haven't any concept of a large multitude that reads my books or listens to my lectures. I can get a multiple concept of talking to a great many at the same time by talking to every one of them individually. Therefore I perhaps add a little con-ceit to the line, but I do communicate. Therefore someone wanting to know how to speak to a crowd would first begin with Dear Alice, part A. So it is very, very far from an unimportant step. It is not just the entrance step that you have to get through to get your Communication Course over so you can really learn something. That is not what it is. It is the first door that opens and that door opens when it opens, and it opens when you can communicate a statement from you to a person. We won't worry about a preclear, because really the person in dummy auditing who is sitting there as preclear is really a coach, you know. But you've got to get something across from you to that person. And it has to be from you to that person – it has to be a communication. And when you can do that, well, you're all set."},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION COURSE 3 PAB 147 – 1.11.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 778 HPCS I once told somebody that if he had a very difficult student – not you – but if he had a very very difficult student, the thing to do with this difficult student would be to put him through seven weeks of dummy auditing and then teach him in the last week to remedy hav-ingness and turn him loose with a certificate and it would be a safe investment. We would be perfectly safe in doing that. But to give him one week when he needed two or three on dummy auditing and then try to cram him full of data and hope that the processes would carry him through somehow didn't make an auditor, it made a liability – both to himself and to pre-clears. So this first step is not just an easy one – it is the toughest step you'll perform in Scien-tology and that's why it's right at the beginning. It's to say something to somebody with the full confidence that they will receive it. And that's quite a trick. All right. How exactly is this done? We give a person a book. The book is Alice in Wonderland. Why Alice in Wonderland? Well, that's just because it is. No further signifi-cance. We give him this book and he is supposed to find any sentence in that book that he cares to find. (These people who just want to read the book consecutively to the preclear are not doing dummy auditing. They again are not in communication with the preclear.) He is supposed to find a line. Now he doesn't put \"Alice said\" or \"The Queen said\" or something like that on the line. He just puts the statement itself, you see. \"Why do they run so fast?\" Well the book says, \" 'Why do they run so fast?' the Queen asked.\" Well we don't use \"the Queen asked.\" We just say, \"Why do they run so fast?\" All right, he picks that up out of the book. Why out of a book? Why not out of his head? Oh, remember. Remember something – in using the English language, you are not us-ing your own ideas, you did not invent the words. You only helped invent the words that compose the English language. You are already using somebody else's ideas. Now there is nothing wrong with your composing these into new ideas of your own, but remember you are already using somebody else's ideas when you're speaking English. All right. Now let's get it a little bit further. We are given a set pat process. Oh I know I dreamed it up, I found it one way or the other, but an awful lot of auditors worked with this. It's had a lot of looking at, and it's become phrased in a certain way, and that certain way might very well be taken by you out of the textbook and given to the preclear, and it won't ever work if you do. \"Do fishes swim?\" is not a therapeutic procedure – it's not. The repetition of it can be very good for an auditor, but it's not a therapeutic procedure. But the statement \"Do fishes swim?\" is not yours really, at the beginning, is it? You got it from the instructor or off of a book, and then you used it. Well when does it become yours? Well, any idea is yours that you make yours. We won't go along with dialectic materialism and say that no ideas are new, because that's not true. There can be new ideas. But if you get an idea from someone else, it is not still their idea. It's your idea. There is nothing wrong with mis-owning ideas, there's no mass in them to get you confused. You take an idea out of a book, it becomes your idea, and then as your idea you relay it to the preclear. And that is all there is to it. It is coached this way. It is not from the book to the preclear. It is from the book to the auditor, and then the auditor, making it his own idea, expresses that idea to the preclear in such a way that it arrives at the preclear. So it's from the"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"COMMUNICATION COURSE 4 PAB 147 – 1.11.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 779 HPCS auditor to the preclear. But we give him the book as the third via because most of the material he is going to handle in communication is from a source outside himself. You've just got to get used to the idea that there is nothing wrong with using another person's ideas. I always know what someone's state of learning is in Scientology when they speak of Scientology as \"your\" ideas. They say, \"I've been reading your ideas.\" I know at once this person can't communicate. It's a great oddity. It's quite wonderful. Because they reveal at once that they cannot take this first basic step of taking an idea and then communicating it to someone else. They are standing back looking at the world in some large sense and they are not any part of it, because they can't own any of the world's ideas. If they can't own any of the world's ideas, then they won't own any of the world, because the easiest thing to own is an idea. No mass to impede it. So, we coach just exactly in this way. We want the person to find a phrase in Alice in Wonderland and then, taking that as his own idea, communicate it directly to the preclear and he can say it over and over, the same phrase if he wishes, in any way he wishes to say it, until the preclear (who is really a coach) tells him that he thinks it has arrived. Now sometimes the preclear, the first day, feels just a little bit strange about these communication lines, too, and sometimes has his entire criticism based upon the erudition, the pronunciation, the way the auditor holds his little finger while he announces the phrase – this has nothing to do with it. It is the intention that communicates, not the words. And when you have the intention to communicate to the preclear, and that intention goes across, it will ar-rive. If you broadcast that intention, no matter if you're saying it in Chinese, if you're a Scien-tologist, it will arrive. One of the steps of the much higher indoctrination level, Tone 40 8-C, consists en-tirely and completely of saying things in funny voice tones while one is communicating an intention – using very odd voice tones; well, this is not part of Dear Alice. The voice tones are unimportant; pronunciation is unimportant. It's whether or not the person could take that idea out of that book, own it, and then communicate it. And the intention must communicate. And it must be communicated in one unit of time. That is to say, it isn't repeated from the last time it was repeated. It is new, fresh, communicated in present time. The fifty-fifth command of \"Do fishes swim?\" is the fifty-fifth, not the first repeated. So we have one unit of time, one command, and the intention. And when we have those things relayed across, then he can find another phrase and communicate that. And that is the way we do that, and I hope you find it helps communication. L.

Ron would listen to these and make invaluable corrective comments. The stress of course was on TRs and session presence. The Interne, after listening to LRH model auditing tapes, and correcting the outnesses noted in his own taped session, would tape another session and submit it. And so on until Flag standards were attained, at which time the Interne passed on his TRs with an LRH OK. Needless to say, Ron sets a very high standard and the results achieved from this pro-gram once again highlight the datum, \"Do what Ron says!\". The following advices and corrections were aimed at particular TR outnesses heard in the taped sessions of specific Internes. They are quoted here exactly as Ron wrote them. Lis-ten to a few LRH model sessions and you'll really hear what perfect auditing sounds like. Interne A: \"Your tone is okay. Your diction needs some work. You tend to muffle at times and words are not clear. LRH\" And after another taped session, \"You are running so dully that the pc is fogged out. Could even be running things that don't read. But TRs are too dull. LRH\" Interne B: This Interne indicated by her C/S comments that she really didn't understand what was going on with the pc. LRH commented in the next C/S: \"...certainty of auditing affects TRs. One doesn't have good TRs on a case he doesn't dig. And lack of such knowledge makes one think he is losing when he isn't...

The Auditor is tense. Pc keeps talking after ack. This 'afraid he'd ARC Break the pc' is actually TR 0. Have this Auditor listen to some of my demo tapes. TR 3 is supposed to be a newly originated TR 1, not a mechanical action. He is not doing badly. But there is no reason why a really good job of training can't be done. If he's this tense or anxious, if his zero is not natural and easy and if TR 1, 3 are out then it falls back to an uneasy 2 and pc not under control. Clear also definition of 'in-session'. He is still trying too hard. Perfect auditing sounds as natural as rain while be-ing as disciplined as a Prussian drill master. Love R.\" And finally, \"Excellent. 1000 percent improved.

Imagine my making one on the Comm Formula after all these years. Do people ever explain to you long after you have understood? Do people get cross with you when they are trying to tell you something? If so, you are suffering from Premature Acknowledgement. Like body odor and bad breath, it is not conducive to social happiness. But you don't use Lifebuoy soap or Listerine to cure it, you use a proper comm formula. When you \"coax\" a person to talk after he has begun with a nod or a low \"yes\" you ack, make him forget, then make him believe you haven't got it and then make him tell you at great length. He feels bad and doesn't cognite and may ARC Break. Try it out. Have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he has completely told you all. That's why pcs Itsa on and on and on and on with no gain. The auditor prematurely acknowledged. That's why pcs get cross \"for no reason\". The auditor has prematurely and unwittingly acknowledged. That's why one feels dull when talking to certain people. They prematurely acknowledge. That's why one thinks another is stupid – that person prematurely acknowledges. The quickest way to become a social pariah (dog) is to prematurely acknowledge. One can do it in many ways. The quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greater length.

Position: Coach and Auditor seated across a table from each other. Commands: \"Do birds fly?\" or \"Do fish swim?\" Training Stress: The Auditor is coached to do Rapid TR 2 to a point just short of a chop, and helping him to develop a more relaxed acceptance, less concern as an Auditor and removing any fear of chopping comm. The Coach has the Auditor do Rapid TR 2, flunking for all comm lags, hesitation, actual comm chop, evidence of out earlier TRs. Faulty OT TR 0 and TR 0 lead to outnesses in other TRs. A coach who does not spot this and lets his student flounder on endlessly himself naturally also has out earlier TRs, so should be put through the same drill. Coach should get the Auditor to find and handle any misunderstoods if he has undue difficulty with the drill.

Ron Hubbard Dummy Auditing, Step Two, Acknowledgment, is the second part of the communica-tion cycle. Now the actual fact is when you have gotten a thought over to a preclear it is cus-tomary to prove it. The whole stress of acknowledgment is entirely and completely upon mak-ing sure that the preclear receives the auditor's acknowledgment. That is the entire stress. Now why all this stress on acknowledgment? Well, acknowledgment is a control fac-tor – I'll just let you in on a secret right here at the beginning. If you acknowledge a preclear well, you will have the preclear under much better control. Now, why? The formula of control is Start, Change and Stop. And that's just it – an acknowledgment is Stop. If you said to him \"Keep going\" or \"Keep talking,\" you would not be acknowledging him. The perfect acknowl-edgment communicates only this: I have heard your communication. That's all there is to it – I have heard what you said. It signalizes that the preclear's (or person's, since Scientology ap-plies to life, not just to an auditing room) communication to you has been received. But when you use it as an auditor you use it also as a control factor. And it says this: Your communica-tion has been received – and that is all there is to it, and that is the end of that cycle of action, thank you. That's what it says, and you have to put that whole intention into a \"Yes\" or an \"Okay\" or anything else you use. It isn't the word, it's the intention that ends it. Your commu-nication has been received and I have now decided to stop that cycle of communication and your communication is therefore under my control. Those things which you stop, very crudely, are things which you control. You have to be able to stop things if you control them. If you cannot control a preclear's communication line you can't control the preclear. I'll give you an example of this. Let's say we're auditing Mrs. Gotrocks, the wife of the executive manager of Fleabite Dustpowder or something, and she is bored (the only thing wrong with her), and she's crazy (that's the only other thing wrong with her), and she never had anything to do, and she's just been Lying around, and she has ailments. She comes into"},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITINGSTEP TWO: 2 PAB 149 – 1.12.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 799 HPCS the auditing room and she starts to talk to you. She says, \"Oh, I've been to this specialist and that specialist and it cost this much money and that much money and I've been here and I've been there and what's really wrong with me and what you really should take up is so and so rah rah rah...\" It's none of your business. The longer you let such a person talk, the less hav-ingness they have. You can watch them go straight down the ARC tone scale if you keep on letting them talk. Obsessive communication – obsessive outflow. And the first major use that you will make of this, the first time you really understand what this acknowledgment is all about, is when somebody starts this on you and starts talking, talking, talking, talking, and you want to get a session started, and you get the intention real good and you say to them, \"Good.\" And they stop talking. Your intention was such that they knew that you had received their communication. And if you can do this very well, if you can get that acknowledgment just right and if it does exactly what it is supposed to do, very often the person will look at you fixedly and say, \"You know, I don't think anybody has ever heard me before.\" Why is this person talking obsessively? They are trying to make up in quantity what they lack in audience. There's nobody listening to them. They are not talking to anyone. And you all of a sudden come up with an acknowledgment and say, \"Hey! I heard you. I heard that. You have communicated to me, and that's it, now.\" And they say, \"Wow. I don't think I've ever talked to anybody before.\" It's quite amazing. I have seen an auditor on an obsessive outflow case get down in front of the preclear, fix him with an eye, move his finger back and forth just in front of the preclear's nose and say, \"Good; I heard that,\" and have the preclear all of a sudden say, \"Ooooh. Geeeeee. You are there, aren't you!\" So a good acknowledgment can actually wind up the entire goal of the process and find the auditor – that's how important it is. Now, that is a specialized use, stopping a compulsive outflow. Its general use is put-ting a period to the communication cycle. It ends the moment of time in which you gave the command you learned how to give, we hope, in Dear Alice, part A. You said something, the preclear heard it, and we understood then that the preclear had heard it, and we said, \"Good.\" Now the exact way Dear Alice, part B (which is Dummy Auditing, Step Two), is done is this. The coach – or a person acting as a preclear – takes Alice in Wonderland and reads random phrases out of it. And, reading the phrase in any old way, we don't care how (we're not disci-plining the preclear, you know; we never do that, we merely control them within an inch of their lives), in this particular case this person says something out of Alice in Wonderland and the auditor has to say, \"Good,\" \"Fine,\" \"Okay,\" \"I heard that,\" anything – in such a way as actually to convince the person who is sitting there acting as the preclear that he has heard it. Now there is a specific way to do this. That is to intend that the communication cycle ends at that point and to end it there. Anything that you do to make that come about is, of course, legitimate, unless it utterly destroys ARC. But it finishes a cycle of communication. So what could the auditor in this case do? You see, there sits the auditor, no book; there sits the preclear with a book; and the preclear is reading, \"And the Mad Hatter dipped his watch into the teapot,\" and the auditor says, \"Good.\" But that ends that, you see. Now, in view of the fact that the preclear is reading a continued story which goes on sentence after sentence after sentence, the auditor will have a tendency to treat this as \"in passing,\" and that is not an ac-knowledgment. The auditor could say, \"Well, read some more.\" That's not an acknowledg-"},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITINGSTEP TWO: 3 PAB 149 – 1.12.58 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 800 HPCS ment – it didn't stop it, did it? \"Continue, go ahead\" – no, that's not an acknowledgment at all. An acknowledgment says, \"Stop\" – \"Whoa\" – \"Air brakes\" – \"Period\" – \"End\" – \"Heard you\" – \"You've communicated\" – \"That's the end of that moment of time\" – \"Final cycle\" – \"That's it\" – \"You've had it.\" You get that? So the auditor has to say \"Good,\" \"Fine,\" \"Okay,\" in such a way as to receive the communication in the preclear's eyes. The preclear has to know that the auditor has received the communication, and that's the only point on which they are coached – at first. Then we could start to bear down and say, as an instructor, \"Well, did you acknowl-edge that preclear's communication? Did you?\" And the auditor says, \"Well, uhh...\" \"Did you do a perfect acknowledgment?\" \"Well – certainly.\" And the answer to that would be \"No.\" The preclear is still reading, still got the book in his hands, still going on with it, still sitting in the chair, and he's still not in this universe. What is this all about? What are we actually trying to do? Well, we're not trying to reach the ultimate in an acknowledgment because that would be the end of the universe. If somebody could say \"Yes,\" \"Good,\" or \"Okay\" with enough intention behind it, all communi-cations of this universe from the moment of its beginning would then be acknowledged, to-tally. (Except that this would violate the communication formula because they weren't all ad-dressed to him, although lots of people think they were.) But what does the auditor actually feel called upon to do? Well, he feels called upon to put a period to that cycle of communica-tion. It actually started, you see, with the auditor's phrase to the preclear, then the preclear signified with some kind of wince or grunt or something that it had been heard, and then the auditor says, \"Well, that's the end of that. Good. Fine. That finished that.\" You see? But an acknowledgment ends the cycle of the communication which you read about in Dianetics 1955, and that is the Bill-Joe cycle. \"Good,\" says the auditor. This is fantastic. If you got good enough at this, a traffic cop would drive up and say something to you and you would acknowledge the fact that he had spoken and he would simply get back on his bike or go back to the station house and turn in his badge and retire. You see, that would be the end of that. That would be it. As a matter of fact, it actually staggers people to have an acknowl-edgment come to them – it staggers them, really to get it through. People who are having a hard time, particularly. It's a good thing, and it's very therapeutic for a person to know that he has been acknowledged. I know that you will be around in the local stores, maybe stopping a pedestrian on the street and suddenly looking at him and saying, \"Good\" – acknowledging him. And you will have some fantastic things occur if you do. An acknowledgment is a very, very powerful sixteen-inch gun in the communication formula; and you shouldn't use it spar-ingly, you should use it to end cycles of communication. I hope you learn to do that very, very well.?"},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 802 HPCS HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 1 OCTOBER 1965R REVISED 24 FEBRUARY 1975 Remimeo All Students MUTTER TR Name: Mutter TR.

Ron Hubbard This interesting, interesting dummy auditing step has a villainous and vicious goal. It makes somebody duplicate. 'Way back in 1950 we found out that auditors, in order to be in-teresting, would vary their pattern; and every time the pattern was varied, every time the au-diting command changed, the preclear received a little jolt. There was an upset because of it. A long time ago we would have considered it fairly legitimate for an auditor, using the audit-ing command \"Do fishes swim,\" to say, \"By the way, do finny creatures wiggle in the wa-ter?\" – and next time to say, \"Say! does the funny tribe bathe?\" – and the next time to say, \"What brands of fishes are there that progress from point A to point B in liquid habitats?\" That possibly would have been legitimate then, but we don't do that today. We do a horrible thing. The auditor says, \"Do fishes swim?\" And, just to vary it, he then says, \"Do fishes swim?\" And, just for good wild variation, he then says, \"Do fishes swim?\" This is where we learn why we were so insistent on one command in one moment of time back in Dear Alice, part A, because we don't repeat the first \"Do fishes swim\" another thousand times. No auditing command should ever depend for any of its meaning on any other auditing command ever uttered. Each one exists, theoretically and purely, in its own moment of time and is uttered itself in present time with its own intention. Now this is quite important. Do you know that the basic auditing process of CCH does not work unless each command is in a separate unit of time? If you run it this way, \"Give me your hand – thank you; give me your hand – thank you; give me your hand-thank you,\" it's not very therapeutic and nothing happens to the preclear. Why? Well, we've got a machine which is simply repeating the first \"Give me your hand\" over and over again. We're not say-ing it – there's no intention there. Do you know that if you told somebody to give you his hand with enough intention behind it his body would respond without any via through the"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 2 PAB 150 - 15.12.58 STEP THREE: DUPLICATION PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 805 HPCS thetan? The body doesn't obey the words, the body obeys the intention to extend a hand. Therefore, when you are asked to express an auditing command with the same words over and over and over, each time you must express it in present time as itself with its intention. It isn't just a long duplication of it. Just duplicating something over and over and over is sometimes so trying that people wonder how auditors ever arrive at all. Nobody could sit in a chair and say each time with a new intention, \"Do fishes swim,\" for seventy-five hours. It's beyond hu-man possibility, according to some people. But the trick is that if it's always uttered in present time it could be said for a thousand and seventy-five hours. It's only when it's repeated – only when the first command is repeated over and over and when no new intention arrives – that it becomes very arduous. Only when it goes on to a machine does it become almost impossible to do. Communication is reached by control plus duplication. At first you find that to make each utterance of the command different in its own unit of time you use different voice inflec-tions. But as you come up the line on this you find out that you actually can pattern the same tone and each time have it entirely new. It would be very, very incorrect to teach this, to have the auditor each time duplicate his own voice tones as they were the last time, because that is making an auditing command depend on the last auditing command. We couldn't care less; and, after a while, you couldn't care less, either, what voice tone you're uttering, but each in-tention is new and fresh. The intention is to ask and get an answer to this question, \"Do fishes swim?\" and, each time you utter it, it is uttered newly and in its own area of time. That's really the only stress there is. One command per unit of time. Each command separate, and each command containing the words, quite incidentally, \"Do fishes swim?\" Here we learn a great deal about the duplicative factors of communication. We find out that, in having to duplicate, we think we actually lose some of the communication at first. It's utterly idiotic – how could you possibly maintain ARC and therefore, of course, interest, ask-ing a person over and over again this silly question, \"Do fishes swim?\" Who could do this? Well, interest in communication has everything to do with the intention to be interesting and very little to do with text. Furthermore, it is not the auditor's job to be interesting. Being inter-esting is a part of the communication formula, but to an auditor the least possible part, as far as the preclear is concerned. He's not there to interest and intrigue the preclear. Right away, people think they are. Place two people in chairs facing each other and each one of these two people feels the compulsion to be interesting to the other. That's not auditing, that's being in-teresting, that's being social and so on. So if a person had any difficulty doing Step Three, Do Fishes Swim, the instructor would be perfectly in order if he simply told the person to sit in that chair and told some other student who wasn't doing too well, or just some other student, to sit in the other chair, and told them just to sit there and look at each other without saying a thing or being embarrassed or anything else. Interesting drill, if you think of it. We do have variation, and therefore interest, in the first and second dummy auditing steps; but now we reach this one and it is utterly devoid of interest. We're saying the same thing over and over and over and over. And if a person can't do this he probably has a compulsion to vary, to al-ter-is, to be interesting, and he wouldn't find it easy just to sit in a chair and face another hu-man being and not say a word and not do a thing but just sit there and look at the other human"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 3 PAB 150 - 15.12.58 STEP THREE: DUPLICATION PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 806 HPCS being. And if I were coaching someone that had difficulty in repetition of steps, I would do that for an hour or two that day. All right. It is absolutely necessary that an auditor be able to duplicate. But answer me this: Is a person who is saying something in present time each time really duplicating the last moment of time? He really isn't, is he? And so this duplication that we do in Scientology means only the ability apparently to duplicate while being in present time. The greatest motto of experience and the life we have lived is this: I won 't ever do that again. This is the one thing your mama wanted you to promise. If you did nothing else, if you lived a completely sinful life, why, mama still wanted you to learn by experience; which is to say that when you did something wrong, or did something, you weren't ever to do it again. She hoped perhaps you would eat enough candy to make you so sick that you wouldn't \"wolf' candy again; that you would eat enough ice cream so that ice cream would make you so green that you wouldn't make a pig of yourself over ice cream again; that you would become so em-barrassed and lose so many friends that you would not do that evil thing again, whatever it was you did; and thus learn by experience never to do it again. And this is experience talking. One thing you must understand – that experience teaches you – is never to do anything the second time. This doesn't necessarily mean that all experience is painful, but people who are having a hard time tend to believe that it is; and when they begin to depend upon experience and stand by this lesson of never doing it again, they can no longer duplicate. And what do you know – they can't communicate. Also, their bank jams. All sorts of interesting things occur. All moments become one moment. One moment becomes all moments. Identification occurs all over the place. And just the action of repeating something like \"Do fishes swim?\" as an auditor, with a full intention, has a tendency to unjam the time track. You should know that this is what this step is up against. It is violating all of that hard-won experience that you have accumulated in the last seventy-six trillion years-if you believe an E-Meter, you're seventy-six trillion years old. And all that hard-won experience, all that wonderful, wonderful lot of mess that you got into, added up completely to Never do it again. And so you've been taught not to live, which is what happens when you get experience. And when you can duplicate an auditing command over and over again, you will find out that au-diting does not become a painful experience. A person who can do this well, by the way, never gets restimulated. Why should he – he's not in the moment of time in which the restimu-lation took place. There is a more basic step to this particular one, by the way. This is to pat the wall five times and then distinguish one of the pats from the rest. An instructor can do that on a student with some profit. Pretty soon the student can tell all five pats apart, and when the student can tell them all apart, even though they sounded all the same, he can also duplicate an auditing command in present time all the way. I've broken cases with that one.?"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 808 HPCS HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 25 FEBRUARY 1960 Fran Hldrs HCO Secs Assn Secs Staff Auditors For use in Academies All courses THE MODEL SESSION It has been some time since anything like a proper model session has been released. I have been researching on this for some little time now looking over the proper wording, and although the do's and don'ts could fill a considerable book (and will), the exact form and se-quence of a session and the exact wording of one can now be laid down for formal repetitive command type auditing such as we are doing with O/W and Responsibility and similar proc-esses. I did not previously lay one down because I considered there was wide room for change. I find now that there are certain inevitable phenomena in an auditing session with all preclears, and these mechanisms are handled by using the following set sequences and word-ings. In other languages some paraphrase of the words should be used but the sequences and sense remain the same. There are good reasons back of these exact proceedings but it would take a book to set them all out exactly with examples. In this HCO Bulletin let it suffice that we lay down the form and wordings. TO START A SESSION Adjust and calibrate as needful the E-Meter (don't audit without a meter). Adjust pc's chair (never let him place it. If he does, give it another slight shift as a control point). Wording: \"Is it all right with you if we begin this session now?\" If not, two-way comm it out and repeat. \"All right; Start of session\" (tone forty this). Drop it thoroughly over pc's head. If you have any doubts say \"Has the session started for you?\" If he says \"No\" do it again and better. Emphasize that the session is started. This means in effect that it's now the auditor's ball and that the auditor will exert control from here on out in the session. The instant this happens the Auditor's Code is in full force on the auditor. There are no restrictions on the pc. The auditor's control establishes the pc's behavior as far as possible and the processes pick up the ARC breaks, etc."},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"THE MODEL SESSION 2 HCOB 25.02.60 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 809 HPCS RUDIMENTS Always use rudiments and use them in this order. Use them even with a child. Make a stab at them even with an unconscious person. The rudiments are in this order because the last three parts of rudiments may require some auditing, and if so you have started a session with no goals established, hence goals come first. GOALS: \"What goals would you like to set for this session?\" \"All right, any goals you would like to set for life or livingness?\" Don't challenge or question goals. Take what the pc says. Remember what he said because you will check it at session end. ENVIRONMENT: \"Is it all right to audit in this room?\" If not, two-way comm it until it is all right or run Factual Havingness on the room. \"Look around here and find something you could have.\" AUDITOR CLEARANCE: \"Is it all right if I audit you?\" If not and you get a meter fall, two-way comm it until it doesn't fall or run O/W on the auditor. \"What have you done to me?\" \"What have you withheld from me?\" Until meter doesn't fall. If this is going to be the session process anyway as in a co-audit team, ease it off here. PRESENT TIME PROBLEM: \"Do you have any present time problem?\" If meter falls, run \"Describe the problem to me.\" \"How does it seem now?\" Run this until meter does not fall on the problem and tone arm is below where you started. STARTING A PROCESS: \"Now I would like to run this process on you (name it). What would you say to that?\" Work out the wording by any means briefly or longly. Don't challenge the pc's definition of words. The auditor has reserved the right to change his mind. If it seems that the pc won't be able to handle the announced process the auditor has said only that he would like to run it and may now say \"According to what we have been talking about then it would seem better if I ran (name another process).\" If this is all right with the pc then begin the process. \"Here is the first command.\" (Give it.) Acknowledge it. Carry on with the session. Always audit a process until the tone arm is lower on it than when the process was started. A process even when it isn't flat may stop dropping on the me-ter needle but it will still be able to move the tone arm from time to time. Abolish the idea that a rising needle tells you anything but that the pc is being irresponsible. Dropping needles tell you charge and shifting tone arms tell you increased or decreased responsibility. Things that start the needle rising are of no great use to you except to spot an irresponsibility and you don't use it on the needle you use it on the tone arm.

If the pc seems a bit alert and won't be startled, tell the pc that \"If it's all right with you in a few more commands I am going to end this process.\" Then do so, warning just before the last command \"This is the last command\" and then give it. On all processes which cycle the pc in and out of present time use another wording as follows: \"The next time you come close to present time I am going to end this process.\" Then add before the acknowledgement \"When was that?\" to each pc answer and then acknoweldge. When you get an answer in the last day or two or in the same hour, end it. This is tricky go-ing. Be careful with it. Be smooth. But end it in close to PT. You can always get a pc into PT (when you've been running an engram or some proc-ess that leaves him back on the track) by starting a new process (which has to be started as above): \"Recall something\" \"When was that?\" Acknowledge. This is far, far better than \"Come to present time\" – you of course bridge out of this at the same time you start it. \"We are going to run this only until you are close to present time and then end it!\" REPEATED COMMANDS If a pc dopes off and then says something (not a cognition), or if a pc says something instead of an answer (not a cognition), the auditor understands it, acknowledges it and then says \"I will repeat the auditing command\" and does so. This must not be used as an invalida-tion. If the pc thinks he is answering the command or did answer it then apologize and give him the next one. COGNITIONS If the pc comes up with a cognition (something he suddenly understands or feels) (\"Well what do you know about that?\"), and yet has not answered the command, the auditor does not say, \"I will repeat the auditing command.\" The auditor understands the cognition carefully, then acknowledges it and repeats the command without saying that he is going to. To say, \"I will now repeat the auditing command\" after the pc has come up with a cognition is sometimes invalidative, since it yanks the pc's attention to the auditor, the pc in the interest of the cognition having forgotten the command utterly. KEEP THE PC IN SESSION The definition of in session is: pc interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor.

If you get drops on the meter you have where the pc's mind is fixed. Run him on it, keep him on it until it's flat. Don't distract him. TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SESSION If something goes wrong in the session it's the auditor's fault always. So if people knock or a phone rings, promptly apologize to the pc \"I'm sorry.\" If the disturbance knocked the pc clean out of session handle it as a present time problem as in the rudiments. A RESTLESS OR ARC BREAKY PC Establish the rudiments often and keep the pc from blowing. Never justify errors. Be effective and keep the code. You'll win eventually even with the worst pc if you follow the Auditor's Code and this model session. ENDING A SESSION Always end a session just as you began one – with full rudiments. Therefore, leave time to get it all done, and if you have time to spare then spend more time on end of session Rudiments, particularly havingness. END RUDIMENTS GOALS: \"Do you feel you have made any part of your goals for this session?\" Take this up and take what the pc says. This is a fairly rapid action, not to be prolonged as you will get him into problems from goals and mess it up if you hang around on it. AUDITOR AND ARC BREAKS: \"How do you feel about my auditing in this session?\" If there is the faintest twitch of the needle, add: \"I am going to run some overt/withhold on you so here's the first command.\" \"What have you done to me in this session?\" Acknowledge. \"What have you withheld from me in this session?\" Acknowledge. As soon as you have the needle behaving on the meter ask the pc how it is now, and if it's much better bridge it out: \"I will run a few more commands on this.\" And do so, warn for the last command and give it and then drop it. AUDITING ROOM: \"Look around here and see if you can have anything.\" If the E-Meter flicks about on this, at once start the process Factual Havingness, \"I am going to run a bit of havingness on this.

The auditor can now say \"All right, tell me I am no longer auditing you.\" When the pc does so, that's that. When a session is over it is over and the Auditor's Code is over, but it's poor taste and you'll have a rough time next time if you criticize the pc or what he did or said in the session. WARNINGS Always get the auditing command answered. Never let the pc skip an auditing com-mand. If it isn't answered to the pc's satisfaction, there you are until it is answered. Never let any auditing command go unanswered. With O/W, responsibility or a rough session in general, always run a lot of Havingness at the end of it. Never restart a process the moment it is ended. You may suddenly see it wasn't flat or he wasn't really in pt. Well, that's tough. Get it next time or get him into pt with \"Recall some-thing\", but don't make a bad control example by restarting what you just now ended. In other words, never double bridge, note it down and get it next session. Run at the case reality of the pc so he gets wins. If he ARC broke heavily last session you probably had him in over his or her head, so use an easier process this next time. That terminal is real to the pc that drops on the E-Meter even when he says it's unreal or didn't even know about it. Run things that fall and you will have interested pcs – clean them up on the tone arm once you've begun and you'll have cooperative pcs. Whatever you start do it well no matter how many sessions it takes or how minor it seems to be. Do one thing well on the case and you advance the case. Do one thing poorly and you drop the pc down tone. Two hundred hours on one engram (that's an exaggeration) is bet-ter than one hour each on two hundred engrams. Do it well. It's confidence regained that makes clears, not quantity of stuff run. Run the pc always at cause. If the pc is worn out with having created something in the last few lives or in this pre-sent lifetime, run anything that drops about the creativeness on \"What about a (that terminal) can you confront?\""},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"THE MODEL SESSION 6 HCOB 25.02.60 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 813 HPCS To get the pc over any condition or aberration that he is agonizing to get rid of, find a terminal that adds up to it and run single confront on that terminal. Example: If the pc is sick, the process would be \"What about a sick person could you confront?\" If the person is homo, it's \"What about a homosexual could you confront?\" Just like old-time 8-8008 creative proc-esses and SOP 8, but with terminals and confront. A person going round the bend on an ob-session or a compulsion or a fixation shouldn't be audited on sweetness and light. They are too desperate; run them where the mind is fixated and get their attention freed. Don't run al-ternate confront anymore. It stalls the tone arm. Don't use \"If it's wrong with you then you did it\", or snide \"Well what did you do?\" when the pc is upset. Let him have a motivator or few as you ease him into the groove. But running the motivator and overt one after the other gives little or no gain. The motivator men-tioned is a new overt and stalls the case. The essence of good auditing is smooth confident control. The essence of control is smooth Start Change and Stop. Control is the background music to all overts and responsibil-ity, knowledge and everything else, so let's have a smooth Start Change and Stop in sessions and you'll see it begin to win win win where it limped before. Academies really knock audi-tors into shape so they can. There is no substitute for good pro training. But pro or no it's a smooth session that wins. People that won't control can't audit. So here is the model session and I hope for you brand new gains. Use it thoroughly and by the rote and you'll have no ar-guments. L.

No. 151 PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR'S BULLETIN The Oldest Continuous Publication in Dianetics and Scientology From L. RON HUBBARD Via Hubbard Communications Office 35/37 Fitzroy Street, London W.1 _____________________________________________________________________ 1 January 1959 DUMMY AUDITING STEP FOUR: HANDLING ORIGINATIONS Compiled from the Research Material and Tape Lectures of L. Ron Hubbard The fourth thing an auditor has to do (in that order) is to handle an origin from the pre-clear. It is actually true that when you are handling Tone 40 processes, you do not handle the preclear's originations. But if you will look on the HCA/HPA chart you will find that these Tone 40 processes are in the minority amongst processes, and in all processes not Tone 40 a preclear's originations are handled – remember that. Don't let anybody talk you out of it. If you are handling Tone 40, which is just pure, positive postulating, you, of course, are not worried about anybody's opinion, origin, condition, or anything else – you simply want him to do certain things, and he finds out that his beingness can be controlled and therefore that he can control it. What do we mean by an origin of the preclear? He volunteers something all on his own; and do you know that is a very good index of case – whether the person volunteers anything on his own? An old-time auditor used this as a case index. He said, \"This fellow isn't getting any better. He hasn't offered up anything yet.\" You see, he didn't originate – he didn't origi-nate a communication. Do you know that that is the hardest thing to get an organization to do: to originate a communication? You actually could – work in the direction of getting a preclear to originate a communi-cation, in spite of the fact that you just previously were running him on Tone 40 processes. He originated the communication that his arms and legs felt like they were just going to fall off, and you said, \"Give me your hand – thank you.\" Preclear says, \"My head's coming off now! I know it's going to fall on the floor!\" Auditor: \"Give me your hand – thank you.\" Good Tone 40. But on control of person, the first two processes are Tone 40, but Book Mimicry and the next process up the line from it, Hand Space Mimicry, are not Tone 40, and originations by the preclear are not only handled but encouraged."},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 2 PAB 151 - 1.1.59 STEP FOUR: HANDLING ORIGINATIONS PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 815 HPCS So remember that we have not lost out of the galaxy of processes the fact that the pre-clear is as well as he can originate a communication. That means he can stand at Cause on the communication formula. And that is a desirable point for him to reach. You see, in controlling people we are really only showing them that they can be controlled, that it is possible for their possessions to be controlled. And then they eventually decide that these are controllable and that people are controllable and that things are controllable and their bodies are controllable, and they say, \"Wonderful! Look, I'll try!\" And before that they didn't even try. So we are controlling a person's possessions or body only until this person then himself decides to take a hand in it, too. And then he finds out that control is possible. But most peo-ple don't originate. Circuits originate, computers originate, compulsive outflows originate. And when you first start to use Tone 40 on a person you will apparently see originations – but they are not originations, they are restimulations being dramatized. There is a big difference between a restimulation being dramatized and an origination. It's whether or not the thetan said it. Did he say it, or was it just a circuit starting up? Well, you can start up circuits and actually throw them into being and you will see that these are not originations. But when an origination appears in anything but a Tone 40 process, you handle it. And you must handle it well and conclusively. There are preclears who have had astonishing things happen to them, who have tried to communicate them to the auditor, who have failed to do so and have then sunk into apathy and just gone right on out of session because their com-munication origination was not handled properly by the auditor. There are instances of this, and many of them. Tone 40 processes do not particularly violate this. An understanding of what they are takes place rather rapidly with the preclear and he doesn't expect you to. But if he has graduated into being a human being and he's getting up there and he originates some-thing and you answer it, now he's liable to say the most astonishing things to you. And if you don't handle them he's liable to drop into apathy about the whole thing. So you must handle them well because they're always unexpected. I would say that un-expectedness actually should be part of the definition of an origination, because they are quite often completely off the subject, they take you completely by surprise, they are apparently not at all what you expected him to say. The fellow says, \"Huh! I'm eight feet back of my head!\" Well, what do you do? In the old days, we might have gone right onto Route One, but we don't today – we handle the origination. (By the way, this used to be an old technical phrase, \"He Q-and-A'd.\" In other words, he did what the preclear did. Any time the preclear changed, the auditor changed. That is the deadliest crime in auditing. The preclear changes because he is being processed and the auditor changes the process. Q-and-A – the preclear changed, the auditor changed. Well, that isn't what you do.) He says, \"You know, the whole back of my head feels like it's on fire.\" Once upon a time we might have handled this. We might have gone right in there and said, \"Oh, that's very good.\" We had finally gotten a somatic on this fellow and we would have handled it in some fashion or other and questioned him about it and audited it, and so on. But we found out that this stuck people on the time track. Therefore, we do not do that any more. So what do we do when he says, \"The back of my head is on fire!\" – do we ignore it? Well, if we are running Tone 40 processes, we ignore it. But if we are auditing any other process, of which there are many in CCH, we handle the origin. And an auditor who has not been trained to do this will often find himself very embarrassed."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 3 PAB 151 - 1.1.59 STEP FOUR: HANDLING ORIGINATIONS PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 816 HPCS But how about in the walk-away world – the world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly, or noisily, as the case may be? Do you ever have to handle an origin in it? Well, I dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not han-dle an origin. Every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody, you can trace it back along the line you didn't handle. If a person walks in and says, \"Whee! I've just passed with the highest mark in the whole school,\" and you say, \"I'm awfully hungry, shouldn't we go out and eat?\" – you'll find yourself in a fight. He feels ignored. He originated a communication to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid. Most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents don't handle their originations properly. Handling an origina-tion merely tells the person, \"All right, I heard it, you're there.\" You might say it is a form of acknowledgment, but it's not; it is the communication formula in reverse. But the auditor is still in control if he handles the origin – otherwise, the communication formula goes out of his control and he is at effect point, no longer at cause point. An auditor continues at cause point. So let's look this over. The handling of an origin has a great deal of use and, until re-cently, it was the least pat step in Scientology. How did you handle an origin? And we finally found out. I finally had a cognition myself. I tried for a long time to communicate this to peo-ple and they still blundered on it occasionally. And I finally found out something that did seem to communicate. There are three steps in handling an origin. Here is the setup: The preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear, and the auditor is saying, \"Do fishes swim?\" or \"Do birds fly?\" and the preclear says, \"Yes.\" Here is the factor, now, enter-ing: \"Do fishes swim?\" The preclear doesn't answer Do fishes swim, the preclear says, \"You know – your dress is on fire,\" or \"I'm eight feet back of my head,\" or \"Is it true that all cats weigh 1.8 kilograms?\" You see, wog, wog – where did this come from? Well, although it is usually circuitry or something like that at work when it's that far off beam, it is, nevertheless, an origin. How do you handle it? Well, you don't want the preclear to go out of session, and he would if you handled it wrongly, so (1) you answer it; (2) you maintain ARC (you don't spend any time at it, but you just maintain ARC); and (3) you get the preclear back on the process. One, two, three. And if you spend too much time in (2), you'll be doing wrong. What is an origin? All right, he says, \"I'm eight feet back of my head.\" It's an origin; what are you supposed to do with it? Well, you're supposed to answer it. In this particular case, you would say to him something in the order of, \"You are?\" (You mean something like, \"I've heard the communication – it's made an effect on me.\") Now, in maintaining ARC you can skimp that second one if you handle the third one expertly enough. The least important one is the second one, but the most deadly thing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining ARC. That's deadly. But you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one, which is to say, get him back into session. So he says, \"I'm eight feet back of my head,\" and you say, \"YOU ARE???\" (What he said really hit, you know.) He's kind of wog-wog about this – he's not sure what this is all about. You say, \"You are?\" and the fellow says, \"Yes.\" \"Well!\" you say. \"What did I say that made that happen?\""},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 4 PAB 151 - 1.1.59 STEP FOUR: HANDLING ORIGINATIONS PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 817 HPCS \"Oh, you said 'Do birds fly,' and I thought of myself as a bird and I guess that's the way it is, but I am eight feet back of my head.\" \"Well, that's pretty routine,\" you say – reassure him, maintain the ARC. \"Now, what was that auditing question?\" \"Oh, you asked me 'Do birds fly?' \" And you say, \"That's right. Do birds fly?\" Back in session, you see. You can't do this: You can't put it into a can and put a label on it and say This is how you do it always, because it's always something peculiar; but you can say these three steps are followed. I will give you another example. You say, \"Do birds fly?\" and he says, \"I have a blind-ing headache.\" \"You do?\" you say. \"Is it bothering you (that's the ARC) too much to carry on with the session (and you've reached number three at once)?\" \"Oh no – it's pretty bad though.\" \"Well, let's go on with this, shall we?\" you say. \"Maybe it'll do something with it (main-taining ARC).\" He says, \"Well, all right,\" and you're right back onto it again: \"Do birds fly?\" One of the trickiest of these is \"What in my question reminded you of that?\" The fellow says, \"Well, so and so,\" and he explains it to you and you say, \"Well, good. Do birds fly?\" and you're right back in session again. Three parts, and – that is the important thing – you have to learn how to handle these things. At the same time that we are doing this, we can get much more complicated, particularly toward the end of the session, by just trying out a communication bridge. A communication bridge from \"Do birds fly\" to \"Do fishes swim\" and from \"Do fishes swim\" back to \"Do birds fly.\" A communication bridge is a very easy thing. It simply closes off the process you were running, maintains ARC, and opens up the new process on which you are about to embark. If you could look at it as two V's, the points facing each other, with a line between the bottoms of the two V's, you would see that one process, which you have been running, is closed on down to nothing, easily, by gradients. You say, \"How about running this just three or four more times, and then we'll quit – okay?\" We give him warning, you see, that we're closing the process off, and we do run it three or four more times. Then we say, \"How are you doing?\" (We never ask people, by the way, \"How do you feel?\" – this as-ises havingness.) We say, \"How are you doing?\" and he says, \"Oh, not too badly,\" and so on. \"Well, did anything hap-pen there while we were running 'Do fishes swim?' \" And he says, \"I don't know. I got a little bit of reality – I felt like a fish for a couple of moments there.\" Auditor says, \"How do you feel about that?\" and so on. \"Is it okay? Are you doing all right now?\" The preclear says, \"Not too badly.\" You say, \"Well, let's go over onto 'Do birds fly?' It's an interesting process and it"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"DUMMY AUDITING 5 PAB 151 - 1.1.59 STEP FOUR: HANDLING ORIGINATIONS PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 818 HPCS just goes like this – I ask you, 'Do birds fly' and you answer me. How about running that?\" and he says, \"Well all right, okay.\" You establish agreement again and away we go. Actually, it is three contracts in a row. The first contract is: to stop the process we are running; the next contract is: we are in an auditing session, binding this as a continuing auditing session; and the third contract is simply: we have a new process we would like to run, and I want your sig-nature on this dotted line that you will run it. That actually is a communication bridge. The reason we do this is so a preclear will not be startled by change, for if we change too rapidly in a session we stick the preclear in the session every time. We give him some warning; and that is what a communication bridge is for. The handling of origins, however, is most important. Learn how to handle origins, and you'll never be taken by surprise by a preclear. You'll be right in there pitching, and the ses-sion will keep on. I have seen an auditor sit with his mouth open for twenty or thirty seconds after some preclear said something fantastic. He just didn't know what to make of it. Well, you answer it, you maintain ARC, and you get him back in session.?"},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 820 HPCS HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 3 JULY AD 12 Central Orgs Franchise REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING As the Prepchecking we have been doing is a complicated skill and as recent rudiments developments open the door to simplified handling of overts, you may lay aside all versions of previous Prepchecking and Security Checking and substitute the following. This is in the interests of improvement of auditing and keeping pcs from being entur-bulated by unskilled auditing. The version herein is far easier to train students into as it uses the same actions as Repetitive Rudiments. REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING We will still use the term \"Prepchecking\" and do all Prepchecking by repetitive com-mand. We will refer to the older version as \"Prepchecking by the Withhold System\" and abandon it as of this date as too complicated and too susceptible to restimulation of pcs in semi-skilled hands. THE AUDITING PROCEDURE We handle any Zero question exactly as in repetitive rudiments, (HCO Bulletin of July 2, 1962). The session is started exactly as per Model Session, HCO Bulletin June 23, 1962, (or as may be amended). A Mark IV Meter is used (using earlier meters on Prepchecking can mean disaster as they miss withholds). The auditor then announces for the body of the session, that a Prepcheck will be done on such and such a subject or Form. The auditor then takes an already prepared Form (such as Form 35, 6A6, Prepcheck Mid Ruds, Goals Prepcheck Form [not yet released]).   5 Editor’s Note: See HCO PL 22 May 61, “Only Valid Security Check”, Vol. IV, p. 275 6 Editor’s Note: See HCO PL 7 July 61, “HGC Auditors Sec Check”, Vol. IV, p.356"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING 2 HCOB 3.07.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 821 HPCS Step One Without now looking at the Meter, the auditor asks the Form question repetitively until the preclear says that's all, there are no more answers. Step Two The auditor then says, \"I will check that on the meter\" and does so, watching for the Instant Read (HCO Bulletin May 25, 1962). If it reads, the auditor says, \"That reads. What was it?\"7 (and steers the pc's attention by calling each identical read that then occurs). \"There... That... That...\" until the pc spots it in his bank and gives the datum. Step Three The auditor then ignores the meter and repeats Step One above. Then goes to Step Two, etc. Step Four When there is no read on Step Two above, the auditor says, \"Do you agree that that is nul?\" The auditor watches for an Instant Read on this and if there is an Instant Read on it, does Step Two above, then Step Three.8 This gives a double check on the flatness of a question. This is all there is to Repetitive Prepchecking as a system. Anything added in the way of more auditor questions is destructive to the session. Be sure not to Q and A (HCO Bulletin of May 24, 1962). Be sure your TR4 is excellent in that you understand (really, no fake) what the pc is saying and acknowledge it (really, so the pc gets it) and return the pc to session. Nothing is quite as destructive to this type of auditing as bad TR4. THE ZERO QUESTIONS TIME LIMITER There must be a time limit on all Zero questions. Although it says, \"Have you ever sto-len anything?\" the auditor must preface this with a Time Limiter such as \"In this lifetime...\" \"In auditing...\" or whatever applies. Form 3 (the Joburg) has to be prefaced with \"In this life-time...\" on every question. Form 6A, as it speaks of preclears, etc, is already limited in Time.   7 Editor’s note: Note the later datum from HCOB 3 July 71R, “Auditing by lists”: “We do not tell the pc what the meter is doing... We do not say to the pc, ‘That’s clean’ or ‘That reads’.” 8 Editor’s note: revised by HCOB 4 July 62 as per which the auditor should not pay attention to any reaction to the question. As per today’s tech a reading confessional question must be brought to F/N, ref. HCOB 14 March 71R, “F/N everything”."},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING 3 HCOB 3.07.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 822 HPCS In Prepchecking the Middle Ruds, use \"In auditing...\" before each question or other appropriate limitations. The Zero must not swing the pc down the whole track as Middle Rudiments then be-come unanswerable and a fruitful source of missed withholds. MIDDLE RUDIMENTS In Repetitive Prepchecking the Middle Rudiments can be Fast Checked (HCO Bulletin of July 2,1962), (using the package question \"In this session is there anything you have sup-pressed, invalidated, failed to reveal or been careful of?\" If one of the four reads, use it singly to clean it in the same worded question and do the remainder of the Middle Ruds singly: \"In this session is there anything you have failed to reveal?\"). Use the Middle Rudiments Fast Checked every time you clean a Zero Question, whether the pc had answers for it or not. PREPCHECKING THE MIDDLE RUDIMENTS To begin or end a series of sessions (such as an intensive), Prepcheck also the Middle Rudiments. In such Prepchecking the Middle Ruds, for havingness sessions,9 the Zeros are as fol-lows: \"Since I have been auditing you is there anything you have suppressed?\" \"Since I have been auditing you is there anything you have invalidated?\" \"Since I have been auditing you is there anything you have failed to reveal?\" \"Since I have been auditing you is there anything you have been careful of?\" To these standards add, in the same question form, \"suggested\" \"failed to suggest\" \"re-vealed\" \"told any half truths\" \"told any untruths\" \"damaged anyone\" \"influenced the E-Meter\" \"failed to answer a question\" \"failed to answer a command\" and \"Since I have been auditing you have you shifted your attention?\" Flatten off with O/W as below. O/W ASSISTS As a Prepcheck by form and even beginning rudiments are not calculated to handle a pc who is very distraught before the start of session by reason of upsets in life (howling PTPs   9 Editor’s note: “Havingness session”: Mentioned in HCOB 23 June 62 “Modell Session revised.” It says there, “If a pc has a badly behaving needle, do a perfect Model Session on pc for 2 or 3 sessions using Havingness or, better, Prepchecking in the body of the session, and you will see the needle smooth out.” Thus in this text here such a “Havingness session” is meant where one uses Prepchecking instead of Havingness, as opposed to a “normal session” where you would run a major action in the body of the session."},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING 4 HCOB 3.07.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 823 HPCS accompanied by misemotion) or who is too ill physically to settle into auditing, an earlier ru-diment immediately after start of session can be used. This is general O/W (Overt-Withhold): \"What have you done?\" \"What have you withheld?\" These are run alternately. This is never run on a terminal (i.e. What have you done to George? etc). Only the general type command is now used. When the pc is much better, go into the usual rudiments. (Note: This is, by the way, the best repetitive process for an assist.) This is run to a nul needle on both questions. If either gives an Instant Read, continue to run both until both are nul, much as in steps One, Two, Three and Four of Repetitive Prep-checking. When used to flatten off a Prepcheck on the Middle Rudiments, whether for Prep-checking or for goals type or ordinary Repetitive Prepchecking, the O/W command wording is as follows: \"Since I have been auditing you, what have you done?\" \"Since I have been auditing you, what have you withheld?\" Both must be nul to conclude the process. If either is found alive on the needle, run both. When used to begin a session, or when used to Prepcheck the Middle Ruds, O/W must be followed by a Fast Check of the Mid Ruds. SUMMARY This type of Prepchecking – Repetitive Prepchecking – is more easily done and more thorough than Prepchecking by the Withhold System and its earlier forefather Security Check-ing. It replaces both of these. In view of the fact that the same system is used for Repetitive Rudiments (HCO Bulle-tin of July 2, l962), by learning one, the student also learns the other, thus saving a lot of time in study and training. Repetitive Prepchecking replaces former auditing requirements for Class IIa and is the Class II skill. It should be thoroughly instilled in the auditor that extra doingness by the auditor is de-tractive from the system and that every additive is a liability, not required in the system and liable to upset the pc. It is a must that the auditor be very capable with TR4 and that the audi-tor makes no attempt to shut off routine pc originations as the intensity of \"In Sessionness\" generated by modern Model Session used with Repetitive Rudiments and Repetitive Prep-checking is such as to make the ARC breaks quite shattering to the pc if TR4 is bad."},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE PREPCHECKING 5 HCOB 3.07.62 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 824 HPCS If Repetitive Prepchecking is run right, with good metering, the only remaining source of missed withholds is the inadvertent withhold caused by bad TR4. (The pc said it but the auditor didn't understand it.) This bulletin culminates three years of exhaustive research into the formation of Model Session, Rudiments and the handling of overts, and overcoming the limitations of the auditor and student in handling sessions. This, coming with the broad success of Routine 3GA, rounds out auditing from raw meat to clear for all cases capable of speech.

History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, England, in 1956. Number: TR 8 Name: Tone 40 on an Object. Commands: \"Stand up.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Sit down on that chair.\" \"Thank you.\" These are the only commands used. Position: Student sitting in chair facing chair which has on it an ashtray. Coach sitting in chair facing chair occupied by student and chair occupied by ashtray. Purpose: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 commands. To clarify intentions as differ-ent from words. To start student on road to handling objects and people with postulates. To obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands. Training Stress: TR 8 is begun with student holding the ashtray which he manually makes execute the commands he gives. Under the heading of training stress is included the various ways and means of getting the student to achieve the goals of this training step. During the early part of this drill, say in the first coaching session, the student should be coached in the basic parts of the drill, one at a time. First, locate the space which includes himself and the ashtray but not more than that much. Second, have him locate the object in that space. Third, have him command the object in the loudest possible voice he can muster. This is called"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 3 HCOB 7.5.68 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 828 HPCS shouting. The coach's patter would run something like this: \"Locate the space.\" \"Locate the object in that space.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" \"Command it as loudly as you can.\" \"Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.\" That would complete two cycles of action. When shouting is completed, then have student use a normal tone of voice with a lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object. Next, have the student do the drill while using the wrong commands – i.e., saying \"Thank you\" while placing in the object the intention to stand up, etc. Next, have the student do the drill silently, putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of the com-mand or the acknowledgement. The final step in this would be for the coach to say \"Start\" then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of \"Flunk\" and \"That's it\". Here, the coach would attempt to distract the student, using any verbal means he could to knock the student off Tone 40. Physical heckling would not be greater than tapping the student on the knee or shoulder to get his attention. When the student can maintain Tone 40 and get a clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement, the drill is flat. There are other ways to help the student along. The coach occasionally asks, \"Are you willing to be in that ashtray?\" When the student has answered, then, \"Are you willing for a thought to be there instead of you?\" Then continue the drill. The answers are not so important on these two questions as is the fact that the idea is brought to the student's attention. Another question the coach asks the student is, \"Did you really expect that ashtray to comply with that com-mand?\" There is a drill which will greatly increase the student's reality on what an intention is. The coach can use this drill three or four times during the training on Tone 40 on an Object. As follows: \"Think the thought – I am a wild flower.\" \"Good.\" \"Think the thought that you are sitting in a chair.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that thought being in that ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Imagine that ashtray containing that thought in its substance.\" \"Good.\" \"Now get the ashtray thinking that it is an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to go on being an ashtray.\" \"Good.\" \"Get the ashtray intending to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" \"Have the ashtray end that cycle.\" \"Good.\" \"Put in the ashtray the intention to remain where it is.\" \"Good.\" This also helps the student get a reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself. Stress that an intention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice, nor is it depend-ent upon thinking certain words. An intention must be clear and have no counter-intention in it. This training drill, Tone 40 on an Object, usually takes the most time of any drill in Upper Indoc, and time on it is well spent. Objects to be used are ashtrays, preferably heavy, coloured glass ashtrays. History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1957 to train students to use intention when auditing. Number: TR 9 Name: Tone 40 on a Person. Commands: Same as 8-C (Control). Student runs fine, clear-cut intention and verbal orders on coach. Coach tries to break down Tone 40 of student. Coach commands that are valid are:"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"UPPER INDOC TRS 4 HCOB 7.5.68 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 829 HPCS \"Start\" to begin, \"Flunk\" to call attention to student error and that they must return to begin-ning of cycle, and \"That's it\" to take a break or to end the training session. No other statement by coach is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off Tone 40 or in gen-eral be stopped. Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student in manual contact with coach as needed. Purpose: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress or duress. Training Stress: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus a compel-ling, unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed, since each jerk is a stop. Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coach execute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone 40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too little force defi-nitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk. Here the coach should check very carefully on student's ability to place an intention in the coach. This can be checked by the coach since the coach will find himself doing the command almost whether or not he wants to if the stu-dent is really getting the intention across. After the coach is satisfied with the student's ability to get the intention across, the coach should then do all he can to break the student off Tone 40, mainly on the basis of surprise and change of pace. Thus the student will be brought to have a greater tolerance of surprise and a quick recovery from surprise. History: Developed in Washington, D.C., in 1957 by L. Ron Hubbard. Purpose of these four training drills, TR 6, 7, 8 and 9, is to bring about in the student the will-ingness and ability to handle and control other people's bodies, and to cheerfully confront another person while giving that person commands. Also, to maintain a high level of control in any circumstances. L.

High School Indoctrination is given to Staff Auditors and very advanced students after these have long since satisfactorily passed routine Indoctrination. High School Indoctrination, at the moment, consists only of teaching an auditor not to let a preclear stop him. The failure of most sessions is the action of the preclear in going out of session. The preclear goes out of session at any moment when the preclear starts to control the session. When the preclear controls the session he is out of session. Therefore, it is necessary for the preclear not to stop or alter the course of action of an auditor. The moment that a preclear can satisfactorily, to himself, stop the auditor that preclear is out of session and the probability of doing him much good while he is out of session is very remote. In High School Indoctrination the technique 8C, simply having a fellow walk over to the wall and touch it and let go, is followed. The person being indoctrinated or the \"auditor\" starts to use this 8C upon his \"preclear\" who is actually the one doing the High School Indoc-trination. The \"preclear\" does everything in his power to stop, divert, change or alter the in-tention of the auditor. It will be found that such simple things as \"Just a moment, my shoe is untied\" are the best in effecting this stopping. The auditor can be thrown aside into running some other process by announcing to him that a facsimile has just appeared or that one should really use his left hand since one is left-handed. The \"auditor\" in High School Indoctrination loses at any moment when he is made to pause. If he is made to pause or interrupt his session in any way then the session has to be started over again. He has \"lost\". Because High School Indoctrination is rather hard on the Instructor, it is run for only 45 minutes and an exact moment of stopping the session, in actuality, is agreed upon. \"We are going to stop this session now at five o'clock exactly, it now being four-fifteen.\" Then the session is entered and is run for these 45 minutes. To run one longer is sometimes almost fatal on the High School Indoctrinator. Then, for the ensuing hour, the High School Indoctrinator runs the person being indoc-trinated with Stop-C-S. This is to reverse the positions which have been occupied. Therefore, to use High School Indoctrination, it is necessary that a two hour period be free and that the first 45 minutes of it be devoted to High School Indoctrination, a short break"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"HIGH SCHOOL INDOCTRINATION  2  HCOB  4.10.56  PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 833 HPCS be taken, and then auditing of the person being indoctrinated who was, in the first 45 minutes, acting as the \"auditor\" (to be given Stop-C-S by the former \"preclear\"). High School Indoctrination depends for its effectiveness mainly upon the cleverness of the person doing the Indoctrination. He has to be very smooth, very often his most casual ef-forts are the greatest and will be found to be the most effective. The final goal of High School Indoctrination is to have a Staff Auditor or Advanced Auditor who is not capable of being halted by a preclear under any circumstances. Because the person doing the High School Indoctrination always has higher altitude, being higher on Staff or in Scientology, it will be found that the person being indoctrinated is much more likely to become confused during the Indoctrination than he would be in the average session. However, it has been learned that those people who become confused in any way during High School Indoctrination have, in the course of their auditing career, \"blown\" several preclears. It will also be found that they have not achieved very high results in auditing. They were too willing to be stopped, too easily rattled, too easily thrown aside and did not know their subject well enough. Some of the effects which can be made on people undergoing High School Indoctrina-tion are quite startling. They can be made to swear or even cry after being stopped as ardu-ously and viciously as they can be stopped by a person doing the Indoctrination. There is no reason to list the number of commands or dodges or attempted stops which the person doing the Indoctrination can use. It is only necessary to synthesise these if only out of one's own experience with very difficult preclears who would rather have done anything than be audited. It is better to think these up on the spur of the moment than otherwise. Planned dodges can be used where one goes very smoothly through the thing for eight or nine commands without offering the least difficulty or resistance and then suddenly hauls back on the next one and says \"I won't\". This occasionally completely stops a person being indoctri-nated. High School Indoctrination must be given to every Staff Auditor regardless of any former training and it must be given by a person with considerable altitude over that auditor, such as the Director of Processing or the Technical Director of an operation.

Ron Hubbard I am now going to give you the five levels of Indoctrination very rapidly. We already have the five dummy processes which form the first level – the five dummy auditing proc-esses. The second one up the line is 8-C – plain 8-C. It is given without stress on control or anything of the sort. You don't touch or handle the person. It is an old process done this way. The auditing commands of 8-C in this particular instance have suffered change recently be-cause no auditing command must depend upon any other auditing command or it won't be in present time. So each auditing command depends upon itself, and the commands of 8-C are: \"Look at that wall. Thank you.\" \"Walk over to that wall. Thank you.\" \"With your right hand touch that wall. Thank you.\" \"Turn around. Thank you.\" There is no \"let go\" there or other direction. If we have not directed him to do something and he does it, if the way he does some-thing is a little different from what we expected, we really have no basis for objection; and the training stress is only this: to get a person to walk another body than his own around the room. There is nothing to this. It is NOT High School Indoctrination. At this level he must be able to duplicate the command, and it is run to a point where a person does not make a mis-take on the commands and stops feeling nervous about walking a person's body around. That is the training stress. Now we move up to the next level of Indoctrination, which might look like 8-C at the first glance, but is not. This is High School Indoctrination. The commands of High School Indoctrination are the same as those for plain 8-C, but this is entirely and completely a train-ing process and it is only run for this reason: to keep an auditor from being stopped by a pre-clear by devious and diverse statements and actions. The \"preclear\" (we can't really call him a preclear at all, for he is actually the coach) runs on this \"auditor\" anything he can think of to stop him, and the auditor must at no time permit himself even to be halted or falter in any way. He must be able to continue a clear, free-flowing 8-C on this person who is getting down"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"THE FIVE LEVELS OF INDOCTRINATION 2 PAB 152 – 5.01.59 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 841 HPCS on the floor and barking like a dog. He mustn't be permitted to go down on the floor. You let a man get below the level of your shoulders and he is going to get down on the floor – that's for sure. You have to catch him before that. He is going to try not to walk across the room. He is going to try and run across the room. He is going to try and do anything. You told him to walk: walking fast is allowable but running is definitely not allowable. The training stress is entirely upon getting an auditor to persevere against any trick mechanism anybody could think of or react to, or any circuitry or dramatization in 8-C. It is total auditor persistence. We don't ask the auditor to do it smoothly – we only ask him to do it constantly and consistently. That is High School Indoctrination, one of the great steps of Scientology. If we had had this a few years ago, it would have made the world of difference in several cases I can think of. A fellow would sit down in the middle of the floor and he wouldn't do anything. We depended totally on our voices, and these people weren't in communication. The coach in this case has a role to play. He is the preclear. He has two signals, one \"flunk\" and the other \"that's it,\" which are effective. Anything else he says does not count. Of course, he says \"Start\" and they go on with it, but when the coach (who is the final judge) considers that the auditor has blundered, has been stopped, and has waited too long, then the coach says \"Flunk.\" What happens when the coach says \"Flunk\"? They go back to the beginning of the nearest cycle of action of 8-C. They do not take it from where they were, but go back to the beginning. They leave that cycle incomplete. The auditor in this case is not permitted to over-ride a flunk. When the coach says \"That's it,\" he means \"We are through. We are going to take a breather. What I say now counts.\" And that ends it. It doesn't begin again until the coach says \"Start.\" This is 8-C done on a very heavy body contact: the coach being lugged around and do-ing anything he can think of to stop this fellow. It is interesting what will stop some auditors. If you understand your business as a coach, you will understand that it is the soft ones and the unexpected ones that count. It isn't the heavy ones, it isn't the preclear just lying down on the floor and refusing to budge and exerting every muscle and having to be dragged from there on. This is perfectly allowable, but it isn't the one that catches the auditor. It is the subtle un-expected actions that \"flunk\" an auditor. High School Indoctrination is a marvelous training process. Several hours should be spent on this and one shouldn't run it just with one coach but with two or three others as well, because everybody develops his own abreactive pattern. It is a wonderful opportunity to abre-act your insanities. An auditor will very swiftly learn how to stop one preclear, but take two or three more, swapping teams around, and he eventually gets a smooth look at the whole thing. There isn't such a thing as being too tiny to handle too big a preclear. The next level of Indoctrination is Tone 40 on an Object. (Actually all these are groups and a number of techniques of indoctrination could be evolved from each one of these. I am simply giving you those that have to be passed.) In this Tone 40 on an Object you can have a number of commands and variations of one kind or another, but the one we use is this: You take an object – a small doll, ashtray, Coke bottle – and the auditor tells it to \"Sit down in that chair\" or \"Sit on the table\" and thanks it. Then he tells it to \"Stand up,\" and thanks"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"THE FIVE LEVELS OF INDOCTRINATION 3 PAB 152 – 5.01.59 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 842 HPCS it. \"Sit down on the chair\" or \"Sit on the table\" – then the auditor moves it with his own hands. He does all this while the coach is just standing there heckling him, and he has to do it so that his intention is so good that he gets perpetually surprised that the thing, the object, didn't sit down in the chair or sit on the table, or didn't stand up. The furthermost extremity of this would be that the object would do so without any further contact with the auditor than his intention. That point may be reachable – I must tell you that. A person does this until his tone in giving the commands is Tone 40. There are many little drills that come into this. One is to make him put the intention into it and squeak and not say a word at the same time, but put the intention into it and alter his voice all over the place until he finds out that his intention doesn't have anything to do with his voice or tone. He will eventually discover what Tone 40 is. Tone 40 is a positive postulate with no counter-thought – expected, anticipated, or anything else; that is, total control. Actually, today we use the word \"control\" very loosely. What we really mean is \"positive postulation\"; what the world means by control is, if he doesn't do it, shoot him. Not Tone 40, but Tone.4. In order to get Tone 40 on a Person going, you can continue Tone 40 on an Object; but whether this belongs to Tone 40 on a Person or belongs to the last end of Tone 40 on an Ob-ject doesn't much matter. It is not a separate level, but it is a separate command. You give the 8-C commands to an object and lug it around for a little while – i.e., having the object move over and touch the wall, etc. – but that is only getting the person used to these commands in that tone. That is the only reason there is for it. We don't use the 8-C commands to get his drill in because he is going to get heckled. What does the coach do on Tone 40 on an Object? At first he is really helpful and tries to get the auditor to get the intention in there until he can put the intention in without speak-ing. When the fellow is getting too good the coach must remember that this Tone 40 on a Per-son is going to be up against somebody with counter-thought, counter-effort and counter-action of one kind or another and the coach furnishes it. He doesn't do it loudly or obstreper-ously, but he does furnish it. \"Is that Tone 40? Are you absolutely sure that was Tone 40? What do you mean by Tone 40?\" etc. – this is when the coach isn't being helpful. The coach is supposed to furnish randomity as a substitute for the randomity of the environment. The per-son can do this in spite of the fact that something or somebody is resisting him, heckling him and messing him up. You could go much further with this. As I say, one can go much further with each one of the five levels of Indoctrination, but I don't advise it. On Tone 40 on a Person, we do 8-C at Tone 40 and that is a total, accurate estimation of effort, with no halts or jagged motions – that is, smooth. Your estimation of effort must be absolutely perfect; your estimation of intention must also be perfect – which is sometimes rather hard on a coach because somebody can get so good that a coach's body starts to walk around and obey the commands rather easily and you find almost all coaches on Tone 40 on a Person are much more docile than on High School Indoc. They really want to be rougher but the technique is rather overweighing this, is too strong. Those are the five levels of Indoctrination and they are only doing this: placing an auditor into a frame of mind and an ability where his postulates can be positive and his com-mand is no longer diffident, where he can control and handle somebody, where he can assume"},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"THE FIVE LEVELS OF INDOCTRINATION 4 PAB 152 – 5.01.59 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 843 HPCS the attitude that is necessary to an auditor.

You're just trying to stick me in my head, because you're a Black Five yourself. All my theta perceptics just turned off! What do you do then? Well, here comes the United States Cavalry to the aid of the stopped, badgered, and harassed auditor. It's called High School Indoctrina-tion. And it should never happen to homo sapiens; he'd never survive it. Auditors, fortunately, are sterner stuff than homo sap. They come out of it, bright as a dollar, crying, \"Bring on the lions!\" Here's how it goes. An instructor, who will act as preclear, leads a student-auditor to a large, secluded room. As soon as the words, \"Start of session\" are out of his mouth, the in-structor-preclear may drop to the floor in a dead faint, burst into a wild grief charge, bolt for the - 315 - door, or balk like a donkey with a glazed, blank stare. Or perhaps he may just stroke the student-auditor's hair, murmuring, \"You're awfully cute, really. Why don't we drop this pretense ...\" Whatever the instructor-preclear elects to do by way of randomity. If the stu-dent-auditor bogs utterly, a soft-hearted instructor-preclear might say, \"End of session,\" and give him a couple of tips. Tougher instructor-preclears frown on this, and believe in letting the student-auditor work his own way out of the situation, though he plow through 76,000,000,000,000 years of track, year by year, to accomplish it. The instructor-preclear may run from manic enthusiasm to deepest apathy in a fraction of a second, and if the student-auditor doesn't instantly detect the change in «case level,» and handle it properly, he will be hearing from the instructor-preclear. One of the more unsettling things the instructor-preclear does is to behave like a nice, sane, high-toned preclear for min-utes at a stretch. The student-auditor knows this state of affairs can't last for long. He will get thoroughly tensed up, expecting from instant to instant the next horrid outburst. It's like marching a lighted firecracker around the room. When the strain becomes obvious, the in-structor-preclear will say, \"End of session.\" And he may say, \"What are you all tensed up for? Relax. Start of session.\" Three seconds later, he's throwing an epileptic fit on the floor, com-plete with froth. There is a second step of High School Indoc which is run seated. By this time the stu-dent-auditor has a fair certainty that he can cope with a preclear's going out of control on a general physical level. The seated form takes a more insidious turn.

RON HUBBARD CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF S.C.S. (Edited from L. Ron Hubbard's 18th ACC lecture No. 6, dated July 22, 1957) The word control has a nasty connotation due to the bad 8-C parents and society ad-ministers upon its individuals. That is because the word control evokes moments when we were beaten down into apathy or given such conflicting commands to obey that we henceforth shudder away from any mention of the word. But in Scientology we have given it a new meaning by adding Tone 40, which makes this control exact and allows the completion of a cycle of action which bad control never considered. Also it does not dramatize the lower emo-tions of the tone scale. An individual who has been made to resist control winds up allergic to control and if he is allergic to it he dies because there isn't anything one can do with anything except in one way or another to view or control it. If a flow flows too long in one direction it has a tendency to dam up and fix itself. It is only necessary to reverse that to unfix the situation. We go back into \"Scientology: 8-80\" on two-way flows and we understand what is happening. When you get a person to get the idea of flowing something out away from him, he will suddenly go anaten. But it is only necessary for him to make something flow the other way toward him for a short while (just a mental idea of flowing in) for him to wake up immediately. If you have somebody who is putting"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 2 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 849 HPCS mockups out in front of him and he starts to go unconscious you only need to have him put them in back of him and the unconsciousness disappears. A thetan who is totally devoted to controlling things and who is not himself in any way controlled, runs into this phenomena. If this is the case one can immediately see why control of a preclear is necessary. If he has fought outgoing control it is only because it has gone out too long. A thetan cannot be upset by a mis-control or bad 8-C. It is just an objec-tion. I think he could take it rather easily providing he himself didn't have a stuck flow on it. If he himself had not done so much controlling of mental image pictures, which is to say the mind, the body and objects in the environment, there would not be a stuck outward flow. When somebody comes along and controls him well, he objects. He objects more when it is bad control. But bad control, that is, bad placement and handling, naturally gets more on his nerves if he already has worn route which starts to come back to knock him out. He doesn't like it and starts to fight a flow with flows. A flow which flows a certain time in one direction tends to continue to flow until it is totally jammed or stopped. A flow flowing long enough in one direction in the mind, eventu-ally flows harder and harder and not easier as one might presume. This is only true when en-ergy is being employed. The more an individual outflows energy the more vacuum he creates on this side of the flow. The more he flows out the more hole he leaves in the bank and even-tually something is trying to pull the flow back in. He has created a \"missingness\" in the en-ergy masses immediately surrounding him and this vacuum caused by the missingness tends to fill itself by pulling back on the same line. It's like taking a rubber band and stretching it further and further. The analogy isn't very good because the flow eventually just sticks. His effort to hold it out there is so great that he can only hold it motionlessly out there. He has got it stuck. Somebody comes along and threatens to disturb this stuck flow just a little bit and the vacuum behind it tends to fill up too rapidly. He resists this and he sticks it out there with more effort. The solution to this lies in these two data; one, you cannot hurt a thetan and, two, the worst that could happen on the snap back is that the bank would disarrange in some fashion and would leave him without some of his pretty pictures. That flow is usually undertaken by non-created energy. He himself did not create the energy. He collected it one way or the other, from sources on a mis-ownership basis. He packed it around him and used that energy. There is an actual series of electrical phenomena which occur in the field of thinking-ness connected with this. These things have been observed to have sufficient violence that a person holding the electrodes of an E-Meter has had an explosion occur somewhere in the vicinity of his hands big enough to knock a hole in his hands and the can. An individual once in a while gets a tremendous explosion in front of his face or above his head and he thinks he is being attacked by something. He just got too much poten-tial and had a stuck flow out there which somebody came along and disturbed and it resulted in a complete electronic display. Any group of people playing around with such things as electric shocks on people to \"help\" them, is just being incredibly stupid because they are us-ing the wrong wavelength in the first place – a very gross wave called \"action\"."},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 3 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 850 HPCS We look at this tremendous electrical phenomena which surrounds the being and we find that mental image pictures are themselves built of energy. They are not some imaginary thing. Imaginary means \"non-energy, non – real, not existent, couldn't possibly be handled\". It is a bad control operation, the use of that word imaginary. If that is the case then everything we can see is imaginary – the walls, floors, ceilings and all the bodies one sees walking down the streets. You can practically produce the same phenomena as a ridge exploding with any elec-trical current or various electrical gimmicks of one kind or another. The electronic engineer can produce this reaction very easily with condensers and resistors, but his ideas of condens-ers are rather strange as well. He thinks if you keep pumping electricity into a condenser until it fills up it will eventually discharge in some fashion or another. Well, we don't know if it has this capacity or not, but we know that a thetan does have some strange electrical phenomena which are not any different than the electrical phenomena of life. This is not unusual to a thetan because he is after all part and parcel to the mest universe and the electrical phenomena we see around us were probably some time or another generated by life. The current running in this tape recorder at this moment is converted or generated by some life form or another in the past. It is probably running on coal and coal is energy stored by, converted by or gener-ated by life forms – trees. The moment a thetan starts to handle energy he runs into all the phenomena of elec-tricity or else he wouldn't have any need of eating or sleeping. That this applies to the mind then should not come as a shock to anybody. That it wouldn't apply to the mind then should be a tremendous piece of balderdash. If it has anything to do with energy then there are cer-tain laws that energy obeys and flows are no exception. Other electrical phenomena contain engrams. Each experience in life is represented by a mental image picture of one kind or another, which contains real energy, which has real potential and which is measurable in terms of current. Meters which measure current, measure the potential in these facsimiles. Furthermore they have mass. You can remedy somebody's havingness with these pic-tures. By having an individual mockup things and shoving them in, you can increase the body's weight. There are many experiences which in themselves – and this is what is confus-ing – contain electrical catastrophes. One can have pictures of catastrophes which, when run, give you a repeat of a catastrophe. One can produce all sorts of electrical phenomena which affect beings. People haven't begun to dream of the number of ways by which a being could be in-fluenced by electrical phenomena. One could say that is about the closest thing there is to infinity. They are numberless and all obey the same laws. If they are so operating and if these laws hold good, then you, in processing, can command the obedience of this phenomena. One of the phenomena is the stuck flow of control. People usually control other things by energy and do not control by postulate which is the optimum thing to do. They obsessively control and then one day they control just a little more by energy and they decide they cannot control things any more. There is no other reason to it than electrical phenomena. There isn't, \"Well, I"},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 4 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 851 HPCS failed too many times to control it so I guess I cannot control it any longer\". They just had to try too hard and had to outflow too much, worked too hard by pushing in one direction too long and they created a stuck flow. Practically all flows are aimed in the direction of control and the anatomy of control is start, change and stop. Starting, changing and stopping things then became stuck flows. One of the things we do is to back up this stuck flow of control. The thetan has been going all the time in the universe controlling things and very few things have ever controlled him. He has a tendency to snap in on himself those times when he has been controlled whether it was good or bad control. Hence you get the various phenomena such as the Service Facsimile which finds its basic residence in just that fact. The idea of training people until they develop automatic responses as in the forces, has practically saturated the universe. They don't ever train the person since they don't even know who the man was. The whole idea of training is completely erroneous because they think that if they get some kind of automaticity going in the bank then this person, like a wound up doll, can thereafter drive a car and tanks. Everybody thinks that it works, so that is the target of education, \"Don't apply it. Just memorize the data presented to you even though you don't precisely know where to fit it into your frame of reference.\" Now an auditor comes along and starts to control him with Tone 40 auditing, such as \"Give me that hand\". After a while the preclear says, \"I wonder if any of that is addressed to me? Could it be that some of it is addressed to me? In the first place they are not asking me to store up any of this in the bank. Quite the contrary. I am supposed to do this every time. Me? Does the fellow mean me because I don't see anything else around here that will give him my hand. Well, maybe if he does this often enough he is going to install a machine which will give him my hand.\" Then it becomes sheer duplication and duplication can utterly ruin any machine. The one thing that mental machinery cannot do is to exactly duplicate. Only a thetan can duplicate. He is the only being that can stand the stress and strain of is. So duplication enters into this with heavy control and he finds that he must be the one who is being con-trolled. Thus he works it out and one gets a back flow of control which is all there is to it. He finds nut that there is no great consequence to this and so becomes willing to control some-thing and that is more or less a crude explanation of how control works when used in audit-ing. We examine this very carefully and find that control is senior to energy. Energy is the servant of control and not the end goal of control although it could be made so. Energy is en-ergy and if it was just floating about doing nothing there would be chaos, that is if there was no direction to it. If we take this idea of energy flows as the only method by which anything can be con-trolled we are in trouble. That is the make-break point of a lifetime. That is the reason why electronic engineers have a rough time. The using of too much and using it too long to control things with energy which they themselves cannot even see, causes this stuck flow which eventually deteriorates into the inability to control and forces them further down to cruder methods yes."},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 5 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 852 HPCS We have a stratum above energy. There is such a thing as controlling by postulate. There is also such a thing as mass without energy, or mass without fields. There can be a mass with no energy and it is not true that that wall is composed of little things that wiggle. It is not composed of space with an idea of little particles. Let's not make the mistake of saying that a mass has no mass. That is what physics got itself into and is in it so deep that it will never dig itself out. When it advanced into higher physics they said that mass has no mass and it made mystics out of the lot of them. That is a reverse postulate. It is all right to say that there is nothing there, there is something there and behold is. But now there is something there and we say that there is noth-ing there without vanishing it and we are in trouble because we are telling a lie. Let's get the isness straight. The universe is real. If you run around saying that it is real it would become less offensive to you, but if you go around on the second postulate and while holding firmly in mind that it is and you say it isn't, you not-is it and become a \"what wall\" case which is lower than south. That which makes something is not the thing it made and because you can make en-ergy is no reason that you are energy. Because the wall next to you can make electrical fields when treated properly is no reason that it is an electrical field. In other words, that wall over there is and don't ever think it isn't. If your body runs into it, it will go thump. We then, as a result of this, have to admit two isnesses. The isness of your body and the isness of the wall and some person with more feeling than others would admit a third – the thump. One an vary, alter and do all sorts of things such as changing mest and electricity but when you say that it isn't you run into trouble and start going blind. This is actually the total reason 8-C and other processes are so good. You just make the preclear go around and say, \"It is. It is. It is,\" and everything brightens up and is liable to become more solid, stronger and more massive. That is the basic control of this universe. It is. One controls something by hold-ing it in existence. Just by holding something in existence one is controlling it. Control then even enters into creation. Create and control are next door to each other. If an individual cannot suffer control himself his ability to create is doomed. He may be fran-tically creating but it doesn't mean that he is going to keep doing this for very long. He is go-ing to hit that stuck flow. If he is creating with postulates and not with energy flows he can go on forever. The number one trick of control used in this universe on a thetan is to make the thetan postulate that he himself can be damaged. One has to make him conceive that he is energy and that energy can be damaged by which he then has it proven to him that he can be dam-aged. One can only damage a person thoroughly and enormously by making this identification between a spirit and energy or mass. Any psychotherapy or practice of religion and philosophy or activity concerning the mind is doomed to failure and will not and cannot work if it is based on the premise that man is mass. The only reason Scientology works is because it disabuses him of this fact. It ad-dresses the being and if we were going around fixing up bodies thinking that man is a body made up of neurons, automaticities, etc., we have said at once that it cannot work, because it is using and confirming this identification."},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 6 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 853 HPCS That is the basic mis-identification necessary to damage a thetan or put him down-scale. One just has to convince him that he is mass, energy and can be damaged and you have a foundation for a slave society. The thetan who is convinced that he is a chair can provenly be damaged. But a thetan cannot be damaged. All you really have to do is disassociate the idea that a thetan was energy and you have 99 per cent of his case right there. People control so much energy that they eventually come to believe that they had better obey the laws of energy and so get stuck in energy. He then thinks he is energy and if he produces something he is the thing. This situation eventually gets into a stuck flow and the moment you process him, not an energy mass, he starts to disconnect from all this energy without really wrecking his hav-ingness. One cannot hurt his havingness. It is just another idea he found. Havingness works because it exercises his connection with energy. It makes him responsible until he wears out a whole flock of postulates and then feels better. This, then, is a direct ratio. One would have to convince a thetan that he was energy before one could damage him. He often sets up a postulate that he could be damaged so as to damage another thetan by example. Somebody said, \"Hell was paved with good intentions,\" but it is actually paved with setting an example. You say, \"Look what you have done to me, you brute. You have slaughtered me,\" and he says, \"WHAT! A living being can be slaugh-tered? That's a new thought!\" and he goes off worrying about this. You pick yourself up and say, \"Guess I got that guy.\" Then one day you do it so often that you forget to get the guy or you run into too many others that convinced you. That is just the method of going into agree-ment. Hence, down scale cases, difficulty in processing, all these things actually stem from these rather stratospheric postulates and activities which may or may not be reached directly by an auditor. They certainly can be attacked on a gradient scale. If they could be reached just like that one would have a one instant clear. The whole matter of \"I am energy, energy can be damaged, I can be damaged\" is actu-ally a necessary channel to create a good solid slave society. A fellow who is energy cannot get out of a skull and must to some degree be conceiving himself to be the content of the skull when you tell him to exteriorize. He is trying to push his brains outside the skull or something of the sort when you say, \"Be three feet back of your head.\" It is painful and it gives him headaches. A thetan couldn't be damaged. His abilities couldn't be less. We have already demon-strated that it is impossible to reduce an ability. About the only thing you can do is reduce its exercise or the willingness to exercise it. The answer to all this is to remember and be cognizant all the time that one is process-ing the thetan and NOT an energy mass or something solid. Only then can change occur. A thetan has plotted out orders of seniority and top amongst them is surprise. I can make anybody go out of control and actually make his body just start flip flopping madly just by making him run a process that isn't a process but which is addressed to surprise. \"Mock up somebody and have him be surprised.\" Just have him do that for a few times and he says, \"I"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 7 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 854 HPCS am feeling nervous now,\" and the next thing you as an auditor see is that he has got all of his clamps about surprise off and all of the surprise which was more or less on automatic goes into full restimulation and he will just flip flop all over the place. Surprise is one of the methods by which energy could be damaged because a thetan gets that associated with a blow and he has all sorts of interesting mechanisms figured out. But we have to have these basic mechanisms first – one, that one can be damaged and two, that he is energy. Christianity, for instance, had this failure. Although they were addressing the spirit very broadly they actually brought in this mechanism called hell. There were seven hells originally and these various hells were all places where thetans could be damaged. They did this very interestingly. They said, \"your soul,\" which, of course, made the operation, \"you are energy.\" Punishment and damage were entered in. That wasn't anywhere near as bad an opera-tion as this dialectic materialism psychology mess that we have inherited in our modern times. Science is going straight ahead on the rocks of \"man is energy – man is mass.\" At least Chris-tian practices gave a via on it. They still have some spirit present in their conception of man. I am more or less prone to believe some of the miracles which occurred in the early days of Christianity in spite of the several Christian churches which now offer large prizes to anyone who can prove that any miracle ever occurred. If you were just to convince somebody that he is a spirit, that he did not \"have\" a soul but \"is\" a soul and nothing else, you are liable to get a miracle. He would slip all the way out of being energy and being damaged into being himself. We thus have control of the spirit as being the highest button of control or processing. Control of spirit would be rather direct without mumbo jumbo and lots of vias such as witch doctoring. We have come to a point where we can do this quite directly. We can control a spirit. The moment that the preclear himself sees that he is control and that he is not energy, sees that he can receive control, communicate and respond to it, he certainly will pull out of the morass. Tone 40 works well for some people and rather poorly for others. It has a lot to do with the goals of the auditor and his understanding of what he is trying to do with that proc-ess. But we are probably the first – and this doesn't even include Buddhism – to overtly ad-dress this problem very directly and without superstition and mumbo jumbo. Direct control of the spirit is our direct goal and when a person can be controlled then he can control and when he sees that there is a two way flow involved he has the situation well in hand. _____________________ "},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 8 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 855 HPCS THE ARC TRIANGLE AND CCH (Edited from L. Ron Hubbard's Lecture No. 2 of the 18th ACC, Washington, D.C.) The ARC triangle is our next to the oldest property in Scientology. The oldest is the bank, the engram and the mental image picture. Quite recently this almost forgotten triangle did a terrific resurrection only this time we have it as control, havingness and communication. Affinity, Reality and Communication are an excellent description of the three basic things on which the universe is built, without which, in balance, life could not exist. AFFINITY, that is some emotional or felt consideration of proximity, is basically a consideration of distance, but it is that consideration which says that one likes or doesn't like it. In other words, without some liking or disliking, having some things to avoid or to go close to, there would be no game at all. REALITY, is that sequence which begins with postulates and ends with mass, which we originally defined as an agreed upon thing. Reality is the agreed upon apparency of exis-tence as per the axioms. COMMUNICATION, is an interchange of ideas between two beings who are aware that the other person is present. We had to introduce with this new simplicity the radical idea that one being could talk to another being and that an interchange of ideas could take place as defined in Axiom 28 and described in \"Dianetics 1955\" – the manual of communication. If you notice an interchange of ideas it is not very feasible unless there is an agreement of some sort or another. The agreement can take the form of having a mass to talk to and we thus get a communication via. At least we know what we are talking to if there is something there – and that is reality. Of course, we can simply postulate that something is there and talk to it. Talking to something is better than talking to nothing. When two beings are talking to each other here on Earth, one normally sees the oddity of two beings standing there, not con-fronting each other and not talking, but a lot of words go back and forth. The reality part of that interchange would be the mass, the platform whether it be Earth or a sidewalk that the two bodies are standing on. The space so far as location is concerned enters into this. Those are located somewhere and therefore we know where the communication goes to and whoever receives it knows where to send the answer back to – a very necessary part of communication. Then we get the affinity factor. How far away does a fellow have to be to talk to you? There is more than that to affinity. Affinity is liking and disliking. Understanding requires affinity, reality and communication and if any corner of the ARC triangle is lowered the other two corners lower accordingly. We know that reality is basically an agreement and we have today the Reality Scale. We have always known that all we had to do was introduce some agreement into the situation."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 9 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 856 HPCS One had to agree at least on what one was talking about in order to talk. There is no commu-nication in progress if there is no agreement on anything. One should have had to establish the existence of one of the other people before communication could have occurred. Communication occurs simply by R and a little A when two people are together. Affinity necessitates a control of attention. We have had a lot of processes founded on ARC and they have not in themselves produced tremendous results. They have produced good results but we haven't seen anybody step out of the graveyard and dust his hat. There must be some counterparts to ARC which are more workable than ARC since if we know ARC is true then how do we (and those are basic considerations) make it work in this universe, on this planet at this time? We know that the three things add up to understand-ing. How do we get this into a processing level? In the first place one has to realize blindness when one sees it. One has to realize that South is an awful long way South and the basic entrance of the ARC triangle breaks down to control for A, to which bodies and the GE beautifully respond. Any preclear, therefore, would respond to it regardless of his tone level if you were processing him via a body, because this is the body's understanding. It is solid. Therefore A is control. Somebody comes along and says, \"Stand up straighter. Got your heels together. Suck in your guts\" and he will say, \"The guy loves me.\" You might phrase it in some other way. You might say, \"Damn the sergeant, I could kill him\" which means at the GE level, \"I love him dearly.\" Thus we have havingness or solid mass in the place of reality and verbalization in place of communication. So understanding takes place in terms of control, mass and commu-nication. Understanding mest-wise always takes place in the framework of mass and location thereof, verbalized or electrical or vibratory interchanges, and for affinity, control. If one dis-liked somebody on a mass level one would simply refuse to control him. The choice I am talking about is to control or not to control. Unfortunately where there are people firmly connected with mass this then is the level of interchange. If people are going around in bodies, then this is the level to which cases re-spond. Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to rephrase or re-do the ARC triangle. I am sim-ply telling you the action level of the ARC triangle when it is in action or you are going to work on a mest level. A becomes control or lack of it. The R becomes mass and its location or lack of it since the complaint is about no mass, and C is some sort of vibratory electrical par-ticle interchange, symbols flying back and so forth – solid. If you start adding too much directness at this very low level you are liable to blow the mass up. A thetan learns that. Every once in a while he loses a favorite piece of bank or ser-vice facsimile. He said exactly what he meant to the fellow directly with no vias and got him-self fired. He was trying to communicate directly on a mest level and threw some particles straight out without the slightest via on them and caused an explosion. One has to have inten-"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 10 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 857 HPCS tion with it. There has to be some livingness connected with it. In other words, one has to go upscale in order to make it function optimumly. People who are at the lower end of control don't want mass, can't have communication which becomes \"it will be said for me\". At this level, when coaxed to put out a control, a communication which is absolutely direct and straight, people discover something fantastic. In order to accomplish this they have to go upscale or shatter themselves in the process of doing so. After they have been shattered a few times they hit a higher tone range. They say, \"I belong up here. What am I doing grubbing around here in the mest?\" That is basically what an individual understands when he starts doing recent training drills. ARC, to become extremely workable, has to be coached where you are dealing with masses in terms of control, havingness and communication. We have said CCH, by which we mean control, communication, havingness or com-munication, control and havingness, and we have lined them up so that it is instantly discerni-ble that this is the other side to the ARC coin. Follow ARC down scale as per the Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation in \"Science of Survival\" and as you go down you will find an area below the bottom line of the chart That has to do with mass. In other words, to wrap up this whole subject the only responses still extant at the bottom of the Chart can still be phrased in terms of control, havingness and communication. Those responses do not entirely disappear as mentioned on the Chart but be-come very coarse and massive and don't entirely disappear. If life can be awakened into a present it will be awakened into a presence or a location by control, havingness and communication, handled in one way or another. The first CCH process is very old and hardly anybody has recognized its antecedent. I processed a cat until he ate an editor. I processed this cat up to a point where he would strike at my fingers. He was a very timid cat and I got him to reach for my fingers and then each time he would reach I would withdraw my fingers slightly. He would reach further and he got more and more fero-cious. So I invited an editor and he ate the editor up. That's an exaggeration but he really ate the editor's thetan by scaring the man with his ferocity. Just by inviting the cat to reach out, no matter how timidly, and strike out at our fin-gers, gradually so as not to startle or surprise the cat we make our fingers retreat, we get the cat to put out a communication line. Lines are solid at the bottom of the Reality Scale so we are right there at the cat's reality. The cat can't have mass, is below mass and is actually trying to connect antagonistically with a solid communication line. So the cat does reach. \"Give me that hand\" is just processing the cat. You say, \"Give me that hand.\" The pre-clear doesn't and you reach over and take hold of his wrist, take his hand and thank him for having given it to you. After a while of this he says, \"You know, there is some dim, vague possibility that I might have had something to do with that. I wonder if I could possibly reach that far over to your lap.\" When he finds out that he can do it, you have achieved a goal for you have got him reaching for the environment, in an 8-C style. When this is done, you as an auditor better have him reach for the mest environment in terms of barriers. You have just got lines recognized and he has to be moved up and out of barriers. So we have 8-C on walls."},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 11 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 858 HPCS When we get him above that the auditor puts him back on lines again and we have Hand Space Mimicry. We get him to locate the mass of the auditor. The preclear cannot disobey these commands. There is no thinkingness involved in it because there isn't any thinkingness at that level and if you are processing any it is a figure-figure. That is what ARC becomes after a long time. An individual becomes a body. He agrees that he isn't anything but a body. People are never anything but bodies and bodies are dead too. A body is a mass and therefore the realest thing there could be to a body is outright control. If a person had a body then control would be affinity. If he could control something he would like it. An individual who finds out control isn't killing him turns out to like his auditor. That is an establishment of a reality level and the affinity level at that reality level is control. It goes up and not down the scale. We use good Tone 40 control on him and he will come upscale to having mass. Let's look at what this does to communication. The individual, of course, is willing to talk. He is also willing to receive objects and give objects away and so interchanges can oc-cur. We are looking at the ARC where understanding takes place only in the presence of con-trol, havingness and communication on a mest level. This is the level at which machines of a mest nature, automobiles and so forth, have to be run. An individual cannot adequately control his car and he doesn't like his car. What does he mean by \"like\"? Does he mean an emotion? No, he means an ability to control it. It is as solid and mesty as that. One wonders why some married couples don't get along although she apparently does everything he says. When an auditor decides that he will get her out from under her husband (or vice versa) or bush up this closure of terminals, he will find out that there seems to be some feeling for each other. It is just control going on all the time. One is looking here at where control is affinity. They express their affinity for each other by kicking each other, try-ing to gain control over each other by fighting. Below that level is love making. One can understand a lot by just looking at what understanding is at the level of mass. It is control, controlling and being controlled. That is understanding. Psychosis is something mocked up so that it cannot be handled. Psychos try to make nothing out of their mass all the time. They have mocked up a non-handlability. People who are below 2.0 on the Tone Scale mock up things that cannot be handled and individuals above 2.0 mock up things, when they do, that can be handled or they simply try to handle anything. There is thus a dividing line on this control. People below 2.0 mock up things routinely which cannot be handled and then brag about it. Those people are much further down scale than one thinks they are. We say it is above or below 2.0 which seems to be a precise line. It is almost as if we are talking about two dif-ferent universes. When individuals go around mocking up things that cannot be handled and bragging about it all the time, they give an auditor a pretty bad time. They are just daring the"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 12 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 859 HPCS auditor to handle them. You start sawing through with \"Give me that hand\" and they say, \"This can't be handled.\" They keep offering things that can't be handled. These people are never really successful at anything. They are terribly destructive. They Q and A with mest and they have become mest. They do what mest does. Here we enter our understanding of life in realizing that there are people around who haven't the slightest desire to handle anything. Everybody's got something in his life that he doesn't think can be handled or thinks that he cannot handle, but these people just mock it up all the time. People or preclears that have given you a hard time have done only that. You cure them of one thing and they mock up something else that you cannot handle. Their whole game is the avoidance of control. But they know how to control other people. That is the Ser-vice Facsimile, which is unhandlable and you handle these people by not permitting them to handle the Service Facsimile which is reactive enough for any reactive bank. One can thus roughly divide mankind above or below 2.0 on the tone scale. Some of them mock up things which can be handled and try to handle other things. These are the peo-ple that keep the world running. They don't build clocks that cannot be fixed. The rest of the people simply keep on mocking up things that cannot be handled and every doctor, every practitioner of any kind is confronted by these people all the time because this is the dare. ARC becomes control, havingness and communication. You recognize that control, havingness and communication are not the bottom because they invert and become no control possible of any kind. This is the \"can't handle\" it. No mass is admissible or viewable and no communication of any kind acceptable. Therefore no understanding is possible. We have discovered that rung which solves the inversion. Just as we can raise any per-son's communication by raising his affinity and reality, as we can raise affinity by raising their reality and communication so we can do these things at the bottom We can remedy con-trol, inability to handle and so forth in his life and vicinity simply by remedying his having-ness. We can do this by talking to him or by using straight control and we can raise his lack of mass by control and communication. We will find that his havingness will increase. Some odd and very complicated consideration about havingness are in the way of all this but it will blow in cognitions which he probably will never mention, but he will come up to CCH. If a person has got to be identified and connected with mass, he is in terribly good condition when he is at CCH. Therefore CCH is pretty high, but it handles all the inversions of CCH and this whole mysterious stratum, the bottom sub-stratum of the ARC triangle, is revealed to view and becomes workable in the hands of the auditor. Control all by itself will level out all lower inversions of the subject of control, hav-ingness and communication. The right kind of communication all by itself will do something for havingness and control. Hand Space Mimicry is a solid line. They will eventually have an auditor. \"Can't have\" on others and \"have\" on self or the three steps of trio or control trio run one way or another on somebody is also a communication process. If you run \"Tell me some-thing your mother can't have\" and get a straight answer, the preclear's havingness comes up. So does his ability to control and his ability to communicate. You can hit CCH at one of its"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 13 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 860 HPCS corners and get the other two to some degree because it permits the auditor to directly address the body and have something happen to the person. CCH then, should be viewed simply as the workable factors at the lower end of the mass scale. CCH is a pretty high level procedure, but it is a description also of all lower lev-els, the harmonics of which are processed by straight CCH. ____________________ START-CHANGE-STOP (Refer to \"Clear Procedure\" by L. Ron Hubbard) Start, change and stop is the anatomy of control. This is a cycle of action – create, sur-vive, destroy. There is continue (persist) on the middle of the curve and other cycles within cycles of action, but the important factors are Start, Change and Stop. Running Start, Change and Stop on an individual brings about greater self-determinism. Self-determinism in the field of motion consists of, by own power of choice, permit-ting the object or body to be still or not to be still; permitting a thing to be changed or not to be changed; permitting a thing to be started or not to be started, and it must be rehabilitated in the preclear. In other words, self-determinism consists here of returning the preclear's power of choice over controlling or not controlling at will. The preclear who is obsessively control-ling will sooner or later fail to control and then will be controlled by something. The obses-sion to control, to start, to change, to stop, will be found to enter into the ARC triangle and is what depresses the preclear down scale on the Tone Scale. These three parts of control are run flat individually, in this order: we run Change flat, and then run Start again very flat and then we run Stop flat. It would be a mistake at this point to say that this process is finished for the excellent reason that if you run Change again you would find further considerations shifting in the preclear and then if you run Start you would find it unflattened. So you would run it again and then run and flatten Stop. It would not be possible to say how long you would have to run the process altogether. On somebody who was total machinery and who never had been in session, this would be a rough process. On a case that is in good condition, this would run easier. The preclear would consider it interesting and would exteriorize quite easily. The end result of this process is ex-teriorization. For someone who is compulsively exteriorized, this would be excellent as he would slide into his head and eventually come out of it again, but not on a compulsive basis."},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 14 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 861 HPCS One meets with three conditions in auditing. The preclear who is compulsively interi-orized, the preclear who is compulsively exteriorized and the preclear who is buttered all over the universe. The latter case, run on C-S-C would greatly accumulate the ability to collect himself. This might not occur until you have run him for five or more hours on it. If this process is continued long enough the preclear will be moving his body by pos-tulate – i.e., from the outside, not by beams, stimulus response, etc. This process does not go all the way up because of the preclear's attention span. Most preclear's cannot stay on a process for more than a few moments, so you would vary the proc-ess a little to keep him interested. His actual response, however, is not important as long as he does it. There is no such thing as bad control, only non-positive control. Good control is posi-tive control and positive control is not bad control. We get a lower level there than moving the body. This would be S-C-S on Objects. It is always safest to run this on someone you are trying out or a person who cannot move about a lot such as an invalid. To somebody who has no reality on his body one would run S-C-S using an object instead of his body. When running this process, the auditor and the preclear should both stand up. This gives reality and the auditor duplicating the preclear (mimicry) will bring about greater ARC. The session always fails when the auditor sits down while running S-C-S. It runs this way: The auditor points out a spot on the floor to the preclear and says: \"Do you see that spot? Good. We will call that Spot A. Now you stand here. O.K.\" The auditor now indicates another spot and says: \"Now do you see that other spot? Good. We'll call that Spot B. All right, now when I tell you to change the body's position I want YOU to move it from Spot A to Spot B. All right? Good. Change the body's position.\" \"Fine.\" Then the auditor says: \"Do you see that spot? Well, we'll call that Spot C.\" (We use three spots so that we don't run a du-plication process on him.) \"Now when I tell you to change the body's position I want YOU to move the body from Spot B to Spot C. Do you understand that? Fine, change the body's posi-tion.\" You can ask him: \"Did YOU change the body's position?\" if his case is not too low, for it is not advisable on a low case at first. Then go back to Spot A. It does not have to be the same spot A each time as it makes the process too much like duplication, brings the preclear to predict the process too easily and he will do it machine-wise. Each time you make contact with the preclear you give the command in a new interval of time. You don't depend on any former understanding of the command. You clear it each time and give the whole command every time you use it. We make each move in time a new move. He doesn't have to depend on his memory, so the auditor repeats the whole wording as given. This is a most important aspect of running any part of S-C-S."},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 15 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 862 HPCS On Start we emphasize START. The auditor says: \"Do you see that wall over there? Good. Now when I give you this command, I want you to move the body in the direction to-wards that wall. When I say 'start' I want YOU to start the body. All right. Start. Fine.\" The preclear may protest that he had to stop the body and change it as well. What is happening here is that the word \"Control\" is beginning to ungroup and as you get start, change and stop apart and distinct from each other, the individual's ability to control the body increases and he gains more confidence in being able to control it from a greater and greater distance. The next command would be: \"All right, when I tell you to 'start' the body YOU start the body, O.K.? Start the body.\" The third command is for STOP, and the auditor says: \"I am going to ask you to get the body moving towards that (indicated) wall and somewhere along the line I am going to tell YOU to stop the body. Is that all right?\" He agrees and you say, \"Get the body moving.\" You don't say start. He does so and you say \"Stop\" and \"Did YOU stop the body?\" You don't say \"your body\" but \"the body\", indicating the body. You emphasize him as a thetan doing it for it increases the preclear's selfdeterminism. You give the commands for each process newly each time. From S-C-S, which is the three processes given above, there are two other processes called START-C-S and STOP-C-S. START-C-S has the exact commands as for Start in S-C-S. We emphasize Start here and use Change and Stop only to unflatten Start. The purpose here is to rehabilitate the pre-clear's ability to get things starting since he has been immobilized a lot in his life when the opposing valences or conditions exercised bad control over him and prevented him from start-ing. After a preclear has been run on Start-C-S, which would flatten to some degree each one of the points of control, we run STOP-C-S. This is a distinctly different process. The commands are the same as used for Stop in S-C-S, but here one specializes in stopping the body. One has the preclear stop the body over and over and as the preclear becomes more accustomed to doing this one then changes the process on him to this extent – the auditor asks the preclear in running Stop-C-S to \"stop the body absolutely still.\" This imposes a new discipline on the preclear and makes the process extremely diffi-cult for him. It is only done when S-C-S and ordinary Stop-C-S have to some degree been flattened. Following up this \"Stop the body absolutely still\" one can introduce Change into the process for a few commands in order to unflatten the Stop-C-S that has flattened. In other words, when the Stop of Stop-C-S on an object or the body seems to be flat, one can run a few Change the body or Change the object and unflatten Stop once more with a resultant altera-tion in the preclear's ability to perform. When Stop-C-S seems flat then it should be unflat-tened at first by running Change-S-S with the emphasis on Change. When Change no longer"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"CONTROL AND THE MECHANICS OF SCS 16 22.7.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 863 HPCS upsets his ability to stop it, Starting it should be run as an alternate to Stop-C-S in order to unflatten it again. Stop is the most important part of S-C-S. The preclear has been told all along the line to stop. He was made effect all the time. How you bring him to just this under his own control and self-determinism and he takes over the automaticity. The same is true for Change. A psychotic is compulsively changing all the time and CHANGE-S-S will take over the automaticity of \"compulsive changing\" and make the person more sane."},{"pageNumber":884,"pageContent":" PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 864 HPCS Explanation and Demonstration of Tone 40 On An Object A lecture and demonstration given on 6 July 1957 [Based on clearsound version and checked against the old reels. Omissions marked \">\"] Thank you. Well, now you know. You always figured that there was something wrong with mayhem and then I show you mayhem and say it's all right. But the truth of the matter is, the truth of the matter is, that any one of these drills actually takes a very long time to really get into good shape. The Academy spends a couple of weeks Comm Course and at least one week of Upper Indoctrination before they even let anybody near a process. That's about three weeks before they let anybody near a process. Pretty interesting, huh? And Academy training, by the way, has changed quite remarkably. It is remarkable to the degree that it has shifted just in the last four or five months. But it's been holding at a very high consistency here for some time, but we've been making awful sure that it's grooved. You know, I've told you \"That's it\" an awful lot of times, but all I'm telling you now is that we have hit a plateau. I don't say we couldn't go up from this. But I will say that the Communication Course, these first training steps which you have seen, has – well, it's been difficult to settle it down at times – but it has been consistent for over a year and the proc-esses which are being done right this minute are the processes which were developed in fairly early 1956. It's quite remarkable. You've seen some of these processes before. This is a level of constancy. It's just that we're doing it more thoroughly. Upper Indoctrination you haven't seen too much of Even the 15th and 16th ACCs did not see too much of these Upper Indoctrination steps. Those begin with simple 8-C and con-tinue through High School Indoc, go through to Tone 40 on an Object and then Tone 40 on a Person. And those are the Upper Indoctrination steps. These are the rougher steps. When a person has passed through those and goes back to the Communication Course he finds out something has changed. He can do the Communication Course now, standing on his head. Funny part of it is, his Instructors very often say, \"Well, why, then, don't we start out with Tone 40 on an Object, because people can do these communication steps so beauti-"},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 2 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 865 HPCS fully after they've finished Upper Indoc.\" So every once in a while we take somebody and start him out on Tone 40 on an Object and put him through the Communication Course, and he can't do Tone 40 on an Object, or he can't do the Communication Course. So the proper route up is probably more or less as it is right now in the Academy. Going through the Academy these days is quite an adventure. I think any of the stu-dents around here who have been with it for a little while, like the night HCA or day HCA courses, could agree with that. It's quite remarkable as an activity. They have three rooms and one of these rooms takes care of the Communication Course, which are these first few steps, and then the next room takes care of Upper Indoctri-nation. And that's down in the basement where they can't knock out the concrete walls. And then they have the CCH classroom where they're taught the CCH steps. The ACC – which is just about to begin; the 18th ACC – takes these very things which I've been showing you here and which you've been drilling on in the seminars, and takes these things and pushes them up to a ne plus ultra. All ACCs are – they have an experimental as-pect. What is learned in an ACC is usually eventually passed on to an HCA. The HCA Course has settled down now at the level of about the 17th ACC or a little bit better. But the 18th ACC – the 18th ACC which is coming up and just starts Monday – will take these same steps, takes exactly these same steps and pushes them through with a thud – with only one purpose in mind; is to find out how arduously people can be trained. There's no doubt now that they can be trained. Now, that is the experimental aspect of the 18th ACC, is how arduously can be trained. Where is the break point in Homo sapiens? We can certainly discover it in Homo sapiens if we can bust up Scientologists. And that is actually, overtly what is going to happen in the 18th ACC. I will consider it a complete failure if there's one student in the 18th ACC who doesn't sometime or another during the course blow; who doesn't quit, start out the door, say \"It's impossible. Nobody could take this sort of thing,\" and try to go over the hills and far away. Now, that is the... that's the 18th ACC just coming up.

And the bulk of our information, to you, is apparently Scientology, its developments and so on. And you see how this subject has developed and get some subjective reality on what it can do. You believe that that is the research sector of Scientology. Well, that research sector is more or less handled by myself and it is even slightly independent in its own courses. It takes place in ACCs, it takes place in the workaday world. But the organization itself wouldn't agree with you that that was the upper reach of what has been learned. The people in the FC Central Organization would tell you what has been learned has been organi-zation – what is organization? As soon as we found out that an organization ain't, we had it made. We just found out then that there were certain duties to be performed and each of these duties had to be per-formed by a person, and that person had to be informed of what these duties were and to have a purpose for those duties. And after that, why, we're not straining at it. These poor people that go around trying to make organizations. Listen, organizations aren't; they don't exist. And the people... Dick Stevens would tell you that's the most we have learned; that'd be his viewpoint on the thing. > [Clearsound version only has Dick with Stevens removed from the above > para-graph] > And the other thing that we've learned would be, from the viewpoint of the remain-der of staff – they would say, well, what we have learned is how to train people, how to make people, how to build up an entirely new person with training skills. And they'd say that is what we have learned how to do. And these things actually have been learned by the people in the organization. It's quite a remarkable gain all by itself. I was talking to somebody the other day and he says, \"You know,\" he said, \"I just ache to get hold of an infantry company and put all their hats on as to what they're supposed to do and train them so that they can control MEST, so the officers can handle men and the men can handle weapons, and so they can communicate with one another and so that they could engage upon their individual activities as they were supposed to.\" He said, \"I just ache to do this.\" He said that they'd at once throw away their weapons. They'd find out that the least use-ful thing they possessed was a weapon. Ah, but you say, \"Well, you can't talk the enemy into surrendering.\" I'm not so sure; I'm not at all so sure. For instance, I'll give you a difference of attitude that can take place in one man. Fellow says he's having an awful lot of trouble with his boss, can't talk to his boss and his boss nags him all the time without any cause or reason. He just always gets nagged and he's always being mean and ornery. Auditor sat down and ran this person – problem of com-parable magnitude to that boss. Nothing else happened. There were no other changes. And this mystic, odd thing occurred: His boss at once stopped nagging him, not because he was being more or less efficient, because the boss couldn't observe that well. But he just stopped nagging him, stopped giving him a bad time, and the problems in the real world folded up the"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 4 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 867 HPCS moment they folded up in that fellow's skull. When the present time problem was flat he did-n't have any problems with these other people. But do you get what I'm striving at here? The people were the ones who were causing the problem, and when the preclear had Problems of Comparable Magnitude run flat, then these people out here who hadn't been processed ceased to give him the problems. Mystic. Mysterious, isn't it? Sort of like how do you influence things at a distance and all that sort of thing. And yet that has occurred rather repeatedly. Some people haven't tried to observe this. I'll give you an idea on this. One day I was having a lot of trouble with the only office which I think should be purchased back by the British people. The British people should take up a collection and buy this office back, and that's the aliens office, and – the aliens office of Great Britain – and they've taken their cue from the Immigration Office of the Department of Injustice and they're pretty ornery. Well, I'd been having trouble with them and trouble with them and trouble with them and trouble with them, and one day sat down with an auditor and I was getting a session, and the auditor all of a sudden says, \"You know, this is a good idea. Let's see, now.\" It wasn't quite a proper process, because the aliens office is not strictly speaking an object. But he said, \"Give me a problem of comparable magnitude to the aliens office,\" and I ran through the gamut of no problem, problem too horrible to face, so what. Problem of comparable magni-tude to the aliens office would be a fleck of dust settling on that light bulb, and the problem would be how to blow it off the light bulb, you see? See? Nothing to it. And the aliens office called me up a couple of days later and said they had my pass-port straightened out and I haven't had any trouble with them since. Rather fabulous. Now, what did my running the process, and not again talking to the aliens office, have to do with the aliens office treating me that way? See, nothing, obvious. Now, a fellow has a big lot of trouble with his business and so forth – run problem of comparable magnitude to his business – problem of comparable magnitude to his business. It's very funny. I get a lot of auditing, by the way. I just finished about a twenty-hour intensive before this congress. And the ... I've got to tell this – I've got to tell this now, be-cause the staff will think it's funny. This is one on the staff; they don't know this. The auditor ran me on problems of comparable magnitude to the FC staff. You know, they're always coming in with a horrible wreck that just wrecked and dumping it on my desk and saying proudly, \"What do I do about this?\" see? And various things are colliding in one way or another in the organization; it runs pretty smoothly, by and large. But she ran me – Problem of Comparable Magnitude. Well, I had a pretty big problem out of this, you know, and ... driving in my anchor points and so forth, and ... The only person we've had any trouble with since that was run has been a person who wasn't on staff at that time. That's right, isn't it, Dick? The only trouble which has occurred has been from a person who wasn't on staff at the time this was audited. And nobody's brought in any problems to me at all; I don't know why this is. They used to think this was the only way they could get to talk to me would be to have a big problem. Staff"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 5 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 868 HPCS is terrific, just absolutely terrific. They actually are no great problem. But it was rather amus-ing when I looked back on it and found out that the person who wasn't present when I audited that, did cause later some trouble, and there was no other trouble caused of any kind. So, this factor we don't have our fingers on. But we could theorize and say that the person himself carries along the restimulative factors which set commotions into action in his vicinity. In other words, that an individual carries with him the enturbulance which restimu-lates others and causes them to react against him. Now, we can see that mechanically, theorizing on it one way or other, and we do have some supportive evidence. It's quite amazing. Every time somebody who is stark staring crazy comes near the organization or is brought in, lugged in one way or the other, by the relatives or something ... We don't ... we're not in this business, you see, but once in a while this hap-pens. Somebody gets dragged in and they're going \"Du-uu-uu-uh, what wall?\" you know. And there is always a commotion going on just as though you'd thrown a brick in the middle of a millpond, see. Thud. Plunk. And there go the waves of commotion. Person gets audited, no more commotion. This is weird, isn't it? If one continued to specialize in psychos he could always expect the immediate vicin-ity of the psycho to enturbulate, not because the psycho has anything to do with it. This crazy person doesn't have, really, any knowing effect on his environment, but he does have an ef-fect on his environment. There is some sort of enturbulative, confused machinery which res-timulates the confusions in others and they get this reaction. Now, a Scientologist who can handle confusion is generally not very confused about this. But sometimes the pieces of paper start flying up in the air and he's quite amazed at this amount of commotion. There's always tremendous numbers of problems. You'd think just dragging somebody in the front door and saying just \"Go to the auditing room\" – you'd think this'd be a fairly easy action. And the people who'd run High School Indoc could accomplish this with the greatest of ease. But the funny part of it is, is the commotion is no longer caused to us by the psycho. We can take care of the psycho, but the restimulated relative comes around and gives us a bad check, you know, has to have another liaison with something or other, has to have a couple of favors over this way. And the next thing you know it's this person who is enturbulated. And the only thing the front office of the organization has never gotten wise to is the fact that they have to run Tone 40 8-C on anybody connected with a crazy person. Just take in the whole environment, doesn't matter what or who: husband, wife, parents, aunts, uncles, and the psychiatrist – if you've got to get that low. Just take the whole works, and you just have to run Tone 40 8-C on the whole works. Otherwise you get this tremendous enturbulance and confusion and meaningless pieces of paper flying around. I could always tell when one has walked in the front door, because the despatch lines of the organization momentarily treble, and then damp down again. It's very interesting. Des-patches coming through – you all of a sudden get a tremendous lot of despatch from an area that you hadn't noticed before, you see.

Well, that is a beautiful experiment. I don't know what it means. I learned it. It's a very nice experiment, but it tells us nothing. If we kick Private Alpha, then Private Zed does not fly off the other end of the line. I point that out to your attention. We stack a bunch of men up here and we kick this man, this man doesn't say \"Ouch.\" See? Human beings do not run according to physical laws. But if we take this stack of men and we enturbulate this fellow, we'll get a confusion passed on to this one, a confusion to this one, a confusion to this one, and it gets damped out rather rapidly, but you get a concatenation or a definite contagion of confusion. And that's about all that happens in the physical side of man's nature. These confusions are contagious. It's very funny. The – huh! – The psychologists, I mean. I don't know what these fel-lows were doing for fifty, a hundred years. They must have been doing something. They've noticed mass hysteria, and they talk about mass hysteria and mass hysteria. But there is no mechanics, no description of mass hysteria or how it starts. They study it, they say it is, they study it. They notice a whole room full of people will suddenly become very hysterical. And they don't think that the bank has anything to do with it. They don't know the bank exists, that it'd have some mass. And you get the idea? They just – there isn't anything there. They have noticed that suddenly somebody gets hysterical and a lot of other people around him get hys-terical at the same time, see? They've noticed this occur. And this is mass hysteria. Well, I don't know that there is such a thing. I don't know, see? I have never myself witnessed the perfect case, which I think is a Southern mill where all the women went hys-terical at the same time. I don't know. I don't think anybody observed whether they went hys-terical at the same time. And I don't think it was either... ever accurately observed, because if you've got that much confusion going from person to person where they all apparently simul-taneously blew off into space, the person watching it was restimulated, and therefore was not a reliable observer. So we wouldn't know too much about this mass hysteria. We do know about this other factor. And we get this contagion, contagion, contagion, contagion, and gradually people get hysterical. Now, it's true that an army evidently starts running, but that's quite apparent. A soldier is standing there and he finds out the soldier to the right of him and the soldier to the left have already left. Makes him feel alone and he leaves. We don't need any esoteric explanation of that. But we do need one about this contagion. We do find out that people who can handle problems with relationship to any particular sphere, these people do not get involved in the same type of problem again. See, that's interesting. In other words, these are the only accurate facts we know, that people do restimulate in the vicinity of restimulated people and that Prob-lems of Comparable Magnitude run on these people then make them immune to this restimu-lation, which is quite an amazing thing to know that much and know it positively and well."},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 7 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 870 HPCS Now, what the mechanics are, that's something else. That's not too easily done. If you made people mock up confusions and become habituated to confusions of one kind or an-other, you say that would do it. Well, I have no evidence that it does, and that is the only rea-son why I make a cautious statement on it. You get a postulate going around, however, that everybody ought to go and act like they're mad, and you generally will get people going and acting like they're mad. That's enough to know about it. So an auditor – now we get up to this drill again – an auditor must be able to handle the confusions and motions and enturbulations to which he is subjected in auditing preclears, otherwise he will restimulate. Don't you see? Well, these drills run this out. It's actually a sort of a process, see? His confidence comes up. He finds out that he doesn't have to stop and be controlled by all of this confused motion. Now, you saw these people up on the stage here in this last hour. They were doing a drill. If they did that drill to where they could do it perfectly, just that sort of thing, they would have very little trouble from people. That's High School Indoc. But supposing these people, by their own postulate, cutting through all confusions, could influence MEST or people with no more than a postulate. Ahhh. Now we know why we're talking about Tone 40 auditing. Not only would they themselves have to be at a place where they were no longer con-fused every time they saw a confusion in their vicinity, but they would also have to be able to cut through any confusion of their own or any confusion of anyone else and make the inten-tion and postulate go through and stick and be executed. Now, the next two steps of Upper Indoc are devoted to that. It was all very well for an auditor to continue to audit somebody in spite of the efforts of that person to stop him. That was all very well, and a very necessary step. But how about this next one, to get an intention to cut directly and cleanly through any confusion of his own and any confusion of anyone else's, straight through to the person at the bottom of all this and get an execution and action. And that is the goal of the Tone 40 processes. Now, actually you knew about High School Indoc before, you knew about a lot of these other things, but I had not publicly or broadly talked about Tone 40. Now, that's what Tone 40 is all about. A person not only gets the confidence that he can continue to perform in the vicinity of people who are confused, but also gets the confidence that this confusion does not stop his intentions, directions or his attainment to his own goals. That child who said, \"I want to be a painter,\" and was arrested and stopped by the con-fusion of the environment from attaining his goal, was unable to make an intention stick. Isn't that true? He just wasn't able to make it stick. And he becomes disabused of the idea. He finds out ... he feels that he can't. Because he himself didn't know exactly what he was trying to do with this intention or through what it had to go, he himself could be defeated by these counter-confusions. Don't you see?"},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 8 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 871 HPCS Well, then don't consider it odd that a person who works on an object, on Tone 40 on an Object, and gets to a point where he can make a clear, clean intention go through his own bank to a MEST object, then improves in his ability to handle his own life and his goals. He's doing what he tried to do when he was a kid and wanted to be a painter, but now he can do it, and right in present time. We ignore cutting through any bank. We ignore going through any confusion. We ig-nore the confusion. We don't not-is it. We just drill the person until he discovers that it is in-capable of stopping him or varying his intention. And when he has learned that, the funniest things happen. Psycho walks in, going all sixes and sevens, very, very confused. The auditor says, \"Sit down in the chair,\" and the psycho sits down. \"Tell me your name, rank and serial number\" The psycho tells him his name, rank and serial number. Nobody else has ever been in communication with this person. Well, we're not then studying purely communication. We're studying something else, which is the interchange of intention. We're studying some-thing else. It's nonverbal. It is an intention which goes through perfectly clean and clear and independent of. And you're seeing here in Tone 40 auditing the first actual result which came about from nonverbal processing, which we were attempting to do in Phoenix in 1954-55. Remem-ber that? Non-MEST processing. We were trying to bypass the comm lines, one way or the other. Well, today we can do this and do this rather easily because we have some Training Drills which promote a person up to doing it. Now, I haven't the foggiest notion of how high these drills go. I haven't the least no-tion at all. I don't know but that an intention cannot go up to a point where a piece of MEST will disobey natural law and obey the auditor. I do not know that this will not happen. Do you understand that? I do not say this will happen, but I do not know that it will not happen. In the first place, there is historical record on the fact that there have been people in the immediate background, not eight hundred years ago, in accurate record, who were able to make MEST fly through the air simply by intending it to. And I'm not trying to oversell this idea, or I'm not trying to raise your hopes, saying, well, all you had to say to the automobile, \"Be five feet in the air,\" it's five feet in the air \"Change the tire,\" and ... I'm not trying to tell you that that would occur But I am also trying to make it very clear that I'm not saying it will not occur. Do you understand that? I don't know what would happen if somebody drilled on this for eighty or a hundred hours, because I don't think anybody has ever drilled on it that long. The maximum length of time is probably in the vicinity of twelve, fifteen, twenty hours for most people. And I think the longest it's ever been run – oh, I think thirty hours; twenty-five or thirty hours. Fellow was having an awful lot of trouble with it at the beginning. But how about the fellow who didn't have very much trouble with it at the beginning? Supposing he had run it eighty to a hundred hours? Well, would it happen or wouldn't it hap-pen? Well, this we're not going to try to answer. No reason to answer that question. An indi-vidual can answer that question himself."},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"TONE 40 ON AN OBJECT 9 FC-11 – 6.07.57 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 872 HPCS Now, here's the oddity: On Tone 40 on an Object – on Tone 40 on an Object – we are only trying to put the intention into the object. We're not doing the same as that lower com-munication drill which you did. You do want to know some more about these drills, don't you? Audience: Yes. All right. Now, the lower drill there is Dear Alice. Well, you're supposed to get the intention, the phrase and so forth across to the preclear and it's supposed to go across to the preclear, and you'd say offhand that's more or less the same thing. No, it isn't at all. You have flattened it to some degree on a person. And a person isn't MEST. This is MEST. And you'd be sur-prised at the reactions of people trying to command MEST directly. Remember, people have-n't been in good communication with MEST. They haven't been telling it to do things for a very long time, just telling it to do things and it did them. And the backlog of this sort of thing, these failures and so forth, tend to go into restimulation when we run Tone 40 on an Object. You see, that's the essence of the drill. Now, all we want to have happen is that the individual gets across to this thing... Of course, he tells it to sit down, but it can't hear. He says, \"Sit down,\" and the intention for the thing to sit down definitely must arrive in the object, and the object must in itself be perme-ated with this intention to sit down. And when the object is down, the individual must now permeate it with the idea that it will accept or the willingness that it will accept his acknowl-edgement. See, this thing has got to be in a receptive mood. That's the intention that goes through for the acknowledgement to come through. Do you see that? And then the acknowl-edgement goes through. These are just two steps. That's one cycle, is \"Stand up.\" And we say to this thing, \"Stand up.\" Pick it up with a hand and say, \"Thank you.\" That's all. So the drill is composed simply of this, and this is idiotic in its simplicity. The reason we don't use Tone 40 commands on it is that the individual would have a tendency then to just groove these commands, you see. You know, he'd get used to them and he'd say that's fine, and he would be Tone 40 as long as he was using 8-C commands. Well we give him some other type of command, that it doesn't much matter, but this is the com-mand of the drill. First \"Sit down. Thank you. Stand up. Thank you.\" That's all there is to the drill.

But what I have told you about it is essen-tially the material that is used in coaching. And that is the way it's coached. Give you a little story about this drill. There was a girl on the London staff When I went over to London in April, I took with me CCH and these various drills and I started checking through the entire London auditing staff on these drills and bringing them up. Started it at that time. For one week one of the staff auditors there, a very pleasant girl, and usually a very good auditor, was auditing a preclear who was stark staring mad. This auditor, for some reason or other, was going all to pieces over the idea of auditing this girl. Evidently it was quite restimulative in some fashion or another, and she was being given a change of pace in auditing and this upset her, too. She was using a technique with which she wasn't fa-miliar. But it was very upsetting. Well, this person still had two weeks to go. So I said to this auditor, having listened to some of her auditing, \"You tell a rag doll at home to stand up and thank it, sit down and thank it. You practice it going back and forth to work. You do it at home. And you get that flat so that you can get an intention in there.\" She did it over the weekend. She came back, picked up this psycho by the scruff of the neck and for two weeks audited with no restimulation at a terrific level of accomplishment. Same auditor. The only difference – there had been no processing – the only difference had been that she had run for many hours Tone 40 on an Object on an old Raggedy Ann doll. Now, that was the sole difference there. Was quite a remarkable change for one auditor.

She simply did it. Now, that's what can be done with that. I have no idea what would happen if it were ran eighty or a hundred hours. I have no idea what would happen if the ultimate in coaching was used on it and each part of it was flattened. But I rather think, just as Joyce said, that all the MEST would be standing up on end.

TRs TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH LRH has been recently coaching, on tape, the TRs of Flag Auditors and Internes for many weeks. Each night Messengers have been lugging in a great batch of tape recorders, each containing one or more auditing tapes. Some real breakthroughs were made on TR training that have never been seen or re-leased. The Tech of making an assessment really impinge and read was completely wrapped up. Pcs, very early in this, began to comment that their Auditor was \"much better\". The Auditors had a great many wins. They are released here for your use in upgrading the quality of your org's auditing. TYPES OF TRs There are two different kinds of TRs. These are General TRs and Assessment TRs. General TRs are for use in regular auditing. They are natural, relaxed, while fully controlling the session and the pc. Assessment TRs are used to get a list to read. Assessment questions are delivered with impingement, the Auditor accenting or \"barking\" the last word and syllable. An assessment is done crisply and businesslike with real punch (not shouting) so each line is to the pc. This is not to say that an assessment is done Tone 40 or with antagonism. Its friendly but businesslike and impinged. TRAINING TIPS In training Auditors and Internes, the person supervising the TR Training, and tapes trains them first on General TRs to a pass, then on Assessment TRs to a pass. A full TRs pass requires both."},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 2 BTB 13.3.75R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 885 HPCS All previous tape cover notes to the Supervisor and his comments should be attached together in sequence so he can see that progress has been made and which points are being worked on. Care must be given to ensure that the Auditors learn how to set up a tape recorder, po-sition the mike so the Auditor and pc can be heard easily and keep the heads clean so that recordings are not faint but easily audible. The proper position of the mike is either hung from the ceiling a bit to the side of the Auditor and pc with the mike at the same height as the Audi-tor's face, or sticking out from under the meter behind the meter shield. A poor recording is as worthless as an illegible auditing report. The person supervising the TRs tapes (usually the Interne Super with a final pass by the Senior C/S or KOT) must not invalidate or evaluate for the Auditors but must use lots of encouragement and ARC. When an Auditor backslides the Supervisor must tell him not to backslide and see that the Auditor is sorted out and improving again. This TR training is not a pattycake affair, but must be demanding and tough enough to get the Auditors through it. Pc results are at stake. LRH has when warranted, ordered an Auditor to 12 hours a day TR Training and increased it to 14 hours a day to bring up the Auditor's necessity level and get him through it when he had been lagging and was overdue to fire to his org. GENERAL TRs TRAINING Tools used in General TR Training were LRH model auditing tapes, lots of Word Clearing, use of the TR Booklets, study of Original Thesis Primary Axioms (Chapter 2) and the rules that permit engram running (Chapter \"The Laws of Returning\"), use of Mood Drills (later described), drilling out attitudes about pcs that interfere with the session, knocking out automaticities by having the Auditor drill doing them, causatively and the TRs themselves. In knocking out faulty or inconsistent TRs, the tech used is to drill the entire scale from one extreme to another up and down. For example: Auditor has a problem with loudness and tends to mumble – have him drill the faulty TR 1 or 2 on a gradient from the barest mum-ble to Tone 40 and back again until it's cured. The idea is to get General TRs up to a level of real polish and consistency (not just barely passing one tape) so they are live, natural, interested in the pc, delivered to the pc, re-laxed and smooth. USE OF TR 0 TR 0 is ordered when it is obviously out, or when other TRs drills don't seem to be re-solving. TR 0 is used so that the Auditor can be with the pc easily, is comfortable in session and not anxious or impatient. TR 0 is ordered done where there is not much Auditor there in session."},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 3 BTB 13.3.75R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 886 HPCS TR 0 was ordered in recent TR training when the following showed up in the Auditors' tapes: when an Auditor was clearing his throat, when an Auditor was fumbling assessment lines, when TR 1 and 2 were way out and not improving, when an Auditor went mechanical in session, to handle a timid Auditor, when an Auditor's mood wasn't resolving with Mood Drills, when the pc was unaware of the Auditor and wasn't working well in session = not much Auditor there. TR 0 can also be used with Mood Drills and when knocking out an Auditor attitude that is interfering. What is usually ordered is to have the Auditor look over his attitude to pcs and drill that attitude to free it up, then practice other attitudes. And also do TR 0. TR 1 TR 1 in General TRs must be friendly and real, natural, positive with each command given in its own unit of time. Poor diction can get in the road and have to be drilled out. TR 1 must also be live and interested with adequate volume and crispness to arrive at the pc. Com-mands must be given without hesitation or being slowly dragged out because that gives a slow session pace and violates the rule on number of commands given and answered per unit of time determines gain. A lilt on TR 1 loses any impingement the question could have. It can be cured by drill-ing lilting and then the opposite, monotone, until the automaticity is broken. The opposite of this is where the Auditor drops the end of the line or swallows it. This also loses impingement and must be drilled out. An Auditor whose TR 1 is too soft and low volume can be ordered to do 50 foot TRs. A breathless TR 1 can be cured by having the Auditor practice being breathless to get rid of the automaticity. A timid Auditor can practice being a mean tiger to get the softness out of his TR 1. He should also review the Primary Axioms of Original Thesis. Timing is an important part of TR 1. Session pace depends on it. Where commands or questions are too far apart auditing time is extended. Flubbed command are out. Having to re-read a command is a flub and shouldn't be necessary if the Auditor drills the procedure so it's smooth. When taking questions or commands from an HCOB the Auditor can sound like he's reading the question and must learn to sound like he's saying when he's in fact reading. These were some of the points picked out on TR 1. TR 2 \"The essence of TR 2 is session control.\" \"The pc's comm is begun with TR 1 and con-trolled in flow with TR 2.\" (LRH) There are really different types of TR 2, a whole range that go from a ½ ack to a full ack up to a Tone 40 ack."},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 4 BTB 13.3.75R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 887 HPCS \"A full ack is really a stop ack. If you break it down, there's a degree of acks going from 'go on, I'm listening' order mutter to an 'okay, that's enough of this phase of this' to 'well we got through with that and that's it'. One doesn't use such words. It is done by tone and in-tention. It's called session control. There's also a Tone 40 ack which ends off the whole scene and that's that.\" (LRH) \"A half ack keeps the pc going and also keeps a pc from over-itsaing.\" \"Half ack when it is going to go on, like Earl Sim.\" (LRH) You use half acks to show the pc you are still there and to let him know you're interested. On R3R you use half acks on 1 to 8, full ack on 9, half acks on A to C and a full ack on D. Where a pc over-itsas it is caused by a slow TR 2, a lack of TR 2 especially half acks, too strong a half ack and over-acking. A lack of half acks shows up with a pc who is unaware of the Auditor and so is out of control or doesn't work well in session. Practice on half acks and full acks so as not to fall between and drilling acks that con-trol comm from making it continue to making it stop utterly, the full range of ½ acks to full acks to Tone 40 acks, cures an Auditor who flubs on the above. Where TR 2 is interruptive and overrides the end of the pc's answer, it will put the pc on a W/H. Practice on timing of TR 2 and perception of when the pc has said all corrects that. Double acks, multiple acks such as: \"OK. Good.\" and \"All right. Thank you. OK.\" are not OK and must be knocked out by drilling the Auditor so he learns to ack with one ack. TR 2 repeated makes an overack. Too cold a TR 2 can be corrected by Mood Drills (see below). TR 2 expresses mood and interest in the pc's incidents and itsa. TR 2 must be to the pc so he gets it. Sometimes an Auditor has TR 2 and the next TR 1 colliding, running together so that they nearly overlap. This is corrected by drilling timing of TR 1 and TR 2 and the next TR 1 so that each TR 1 is in its own unit of time and each TR 2 ends that comm cycle. Use of LRH model auditing tapes is necessary in training Auditors on TR 2. MOOD DRILLS Mood Drills were developed by LRH to handle stuck or fixated Auditor moods or where some Auditor's mood entered into the session would rough up or upset a pc or slow his progress. Mood Drills consist of TRs 1 to 4 done out of session on each tone level of the full tone scale, hitting each mood up and down the scale. The coach calls the mood, the Auditor does TRs 1 to 4 in that mood. It doesn't really require much coaching. \"You just start low on the scale and TR that mood then the next, then the next. Like all TRs done 'hopeless', etc. Lots of laughs doing it really. Doing TRs as a dead Auditor is pretty tricky.\" (LRH)"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 5 BTB 13.3.75R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 888 HPCS An Auditor drilling these must beware of mis-Us and make sure that he understands each mood (tone). Any moods that are too easy to do or too hard should be spotted by coach and Auditor and repeated until the automaticity is broken. Once begun mood drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the Auditor doesn't get stuck on the Tone Scale but can do any mood easily and without strain. \"TRs are a matter of sound not how an Auditor feels.\" (LRH) Where an Auditor is upset about his voice you can have him try – out of session – speaking melodiously, boringly, enthusiastically, until he can change his mood about at will. Mood drills can be done on TR 104 when R3R is mechanical, brush off, not interested or done with a set emotion. You have the Auditor drill TR 104 by mood, up and down the tone scale, and to the pc. The coach calls the mood as with TRs 1 to 4. 50 foot Mood Drills can be used to cure a fixed mood that doesn't seem to budge with regular Mood Drills. A timid Dn Auditor is cured with 104 at each mood level including doing it as a pan-ther, a lion, aggressive. As a bird, scared stiff. This breaks the automaticity. Mood Drills can be done on Assessments where the Auditor's mood would rough up the pc, where the assessment has an up lilt, or when it's dull or monotonous or when it's an out mood of any sort that's fouling up the Auditor's assessment. The Auditor can be drilled on assessments in the E-Meter Drill book at different moods or he can use a prepared list in a dummy session at different moods. Mood Drills can also be used to fix up a TR 1 that's too variable or rushed, on a set emotion, choppy, pushy, monotonous, sad, dreary and even on TR 2 when it's an out moods. Mood Drills are not only fun to do but also enable an Auditor to pass off a session without strain and without his own feelings interfering with it. The session will sound live, the Auditor will be interested in the pc and with good TRs get maximum pc gain. ASSESSMENTS Assessments are done to impinge and get a meter to read. The Auditor barks the last word and the last syllable so it does impinge. You don't go ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄\\, ̄ ̄ ̄ ̄\\. Go /, /.You don't drop your voice or downcurve your voice tone at the end of the line as that will cost you reads. You punch the last syllable to make it read, and to the pc. This is different from a lilt which is a —/. The accent is at the end of the sentence routinely, not on the earlier part. This must be drilled, drilled, drilled until the Auditor can do it easily and consistently with good bark. A lot of automaticities will come off with the drilling and it may sound \"strange\" at first but you'll be surprised at the reads you otherwise wouldn't get. An example is the line \"Were you ashamed to cause an upset\" (usual emphasis underlined) which when assessed goes \"Were you ashamed to cause an upset\" (bark on last syllable)."},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"TRS TRAINING BREAKTHROUGH 6 BTB 13.3.75R PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 889 HPCS Don't get the idea that assessments are harsh or forceful. You don't have to shout. They must be natural without strain, consistent, friendly but businesslike, with good impingement and bark. Done as above your assessments will read when they should and not when they shouldn't. VERBAL TECH Beware of verbal tech on TR training. You can detect verbal tech when several Audi-tors are making the same TR errors. Locate the source of the verbal tech, the \"expert\" giving advice and knock it out. It can cost you your results.

If he becomes too involved with the Bull-Baiting he can easily miss flunks on the Student. Also, buttons are not easily duplicated, as the action which caused the Student to break his confront might not have been seen. This either hangs the Student with a loss or puts him into self-coaching. Therefore, on these TRs involving more than 2 people (specifically TR People BB 1, BB 2, BB 3, BB 4) the Coach does not Ball-Bait. He is an additional person to those doing the drills as laid out in the Admin TR BTB. He stands or sits close to the Student and simply ob-serves him. If the Bull-Baiters cause the Student to break his confront or flub in any way, the Coach flunks the Student and ensures that the Bull-Baiters flatten the exact button that caused the reaction. In short, he controls the Whole TR. It is up to him to see that the Student gets the gains that can be his from doing the TRs standardly.

The setting is different for almost every pc. TOO LOW Too low a Sensitivity on some pcs (like Sens 5-32) will obscure reads and make them look like ticks. It will obscure an F/N. Whereas a Sens 16-128 will show reads and F/Ns. A pc can be hindered by the auditor not setting the Sensitivity high enough to show reads and F/Ns. Items are missed as well as F/Ns. TOO HIGH When auditing a flying pc or a Clear or OT the auditor who sets the Sensitivity too high gets weird impressions of the case. \"Latent reads\" on such a case are common. They aren't latent at all. What happens is that the F/N is more than a dial wide at high Sensitivity and a started F/N looks like a read as its sweep is stopped by the pin on the right of the dial. In this way uncharged items are taken up, the case is slowed, overrun and general up-sets requiring repairs occur. On one hand electrode an OT VII sometimes has a ¾ dial wide F/N at Sens 5-32. This would mean a 3/4 dial F/N at Sens 2-32 with two cans. A Clear sometimes has a floating TA at Sens 32-32 instead of an F/N. He would have to be run at Sens 3-32 two cans to keep him on a dial or detect F/Ns. This is a very important matter as the auditor will miss F/Ns, think beginning F/Ns are reads and as the Pre-OT is off the dial, miss reads. Thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed.

Here are some observations I have made on the coaching of E-Meter drills, which I feel could be of use: 1. The coach's needle is dirty. The student's out comm cycle has cut his comm in some way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cycle that went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles. 2. If a coach's TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that the student's comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach is either (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing. 3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed him and pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blow down. If there is no blow down, the coach has flunked the wrong thing. 4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although the needle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR 0) for lack of impingement and reach. 5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with the student. 6. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get the Meter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably – \"but I'm assessing the bank!\" They haven't realized that banks don't read, only thetans impinged upon by the bank – therefore the TR 1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meter responds proportion-ately to the amount of ARC in the Session. (See HCOB 29 Jan 70 for lists that don't read.) L.

First the Coach has the student give him the steps in order until he thoroughly understands them and could use them. When the Coach calls off situations, for example, the D of P says he doesn't have any PCs. Or, all PCs on lines need actions you cannot audit, etc. How will you get a PC? Keep throwing situations at the student Auditor until you are confident he could get a PC no matter what barriers existed. Flunks are given for any mishandling, or failing to satis-factorily obtain a PC. The student is passed when he knows how to get a PC. Steps: 1. Inform the D of P that a PC is needed. 2. Hound the D of P to assign you a PC, if he hasn't. 3. Independently go through current PC folders looking for any ready for an action you can do, get their Auditor to complete them to where you can audit them, fast. 4.

Position: Student seated at a table. Training Stress: Is on duplicating and understanding and learning the full Tone Scale \"Chi-nese School\" style. The first 3 parts are done with a twin coach. The last part can be done ei-ther singly – with a coach or in a group. Commands: No set commands. Steps: Part 1 – Method 8: 1. Take a copy of HCOB 25 SEPT 71 REV. 15 NOV 71, TONE SCALE IN FULL. 2. Starting with bottom of the scale and going up towards the top – clear each word of the Tone Scale per Method 8 HCOB. Part 2 – Examples: 1. The student Auditor tells his twin coach examples of actions that would indicate a per-son's tone level. (Note: The book Science of Survival is all about the Tone Scale and explains behavior on the different tone levels and should be read by all Auditors. 2. When the student has done this to his and the coach's satisfaction, go on to the next part. Part 3 – Acting it out: 1. The student now takes the Tone Scale HCOB and starts from the bottom up – drama-tizing each different tone level. His twin coach tries to guess which one he is doing. The student does this over again and again until he feels confident he can duplicate the various tone levels. Then the coach takes a turn and dramatizes the different tone lev-els and the student guesses which one he is portraying. This part of the Drill is done to the satisfaction of both the student and coach. When this point is reached, go on to the next part. Part 4 – Chinese School: 1.

Take some big card board or paper and print the Expanded Tone Scale on it with a felt tip pen of heavy ink. 3. This Drill can be done by one student and coach or with a group. 4. Coach has a pointer and starts from the bottom of the Tone Scale and works up to-wards the top in the following manner: The coach points and says \"Total Failure.\" Student(s) says after him: \"Total Failure.\" Coach points and says \"Can't Hide.\" Student(s): \"Can't Hide.\" And so on up to Serenity of Beingness. 5. This is cycled through several times until the student or group as a whole feels good about this step and is thoroughly familiar with the Tone levels. 6. In this step the coach points to the Tone level and says: \"What is this?\" Student(s): \"Total Failure.\" Coach(s): \"What is this?\" Student(s): \"Can't Hide.\" and so forth. Coach follows the Tone Scale from bottom up to the top of the scale until the student(s) is thoroughly familiar with it and can do it very fast. 7. When the student(s)get very good at the above steps, you can have them recite the Tone Levels without looking at the chart. In this way you can also tell how much more drilling may be needed in the event the Tone Levels are not yet known verbatim. History: Developed by L.

Commands: The following questions were designed to get a person \"involved\" so you can get an Emotional Reaction, (If you want to get real fancy, you can of course learn to do a proper Survey Question for the PL 7 Jan 72 Issue II, PR Series 14, \"Creating Survey Ques-tions\",) 1. \"What's the most obvious thing about me?\" 2. \"When was the last time you had your hair cut?\" 3. \"Do you think people do as much work now as they did fifty years ago?\" Steps: 1. The student takes a clipboard and paper and pen and goes out of the classroom and into the public to talk to strangers. 2. The student can tell public persons he is a public-opinion poll-taker from the Hubbard Research Foundation. 3. The student is to keep in mind the real purpose of going out and talking to people at all times. (This is to spot persons on the Tone Scale, their chronic Tone and social Tone.) 4. To gain proficiency, this Drill is done on a gradient A. Walk around and spot people on the Tone Scale. Just say to yourself what Tone Level each person is at until you feel confident that you can tell instantly where any person is on the Tone Scale, spotting their social Tone and actual Theta Tone. B. Now, decide to look for someone at a specific Tone Level. Walk around until you find someone at that Tone. Then pick another and go from there. Do this until you feel confident, making sure you spot both their social Tone and actual Theta Tone Level. C. Now take your clipboard and write your survey questions on it (if not already done) leaving a large space between questions. Mark the questions 1, 2, 3 or a, b, c. The second sheet of paper under your question sheet is marked 1, 2, 3 or a, b, c – also leaving a large space between the numbers. On this sheet is where you will quickly note the Tone Levels, social and Theta, by number. Now go up to someone and give them an R-factor that you are a public-opinion poll taker and you would like to ask him some survey questions. Ask your questions (as given above) and very quickly note the Tone Levels and any useful info you may want to jot down. Don't linger or fumble about with your papers – be efficient in your manner.

Now interview at least 15 people. With the first five, match their chronic tone as soon as you've spotted it and see what happens. Make brief notes after the inter-view. With the next five, you drop below their chronic tone and see what happens. Make brief notes after the interview. With the last five, as soon as you spot their chronic Tone, go a ½ to one tone higher than their and see what happens. Make brief notes after the interview. Do this drill until you feel very confident and have gained assurance in handling people and Tone Levels. History: Developed by L.

Purpose: To train the student to raise his awareness of the condition of the PC. Position: As described. Training Stress: An Auditor must be able to see when a PC has not eaten or slept, or what his tone level is, or is the PC auditable? 1. Student must know the Tone Scale levels verbatim, from HCOB 25 Sept 1971R 15 Nov 1971 \"TONE SCALE IN FULL\". Coach and student go around the Org. Coach has the student name the Tone Level of large numbers of persons until the student can spot a person's Tone Scale level instantly, and with certainty. 2. Then the coach has the student find someone who hasn't had enough sleep for a ses-sion. He must observe the physical and emotional aspects of the person and note these down. Do this on as many persons who haven't had enough sleep as possible. Coach then gets the student to tell him the characteristics of a person who hasn't had enough sleep. The Drill is done until the student can spot someone who hasn't had enough sleep instantly and with certainty. 3. Then the coach has the student find someone who hasn't eaten, with certainty. Do the same as in 2 above until the student knows the characteristics of a person who hasn't eaten, with certainty. 4. Then the coach has the student find persons who haven't had enough sleep and who have not eaten enough for a session with certainty. Write down these characteristics in combination.

Note: Both coach and student are expected to be familiar with the Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation (Science of Survival), and to have a copy of this chart. A disagreement between coach and student is not to develop into a Q&A session. It is handled by simple reference to this chart. History: Developed in 1971 by L. Ron Hubbard. ED – 11 SESSION SET UP PROCEDURES UNBULLBAITED ED – 12 (No bullbaiting on this Drill.) Purpose: To train the student in obnosis of preclears and in session set up procedures. Position: Student and coach seated at a table across from each other. Commands: No set commands. Training Stress: The steps below are drilled until the student can do the whole procedure flawlessly. All actions observations, notes made, steps 1-16 done in one minute. The coach gradually increases the stress, adds mannerisms which the student is to see and note down, and demonstrates in increasing degree of out points. The student is to see each single one and note it down. Flunks are given for incorrect procedure or out TRs. The Drill is passed when the student can do it flawlessly. Steps: 1. An E-Meter is set up on the table, shielded so coach can't see the TA. 2. Worksheets, auditing reports etc., are also behind the shield so the coach can't see what is written. 3. Under the E-Meter are reserve pens, minimum 3 extra blue (black) ones, a green one and a red one. (Reason – they may be needed for list corrections.) 4. E-Meter already switched on (having been trimmed and plugged in before coach ar-rives at table. 5. Coach sits down. Student may already be seated or sits down with coach. 6. A piece of paper with red writing on it (the current C/S lies face down between the ta-ble edge and the bottom of the E-Meter. 7. Student observes coach when he comes in and sits down. 8. Student watches for indicators: A. Skin tone. B. Expression on face. C. Tone level. D. Mannerisms – twitching eyes, trembling, nail biting etc. 9. Student notes these down on W/S, very briefly."},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"BASIC AUDITING DRILLS 10 BTB 20.7.74 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 925 HPCS 10. Student observes characteristics of lack of sleep if the slightest bit suspicious asks coachs \"How many hours of sleep have you had?\" (Note: He does not asks \"Have you had enough sleep?\" for obvious reasons.) Similarly obnoses for lack of food, drugs etc. In this manner he assures that the Auditor's Code does not get broken. 11. Tells the Coach, \"Pick up the Cans please.\" 12. Checks the coach's grip on the cans. 13. Student assures throughout the Drill that the cans are held in such a position that he can always see them. 14. E-Meter and worksheets are aligned so the student can see them and the coach (PC) at one time. 15. Student observes coach and sees whether or not the coach is ready to begin session. 16. Student then says \"This is the session.\" (Tone 40.) ED – 13 SPOTTING BAD INDICATORS UNBULLBAITED ED – 14 (No bullbaiting on this Drill.) Refs: HCOB 29 JULY 1964 GOOD INDICATORS AT LOWER LEVELS. BTB 26 APRIL 1969 BAD INDICATORS Purpose: To train the student in obnosis of the PC as a continued action and to teach the stu-dent Auditor that auditing does not occur to the degree that the Auditor is not with the PC. Position: Coach and student Auditor seated at a table across from one another with a full ses-sion set up. Commands: \"Do birds fly?\"; \"Do fish swim?\" Training Stress: This Drill is done with perfect TR 0-IV. Coach uses \"fruits\" for verbaliza-tions (eg. \"There is a banana on the table.\" etc.), and is not permitted to enter his own case into situations. Flunks are given for any failure to spot and note any bad indicator, or for any out TR. The Drill is passed when the student can flawlessly spot bad indicators. Steps: 1. Verifies session set up procedures have been done. 2. Notes coach is ready to be asked the first question. 3. Both student and coach have a copy of HCOB 29 July 64 GOOD INDICATORS AT LOWER LEVELS, and a copy of BTB 26 April 69 BAD INDICATORS. 4. The coach dramatizes one of the bad indicators. Student spots it and notes it down. 5.

Position: Student and coach seated at a table across from each other with a full session set up. Commands: No set commands. Student Auditor uses phrases from \"Alice in Wonderland\" with the \"He said\" omitted. Training Stress: To train an auditor to clear an auditing command fully with TRs O-IV in. Steps: 1. Just before the coach gives a \"Start\" the Student Auditor takes a phrase from the book \"Alice in Wonderland\" with the \"He said\" omitted and writes it down. 2. The coach then gives a \"Start.\" and the student Auditor gives an R-factor \"We are go-ing to run a process called.\" Student makes up a name, using a fruit word(s) or a word(s) from \"Alice\". 3. The student also says \"We'll clear the command first.\" 3A. The Auditor makes sure the PC is holding the cans and watches the Meter for reads while clearing the words and the command. 4. The student then clears each word of the command, starting with the last word in the command. (In other words, clear the command words backwards.) 5. For any word the PC – coach does not know the definition of, the student Auditor opens the dictionary and finds each word to be cleared (one at a time of course). He has the \"PC\" read the definitions and use the word in sentences until the PC feels good about it and understands it. 6. The coach meanwhile is holding the cans in his lap and can simulate Meter reads by can squeezes. 7. When all the single words are cleared, the student then clears the whole command and watches the Meter for a read."},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"BASIC AUDITING DRILLS 12 BTB 20.7.74 PROFESSIONAL COURSE SUPERVISOR 927 HPCS 8. The student Auditor must be sure the \"PC\" coach fully understands the command. 9. The Drill is coached on a gradient, handling one thing at a time. 10. The coach throws in misunderstand word phenomena becoming more and more diffi-cult until the student Auditor can handle the randomity of clearing words and com-mands. The coach then bullbaits him on a gradient to a flawless performance and a pass.

Position: Student and coach seated facing each other across a table with a full session set up. Commands: \"Do birds fly?\" or \"Do fish swim?\" Training Stress: The student Auditor is trained to see a process cycle to complete EP effort-lessly and flawlessly. Steps: 1. Coach gives student a \"Start\" and student gives command \"Do birds fly?\" or \"Do fish swim?\". 2. Coach answers as in TR 4. He ensures that the student's TRs are in. 3. When the coach has observed that the student's TRs are in, he proceeds to simulate an End Phenomena using a pen to simulate a small FN which is gradually being widened as the \"PC\" cognites. 4. Coach talks, looks at student, looks away, looks at student etc. 5. The Student Auditor obnoses coach until he sees coach has said all, the needle is float-ing widely, coach has VGIs and is in PT, ie. no longer introverted. 6. Student Auditor then indicates the FN by saying as though agreeing with the \"PC\" – \"Your needle is floating.\" ED – 19 HANDWRITING DRILL UNBULLBAITED ED – 20 (No bullbaiting on this Drill.)
