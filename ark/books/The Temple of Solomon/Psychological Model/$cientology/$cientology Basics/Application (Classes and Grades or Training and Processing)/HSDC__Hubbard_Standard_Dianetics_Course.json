Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades” entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not “entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Trouble spots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are “no results” or “bad results”. Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 2 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 3 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to “eat crow”. On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular”, “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 4 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opin-ion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank that says we must fail. So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor’s report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 5 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”. All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That Process X didn’t work.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your audi-tor’s report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just a knack he has” is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 6 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that lets eve-rybody down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead than incapable.” Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 HSDC 7 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of “unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student's progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs.

Remimeo All Hats BPI SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY For some years we have had a word „squirreling”. It means altering Scientology, off-beat practices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why. Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or a perfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system. In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workable system. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another. Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of Scientology. Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact mark-ings in the tunnels. It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out. It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also a clear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth. Therefore it is a workable system, a route that can be traveled. What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy guide. What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure the su-pervisor knew worked. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor. What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You’d think he was a pretty heartless guide. You’d expect him to say at least, „Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn’t go that way.” All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his pre-clear eventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition? People have following the route mixed up with „the right to have their own ideas.” Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions – so long as these do not bar the route out for self and others."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY 2 HCO PL 14.2.65 HSDC    12    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth. If there were no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in the sticky dark, alone. Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess. So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. He isn’t following the route. Scientology is a new thing – it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all the sales-manship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routes are being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery. Scientology is the only workable system Man has. It has already taken people toward higher IQ, better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor. Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now the route only needs to be walked. So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don’t let them off of it no mat-ter how fascinating the side roads seem to them. And move them on up and out. Squirreling is today destructive of a workable system. Don’t let your party down. By whatever means, keep them on the route. And they’ll be free.

The conditions of a new preclear are these: (a) Doesn’t know what is supposed to happen. (b) May be under the stress of being embarrassed to talk to someone. (c) May have preconceived ideas of how he is supposed to respond to the auditor (such as psychoanalytic “free association” where he just talks, etc). (d) May be waiting for some magical effect entirely independent of his own participation (as in getting a “shot” from a doctor). It is too much to ask of a being to: 1. Talk to another intimately about himself, 2. Fumbling with a new activity while 3. Confronting his own bank. Possibly he has never done any of the three before and to ask him to do them all at once...... well! All cases are started in their lowest ability level since they have not had it increased. Whereas they may be quite well off as human beings, they do not know how well off they might become. The wrong thing to do is to enforce their improvement with a sales talk or evaluation on how well they did in the session. And it is wrong to go on auditing them while they essentially remain in mystery.

If he is on narcotics he must come off them and have been off them for a while (in Los Angeles they say six weeks), before resuming his auditing. If on resuming auditing the preclear still does not gain despite 7 cases, a careful and full medical clinical examination should be ordered as the preclear is medically ill in some previously unsuspected fashion. This is covered in HCO B 12 March 1969, “Physically Ill Pcs”. Should this not prove to be the case, or if the pc does not get well then apply the HCO B of 2 April 1969, “Dianetic Assists”, an auditing assist as given in that HCO B. Above all, don’t let unnecessary stops occur on this line for pcs who just sail through. In a recent glance over the case folders of some stalled or “chronically ill” pcs I found the main sin was simply “No Auditing” occurring in the following ways: Case 1 – 3 case supervision directions carefully and correctly advised but none of them done. No other auditing was done either. Then a fourth case supervision direction on top ignoring the folder and advising something else but that was not done either. Case 2 – Preclear chronically doing badly. Was being “audited” but hadn’t a clue. Was not up to talking to an auditor at all. (I ordered TRs and the auditor did them, the pc bloomed and went on up the grades splendidly.) Case 3 – Pc all crippled up from old injuries. In the folder I found no C/Ses there had been done as ordered. Also found the pc had sneaked his folder and done some wild self au-diting before auditing could be done. (Ordered HCO B 12 March 1969, Touch Assists and then medical treatment to set a long time broken back.) Case 4 – Pc told the auditor in the session she had a secondary sitting right there and was in it. And although had bad indicators in, the auditor just ended the session. Case 5 – Pc ordered in for a Review, was given the cans, the auditor said “That’s it”, pc went off in mystery. Case 6 – Pc shaking and fevered but no physical illness according to doctor. Auditor A did an S & D. Pc still not well. A few weeks later illness recurred. I got hold of the pc, asked when the shaking had begun, found an engram where the pc had been withholding being cold, ran it, pc totally recovered. The incident had occurred only a day before Auditor A’s session. Had Auditor A merely asked what had been going on he would have found it at once, run it and that would have been that. It was only an auditing assist that was needed which is why I wrote HCO B 2 April 1969, “Dianetic Assists”. It hadn’t ever occurred to me that auditors wouldn’t use the principle of engram running to handle a pc who hurt. So it adds up to the fact that just not doing auditing is a fundamental error. That’s what’s meant by “no auditing” in the 7 Resistive Cases of a Class VIII. Auditing just wasn’t used to handle the pc. “No Auditing.”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"NEW PRECLEARS – THE WORKABILITY 4 HCOB 5.4.69 OF SCIENTOLOGY HSDC    16    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The new pc who hasn’t a clue what auditing is is apt to get a lot of “No auditing”.

The troubled pc who is all introverted with a real physical or mental problem had jolly well better get it handled, as in the “Physically Ill Pcs” HCO B 12 March 1969 or with Dianetic Assist as per HCO B 2 April 1969. You don’t just sail on up the grades and throw them away. If you ever get an area that thinks Dianetics and Scientology don’t work (which is about as silly as saying there is no gravity) then: (a) You have an area that has been infiltrated and the tech performance perverted; or (b) You have a person around who is terrified that it will work and others grown more powerful will now destroy him (which surrenders casewise to “Physically Ill Pcs” or the top Power Process used first followed by sub-zeros and grades); or (c) You have a narcotic-silly area and are not making them desist before auditing or han-dling their past addiction by running out its engrams; or (d) You have an area that just isn’t auditing at all; or (e) You are not handling new pcs as we used to and as recommended in this HCO B. As a final remark, I have seen a person get “audited all the way to the top” who wasn’t ever audited at all. As a comment this is pretty bad but a close check revealed that a large per-cent did not even know the content or action of a key grade below where they were supposed to have “arrived”. They had zero indoctrination as a pc and had not ever made even the sub-zero of ARC Straight Wire. So lay this down, Case Supervisors and auditors all, as a firm cast-in-concrete rule: If your pc does not obtain a total reality on having had gains beyond his expecta-tions, auditing has not been done in the first place or the pc is on drugs or physically ill. I look at it this way, auditing is terribly simple. Turn me loose with an E-Meter and a pc and up the line he comes. If he doesn’t or can’t respond he’s seriously ill. If he’s that ill that he can’t be audited he needs medical treatment. And when he’s had that, back to the me-ter and I’ll show you a shining pc. You say, yes, that’s you. You know and can do it. Sure, sure, sure. But anyone who has studied his meter, his books and bulletins can do it just as easily. If the pc answers his questions and if he does audit. L.

Any person not recovering his health and sense of well being by use of Dianetic audit-ing should be given by competent medical and clinical doctors or technicians a thorough physical examination to locate the illness, structural or pathological (disease), which is trou-bling him and introverting him. Scientology healing and mental treatment policies apply to Scientology. Dianetics is fully excepted from these policies. This is in view of the strong and increasing interest and cooperation of individual medical doctors over the world which should be continued and promoted. This policy does not include turning any person over to institutions or practitioners engaged in political treatment and expressly does not allow the use of such political treatment as electric shock, lobotomies, brain „operation“ or drugs producing convulsions. This policy does permit surgical and structural operations including the alleviation of concussion or skull fractures or the removal of brain tumors but only after they are proven to exist beyond any doubt by competent clinical examination. It does not include exploratory operation. The severance of nerves to „end psychosis“ is expressly condemned and the use of produced convulsion by any means to „alleviate psychosis“ and the practice of euthanasia (mercy killing) or any barbaric torturous or murderous or terrifying treatment or approach are not only not condoned but should be actively fought due to the non-therapeutic results, the immediate or early demise of the „patient“ and to the efforts to use these „treatments“ to ef-fect political ends. The persons using these means actively financed and fought Dianetics and Scientology over the world and were the sole source of repression of a valuable sincere and vital breakthrough in the field of healing as consistently demonstrated.

For many years, 1950 onward, a Dianetic auditor was proudly capable of resolving mental and physical problems by his ability to find and run engrams and secondaries. The Dianetic auditor had no other skill or tools than his understanding of mental im-age pictures, as locks, secondaries and engrams and the time track. With these tools he produced many miracles. Broken bones healed in two weeks in-stead of six, withered limbs restored, burns vanished, swellings reduced visibly to nothing, lives wrecked by grief and loss recovered, women lost their aging wrinkles and sought-after abilities returned. The percentage of win was above 50%, which is double that of former approaches. The use of the E-Meter and my development of R-3-R increased this percentage. Dianetic training was usually one month in length and attained a high percentage of successful graduates who could attain excellent results. Dianetics operates at the level of the human being and is addressed mainly to the body and mind. It does not attempt and should not be confused with the end product of Scientology which is spiritual freedom. The end product of Dianetics is a well, happy, high IQ human be-ing. Dianetics is itself and has its place. When one can handle Dianetics so as to make peo-ple well and happy, one can then begin to think of and work on the higher aspects of Scien-tology. To attempt to obtain the results of Scientology by applying only Dianetics is in fact a confusion of objectives. The Dianetic auditor, whether the „very best people“ behind governments like it or not, is the natural inheritor of all mental healing. Working in conjunction with bona fide physical healers such as the actual practicing medical doctor, the Dianetic auditor, with only the skills taught on the Dianetic Course, could all but eradicate psychosomatic illness and mental illness on this planet. Tens of thousands of cases in Dianetics show this is no idle boast. The recent breakthrough showing most insanity is common physical illness untreated, adds up to making such an objective a fact."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"FUNDAMENTAL AUDITING 2 HCOB 6.4.69 HSDC    20    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The Scientology auditor is all too often balked by the fact that his preclear comes to him already ill. His preclear is below being a well human being. That is part of the gradient. If the Scientology auditor is not also a good Dianetic auditor he tends to ignore the fact that his preclear is not yet up to being a well human being. Applying Grade Processing the Scientology auditor has already skipped a grade – a well human being. He therefore fails to understand that his preclear is simply seeking to es-cape as a thetan the gradient of being a well being. The role of Dianetics, let us face it, is that of a healing science. It is the most advanced mental science man has. It should not be skimped or scanted. A good Dianetic auditor can handle the bulk of psychosomatic illness and speed the healing of ordinary illness or make it possible for the person to recover. Mental aberration as such can be handled in Dianetics if it works in conjunction with other valid branches of physical healing. There is then a demarcation between Dianetics and Scientology. The Dianetic audi-tor’s skills reach up to and include a well, happy human being. This is in excess of man’s hope for any mental science. The Scientology auditor is working for increased ability and spiritual freedom. And that is far in excess of any dream of accomplishment man has had including Buddhism. When we get a sick human being being handled to make him spiritually free we get a confusion and are likely to fail. The Scientology auditor who is also a good basic Dianetics auditor can make that be-ing well enough, using Dianetics and available healing skills, to succeed with Scientology objectives. But it has become plain, particularly in the last few months when I have been sorting out materials to communicate them better, that there is a vast difference between Dianetics and Scientology. A Dianetic preclear is one who is being processed toward the objective of a well and happy human being. A Scientology preclear is a well, happy human being who is being proc-essed toward total ability and spiritual freedom. Those two definitions should be well learned. It will prevent much confusion and some failures. When I hear of a preclear „getting his Grade IV to get rid of his headaches“ I really groan. A preclear „getting his Grade IV“ obviously never got his Dianetic auditing and the auditors who audited him were mixed up. I would never never never audit a pc on grades if I found before me a sick person.

It may sound peculiar or too obvious to say that. But this fact has to be stressed since it was found to be the leading reason for non-recovery. Even this has its degrees of error. 1st is just no auditing. A case wasn’t audited at all. No session, no auditor, no auditing. Complaint, „I’m a Scientologist I still have awful headaches.” Sounds real incriminating. The fact is in this question „Did anybody run the engram?” „No, just grades.” Dianetics wasn’t used at all. The next degree is starting in on a lock, secondary, engram or chain of them and not completing it to erasure. Running the pc through one engram once with no good Indicators or erasure and then calling it a session is really no auditing. Next session you must complete the action started. The next degree is to get rid of one chronic somatic or sensation and then fail to carry on when the pc has others too. The most recent discovery I made was that an illness has several sources expressed each one as a different sensation, ache, pain or emotion. Every one of these is out of a men-tal image picture or the series of them called a chain. The degree of omission in applying Dianetics is that one did not take up each sepa-rately stated or assessed symptom and erase its source – that particular mental image picture. The vast majority of Dianetic cases I have case supervised now have this in common – No Auditing in one or more instances outlined above. Really it’s kind of „corny” as an error.

While a thetan can produce illness, it is the body that is ill. Thus Dianetics is used to knock out and erase illnesses, unwanted sensations, misemo-tion, somatics, pain, etc. Scientology and its grades are never used for such things. Scientology is used to increase spiritual freedom, intelligence, ability, to produce im-mortality. To mix the two has been a very bad error. Dianetics came before Scientology. It disposed of body illness and the difficulties a thetan was having with his body. This was a Present Time Problem to the thetan. In the pres-ence of a PTP no case gain results (an old discovery). When a thetan has body discomfort or upset solved, he could then go on with what he really wanted which were the improvements to be found in Scientology. Mixing the two practices in any way produced and will produce no real case gain. Sci-entology grades will only occasionally get rid of body ills and Dianetics will not achieve real spiritual freedom. Used within their own areas they both each one separately achieves that for which it was intended. Dianetics can make a well body, Scientology can make a recovered thetan.

I found that Dianetics had been forgotten for a dozen years and was being given a light brush-off as a course and that auditors and pcs were trying to use Scientology grades to han-dle body ills such as headaches, chronic somatics and so on. Man's usual PTP is his body. So if one gave him gold ornaments he'd try to use them to cure his aches and pains. Thus Dianetics was forgotten and unused and Scientology was being made to attempt cures. Thus they were, both subjects, busily being made to fail to some degree. Dianetics as it now exists is so simple, so elementary and so broadly applicable to the body that it requires a real effort to complicate it or make it unworking.

When a group seeks to forward only what is currently acceptable it of course stalls all progress. Further it is dishonest to suppress or fail to reveal scientific discoveries. Disagreeing with the Law of Gravity could give one some very bad falls. Pre-Dianetic mental studies customarily threw out anything that did not agree with their pet theories or would be „unpopular“ with authorities. Such was the dishonesty practised in the humanities that the whole field had fallen into brutal hands. Dianetics had to encounter the Dark Age atmosphere which then prevailed, complete with torture and murder of the insane. The facts are that what the auditor believes has little to do with the preclear’s reality. If a practitioner challenges or demands proof of a patient’s data the patient becomes ill – that is the bald fact of it. It’s part of the Auditor’s Code. As far as past lives are concerned, if you don’t run mental image pictures from past lives when they come up on a chain, the preclear will not recover. A pathetic case of this occurred in early research. A girl crippled by polio was able to throw away her crutches after my first session. And would have become entirely well except that she recalled seeing and hearing Lincoln give his Gettysburg address. Her mother con-demned her for such nonsense. The girl’s lameness was confirmed and perpetuated by this and by a psychotic father who raved at me for daring to suggest such things. I didn’t suggest anything. In auditing the girl she suddenly came up with being at Gettysburg listening to Lin-coln. Seems a bit cruel to condemn a young girl to a lifetime of lameness just to satisfy a fixed idea. The weird idea is that one only lives but once."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PAST LIVES 2 HCOB 23.4.69 III HSDC    28    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE We have several times traced the graves of pcs in a special project and they usually came up correct. One pc was very upset to find his friend has failed to erect the fitting paid for tombstone, substituting a common slab, possibly to pocket the difference. Some pcs have been so overwhelmed in the past by some great figure that they go into his valence in that life. This often throws discredit on past lives. I recall one girl who had been every famous figure in history who when we got her in valence turned up to have been only a victim to them. The great generals and politicians of history, it must be sadly remarked, aren’t easily distinguished from mass murderers. But even famous figures are somewhere. Past lives as a subject is made distasteful, possibly purposely, by some who, by fearing to have been a nobody and seeking status, talk loudly to others about having been Napoleon, Julius Caesar and Brutus all at the same time. In a society which tries to hide in the current identity or seeks to mortalize everyone and make people only animals the subject of past lives can be a difficult one socially. The truth in auditing is, if you don’t run the incidents given by the pc he doesn’t get well. One spectacular recovery of an insane woman occurred when she ran an incident as a lion who ate her keeper. Freudian work hadn’t been able to crack the case. The alienist at the sanitarium kept her in with trying to explain how it was all delusion (the current technique pre-Dianetics). A Dianetic Auditor found and ran it and she became sane at once and stayed so. It is not the auditor’s role to handle the philosophic or social aspects of incidents. To chide a pc for having an anti-social engram or a record of a crime or to challenge his data or refuse him his past life will bar his road to recovery and is itself a crime. It will be found that Man is basically good. Only his aberrations are bad. When you run out his engrams he becomes social and reverts to being good. Auditing is auditing. Audit what the pc has to audit. Leave the social aspects of the case to others. It’s not the auditor’s job. L.

It has worked and well since 1950. In some areas, mainly the US, it was illegal to heal or cure anything. There was even a law in California giving 25 illnesses that were against the law to cure. The “Better” Business Bureau in the US even issues pamphlets that state that “You can always tell a fake healer be-cause he says he can cure something”. Why a civilization would make it illegal to cure illness can only be explained by some vested interest making more money out of people being sick than getting people well. There existed a continual threat to anyone who helped their fellows. The ability of Scientology to bring about spiritual freedom therefore received the con-centration of effort by organisations. Lately public opinion has turned heavily against these suppressive groups and the pub-lic discovery that illegal seizure, torture and murder was the hidden activity of political psy-chiatric groups has lost these people their support. It was overlooked that spiritual healing of the body has not been illegal and that Dianetics used for pastoral counseling is completely legal. It is a sobering thought that the only effective technology of psychosomatic healing – Dianetics – could be suppressed out of full usage. One is handling the effect of the spirit on the body. Therefore even Dianetics is spiri-tual healing and as such is far from illegal. Man should not be kept ill just to let a few have a monopoly. In almost all other countries than the US there is no restriction on healing despite mo-nopolistic efforts to make one. Another reason Dianetics was for some time out of use was that it was believed it had been superseded by Scientology which it never was in fact. Dianetics can be done with no reference whatever to Scientology or its techniques. People who have given up through illness are also prone to want to leave. Instead of confronting their illness it is easier to try to get away from it.

But if they have a sick body, it is a present time problem and inhibits attaining the spiritual freedom they seek. The correct procedure is to make them well wherever possible with medical treatment and to handle their psychosomatic illnesses with Dianetics and then, before any further abuses by life can occur, to raise their ability and secure their freedom with Scientology. This is the correct use of Dianetics. It is the remedy for psychosomatic illness. The basic use of Dianetics is to make a well body and to augment physical treatment. Any injurious experience can be erased by Dianetics. It is very easy to use and if one wants people well and happy it should be used at every occasion. A person has an operation. This should be followed soon after by the erasure of the engram of the experience by R-3-R and the usual Dianetic auditor actions. The healing time will be greatly speeded and often healing will occur where a relapse might have followed. A woman has a child. The engram of delivery should be run out soon after. The result of doing so is very spectacular. There is no “postpartum psychosis” or dislike of the child and no permanent injury to the mother. It is in fact best to audit the mother both before and after the delivery, which gives one fast relatively painless childbirth and quick recovery. Recovery from disease under treatment is speeded by Dianetic auditing. Where the incident of the break is, with any chain, run out, a broken limb will heal (by X-ray evidence) in two instead of six weeks. Some patients who are not responding to medical treatment who are then given as lit-tle as a touch assist will then be found responsive to the medical treatment. An auditor giving the person a Dianetic session will more or less ensure that the medical treatment will now work. A person who is accident prone when audited usually loses this unwanted characteris-tic. Many “insane” recover from their symptoms when given proper medical treatment, rest, no harassment and then good mild Dianetic processing. They become and remain normal people without relapse. Chronic, which is to say, long-term illnesses cease when audited by Dianetics and then medical treatment, which was earlier ineffective. Whole classes of “mentally retarded” children have been made more normal by teach-ers in London County Council schools using relatively unskilled Dianetics. Tiredness, unwanted sensations, bizarre pains and aches, bad hearing or sight also rou-tinely respond to Dianetic processing. The sickness and death rate of persons who are part of Dianetic groups is only a small fraction of that of other groups. Pilots audited with Dianetics, by a test involving a whole squadron, went without a single even minor accident for the following year."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"DIANETIC USE 3 HCOB 24.4.69 HSDC    31    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Scientists audited with Dianetics have greatly improved intelligence. Dianetics raises IQ as a side product to usual auditing, at a rate of about one point of IQ per hour of process-ing. Withered limbs, skin blotches and rashes and even blindness and deafness have all re-sponded to Dianetics. Possibly the point which counted most against Dianetics in the early attacks on it was that it did a vast array of things. The truth was, it actually did them. When you have the an-swer to the human mind as in Dianetics of course anything caused by the mind can be reme-died. It is very much easier to train a Dianetic auditor than a Scientology auditor. It requires only about a month to make a Dianetic auditor who is sufficiently conversant with the subject to get results. This too was used against Dianetics as the psychiatrist of that day claimed he himself needed twelve years of study to do psychiatry. Of course when the public found out that the product of these twelve years of study was killing the “insane” and increasing their number the argument became silly. The spectacular personal gains which were available in Scientology were so great they tended to obscure the very real use and value of Dianetics. Further, a Scientology executive trained and processed beyond the need of body help tended to forget that much of the public out there first had to be helped out of their physical misery before they could attempt anything like personal gain. You use Dianetics much the way you would use any remedy. When a fellow is burned you audit out the burn. When a woman loses a loved one you audit out the loss. When a young man can’t finish his schooling you audit out his unhappy school ex-periences. Dianetics is for Use. There is not a lot of admin about it. It isn’t something you use af-ter bowing down three times to Chicago. You just use it. A Dianetic auditor who sees someone sick and who doesn’t get him treatment and then audit him is just not humane. Woman going to have a baby – get out the meter and audit her into shape for it. When she’s had it, run out the delivery. Fellow burns his hand, break out the meter. Dianetics is the answer to human suffering. Use it. Ideas build up to halt the use of Dianetics such as “once you have a floating needle on engrams you don’t run them any more – -”. That’s silly. An F/N on a chain can be called the end of that chain.

I was"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"DIANETIC USE 4 HCOB 24.4.69 HSDC    32    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE engaged for many years researching and completing Scientology. I had not noticed and had not said that Dianetics must be preserved and used in all cases of psychosomatic illness or in physical suffering. Yet, during all this time when I had to handle illness, I did not use Scientology. I used good old Dianetics. Now I have refined it and made a better statement of it and made it easier to use and I trust it will be used for what it was intended and that Scientology grades will be relieved of the burden of attempting to heal physical illness, a use for which it was never designed. Scientology is a vital practice in itself. It places a person above any further illness or suffering. But he has to be made well first. People will ask, “Deafness? Now what special process is needed in curing deaf-ness......?” This is one of the modern refinements of Dianetics. One runs whatever is assessed for the preclear. He doesn’t decide to cure somebody of deafness. He handles the illness that reads. Maybe it will be deafness. You have one single procedure covering all cases and that is R-3-R and the steps of HCOB 16 Apr 69. You audit what reads when assessed. The whole of the person’s com-plaints, if you just keep on going with HCOB 16 Apr 69, should eventually vanish. Having gotten the pc well by medical care and Dianetic auditing, then start out with Scientology. If he gets sick again before many grades, revert to Dianetics, handle it and then when he is well, resume Scientology where you left off. Never run a Scientology grade to make a pc well or cure something. It’s a misapplica-tion. By using Dianetics as readily as you use shoes you can make and keep people well. You don’t worry about overruns, rudiments or anything else. You just use R-3-R even to cor-rect ARC Breaks and PTPs and bad auditing. By then correctly using Scientology we can make the person a far better being. We now have Standard Dianetics. We have developed Scientology Standard Tech. Both are now valid as themselves.

Also, sometimes you get a Dianetic result while auditing Scientology. This tends to keep the two distinctly different subjects confused with each other. A preclear, after Dianetic auditing, tells the Examiner he is exterior and feeling fantas-tically bright. This is a Scientology result. Sometimes a Scientology preclear after attaining a grade will state that it has healed his terror stomach. This is a Dianetic result. There is nothing whatever wrong with this except that it gives an auditor an invitation to confuse the subjects and think they are the same. The clue is consistency. Dianetics only rarely exteriorises a preclear. Scientology only occasionally handles a terror stomach. In fact a person whose terror stomach wasn’t handled by Dianetics and its R3R can go all the way to OT VI sometimes with it. He doesn’t get rid of the terror stomach and he doesn’t (since he had a present time problem all the way) make OT VI either. If it is a body pain, sensation, somatic, illness, disability, the subject to use is Dianet-ics. If it is a gain in ability and beingness that is the purpose, the subject to use is Scientol-ogy. After many years of handling cases this emerged as a very factual fact. Dianetics is Dianetics, Scientology is Scientology. If you mix them they attain limited results. This is so true that when you use all the prohibitives and Never Nevers of Scientology in doing Dianetics, Dianetics also fails. See these two subjects as clearly separate.

It is basically so simple it is hard to conceive that this could happen. But it has happened several times and was a contributing cause to its lack of use in several areas for some years. There are various ways to make Dianetics difficult. Most of these come under three headings: 1. False information as to how it doesn’t work by some vested interest acting as a third party (see HCO B 26 Dec 68 on 3rd Party Law). 2. Failure to provide or get studied the actual data and HCOBs. 3. Mis-instructing which enters an instructor’s or examiner’s opinion or invalidation or alteration of the actual technology. A person who pays attention to 1 and 3 and who doesn’t insist on 2 is courting failure in auditing. Many many instances exist of each of these three being done and almost all fail-ures one has in auditing can be traced to one of the three reasons given above. The failures aren’t because of the pc or the bad intention of the auditor. Believe that. They came from either not using Dianetics at all or 1, 2 or 3 above.

This has often occurred in the history of technical developments. An example is Dr. Semmelweis’s discovery of the cause and cure of childbed fever. For over half a century after that women still died in agony after child-bearing. Eventually the culture caught up to it and the illness which had accounted for a huge percentage of female deaths ceased to exist. Dr. Semmelweis’s discovery of its prevention was “ahead of its time”. Pathetically, scoffed and disbelieved, he even died to prove he was right. The atomic bomb was wholly feasible more than a decade before it was “developed”. No one credited it and no one put up the cash. The radio telephone was invented and demonstrated half a century before it was gen-erally used. Cultural lag occurs for many reasons. In any field as retarded as the human sciences the emergence of Dianetics and Scien-tology, full and workable and complete, is startling. And thereby subject to disbelief. This does not mean they aren’t used and useful. It is significant that hundreds of aerospace technicians, working with satellites and rocketry, broadly used Scientology first. At the same time parliaments in some socially back-ward countries were busy passing laws against Scientology to protect their psychiatrists whose medieval approach was to seize people without any process of law and castrate them and saw out brains as a “cure” for mental illness. In a world where governments are fighting to dominate men’s minds, mental technol-ogy is needed to protect the individual and to prevent the enslavement of all. So Dianetics and Scientology may be a century ahead of their times but still they are just in time before we all go up in smoke. Dianetics was the first practical workable easily taught science of the mind. It has en-dured already 19 years and is better and more used than ever before. L.

Man has used mental knowledge in the past mainly for control, politics and propa-ganda. The word „psychology” in the popular usage is synonymous with „getting around” somebody. In the thousands of years before 1950 there were many philosophers and much knowl-edge was gathered in the field of logic, mathematics, electronics and the material sciences. However, due to ideologies and political conflicts, little of this prior knowledge was ever applied to the field of the human mind. The scientific idea of regarding as a truth only that which could be demonstrated with a result was never really applied to the mind. „Researchers” in this field were not fully trained in mathematics, the scientific method or logic. They were interested mainly in their own private ideas and in political Targets. As an example, the only „schools” of psychology taught or followed in the West were Russian and East German. The primary school was that of Ivan Petrovitch Pavlov (1849 – 1936) a veterinarian. Every school child and university student was required to study Pavlov in one disguise or another. The burden of Pavlov’s work is that man is an animal and only works through „con-ditioning”. The Western nations overlooked the fact that this work had already destroyed sev-eral countries including Czarist Russia, that Stalin had made Pavlov write up his work in the Kremlin in 1928 in order to permit the control of men. Using the mental studies of an enemy is a very dangerous thing to do. The West at that time was run by only the „very best people” and possibly it pleased them greatly to think that the masses they controlled were only animals after all. That this also made them animals did not occur to them. Billions of dollars were appropriated by parliaments and congress to subsidize men to „better control” their animals. These men had no idea of healing anyone or helping anyone. Riots and civil disorder were the only product they achieved."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"DIANETICS ITS BACKGROUND 2 HCOB 22.5.69 HSDC    42    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Dianetics was released straight into the teeth of these heavily subsidized Barons of the Mind with their „it takes 12 years to make a psychiatrist” and „authority states” and „any ef-fort to interrupt this monopoly must be stamped out at once”. Psychology and psychiatry were state (government) subjects, pushed by the „very best people”. They could not make their way on their own because they were contrary to the public morals and customs. The public actually wanted nothing to do with them. In mental institutions torture, permanent damage and death were the order of the day, on the basis that it did not matter if one killed people as they were just animals anyway. So the public was on the side of Dianetics (and later Scientology) and the governments were on the side of the „very best people”. Press, controlled by governments and intelligence services and the „very best people”, lied endlessly about Dianetics (and Scientology). Dianetics, a new valid mental science, was pitted against Russian and Eastern Euro-pean teachings. Dianetics is not only the first mental science developed in the West, it is the first men-tal science on the planet that uniformly produces beneficial results. Man is being subjected to fantastic and violent efforts to lure or crush him into docil-ity. This is the obvious end product of Russian and Eastern European technologies now heav-ily financed and supported, unwittingly, by Western governments. Man’s response to this is riots and civil disorder in the universities, unions and streets. Man does not accurately trace the source of his oppression. He is violently worried. The government response has been more millions to psychologists and psychiatrists to develop new means of control and oppression. What has not worked in the past is not likely to work in the present or the future. Czarist Russia, the entire Balkans, Poland, Germany and many more Eastern European countries have already perished trying to use the work of Pavlov, Wundt and others. The en-tire West, having „bought” the same governing ideas, is now in turmoil and is perishing in its turn. Dianetics refuses to be a revolutionary activity. It does not have to be. All it has as a mission is to get itself applied. The basic building block of a society is the individual. From individuals groups are built. And this is the society. No society is better than its basic building blocks. Men are not animals. Well men are sane men. Dianetics, if applied to individuals in the society, brings hope, well and sane beings. These well and sane beings, sent on to Scientology, then become brilliant and very able beings."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DIANETICS ITS BACKGROUND 3 HCOB 22.5.69 HSDC    43    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE We are evolving Man to a higher state.

Dianetics was first conceived in 1930 and the developments of 39 years have gone into producing Standard Dianetics. Dianetics: The Original Thesis was published in 1949 in manuscript form. It was cop-ied in various ways, hand to hand across the world. Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science was published in late 1949. Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health was published May 9, 1950 and has since sold millions of copies. In the early ‘50s new discoveries concerning the spirit brought us into Scientology. But Dianetics was never lost sight of and every little while I would push it further ahead toward a fast, easy, 100% workability. The present release of Standard Dianetics is a near final product. If done exactly, it produces good, permanent results in only a few hours of auditing. One can train a Dianetic auditor in Standard Dianetics in from 10 days to a month at the most, with an average of about 2 weeks. These are very, very worthwhile advances and Standard Dianetics is almost as great a breakthrough in 1969 as the Original Thesis in 1949. Hundreds of thousands of hours of search and research have gone into it. Dianetics has progressed from the pre-Dianetic period of no science of the mind, to the existence of a real science of the mind, to a fast accurate science simpler than any other scien-tific subject and of more value to Man. All this advance has been very hardly won, without government billions, in the teeth of avalanches of lies and opposition. The subject owes no allegiance to anyone but itself. It has no commitments to anyone. It has no politics. It belongs to those who use it. It is the only game in the universe where everyone wins. Let’s keep it that way. L.

The auditor is often called upon to handle psychiatric abuses. Auditors should know some facts about psychiatry. PAIN ASSOCIATION As a technical action, it is of interest to any auditor to know that Pain and Ideas is a basic “therapy” used down the years by psychiatrists and such lot. The practice is very general and very old. The person is made to associate his “wrong ideas” with pain so that he “will not have these ideas”, or will be “prevented from doing those things”. A crude current example is to electric shock a person every time he smokes a ciga-rette. After several “treatments” he is supposed to associate the pain with the idea and so “give up smoking”. Homosexual tendencies are also so “treated”. In earlier times alcoholism was “cured” by putting poison in drinks so drinking would make the person violently ill so he would “stop it”. Examples of this are all over the time track. The mechanism is “If you get this idea you will feel this pain” Zap! Basically this is the action of an implanter. Current use of it will be encountered where psychiatry has been busy implanting. This is a pinnacle, an all, of psychiatric “treatment”. Another version of it is drugs. Make the person too torpid (sluggish) to have any ideas. The motto of this is “too dead to act”. Institutions are emptied by hooking psychotics and “community psychiatry” exists “to make them take their pills”, in short, to keep them hooked. This started the current drug craze that spread into “illegal” drugs. The auditor will encounter this with growing frequency as the business of it is so big that one group spends 12 billion in advertising alone per year! This is the Rockefeller drug cartel. They also spend vast sums in lobbying parliaments."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHIATRIST AT WORK 2 HCOB 16.7.70 HSDC    46    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE OBSESSION Most “got to’s” or obsessions come from Pain Association or drug association. People in pain or drugged can become obsessed with doing the idea. What the psychiatrist does not care to publicize is that his “cures” are implantings with compulsive ideas. The smoker so treated now must smoke but can’t smoke. These two things are op-posed. That is known as frustration – a form of insanity. Must reach can’t reach, must withdraw can’t withdraw is total basic insanity. Thus psychiatry is making insane people. This is why the insanity statistic is soaring and why the crime statistic is on a wild climb. The psychiatrist if he handled his field well and did really effective work would have a declining insanity and crime statistic. That the psychiatrist and his “technology” has been in charge during the whole period of these alarming statistics is ignored by governments. The psychiatrist argues that he needs more money and more practitioners. But he gets money by the billion. The state has to totally support them because the public will have noth-ing to do with them. Psychiatric care in a private hospital costs $30,000.$2,000 a month for board only is the price at Walnut Lodge in Washington DC, an average place. £60 a week is charged in England for a shabby room. “Care” is extra if it exists. Psychoanalysis costs £9,000 for a full and ineffective course, takes 5 years, 30% sui-cide in the first 3 months. Psychiatric treatment runs 5 times the total cost of every course, grade and action available in Scientology orgs. SKILL LEVEL Any has knows more and can do more about the mind than any psychiatrist. There is no real level of comparison since psychiatry as used is a destructive technol-ogy. Under a “drug treatment” engram you often find savage electric shocks of execution strength buried. It is doubtful if one could watch an electric shock “treatment” without vomiting. In “neurosurgery” the Ice Pick is used to rip and tear up people’s brains.

His principal organization, World Federation of Mental Health, and its members, the National Associations of Mental Health, the “American” Psychi-atric Association and the “American” Psychological Association are directly connected to Russia. Even the British Broadcasting Company has stated that psychiatry and the KGB (Rus-sian Secret Police) operate in direct collusion. A member of the WFMH sits on every major “Advisory Council” of the U.S. govern-ment, to name one government. Ministers of Health or Health Authorities are members of the National Association or the WFMH. The psychiatrist has masters. DOCUMENTATION All these statements are the subject of total documentation in the hands of Scientol-ogy. SUMMARY The auditor in auditing uncovers considerable data in former psychiatric cases. Further an auditor can put to rights a case so abused unless a fatal injury has been done. As psychiatry circulates rumours about auditors and attempts to discourage the use of Dianetics and Scientology, it is only fair for the auditor to know exactly the status of psychia-try and psychology as used today. It goes without saying that the savagery and fraud of psychiatry must cease and that auditors must encourage in state and public and through all their connections displacing psy-chiatric abuses with sane auditing.

It occurs when the postulate made during the basic incident on the chain is gotten off. A Lock is a mental image picture of an incident where one was knowingly or unknow-ingly reminded of a secondary or engram. It does not itself contain a blow or a burn or impact and is not any major cause of misemotion. It does not contain unconsciousness. It may con-tain a feeling of pain or illness, etc., but is not itself the source of it. Example: one sees a cake, feels sick. This is a lock on an engram of being made sick by eating cake. The picture of see-ing a cake and feeling sick is a lock on (is locked to) the incident (unseen at the moment) of getting sick eating cake. When one finds a lock it can be run like any other mental image pic-ture. A Secondary is a mental image picture of a moment of severe and shocking loss or threat of loss which contains misemotion such as anger, fear, grief, apathy or „deathfulness.” It is a mental image recording of a time of severe mental stress. It may contain unconscious-ness. When it is restimulated by a similar but lighter experience another mental image picture is recorded which becomes a lock on the secondary and serves to keep the secondary alive. A secondary is called a secondary because it itself depends upon an earlier engram with similar data but real pain, etc. An Engram is a mental image picture which is a recording of a time of physical pain and unconsciousness. It must by definition have impact or injury as part of its content. It is of the very greatest importance that a Dianetic auditor really grasp what these things are. Otherwise he won’t know what he is doing or to what. Now because he isn’t seeing his preclear’s pictures an auditor can become very care-less about them and not handle them correctly. If an auditor doesn’t really know what these things are (erasure, locks, secondaries, engrams) he cannot of course hope to handle them for the preclear."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 2 HCOB 23.4.69RA HSDC    50    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The basic Dianetic errors are just not knowing what these are and that they are there to be handled and that these and these alone cause psychosomatic ills. Once one has a full grip on these definitions he can then and only then hope to do any-thing with them for the preclear. If the auditor is going to handle the aches, pains, unwanted sensations and psychoso-matic illnesses of the preclear, it requires that he fully grasp these basic definitions. Literally millions of complications can stem from the simple fact that a preclear re-cords experiences in mental image pictures and that these thereafter can affect his body ad-versely. Once one really understands that mental image pictures are all there is in the pre-clear’s „mind” one has understood the total of aberration. There is not something else there. No „id,” no „ego.” There are only mental image pictures. These, if you use the exact procedures of Dianetics, can be found and erased. When the unwanted locks, secondaries and engrams are erased the preclear will be rid of the physical disabilities of which he complains and will be well physically. Somatic – means essentially body sensation, illness or pain or discomfort. „Soma” means body. Hence Psycho Somatic or pains stemming from the mind. Misemotion – anything that is unpleasant emotion such as antagonism, anger, fear, grief, apathy or a death feeling. This is the entire breadth of Dianetics today. In Scientology we deal with the thetan, the being who is the individual and who han-dles and lives in the body. This is beyond the scope of today’s Dianetics. If a preclear is well physically made so by Dianetics and any required physical medi-cation or nutrition, he can then embark on Scientology, the increase of his abilities and spiri-tual freedom. If a preclear who is being audited or has been audited on Scientology grades becomes ill one does not try to make him well by giving him new higher grades. That has been an error of great magnitude. Instead one reverts to Dianetic Auditing until the pc is well and only then continues with Scientology. This is correct procedure because it works. People „come into Scientology” to cure their headaches. Somebody starts them off on grade auditing, several grades later they still have their headache. It is a continual present time problem to them and the auditor. It sometimes vanishes during grade processing. This gives an unfortunate win."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 3 HCOB 23.4.69RA HSDC    51    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The right thing to have done was give the person Dianetic Auditing, until he or she no longer had headaches and then begin to audit the person on grades so as to put them well above ever again getting headaches. Continual headaches come from mental image pictures retained by the pc of having a head crushed or shot off or hit. That is an engram. It actually had to happen. It is not imagi-nary or delusion. The proof is that when the auditor finally erases the engram the recording of the injury is gone and the headaches will not again occur. The preclear often is unable to confront the actual engram at once. He offers one a Lock, a time when he had a headache. One „runs” this lock (one always runs whatever is of-fered, you don’t force the pc) and finds after putting the preclear through it a couple of times that it is getting more solid or it simply isn’t erasing. One finds an earlier recording. This possibly turns out to be a secondary. The pc had a moment of loss and cried and also had a headache. This secondary may or may not erase. If it does one leaves it of course as finished. But if it goes more solid (shown by TA rising at the end of a run through the incident – or if the pc says it is going more solid) one then asks for an earlier incident. One probably would then get the actual engram, a recording of a time when the head was actually injured. The auditor runs this through and as soon as he has completed a run through the in-cident and discovered (from the rising TA or the pc) that the incident is going more solid, he asks for an earlier incident. This one erases. When it erases the whole chain of headaches also erases. And that is the end of the pc’s headaches period. One then inquires after other somatics or sensations and handles them the same way. It is all done by using the technique called R3RA without variation. Since these recordings contain mainly other-determinedness (pictures of others doing things) the auditor always has more control over the preclear’s mental image pictures than the preclear does. Thus the pictures do what the auditor says. This point too must be grasped by an auditor or he will be waiting on the preclear to act or move in time. The Time Track is the consecutive record of mental image pictures which accumu-lates through the preclear’s life or lives. It is very exactly dated. Pleasure Moments are mental image pictures containing pleasure sensations. They respond to R3RA. One seldom addresses them unless the preclear is fixated on some type of „pleasure” to a point where it has become highly aberrated."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 4 HCOB 23.4.69RA HSDC    52    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Black Field is just some part of a mental image picture where the preclear is looking at blackness. It is part of some lock, secondary or engram. In Scientology it can occur (rarely) when the pc is exterior, looking at something black. It responds to R3RA. Invisible Field is just a part of some lock, secondary or engram that is „invisible.” It like a black field responds to R3RA. Pressure Somatic is, in Dianetics, considered to be a symptom in a lock, secondary or engram, simply part of the content. Whatever, the symptom pain sensation, whatever, it is from either the body directly (such as a broken bone, a gallstone or immediate physical cause) or is part of the content of a mental image picture – lock, secondary or engram. The Dianetic auditor does not audit ideas or think. He is handling mental recordings. Ideas are in them. Ideas come out of them. But think is no longer part of Dianetics. In Dianetics we handle locks, secondaries and engrams. Key-In is the action of recording a lock on a secondary or engram. Key-Out is an action of the engram or secondary dropping away without being erased. Dianetic F/Ns are handled differently than Scientology F/Ns. An F/N seen by the auditor in running R3RA is not called until the full Dianetic EP is reached. An auditor running R3RA is not looking for F/Ns. He is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running. The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in its place. Release the postulate and the chain blows. That’s it. The auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/N and end off auditing that chain. An F/N seen as the incident is erasing is not called. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate the erasure has occurred. The auditor will see an F/N and VGIs. Now the F/N is called. F/Ns are not indicated until the EP of postulate off, F/N and VGIs is reached. It’s the postulate – not the F/N that we are going for in New Era Dianetics. Multiple Illness – means the preclear is physically uncomfortable or ill from several engrams of different types all restimulated. One runs one somatic chain at a time, running each new symptom that is assessed or stated by the preclear. Chain means a series of recordings of similar experiences. A chain has engrams, sec-ondaries and locks. Example – head injury chain in the sequence encountered by an auditor and run by R3RA – sporting goods display window seeing it (lock), losing a bat (secondary),"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 5 HCOB 23.4.69RA HSDC    53    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE hit in the head with a bat (engram). The engram is the earliest date, the secondary a later date, the lock the most recent. By using somatics to trace back (meaning discomforts, complaints, sensations, aches, pains) and by staying on the chain of only one somatic (i.e. headaches) you get back down the single chain without dispersing all over the place into different chains. Thus one runs the chain of one particular somatic or discomfort or complaint down to key-out or erasure before doing the next somatic or discomfort or complaint. Automatic Bank – when a pc gets picture after picture after picture all out of control. This occurs when one isn’t following an assessed somatic or complaint or has chosen the wrong one or one which the pc is not ready to confront or by overwhelming the pc with rough TRs or going very non-standard. Some pcs turn up in their first session with automatic banks. The thing to do is carefully assess the physical complaint for longest or best read and gently handle that chain well. Basic – this is the first experience recorded in mental image pictures of the type of pain, sensation, discomfort, etc. Every chain has its basic. It is a peculiarity and a fact that when one gets down to the basic on a chain (a) the postulate made at the time of the incident comes off and (b) the whole chain vanishes for good. Basic is simply earliest. Unburdening – as a basic is not at once available on any chain one usually unburdens it by running later engrams, secondaries and locks. The act of unburdening would be digging off the top to get at the bottom as in moving sand. As you run off later incidents, the ability of the preclear to confront it also increases and basic is easy to run when finally contacted. Basic Basic – this belongs in Scientology. It is wholly beyond the scope of Dianetics. It means the most basic basic of all basics and results in clearing. It is found on the Clearing Course. If contacted or run before the pc was brought up through the Scientology grades, he wouldn’t be able to handle it anyway as experience has shown. So this is part of Scientology, not Dianetics. Valence is the form and identity of the preclear or another, the beingness. Ally – a person from whom one had sympathy and was dependent upon. Assess in Dianetics means choose, from a list or statements, which item or thing has the longest read or the pc’s interest. The longest read will also have the pc’s interest oddly enough. If you know these definitions cold so you don’t have to mutter them or memorize them but just know them, you will really get results with Dianetics. The biggest failure in training auditors was their faulty grasp of what they were ad-dressing and their additive think."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"DIANETICS; BASIC DEFINITIONS 6 HCOB 23.4.69RA HSDC    54    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The discoveries of Dianetics were basic and vital and opened a wide new unexplored frontier. These words were assigned to things arbitrarily. They had to be. Man had not had any notion of these things before so they had no names and had to be assigned names. The names were chosen because they didn’t also mean something else in another field of science. The terms are therefore important and what they mean and the things they name must be grasped before success can attend any auditing. Any failures of Dianetic auditors were not the failures of Dianetics. The persons at-tempting to audit others didn’t know what these things were, essentially the lock, the secon-dary, the engram, erasure and key-out.

The Dianetic auditor uses R3R to get a preclear to locate and examine the chains on his time track which cause him discomfort in present time. The feeling chains (pains, soreness, physical sensation) are the ones that relieve what's wrong with the preclear. Therefore, the Dianetic auditor asks for and follows down only feelings. Those can be attitudes, emotions, sensations or pains. Somatic: essentially body sensation, illness, pain or discomfort. Soma means body. By using somatics (meaning discomforts, complaints, sensations, aches, pains) to trace back and by staying on the chain of only one somatic (i.e. headaches) you get back down the single chain without dispersing all over the place into different chains.

The person's Dianetic auditing is now complete. He still has other engrams, but these are not in restimulation and so do not get in his way or cause pain or illness. These may never restimulate in the entire life of the pc, but if any should, the pc can receive more Dianetics at any time.

Thank you. Thank you very much, that’s a nice welcome. Well now, today we’re getting down to business. We’re getting down to business, and this is the 21st of July 1966, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, a lecture on Dianetic audit-ing. I go away, and right away everybody forgets how to audit. No, the processes today are so fast, they’re so rapid, that an auditor cannot be trained. That’s it. I mean, it's as simple as that. I recognized this some time ago, and back in April wrote a bulletin which covered this which has actually not been put into action yet and which is being put into action right now, and I think went into action at 2 – 2:00 P.M. That’s it. Ron’s back. [laughs] All right. The main thing about this is that if auditors can’t audit, why, then no audit-ing gets done. Now, that’s very, very horribly true. And then nobody will make it up the line at all. And it’s also factually true that our first Clears are uniformly good auditors. But today I turned a pc over to an auditor, and he didn’t know enough to flatten the process. Pc went un-conscious so he changed the process. Huhoo! That’s awful. That’s awful. Don’t do things like that! So the guy goes unconscious. All right. Get your question answered. So a pc says he can’t answer the question, just sit there till he does. If a pc has no more answers and so forth, the process probably went free needle and you didn’t notice. It probably is already squared away. But don’t just change a process because a pc went unconscious. Do you see? These are the little truisms of auditing. Man to man and man to girl I make a plea: Follow the fundamentals. Get your auditing question answered. It’s a plea. Don’t change processes because the pc goes out like a light. Don’t panic; don’t be a psychiatrist. Now, if goofs like that can occur, it’s because one doesn’t have enough drill. But drill just on the TRs is not adequate to produce the whole of auditing phenomena for the auditor, and so he doesn’t get used to handling them and he – it’s like a greased ball in his hands, you know? Like, \"Let’s see. It said in the bulletin that the next thing I huh-hah-and-yeah, and I hope that’s right.\" And the pc goes Release – and so he says he gets no more practice with that."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 2 21.7.66 HSDC    82    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Well, I can assure you Dianetic auditing carried on this way is not likely to release anybody very rapidly, and if it does, it only releases him on a chain. If you get any Releases in this, they’re subzero Releases – way down. Now, I have made Releases with Dianetic auditing, and so on, and they were the first Clears. It’s not too hard to do. But of course, they were simply Keyed-Out Clears which today we call Releases. Those people remained stable or didn’t remain stable or something of the sort, but it completely changed their lives. The trouble I had in those days was the person felt so good – and there was no training, of course, pre-50 – they just walked away. I kept tabs on them for some years from time to time but somebody stole my book and I don’t have any idea what happened to them. But I can tell you that these people were in much better shape. They really weren’t up to a Grade 0 Release but they were certainly in much better shape. Some-thing had happened. So there’s value in this type of auditing. But I wish to make you another plea: is don’t go out and use it in practice. It’s practice auditing. Don’t practice with it on people. Because all sorts of disastrous things will occur If you become an expert Dianetic auditor then we’re all in trouble because we will start curing everything, you know, and knocking out psychosis and neurosis and doing all those poor doctors out of their jobs. And you don’t want to do any doctors out of their jobs. [laughter] But I say this in all sincerity, this leads you in to the fact that you can heal, and that is not your profession. You’re trying to clear people, and these processes will heal people, even badly run. They’ll cure migraine headaches and arthritis and lumbosis and medicosis and all kinds of wild illnesses. But it doesn’t necessarily follow that it’s uniform. In other words, you don’t get one for one for one, you see, for the excellent reason that the whole reactive mind is the reason for very severe illnesses. It’s the whole mind. And you can key out parts of it and make somebody quite well, you see. You can key out some very specific illness like that and have it go away but it – don’t be too surprised if it comes back. So therefore, \"cure\" is a – is not well used. It’s ill-advised as a word. The way to make somebody well is to make a thetan Clear, and just never, never de-part from that and you’ll be fine. But you do need practice – I’m not – don’t use \"you\" broadly, but you as an Instructor, you as a Scientologist and the new student all need some process which doesn’t produce an instantaneous result. And then you get so that you can han-dle ARC breaks and you can handle a comm cycle and you can do this and you can do that. And you get practice. You can sit there and grind away by the hour, don’t you see? You can use a meter; you can fool around with this and that and so on. You could go on a project like cleaning up all the engrams of the last three lives. Well, you’re not likely to release anybody doing this but it’s awfully interesting – great interest to the auditor, great interest to the pc. You might change some things; you might improve somebody. We’re not interested in that particularly. But it’s quite rewarding, quite rewarding for the pc, but we’re only interested in the auditor in this particular case, you see? Now, the auditor will get so that he knows that a pc who is being critical has got a withhold. And he knows enough to get his question answered. And he knows enough not to"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 3 21.7.66 HSDC    83    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE overrun. I mean, the pc completely runs out of answers. Well, you should recognize that the pc has done so and it isn’t just a dodge. He’s not a very imaginative pc. You say, \"Where did you put the cat?\" And the fellow says, \"In the living room.\" Now, there’s no point in now saying, \"Where did you put the cat?\" because there aren’t any more answers to it. And sometimes you get into this squirrel cage and you must recognize these things. But the way to learn how to audit is to get your hands dirty and the dirtiest you can get your hands is going down the reactive bank on the time track. Now, there aren’t any bugs in Dianetic auditing; there aren’t any bugs in it. They’ve all been ironed out. Even visio – there is a way to turn on somebody’s visio so he can see the picture. There is a way to do this. All you do is get the duration of the incident and if you get the exact duration of the incident, the boy will have visio in it. It’s the most remarkable thing you ever saw. So you’d have to know how to get the duration of an incident. You know, if he was being hit on the head with a sledgehammer, you have to know if he was hit on the head for one minute or five minutes or one day, you see? All right, if you get the correct time on your meter and so on... This fellow, it’s all black – this case is a black five; he’s never seen pictures or anything like that – if you get the exact point where he’s parked on the track with your meter, and then you get the exact duration of the incident, bang, he has visio. Startles him most to pieces. That’s what used to chop us down in running en-grams, and so forth. Well now, one has to go into this from the most basic and elementary possible ways; the most fundamental fundamentals have to be gone into to teach somebody something about Dianetic auditing. Now, there is a book on the subject, Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health. But to give you this practice material I have condensed Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health into HCO Bulletin 3 April 1966 which is one, two, three, four, five pages long. You get brighter as you get older, you know, in the process. And I wish to point out that HCOB 3 April 1966 is a far simpler and better method of running secondaries and en-grams than Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health. So, if you’re reading this and read Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health, realize that this bulletin written sixteen years later takes precedence. You got it? Now, there’s a lot of dope in Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health, but it runs engrams quite differently; it runs them by repeater technique, it runs them by phrases, it does all kinds of things, and so on. Whereas this doesn’t run them by repeater technique and run phrases. Now the main danger that you run into, then, is not really reading what it says in this bulletin and actually trying to run Dianetics secondaries and engrams the way it is described in Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health, you see? You let some of the old Dianetic technique get into this bulletin and you will have to that degree just this much trouble. Now, a Dianetic session today would look like a repetitive auditing session with this single exception: that it takes longer for the pc to answer the question. If you tell him to go through it and tell everything that has happened, and so on, that is an auditing command, but"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 4 21.7.66 HSDC    84    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE it may take him five minutes to answer it. And I – the only danger is, is I don’t want you to pick up the idea that your pc ought to gab, gab, gab on Grade 0 processes, and so forth, any more than it takes him to answer the question. We don’t want the pc continuously itsaing. Well now, he isn’t continually itsaing. He’s told you – you tell him to go through it and say what happened. And when you tell him this, why, he then goes through it and says what happened. When that finishes oft why, you give him a final acknowledgment. Sometimes he gets scared or lonesome and you have to give him an \"Uh-huh\" to en-courage him, but this is a sort of a half-acknowledgment. If you give him too many of those, he’ll start talking to you obsessively because he feels that he’s got more to say and you’ve already acknowledged him. So get your half-acknowledgments really half, you know – \"Uh-huh,\" you know? \"Uh-huh.\" Don’t say \"Good!!\" you know? Now, if you really want to start him talking, just do that to him a time or two. Then he’ll feel that you’re stopping him from talking, and so he will then talk more and more and more. These continuously talking pcs, where the auditor never has a chance to get a question in edgewise, have either been trained in the field of psychoanalysis or the auditor is overacknowledging and the pc is trying to get past that acknowledgment. So anyway, you’ve got a lot to learn about auditing, and it’s about auditing that you are learning while you’re running Dianetic auditing. But to use Dianetic auditing at all you have to know something about Dianetic auditing. That brings us back to a subject called the human mind. Now, there was a fellow one time called Sigmund Freud, and Sigmund Freud started out on an adventure in hypnotism with a fellow by the name of Breuer to explore the entirety of the human mind. And he ex-plored it down to a light lock at three years of age and figured out he had done the whole works. That’s something like looking at a mountain, telling everybody you have found the en-tire mountain because you now are holding a pebble. See, a little pebble came off the top of the mountain or the tip of a blade of grass growing on the top of the mountain, then you’d say that’s the whole mountain, you see? But he had this occasional experience, that after he had let somebody chatter for a while he would find some kind of a childhood experience of some kind or another – and maybe that was his own case he was running, who knows – and he would – he would take some charge off of this, and all of a sudden the person would feel a little bit better and then he would be told, \"Now if you are very, very careful for the next thirty years, you will not be neurotic anymore.\" That was psychoanalysis – 1894, he released the libido theory saying that all life is based on sex. Now that is maybe an unkind statement with regard to the libido theory – libido for love – but nevertheless that was it. Later-year psychoanalysts had an awful lot of trouble trying to explain away this and say that what Freud really meant was that life was based on social things as well as sex. But Freud didn’t say that. He said it was based on love. Now, this guy Freud, in spite of all of that, was a sharpie, and he did discover that there was possibly some coordination between mental reaction or mental experience and psy-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 5 21.7.66 HSDC    85    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE chosomatic illnesses or illnesses – physical illnesses stemming from the mind. He discovered that there was this relationship, only he didn’t have any proof for it, and how medicine has gone on believing it ever since has got me staggered. Because he couldn’t do it one for one. So of course, therefore, it was not really proved. But medicine today believes there is such a thing called psychosomatic illness. You understand? They think there are physical illnesses that stem from the mind. Well now, how they know this, I don’t know. Because, you see, they’ve never proven it, because they can’t take somebody’s lumbosis and get away with it by doing something with the mind. You fol-low? But we can. So it’s quite factual that physical illness can result from mental aberration. Now, we’re not much interested in the vagaries of neurosis and psychosis and all that sort of thing. Let somebody else worry about these, or use more basic processes. Or if you got a psychotic, put him someplace where it’s nice and quiet, and where he gets something to eat and nobody disturbs him for a long time, and where he feels safe. And let him look at a mo-tionless object that has some mass as the common thing for him to do, and you will find out that he generally will come out of it. As far as neurosis is concerned, neurosis is – the difference between neurosis and psy-chosis is that psychosis, the guy is just generally the effect of everything, and in neurosis, why, he’s more or less singly the effect of things. It’s – he’s a deranged being on some sub-ject. Now, all of this is very easy to say today, and it’s very easy to cover. If you want to know more about it, read – read some things about – on psychoanalysis and so forth. Good practice for you to do so. Nobody is trying to make a psychoanalyst out of you but it might – you might be curious about it. You won’t find very much there, and knowing Dianetics you will read far more into what you are reading than was ever there. They didn’t know what was there. Now, let’s get into this subject called the mind. The mind is a record, a literal record, of experience plotted against time from the earliest moment of aberration until now, plus ad-ditional ideas the fellow got about it, plus other things he may have mocked up or created on top of it in mental mass, plus some machines, plus some valences. Joe Doakes is a monster, Joe Doakes beats him up, therefore Joe Doakes is the winning valence, and after that he can keep a valence called Joe Doakes. Got the idea? Now, it’s just those pluses. But all of those pluses – you can audit almost any of those things. The least profitable is to audit the machines. It’s very often a lot of fun to audit a ma-chine. When I say a machine, I mean it has wheels and smokestacks, and so forth. And every once in a while a thetan has got a machine parked out there. This isn’t very uniform, but you have to comment on it. You have to comment on it. Now, valences are interesting because they make circuits, and these circuits will talk to the being. He can talk to them and they talk to him. Oh, he has a ball. And very, very dis-turbing, this idea of circuit. This gave the Arab his psychotherapy. And the Arab psychother-apy was to chase out the demons, and what he was really talking about were these valences."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 6 21.7.66 HSDC    86    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, the auditor can actually talk to the pc and get the pc to talk to the demon or the valence, and have the valence talk to the pc – talk to the auditor. It gets that complex. What it is, an endowed life object. Now, when we say record or when we say mass and so forth, we are speaking of men-tal mass. A thetan is quite capable of mocking up mass. He actually is quite capable of mock-ing up matter, energy, space and time. He’s quite capable of doing this, only he mocks it up in a very – in his aberrated, wog condition, he mocks it up in a very thin – very thin indeed. Its proportionate weight would be terribly slight compared to the real objects which he is mock-ing up a picture of. He mocks up a picture of a car; his picture of the car would probably be one-hundred-billionth of a gram would be the total weight connected with it, and the car weighs two tons, you see? But nevertheless, he can mock up a full picture of a car in his aber-rated condition. When he gets better and when he’s no longer sick or human, and so forth, why, of course, he can mock up a car. But that’s beside the point. We’re getting off into more advanced therapies now. Now, here’s the score with regard to the mind, then. For auditing purposes, it has these valences and that’s what you are working with when you do what’s called a Search and Dis-covery or an S&D. You’re not working with mental image pictures; you’re working with va-lences. You’re trying to find the valence that is raising the devil with him. Every once in a while you miss because he is the valence that is raising the devil with him. Sometimes, if you wanted to really do a profound S&D that went the whole track, you’d say, \"Who are you?\" You’d possibly even get a suppressive. But that’d be a very, very fundamental S&D. The psychiatrist and the psychoanalyst more and more began to try to address what the person was creating, and they began to consider that everything there was there, it was what the person was creating. I said there’s the things the guy mocks up in his mind, you see. Well, so they addressed the things that the person had himself created, and they are not very aberra-tive. They’re the lightest of aberrations. So the fellow says, \"I think the room is full of Martians,\" and their immediate therapy is \"You’re just imagining it.\" You possibly, through accounts of hospitals and that sort of thing, know that that is the standard response. Well, that’s because they’re addressing the illu-sion or the unactual. They think the unactual or the illusion is what is wrong with the person. Actually, what is wrong with the person is that he is producing illusion and you want to find out why he is producing illusion; then you have to get down to the cause of the pro-duction of illusion. Not, \"Oh well, you’re just imagining it, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones is crazy; he thinks he’s prime minister, see? He thinks he’s Napoleon,\" and so forth. Illusion. So the psychiatrist attacks illusion and he’s trying to get rid of that. And that is some-thing that you neglect entirely. You’re only interested in experience. He would have gotten much further had he actually attacked experience. Now, sometimes a person gets delusory after they’ve had an experience. This is per-fectly true. But you’ll find out that that is a minor problem, because as the person confronts the experience, he will lose the illusion and get the actual experience. Illusion is a surface manifestation which disappears when experience is consulted. So what you are doing is audit-ing – with Dianetic auditing – you’re auditing experience. Now, don’t get all clouded up"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 7 21.7.66 HSDC    87    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE about is it illusory or isn’t it illusory or wah-wah, you know, this or that or the other thing. No, just skip that. Now, you’ve got processes, advanced processes, that handle valences. Those are by assessment and they’re summed up today in Search and Discovery. If you want to change somebody’s personality graph like that, why, audit a few valences, because the personality graph is actually a picture of a valence on any human being. He himself is not really enough there to have a personality. He’s very subdued. So, we take that out of Dianetic auditing. We take machines out of Dianetic auditing; they’re fun but they don’t do anything. You think I’m just joking probably about these ma-chines or you think it’d be some little object someplace like that, but actually – actually every now and then you will run into one that’s got great big red flywheels and brass – a body, you see, and little whistles and things and it’s something that produces predictions for him or something like that. It shuffles them out to him, you know? It’s crazy, man. These people aren’t insane. Their perception has to be much better than the average in order to perceive that they have these things. So, we’re going to neglect that and then we’re going to neglect illusion. Now that – you must remember, you must neglect illusion in Dianetic auditing. That’s very, very impor-tant, because illusion is simply the product of the actual. And if you attack illusion, you pre-vent him from reaching the actual. Now, the actual is so bizarre from a viewpoint of a human being, it is so strange, so weird – the actual is – that of course, people are all too prone to call the actual and the illusion both illusion or hallucination, see? There are people around who work on the basis of making somebody hallucinate. You know, there’s a whole – the whole play dedicated to it called Gaslight. You know, they work on this – guy works on this girl and works on this girl – by changing the actual physical uni-verse, makes her think she’s crazy, you see? Till, \"Where did you put the staircase, Paula?\" And anything that happens, he does it and then he blames it on her and she can’t remember doing it. So she thinks she’s gone mad. So therefore, she thinks she’s having illusions, you see, or hallucinations. So people work on this all the time. For instance, the newspapers would like you to believe what they print. You only have to read stuff about yourself in the newspapers to know doggone well there isn’t a line of truth anywhere in the paper. But somewhere in the human world there was probably some event that had an actuality on which the news story is based, you see? There probably was some-thing. You get down to more solid objects like trains run off bridges, it’s easy for them to write something like that because it’s at their tone level, you see? Disaster, and everybody messed up and, \"We’ll sell lots of papers!\" So – but it’s remarkable how much illusion they’ll even write about a train wreck. There was a train wreck, but what appears in the paper is very often quite different. No, as I say, you only have to read about yourself in the press a few times to then wonder about the story to the right of that story and to the left of that story. You wondered if Senator Snodgrass was even in Washington at the time he made the speech, you see? It’s spooky; it’s spooky. What a river of lies. So that is the social illusion: what normally, laughingly, is called news."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 8 21.7.66 HSDC    88    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE This is based on old women’s gossip. There used to be gossips occasionally who were put in stocks because they said nothing but vicious things about everybody and stirred up trouble for everybody and ran all around doing this sort of thing. And they just made nothing but trouble and told nothing but lies, and so forth. Well, the modern gossip is the newspaper. And if those characteristics were in one human being, that human being would be driven from the community. Why everybody buys newspapers, I don’t know. I’m tired of them myself. But I’m just giving you an example. The newspaper is the illusion of the event. Well, very often a person will get an illusion. You can expect a pc running things to get an illusion of the event. The event was too much for him to confront so he dreams up what it was. Now it’s – if you’re really running a real engram – illusion will often come off of it. The fellow will start changing his mind about it. Well, for heaven’s sakes, don’t fix him with the illusion till he reaches the actual! Don’t stand around saying, \"Well, the last time we ran that – last time we ran that you went off the bridge. Now apparently – now apparently you weren’t in the car at all.\" And yourself, don’t be baffled, because the fellow couldn’t confront the ex-perience. So he partially confronted and partially dreamed it up, see? The part he couldn’t confront, he dreamed up. Now as he audits this, his confront gets better and he sees what it is. Now a pc quite often will get himself confused because he says, \"The mental image picture is absolute, and that is what I see the first time I run it through. And therefore, I am very upset because the second time through, the woman has a red hat on and she wasn’t wear-ing a hat the first time through. So what is this? This then isn’t a real experience.\" Well, it’s not for you to evaluate for him. Just put him through it again and he will say, \"Oh, I-I guess I never could confront her,\" you know, or something like this. You get the idea? So actual experience is at the root of all illusion, and you are not in the business of evaluating the content of secondaries and engrams. That is not the business you are in. The business you are in is the alleviation of the incident – mental image picture of the incident itself. All right. So what happens in life? A thetan is a busy little bee and he will make a pic-ture of events as they occur and then he clutches these pictures to his thetanish bosom, and wonders why he’s so sick. This is not very bright, but he does it. Now he has a great loss. All secondaries depend upon loss. We say secondary, and the reason it's a secondary is because it depends for its charge on an engram which contains pain and unconsciousness. It’s secondary. It does not contain pain and unconsciousness, it contains emotion. Any emotion or misemo-tion may be contained in a secondary but, of course, pleasure and so forth does not make a secondary and it also doesn’t make an incident. It doesn’t make an aberrative incident because he was so happy. A person, however, can have a win which is so magnitudinous and so unexpected that it hangs him up forever. He’s always going back to this big win, you know? Very often old men will sit around and go over their wins with one another. And it was always amazing to me as a little boy listening to former road agents – which is to say robbers, and who were now very respectable – cattle rustlers, ex-sheriffs, not much difference to choose between them because actually they swapped their hats almost at random, you see – talking about the horses they had stolen and the cattle rustlers they hadn’t shot and all of this sort of thing. It was in-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 9 21.7.66 HSDC    89    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE teresting to me that their stories never wore out. And while I would find their stories of inter-est, sitting around as a little tad, I would very soon become very familiar with all of them. And they would still tell them. And one of them would be talking and the other one would simply not be listening at all but be waiting to talk in his turn. And it was interesting to me that those incidents never wore out. They never desensitized at all; they just were good forever like an unperishable phonograph record. And that is true about pleasure moments, and so forth, is the thetan just goes on with them forever. All right. So, we’re talking then, when we talk about a secondary, about misemotion – grief, fear... Well, you’d – actually it’s the old Tone Scale. We got the old Tone Scale from the fact that as you run a secondary, if you run a classic secondary, it will come up from be-low apathy into apathy and move right on up the Tone Scale in its tones. And it will finally wind up at boredom, and that’s the wrong place to stop, because there’s enthusiasm just above that. And at that point he doesn’t care about it again. But that is a secondary. It’s misemotion. The Tone Scale was plotted from the behavior of secondaries under auditing. But to have a secondary – a moment of loss which is aberrative – an individual must have had an experience containing pain and unconsciousness and that is an engram. An en-gram is an experience – mental picture of an event of pain and unconsciousness. A person had to hurt, and he had to have gone unconscious to greater or lesser degree – and sometimes they just go unconscious during the center moment of the hurt, but there’s always a little uncon-sciousness connected with great pain – and the mental image picture of that event is the en-gram. Now, the word engram itself comes from \"trace on a cell\" – is what it means. And at the time I was first working with this, I was thinking in terms of cellular memory. I didn’t know where these things came from – it was way back when – and so I chose a word which was preferably different than other terms being used, and that was the first consideration. Second consideration was that we could define it and say what it did mean. Anytime an indi-vidual was hurt, like a faithful little idiot he made a complete record of the event. A complete record of the event was manufactured at that moment. You’d be surprised how complete it is. Do you know that you could take somebody through a tonsillectomy with a stopwatch? You can even have a doctor there who knows the speed and action connected with a tonsillectomy and have him criticize the quality of the sur-geon doing the tonsillectomy. You can move the person right through the tonsillectomy by calling off the time in the tonsillectomy – one minute deep, two minutes, three minutes, four minutes, five minutes. You know, you can get the event and so on, you can put the time in it. A thetan is fantastically accurate in terms of time. Time is something which a thetan has a good, solid grip on. He has a very, very solid grip. A being does not make errors reac-tively about time. Analytically he gets confused about time, but right down deep, right down deep he never makes an error about time. He knows reactively exactly when it happened and for how long, but he now is incapable of confronting the fact, so he makes (quote) \"errors\" while he’s wide awake. You ask some girl how old she is, you’ll understand what I mean. She sometimes looks very vague."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 10 21.7.66 HSDC    90    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Very often the person can’t tell the date. Well, that’s because he doesn’t particularly want to confront dates. But if you went at it with a meter, you would pick up the exact date. It is recorded but is unconfrontable. So he records what he can’t confront, and that is where he gets engrams and secondaries. I find that very amusing, though. Why would he record it if he can’t confront it? If he can’t confront it why didn’t he just skip it? But the truth of the matter is, he didn’t. See, we’re only dealing with what is, not what should be, you know? So, we have a time track, let us say – well, we have a consecutive series of events be-ginning with the first aberration of the being on through to the present. And the wonder of the E-Meter is, is that as a person is more capable of confronting, the E-Meter will reach just be-low, to what he slightly can’t confront and will give you a read on it. The E-Meter sees deeper than he does. That’s very interesting. But the E-Meter doesn’t say – see all the way down. You’ll run right straight across events that won’t register on the E-Meter but then the pc is improved by auditing, he comes up, and then all of a sudden you’ll find the E-Meter is registering on those events that it didn’t register on before. That’s because they’re closer to being confronted. So the E-Meter will register on anything that is close to being confronted, and it reads deeper than the thetan can confront, which is quite amusing. It’s like life is at this level, you see – four feet off the floor – and then we have the E-Meter able to sound a foot deep. See, the being himself can only see this strata four feet off the floor but the E-Meter can see three feet from the floor. See, it can see one foot deep. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t event between three feet and the floor. See, there’s tons of event in there. But as the being becomes more familiar with his own mind and his own past, and as he becomes more able, then this depth increases. But of course, the four-foot level is now very, very easy for him to confront, the three-foot level where the E-Meter was seeing before is now confrontable by the being himself, and the meter is now confronting to two feet. And eventually the being can confront as much as the meter can confront. But at that time, unfor-tunately for auditing, the individual is Clear. Now, therefore, the function of the E-Meter is not a sees-all, end-all seer of some kind or another with a swami-type turban and a big glass diamond. It’s just something with a little bit better telescopic sights. It can see a bit deeper than the being himself. Don’t feel com-pletely reassured because there is no meter read that everything on that subject is gone. No, everything that is in restimulation that will have any effect upon the thetan is gone. Do you see? So, therefore you can easily unflatten things which you have flat. In other words, you’ve gotten something down to a point where it no longer registers on the meter, and you say, \"Good, that’s flat.\" Now we go over it again just to make sure, and now we get things reading in it again. I want to caution you about this in auditing engrams, because you can flatten them and you can unflatten them just as easy as scat. So you want to get it down to where you aren’t getting tone arm action, you more or less got it. Now, the mind, then, that is being approached by Dianetic auditing is the mind of event, and the things which are aberrative in that mind are the engrams and the secondaries. They are very often visible through their locks or tiny surface manifestations."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 11 21.7.66 HSDC    91    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A guy is hit on the head with a hammer. That makes an engram. There’s physical pain and unconsciousness in it. A few days later he walks into a hardware store. He doesn’t like to be there. He can’t tell you why, because he can’t confront the incident of being hit in the head with a hammer but there are hammers in that hardware store. He doesn’t even see what is res-timulating the engram. He just is uncomfortable and he will take a picture of the hardware store as an uncomfortable place. So you chase a guy down the time track and he has a picture of a hardware store. Well now, you couldn’t possibly guess why he has a picture of a hardware store. He might have been hit with a blow – hurt with a blowlamp; he might have gone bankrupt, making a secon-dary. We don’t know why he’s got this little picture of a hardware store, because there’s no pain and unconsciousness in connection with a hardware store. But with a meter and with getting him to look it over and think it over and look around on the incident, and so on, we could pick up what it was the lock on. Now, the lock is in view and the incident is out of sight. Now what a person knows about is not aberrative. This in – I’ve had more people walk in and say, \"Oh, I know exactly what it is. My second husband – and he beat me all the time with a club, and I’ve been in terrible shape ever since.\" And they go on and on and on and on and on. Well, we point out this interesting fact: They know about that, and they have – you’re the thousand and first person they have told about that and it hasn’t blown yet, which is to say hasn’t disappeared, hasn’t erased. So obviously, that isn’t what’s wrong. Now, it’d be your job as the auditor to discover what was wrong. Now, maybe in ac-tual practice that would be an exercise in finding valences like you know, listing and assess-ing lists for individuals or things they have known. But we’re talking about it from a Dianetic approach. This is the processing we want to work slowly. We don’t want any speed out of this process. We would go on down the line now to find out what was this all about. And this is her second husband and according to her, her first husband was a knight in shining armor. That’s illusion. You know that you could say to almost anybody, \"Who – uh – who was...\" You no-tice this fellow is terribly silent, see, and always silent, never has anything to say. So you say to him, \"Who is the most talkative person you ever knew?\" \"Oh, my Uncle Bill. Oh, he just talked all the time.\" \"What did he look like?\" \"Oh, he was a tall fellow, and he had green hair,\" and so on. And so on. \"He just talked continuously, and he’s the most talkative fellow you ever...\" You say, \"What’s the matter?\" \"That’s funny. I can’t ever remember him saying a word.\" He’s in Uncle Bill’s valence, don’t you see, resenting everybody being talkative but he’s actually transferred valences. So his valence at the time has now transferred to Uncle Bill’s valence. You get a swap."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 12 21.7.66 HSDC    92    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You ought to try this sometime just for fun. You notice something about a person and ask him who was the reverse. And watch him get all confused and mixed up. You notice this girl is very sad; she’s a very sad, moping-type person. \"Who’s the happiest, gayest, most en-thusiastic person you ever knew?\" You want to ask her this, see? \"Bessie Ann.\" \"Well, tell me about Bessie Ann.\" About halfway through the dissertation: \"You know Bessie Ann was the most sour sourpuss I ever ran into in my life.\" They themselves had loses in being enthusiastic in trying to cheer up Bessie Ann. You get the idea? That’s a valence problem which you’re not interested in but this comes into auditing because in engrams they sometimes swap valences. And if you want a real tough engram, you will find somebody has been the scaffold, the headsman, the ax, the block, his wife, a little boy in the crowd, an egg, a hen... You’ve got this incident and the game in running this thing is to find out \"What was he?\" And if you run it long enough, why, you’ll generally find out that he was the guy being beheaded, or he was the executioner. And you’ll – you’ll run into valences just to that degree. Now, if an individual is looking at himself in the picture he is out of valence. You can actually briskly tell him to get into valence or just run it; he eventually will. Now, there is a danger in running Dianetic engrams in that you run too late on a chain. Now, incidents of similar nature, strung out in time, are called chains. Now, let’s take the automobile-accident chain – the auto-accident chain. Now, this is a fascinating thing, but the individual will tell you he’s been in one automobile accident; when you start checking it over, he’s been in three. You have to have the earliest incident on the chain before you really start grinding away. But you can get too enthusiastic about this and you can work too hard to find the earli-est incident on the chain, because unfortunately, even though the psychiatrist doesn’t like us to say this and even though the church is quite insulted occasionally, when we mention that their converts have lived before this life, this is one of the first phenomena you run into in Dianetic auditing. And you run into it in everybody. Now, a this-lifetime address to the situation is recommended, because the number of automobile accidents the fellow has been in may be nearly infinite. He might have been in dozens, hundreds, thousands. In – maybe he’s stuck in an incident in a space-opera society where a – where a flying car hits him, you see, and that last truck accident, and so on, is sim-ply hung up on it. But you can’t always insist that he stay in this lifetime, because it’s very hard for him to do. So he’ll skid. But the danger that I’m telling you about is not a danger of him going into a former lifetime, but the danger is trying to erase something that is getting more solid. It is – the reason for that, it is too late on the chain. There’s two mistakes can be made here: You can continue to grind, grind, grind and it’s just getting tougher and tougher and harder to do, or you can hit it too lightly and go back"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 13 21.7.66 HSDC    93    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE too quickly, and then go back too quickly again, and then back too quickly again without tak-ing enough charge off and the guy will become a – become just a ball. He’ll get all messed up. Let’s say we have fifteen automobile accidents, and we can only find the fifteenth. So we take a light pass through it but we get all the charge of it off, and then we go to the four-teenth. We think that is the earliest one now, see? That’s what it registers on the meter. And it’s a bad thing for you to always be using earliest one and so forth, because you quite com-monly have a lot of earliest ones earlier than the one you’re running, you see? So it’s better auditing terminology to say earlier – the earlier incident. So you get the fourteenth. You don’t know it’s the fourteenth by this. See, you don’t know it’s the fourteenth yet; you think it’s number one. And you go through it but it also behaves in a peculiar fashion, and if you started to grind it too hard, why, you’d be in a bad way. So you find the thirteenth, and here’s where you would enthusiasti-cally make a mistake: You just note that there’s a thirteenth, note there’s a twelfth, note there’s an eleventh, a tenth, a ninth, and all of a sudden bu-thuth-thuth! ffft! What you did is you tried to shoot him down with the same perception as the E-Meter. There’s not enough charge off. You should have gone through those incidents. You should have gotten enough charge off of them so that he could go through them and go down earlier on them. Do you follow? So an auditor can make this error, and it’s a very serious error. I give it to you very, very, very severely here as a – as a great error to try to follow down a chain without running what you’re finding on the chain, just out of your impatience or the pc’s curiosity or some-thing like that. You got fourteen automobile accidents, you better run him through fourteen automobile accidents until you get the first one. Now, maybe in the last two or three at the bottom he’ll suddenly jump to the first one; you run that and the whole chain blows. But you can ball him up, man. Do you see? The area has got too much unconfrontable stuff in it. But the more of these he goes through, why, the more he can confront and the deeper he can go and the more charge, see, the more material he has confronted, the more he is able to confront it, and you finally get him down to where he can confront basic on the chain. Now sometimes a pc will fool you. And he himself will get so anxious that he skips five, six, seven incidents just in an anxiety to get to that bottom one, you see? And the next thing you know he’s glug! He’s gone into the glue. Now, a pc gets very confused if you do this. The right way to do this is to erase the auditing. You don’t go back and do what you should have done; you just erase the auditing. Treat the session as an incident. And erase it as a lock, and everything goes back together again rather neatly. And that is something we have almost forgotten how to do in Scientology. Guy has a rough session, right away we want to get him over to Review and get his ARC breaks off and fool about with it and do this and that. No, you don’t have to do that; run the session as an incident. \"You remember the be-ginning of this session? All right, go to the beginning of this session. All right. Rapidly pass"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 14 21.7.66 HSDC    94    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE through to the end of the session and tell me the incident and tell me what happened.\" Do that two or three times. Pssth! That’s it. You can erase anything if you’re good. But, oddly enough, if you took him through the session two or three times it might gum him up because he’s had some earlier, rougher sessions now that you should have gone back to on a chain, and you’ve got another chain on your hands. [laughter] So you might say you can always go through something once, but if it’s a chain, watch it. So the whole of Dianetic auditing is the tracing of experience. There are thousands of things I could tell you about this. There are tons of phenomena. We probably know more phe-nomena about Dianetic auditing than any other single activity. And the funny part of it is, all you really need to know – well, I’m giving you data in this lecture which is highly explicit and which is very useful to you, but it’s all contained – pretty well contained in HCOB 3 April 1966. Now, if you had this lecture, too, of course. Now, there’s power in this stuff and you can become a drug addict on Dianetic audit-ing very easily because it is very, very, very interesting stuff. It’s the root material of life. I probably from time to time will remember little bits and pieces and give you some more. I just thought of one just now, that’s a handy thing to know. If you get some lifetime in restimulation, run the engram of the death and it’ll disap-pear; the life will desensitize. You get the guy stuck in a lifetime as a sewer cleaner in Paris or something like that, and it’s such a degraded life when he at first was telling you he was Joan of Arc during that period. He isn’t necessarily wrong about this, don’t you see but he actually was jumping to an earlier life and getting it beautifully confused so that he wouldn’t have to face the degradation of that life. It’s the lives that almost make it are the bad ones – you know, the lives that almost make it – or the lives which are just so degraded the guy can’t imagine himself as that kind of a being, and that’ll upset him. It isn’t really the successful lives. People will run Julius Caesar with the greatest of ease. But they wouldn’t like to run Cassius. People who run Julius Caesar were probably something horrible during his lifetime. You see, they’re just like the guy flying around in the incident, and he is the headsman, he’s the headman’s ax, he’s the block, he’s the executioner, he’s himself, he’s the executed person. Now, you have a lot of fun running stuff like this. You can find out a lot about track, pcs have an awful lot of cognitions, and you may hit some lower levels of Release. But it’d be release by chain. You’re not going to get release from the whole experiential track. That’s not possible. But you might get a free needle on automobile accidents. And if you do, pull out, man. But then don’t stop running engrams. Find some other type of engram. There is – I can assure you that you’re not going to get a total bank release, because those total releases are up there at 0, I, II, III, IV, V, you see, and they’re all above this. You’re going to get negative releases. Releases on the negative lines. The minus scale which you have on your first Gradation Chart and which should have been repeated on the next one and should – will be repeated again because they’re quite vital. Do you know that you can"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 15 21.7.66 HSDC    95    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE assess – apparently assess the minus levels and sometimes produce a Release just by assess-ing them – where the guy is stuck at – but don’t keep on assessing after you see a free needle. But here – here is practice auditing – practice auditing. Now, somebody will tell you that it’s very, very bad to fool about with the mind – very bad to fool about with the mind. But in actual fact any Dianetic auditing is better than no Dianetic auditing. You see, that remark was true about Dianetics. We’ve moved up into such powerhouse auditing today in Scientology and so forth, that you can perhaps knock a guy around with auditing, but not with Dianetic auditing. The guy will struggle out of a session and so forth. Now, we used to tell people to come up to present time, and in view of the fact that’ll also put him at the beginning of track, there’s no particular reason to tell him that. So, the thing for you to do, if your pc is very groggy after a Dianetic session, why, just get him to look around the room. Get him to name two or three objects in the room, and it actually will orient him in PT. Now, try for light secondaries when you first go into this sort of thing. Well, that’s – far as that’s concerned, try for what will really be light locks. Try for a little bit more in the way of secondaries. Actually, if you just kept auditing secondaries you’d eventually fall into engrams because it’s very funny, the engram lying there and the secondary is visual. I mean, he can – he can run the secondary, but the engram is too much for him to con-front; so we can’t run that. But the reason for the secondary is the engram. You say, why is the fellow sad at the departure of his wife? The fellow is sad at the departure of his wife. If he is way over exaggeratedly sad and she wasn’t a very good cook, you can’t see how this is going to ruin his next hundred years, don’t you see? But he’s all set to have this ruin his next hundred years. Why is that? Well, it’s setting on an engram. It may be sitting on an engram and maybe he was a wife in that life before and got shot. See? Something like that. There’s pain and unconsciousness associated with a similar contextual incident. Now he gets this ter-rible grief, heavy grief type incident and he doesn’t know what to make out of this. This has great value, by the way, auditing of secondaries. There’s a lot of tricks asso-ciated with this. It takes a long time to audit these things sometimes, but there’s a lot of gim-mickry associated with Dianetic auditing that you don’t really have to particularly know. You sort of fall into it. You start developing it; you start recognizing it, and so forth. Because it’s very obvious. But I could take ten or fifteen years off the appearance of any widow by simply running her husband’s death. It’s fantastic! You wouldn’t believe the change that would oc-cur. There are certain things that you can do that produce remarkable and fantastic changes in a being. There are certain things that you can alleviate. But I give you this warning: If you start using Dianetic auditing to cure up somebody’s lumbosis – he’s got lumbosis so you’re going to run the engram that causes lumbosis, and that is now going to cure his lumbosis – forget it! Every so often you will cure his lumbosis. Every so often you’ll have a win. That’s the wrong way to go about it because you’re validating a down statistic. You’re giving him this attention because he’s got lumbosis, and he tends to deteriorate as a being."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 16 21.7.66 HSDC    96    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You want to use this just as you use any other kind of auditing. You should use it just to improve the being – just improve the being. You’re auditing a thetan, you are not auditing lumbosis. Now, you’re not medical doctors – thank God – not psychiatrists – heaven forbid! – you are people who can make beings totally recover. You have the technology of total recov-ery of a being, and that doesn’t mean a body. And that is so fundamental a truth, that as long as you use any auditing just to make the being better, there you are. All you’re trying to do is improve the guy’s confront, that’s all. This guy wants to be audited because he’s got medicosis – deadly illness! And he wants you to cure his medicosis. I don’t think I’d take that pc on. I really don’t think I’d audit him. I’d much rather audit his sister who wants to dance better. Because this guy is down the line in a sort of a cave-in, don’t you see? He’s going to be rough, he’s going to be this, that and the other thing. He just – mmmm – entirely different emotional frame. Now, he’d be very anxious, and he’s already told you he had a hidden standard. He’s saying – when he says, \"Cure my medicosis\" – he’s saying in essence that, \"If you can have an effect upon my medi-cosis, why, then I will believe in Scientology\". And you say, \"Isn’t that sweet of you!\" There’s an ant over there and you know, I just don’t care whether he believes about Scientology or not. In fact, I don’t think it’ll change any part of human history whether that ant believes in Scientology or not. Now, if you know somebody who thinks he can be better, I’ll happily audit him. But I’m afraid I would be that nasty. I’ve had enough hidden standards, man! Because let me tell you, his medicosis probably won’t alleviate until he’s about a Grade V and he’s asking me to do it with two seconds at Grade 0. But he’s so stuck on a hidden standard that he wouldn’t even care that his communication was better. He’s just all wrapped up in problems like mad, and so on. Well, there’s ways to handle this person. There’s ways and means to handle this person, but not as a practice case in Dianetic auditing. This is fun. Why get serious about it? Now, you yourself as an auditor should know how to run an engram; you should know how to run a secondary, because you yourself in your early career very often burn your finger, cut your hand and you can run it out – phhhh-phhh-phhh-phhh-phhh. It’s very remarkable. You can make burns go down and you can do all sorts of magical things with yourself I wouldn’t advise you to do it for some little kid just because he’s burned. I’d give him a Touch Assist or something like that. But it’s very interesting. Anybody ought to have this experi-ence, but don’t burn yourself just so that you can have the experience. To watch a blistered finger go down as you steadily, steadily, steadily on, run the incident out of having burned it. It’s quite interesting. Every once in a while in auditing somebody with these you’ll get an awful win – and the last – last thing I want to question you about – one thing I want to warn you about very, very much – is please don’t get stuck in those wins! There’s value to this auditing; there is greater value to this auditing than man ever before had. This solves the problems that Sig-mund Freud was trying to solve. It solves them with spectacularity, man! And compared to Scientology, it’s nothing. Don’t go getting stuck in a win. Have wins by all means, but don’t get stuck in them and suddenly say, \"You know, Ron’s really got something there. You can"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"SHSBC-433 DIANETIC AUDITING 17 21.7.66 HSDC    97    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE cure people with this. Hey! Woof! Look at that!\" [laughter] \"Guy had a withered arm. I ran three engrams. His arm grew the normal size. Good God! This is for me!\" You go out and collect a whole bunch of withered arms and that’s it. [laughter] The danger of Dianetic auditing is it wins. The road out is the road you have up through the Grades. And it took all this knowledge of Dianetic auditing, it took all the mate-rial, it took all the odd observations, it took all those years of work to carve that very thin and now rather ordinary-looking path that works too fast, up through the Grades. Dianetic auditing was very useful with which to learn the fundamentals about the mind, and that’s what I want you to use it for. You will all of a sudden be rather interested to learn about these recorded incidents, and you will become very familiar with this thing called the human mind as you use this in auditing. And you yourself will get a very interesting in-sight into such things as history, customs and habits of bygone races. You have lots of fun; you get practice in handling pcs, and you might make some minus-grade Releases. You won’t even make a Grade 0. Don’t expect to. But this is – this is great training – great training. If you were to go out and hang up a shingle with this, you’d get enough wins. You’d get proba-bly 50, 60 percent wins. So what? You’re rewarding a down statistic. The guy got sick, so we’re auditing him. That’s probably what’s wrong with him in the first place. He wants atten-tion. And if you go bog yourself down at this stage of development of Scientology with handling all the sick and the insane of this planet, you will never get anyplace. There are all kinds of people who aren’t. Now, somewhere up the line in a century or a millennia or some-thing like that, somewhere up the line the Registrars are going to run out of auditors and pcs. By that time everybody will either be very adept or very disinterested, but wait for such a time as when an organization, to function, must have such pcs. Then – then get into it. Then get into it. You’re not strong enough, stable enough or anything else to suddenly take on all the woes of the world simultaneously. I can confront them, but that’s no reason I have to audit them. You could just bog yourself down right there. I’ve seen more auditors ruin their careers by making a career out of one psychotic. Think of all the able people that could have been made more able while one psychotic was giving an auditor a total failure. Because the reason he was totally psychotic was probably his environment and he wasn’t even removed from his environment to audit him, and he gets up two feet and gets knocked back three. I remember one girl in New York City that – they kept auditing her and auditing her, auditing her. And they’d get her up to anger and she’d blow the household or something like this, she’d get out of there, and they’d promptly blame the auditor because the girl was now angry, and go back and put her into apathy and get the auditor to audit her again. And he would audit her up – or she would audit her up to a point where this girl was in anger, and then the family would blow up because the person now couldn’t be lived with and so they’d knock the person back into apathy again. And this went on and on and on and what an awful waste of time. Do you see? So Dianetic auditing is not for the psychotic, the neurotic or the sick. In spite of the fact that it probably could handle the psychotic, the neurotic and the sick.

Thank you."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" HSDC    99    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND A lecture given on 28 July 1966 Thank you. Thank you. Good, you made me smile now. Now, this is the what of the which? I get these planets mixed up. It’s 28 July AD 16, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course and a lecture on Dianetic auditing. Now, needless to say, had you listened carefully to the first lecture, you wouldn’t need this lecture. [laughter] I hate to have to – have to point these things out but that’s the truth. Now, let me ask a question here. What are you handling when you are running Dianetic secondaries and engrams? What are you handling? Audience: [various answers] Well, boy, you should sure know this. You are handling the human mind. That is all there is to it. If we add to that then, as another picture, a valence, and as we add to that an-other thing called a machine, then you’ve got the lot. That’s the human mind. You are actu-ally getting your hands all dirty with the human mind. That is the human mind. It isn’t any-thing else and there is nothing else in the human mind. Now, that was a basic discovery in Dianetics. Now, what the mind was coating was the discovery of Scientology. It was coating, you know, paint coats, globs of glupf coat. It is coating a thetan. And a thetan is a life unit capable of many things as described in the Axi-oms, but most familiar to one and all as you. [laughs] So you, a thetan – and if you don’t believe you are a thetan, I’ll give you a little exer-cise: Look around you; what do you see? You see the physical universe, correct? All right, and look at another person next to you; you see a body, correct? All right, very good. Now look at a picture of a cat. Make a picture of a cat. Those who are too black to do so, why, just skip that exercise. Make a picture of a cat. All right. Now, that picture, although it is synthetic and a creation at the moment you’re making it up and so forth, that’s the mind. And what’s looking at the cat? [laughter] You are. And those of you, now, who couldn’t get a picture of a cat, whatever you got, look at it. [laughter] Now, what’s looking at it? You are. Now, this is the entirety – the entirety of the human mind. Now you say, \"Well, if we created a picture of a cat, oh well, that wasn’t part of the mind, it was part of my crea...\""},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 2 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    100    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Who the hell do you think is mocking that thing up called the mind? You are. Now, that was the great discovery of Scientology. That was discovered after Dianetic days. What is the source of this thing? Engram originally meant \"trace on a cell.\" I know it’s fashionable for the newspapers to say I never went to college and there are several colleges at this particular time that are wishing that I hadn’t gone there. [laughter] But I can also assure you that you give them another decade or so, those colleges I haven’t even done more than go to a prom at will have some plates on ‘em. You know? Man is silly, you see? Anyway, in college we were taking atomic and molecular phenomena, which is a very interesting subject. And they should have left it there as a toy subject and shouldn’t have gone any further with it because out of that subject came the atomic bomb. Now, it’s originally called atomic and molecular phenomena. Well, they narrowed the subject down and made it very compressed and highly specialized and called it nuclear physics. And today, why, people get degrees in nuclear physics and go out with aplomb to blow human beings all to pieces because politicians don’t know how to handle governments. Now, the whole subject of the human mind was so unknown, so bedazzled and mucked about – people hardly even knew there was a mind. You find Mary Baker Eddy say-ing, \"All is mind, infinite mind.\" Well, we’re into a problem in semantics, meaning the mean-ing of words. She was using mind in some other connotation and so on. She was – she thought the universe was a big think. Fortunately it’s not. We’re here. A lot of think but there’s also us. Now, when – no criticism of her – she was trying like everybody else. So, this thing called the engram came from a theory I developed while I was in George Washington University. And it was an interesting theory because man had no explanation for the storage of thought. But if you consider – now, hold your hat because this is – this is typi-cal scientific think, see; some theory to embrace the phenomena. Now, if memory is con-tained in a molecule, there are ten to the twenty-first power binary digits of molecules in the brain – in the neuron system – yes, ten to the twenty-first power binary digits. Now, what a binary digit is, I’ve forgotten. You know as well as I do. [laughter] I knew once, but I don’t know anymore. Binaries to me – you see, I’ve been in navigation since – and they’re the two suns that go around each other and make a dumbbell sort of star. You see, I don’t know what it is. Well anyhow, I know it’s a long figure. And if there were a hundred holes in each molecule – see this figure is something you just go on writing for a day or two, you see, or weeks – and if there were a hundred holes in each one of these molecules and there was one memory in each hole, why, man – by calculation then, of the number of things observed and remembered and by actual inspection of man’s memory – man had enough memory storage to last him three months. And although this may not be true of psychologists, psychiatrists or many professors, there are those who can remember further back than three months. [laugh-ter] So I wrote this up as proof that this wasn’t how man remembered. In I think 19 – oh, I don’t know when it was – 1936, some five, six years later, something like that, this was issued in Austria (from Vienna, where else?) as the way man remembered. So, man is so scarce on"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 3 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    101    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE data that he will even buy ways people have proved man doesn’t remember in order to ex-plain the mind and memory. Now, there’s a mirror theory that is even more ridiculous than that one, whereby one perceives by having a mirror which reflects the perceptions and concentrates it. Now, don’t ask the question – by the way that was in the 50s and so forth, that was the psychological school of thought explanation – now, don’t ask what looks at the mirror, because they’ll tell you another mirror. And we sort of get into an infinite – [laughter] one of these German peri-scopes, you know, where the submarine captain lays in his bunk and looks at – looks at Ber-lin’s nightclubs or something. [laughter] I mean, they never followed the thought all the way through. Something had to look at the mirror. It’s the same idea they have about computers. They talk about the wonders of com-puters, you see? Marvelous computers! \"Boy, can I – can I think!\" You know. \"Great, great! Can I think!\" Every once in a while I’m standing around when I see some of my friends, and I – they’re in there with the ENIACs and UNIWACs and mucklucks, or whatever these things are called these days, and they’re doing this gorgeous stunt of praising the computer and say-ing how much better it is than a human being. And I shatter their comparisons by saying, \"Who asks the computer questions?\" And they say, \"Well, of course, we do because we’re so stupid.\" [laughter] And I say, \"Who, then, does it answer questions for?\" Oh. They’ve sort of got the idea that a computer answers questions for other com-puters that asks questions for other computers, you see? But the truth of the matter is any time you go near one of these UNIWACs or ENIACs or mucklucks or something, you see some guy there feeding it – feeding it cards and feeding it questions. And there’s – whatever slots they have on the things and so forth. You’ll also see somebody come over and take out a long tape and then read it. [laughter] And it didn’t mean a thing until somebody read it. Do you see? So man’s – all I’m trying to give you is man’s approach to this was so childish as to be silly. The – his – what data he had about the mind, he couldn’t even think about. But now, it’s very difficult to think about the mind and don’t blame him too much, be-cause the mind, essentially, if all there was, was a mind... The psychiatrist thinks the mind is the brain. He’s got it moved over sideways. That’s why he keeps sawing up brains and drill-ing holes in them and so forth. He thinks he’s getting something. You can’t drill a hole in a mind. It’s not possible. He would, if he could! [laughs, laughter] But this thing – this thing called the mind, you see, is being asked to think about something called the mind. An ENIAC or UNIWAC (names of the big electronic computers) are not able, actually, to think about computers, see? They’re not able to design themselves. But fortunately – fortunately, why, the mind doesn’t have to understand the mind because there’s somebody there to understand it. And fortunately for us and unfortunately for a lot of other -isms and -ologies and so forth, I for one was there to understand it. Do you see? So this thing called the mind is probably the least understood, the most mysterious ob-ject that anybody ever heard of. You would have to know that an individual was quite capable"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 4 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    102    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE of making pictures, of creating mass, energy, space and time, before you could understand what the mind was. That would require, then, that you understood there was such a thing as an individual. And an individual isn’t something walking around in a frock coat or with pince-nez glasses or something like that. An individual is a static. And this static is that – well now, static is something that’s motionless but actually a static by definition in Scientology is simply the ultimate in \"What is it?\" Now, there is no reason to try to explain a thetan or say where it came from, because it didn’t come from any place. It is! And we have to understand now the Scientology idea of what is reality. And this really baffles people because this is the biggest philosophic conun-drum of the ages. What is reality? Now, people tell you to face reality and so forth. But you could say with a philosophic quip, \"I’ll be glad to face it if you will explain it.\" And that would of course stop them cold, because they can’t explain reality. Reality totally lacks philosophic definitions and we got into such weirdities – weird things as, \"If the tree fell in the forest and there was nobody there to hear it fall, then would it have made a sound?\" I think that’s marvelous, you know? I mean, the jokers – and they couldn’t have all been serious – Hume, Locke, the rest of these birds, and some of the French philosophers and so on – these fellows – these fellows really dreamed some up. You want to have a ball sometime, read some of these old timers of two, three, four, five hundred years ago and get their definitions for some of these commodities which you have to know about in order to be free. And reality is one of them. Well, reality, in Scientology, is what is. And people who can’t see very much, of course, don’t have much reality. And you say, \"Is the E-Meter real?\" Well, the E-Meter is real because it is. And honest, you don’t have to go beyond that as a definition. You don’t have to go into \"Why is it there, and who made it, and who put it there, and how come it’s running along in time with us?\" These are other questions. Well, for heaven’s sakes, break them all down to their proper, tiny components. Not one of these questions, of course, is simply \"What is reality?\" Reality is what is. And you can experience reality so easily that I wonder a little bit at anybody having any trouble with it. You can stamp, and it is, so there it is; it’s real. \"Yes,\" they say, \"but a lot of people have an awful lot of delusions.\" You say, \"Okay, what’s a delusion?\" That would probably stop them. We could an-swer it easily. A delusion is what one person thinks is, but others don’t necessarily. You might say that’s a reality for one person out of agreement with others. And I’d hate to have a mental practitioner – I’d hate to have a mental practitioner who himself had a very low level of reality, you see, because he’d be out of agreement with every-body else’s. So that everything to him would be delusion. [laughter] Just the fact that some-body said it was real would be enough for him to then state that it was delusion. Now, one of the ways to handle such a person – and I say this in all kindness because, don’t cheer boys, the poor devils are dying, you know – is just get him to feel the table, you know? Don’t be amazed if he experiences a fantastic case gain in just that instant. But just get him to feel the table. And you – and let him in on something: you feel the table and you say, \"I can feel it, too.\" And it will be such a relief to him, because for a long time he thought only he could."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 5 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    103    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, out of these things of \"What is reality? What is a being?\" and \"What is a mind?\" and so on, we can walk, we can map a path with great security and find out what it is that has man trapped, why man acts as he does, why he reacts as he does. And all this is very elemen-tary once you know the basic definitions. But I don’t think you would have very good luck in auditing Dianetic engrams. En-gram definition today is just something that – an experience – a mental image picture of an experience which contained pain and unconsciousness. And of course, it still contains pain and unconsciousness. Secondary is – is an experience – a mental image picture of an experi-ence which contains loss and is therefore misemotional. Now, that’s all there is to that. Now, in Dianetic processing, then, you have to know what the mind is. And in the process of being processed and in processing it you are running head-on into what this thing called the mind is. And it isn’t anything more complicated than what I have told you. Now, how it got made: Well, a thetan is a compulsive mocker-upper. By mock-up we mean a mental image creation, ordinarily. And he’s able to create just like that. So a bullet hits him, so he makes a full picture of him being hit by the bullet. He is so overwhelmed by it that he thinks the obvious thing for him to do is to make a picture of it. He is stupid, man! And that is the flaw which makes him aberrated. And that is the one flaw in a thetan. Now, if you can get him over doing this so that he can recover from this mad obses-sion to make a picture of everything that happens to him and then hide it from himself and then fix it up so it can impinge itself upon his existence, you can get him out of the cage. And the funny part with all this, you say, \"Well, he didn’t have enough experience, he didn’t have enough pictures, so therefore...\" You can rationalize all you want to; the case happens to be that the individual is trapped by his own creations. Now, he dramatizes these pictures, or they enforce computations on him. He will go through being shot because he has an engram of being shot. Now, the way he does this is get dislocated in time. Now, each of these pictures – you want to know about precision, man. The precision with which a thetan mocks these things up as they happen and then puts them on the time track with the exact time on them is amazing! You talk about the inaccuracy of a human being. Boy, that is accuracy to end all accuracy. It is correct within seconds. It is an amazing feat! If it happened four years, two months, one day, and three hours, seven minutes and two seconds ago, that is the exact thing that will fall on the meter. Now, he can also turn time around, you see, to how long ago it was. You can run it from the beginning, but you better not because there are some booby traps at the beginning. But you run it from PT back and you’ll find that this amazing ability to spot in time these mental image pictures of the things which have happened to him are absolutely gorgeous. It is so great that sometimes all you have to do is date how long ago the incident occurred to have it blow. An individual has to be in pretty good shape, however, before you can do that. Now, this then, in essence, is the mind: Is those pictures which have been made of ex-periences and plotted against time and preserved in energy and mass in the vicinity of the be-ing and which, when restimulated, are re-created without his analytical awareness. That is the mind. That’s the mind you’re working with. That is the mind you’re trying to get out of."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 6 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    104    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, you say this, \"We’re trying to get this individual out of a body.\" No. You won’t get anybody out of a body worth a nickel so that he’ll stay out of a body and so forth, because he is so weakened by his mind that he cannot control or handle himself in relationship to his body. Now, the trick of all of this – the trick of all of this is that you cannot make a postulate or an intention through this mass called the mind. And whenever you do, the mind restimu-lates, so a thetan is not able to make or handle things by postulates. He says – he says, \"You will be all right.\" You know, he has this impulse to say, \"You will be all right.\" You talk about spot healing, you know, or something like miracle healing, you know? Saint Pete or somebody walks along and sees somebody and he wants to heal him up. So he says – the thought – the intention is there to make the fellow all right. His intention goes just so far, col-lides with whatever engrams are in restimulation and goes splat! So he says, \"I guess that’s not a good thing to do.\" Whereas his intention is actually terrifically powerful. So a thetan’s thought can’t go through his own barricade of his mockups. So obviously the less experience – creations of experiences – the less creations of experiences an individual has around him and the less that he has to restimulate, why, the more he can think or project his thoughts or the bigger he gets. Do you follow? Now, you can delete these experiences and Dianetic auditing is that activity by which these experiences can be erased. Now, if an individual is always going around like this – he’s always going around like this, you’re fairly sure – this is... I’m now talking from a Dianetic viewpoint. Of course, there may be dozens of reasons he’s going around like this, all contained in the mind on the same thing. But I will give you a simplified action of it. He’s going around like this, you can be absolutely sure he’s got a mental image picture where something made him go like this. So much so that you could even... And you better not do this with any case that is having any trouble at all; but somebody who is pretty well uptone and is doing fine, you can actually ask him things like that. But the trouble is, if they’re uptone they aren’t obeying their engrams to that degree. But theoretically, you could see this fellow bent over like this, and you could say, \"All right, the incident in which you are bent over like this will now appear.\" And he would get the incident. If he didn’t get it and it remained black, you could then get the duration of the inci-dent – you could – the date of the incident. You date it – how many years and so forth, ago? And then you would date the duration of the incident – how long did it last? And he would get the picture of it. And there he is – there he is, dangling from a tree or something like that, with a rope under him, having been shot with fifty-four arrows, you see, after being flogged or some mild, minor experience of this character. Now, the – there are various ramifications to all of this. There are various complica-tions, you might say. This individual is all messed-up because he’s trying not to dramatize the engram in which he is stuck, you see? He’s trying not to dramatize it, because the tendency of the individual in a dramatization is to repeat in action what has happened to one in experi-ence. That’s a basic definition of it. But much more important, it’s a replay now of something that happened then. It’s just being replayed out of its time and period. So this individual who is dramatizing is actually either totally unrestrained and therefore totally dramatizing (at"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 7 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    105    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE which moment we consider he’s mad), or he has the impulse to dramatize it but he knows he better not. And a fellow will tie himself down like Gulliver in Lilliputia, you know, with all those strings. Just tied down and tied down and tied down and he will hold himself back and so forth. He’s trying to keep from dramatizing some incident. So you get a double action here. You get the impulse to dramatize and the effect of the incident on the individual, and you get as well the individual’s analytical awareness that it’s not a bright thing to do to pick up rocks – whenever one sees a rock, to pick up the rock and hit somebody with it. He’ll think he’s rather odd. He doesn’t know where this comes from, so he begins to lose confidence in himself. Every time he sees a rock, why, he has an impulse to go over and to pick up the rock and bash somebody’s head in with it. And he knows that that is not a nice thing to do. It isn’t because he’s afraid of the police. It’s because he’s basically good; he doesn’t want to do those things. But there’s the rock and there’s a head, and he’d sort of start holding things up so that he can’t look at rocks. And then the next thing you know he walks around like this all the time, you see, so he won’t see any rocks. You get it? And he’s dramatizing an incident where somebody else picked up a rock and hit him over the head with it and then he went into their valence. Do you see? He became them because they were the winner. So this – this is the way all of this stacks up. There’s tremendous amount of interesting phenomena and bric-a-brac, and so forth. You’re dealing with the basic mind, because what is the core of the reactive bank also has this same character. But it is so outrageous and so dif-ferent and is so overwhelming that you’re not about to touch that unless you’ve got the exact map. And even when you’ve got the exact map you occasionally knock your block off. But you’re going in this lightly, lightly – dealing with this lifetime, the last year or two probably, and some people have probably not penetrated any deeper than this morning’s breakfast. But the existence is all mapped. Now, in view of the fact that he didn’t know what happened, occasionally he tells himself what happened and so he will sometimes have his actual experience overlaid with another experience. This is the way you get too many Julius Caesars. You can get an almost infinite supply of Julius Caesars. The man was a mad heterosexual [homosexual] nut who had very nasty personal hab-its and whose ideas of conquest were so laughable as to be nonsense. He conquered such countries as England which were ready to welcome the Briton – the Romans at that time. They were all ready to practically bring them ashore and shake them by the hand and say, \"Hey, what do you know. And we’ve been using your stuff for a long time, boys. Come on in and sell us some more,\" and so forth. So he lands with chariots and spears so he can conquer everybody. You know, loony. He cut off the right hand of fifty thousand Gauls – the act of a madman. Now, this is a pretty suppressive punk, isn’t it, huh? Well, this made him the winning valence. So, I’d say that a lot of people who served with him on his side and a lot of people on the other side, and so forth, would register loud and long as Julius Caesar. Now, whenever you have a personality – whenever you have a personality that has been either terrifically successful (only that’s less so), or a personality who has been terribly"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 8 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    106    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE overwhelming, vicious and oppressive, you get a lot of people in that time in that valence. Because there’s a lot of mental image pictures of it, see? So don’t get too baffled about past lives. Every once in a while past lives get so in-validated to people that they don’t want to have anything to do with them because they’ve seen too many Julius Caesars. And it tends to suppress one saying that, you know, I was Cas-sius, you know? And you – it’s the invidious comparison. Get the chap who’s walking along and he’s got a plan that is going to help the British Empire, you see? And he’s a perfectly valid statesman. He’s going along; he’s doing all right. He’s perfectly capable of doing so. Some bird walks up to him who is a complete, frothing idiot, see, and he tells him that he used to be Disraeli and he has a plan to save the British Empire. At that moment the fellow who is the sane boy has a tendency to feel that he must be crazy because he has a plan to save the British Empire. Do you follow? And by invidious comparison, you say to yourself \"I couldn’t have lived before because look at those nuts talk-ing about – there are three Julius Caesars over there and two Napoleons,\" you know? So sometime if a pc is being too doubtful about all this and he’s had a hard time on it, just run invalidations – run your Suppress and Invalidate and so on, on the subject of \"Have you lived before?\" You’ll get some very interesting results of it. It is fashionable, simply because thetans – meshed in to the degree that they are, smashed down by mass and the mind and so forth – it is very hard to remember. It’s very hard for a thetan to remember more than a few years when he has a totally smashed-in mind, com-plete. And one of the reasons is – is his effort to remember gets painful, so he’d rather not remember. Now, when you’ve just been blown to pieces with a cannonball – you’re twenty-one years old and twenty-one years ago you were blown to pieces with a cannonball – trying to coax anybody to remember any earlier than twenty years ago or better still eighteen or more comfortably sixteen years ago, it becomes very hard unless a person knows what he’s up against. He tries to handle this. He has methods of handling this bank. And one of his favorite methods of handling the bank is almost as nutty as making it in the first place. His method of handling it is to forget about it. How crazy can you get? Of course, you have to be up in the vicinity of Clear before it really starts to look hi-lariously funny. Because you take a Grade V – even as high as Grade V (certainly as high as Grade IV), you find people still trying to figure out how that bank – you know, how the – the bank, mind: interchangeable words – how this mind of his is valuable. Of course, this is an excuse not to confront it. You know, \"I better not confront it and do anything about it because it’s so valuable.\" Well, of course, his effort to confront it is an effort to confront very, very painful ex-periences. And he doesn’t want to confront those painful experiences and so he said, \"There must be some virtue in it; I’d better leave it there.\" Another method he uses in fooling himself concerning it. And there’s a whole cult that follows this – a real cult; not what they call us, you see – called psychologists. And this cult actually follows and subscribes to the theory that you had"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 9 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    107    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE better be glad you’re neurotic. But that is merely a school’s expression of something that be-ings kind of want to think anyhow, see? If you can’t cure neurosis and you don’t know what the mind is all about anyhow, then you could excuse all that by simply saying, \"Well, you really don’t want anything done about your mind, because you see it’s a good thing you’re neurotic. You see, all great artists are nuts. You see, that’s obvious. Look at them.\" I don’t know, I also look at their artwork. Now, therefore, the mind is a complex mechanism which influences the individual and which he’s better off without. And you really won’t believe, all the way, that you’d be better off without it until you finally get rid of it, and then you say, \"I’ve sure had a lot of weird rea-sons while I was hanging on to all this coal tar.\" You say to yourself \"I must have been nuts!\" That’s right. [laughter, laughs] Now, every now and then – every now and then, somebody’s got a valence – some genius valence of some kind or another. And this genius valence is all rigged up to answer questions. And he’s got a computer, see? So he says, \"How big should I build this building?\" And he gets \"562½ feet high.\" So he puts it down on the drawing. He wouldn’t know what to do without that thing. It never occurs to him that he himself has to go around here and to work out the answer and then come back here and hear it. And he will become sad about losing his mind. He will come very sad about losing his mind if he gets – if he gets one of these things half-desensitized. It’s half-gone. It’s still there but it doesn’t work anymore, and he hasn’t taken back the ability. See, he hasn’t taken back and owned the ability to do it, and yet it is erased to a point where it doesn’t work. And at this point he will be rather regretful of having done something about it because he says, \"How big should the building be?\" Dead silence. [laughter] And then he goes along a little further and he gets a little bit better and all of a sudden, \"Of course,\" he says, \"the building ought to be 819 feet and a half. Only – any fool could see that.\" He can see that now, you see? What he did was attribute the ability to a circuit, put it on an automatic-response basis. But he was in actual fact using a valence. Now, every once in a while you’ll see a child come along and they can play a piano or a violin – oh my God! They just sit down and brrroom bang, you see? And they’re only six years old or something like this, and, wow, they’re playing with symphony orchestras. And all of a sudden they get to be ten, twelve, and they one day look at a piano and they don’t know what it is. That same mechanism occurred, except they’ve been working on a circuitry of some kind or another, and in the circuitry they have somehow or another erased part of the circuitry or done something about it. They never get up to a point of realization. Now, in one lifetime you can almost erase your own skills if you’ve put them all on picture form, which is quite remarkable. So a fellow starts out – boy, he just starts out great guns, and the next thing you know, why, he’s blah. Well, the best way to do that is to stick yourself in college. Get a nice valence of you – of you the expert; nice valence, you know – nice circuit out here, valence, a beingness – which is the expert. And then always consult the expert; never think it out for yourself see? And then one day accidentally abandon this thing, mislay it or move on the time track so that"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 10 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    108    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE you’re not near it anymore, and then be totally lost and not have the skill. But who has the skill in the first place? The individual himself. Do you follow? Now, a thetan, once having started this idiocy of mocking things up and mocking up and holding on to all of his personal experiences, then began to find virtues for it. And he made little machines and he did all kinds of things. Now, when you start reversing this proce-dure, he goes slightly mad, because halfway through any action, why, he will have lost the benefit of it without having regained it himself. Do you follow? This does not respond, however, on the IQ graphs. Any processing increases IQ. It’s almost impossible to lower IQ. So the individual is getting brighter, and that’s the final test of it. A great many things have worked out, of course, about Dianetic auditing since we have begun to make Clears. And man is basically good, and the more mind you get rid of the brighter you get, until you get rid of all of it – you’re very bright. All of this – all of these things, you see, have borne out and are perfectly true. Now, when I talk to you about Dianetic auditing, when I talk to you about erasing the automobile accident you’ve been in or losing Aunt Mamie, your favorite ally when you were a little boy, or something like this, you realize I’m talking to you about play. As far as audit-ing is concerned, this is play. The amount of benefit to be regained from running half a dozen engrams exceeds anything that man has ever been able to do for anybody in the history of the human race. And compares to Scientology processing the straight way at about one one-millionth of the potential gain. Do you understand? So, I’m talking to you about play today. But you as an auditor had better know about it and you better look at it and you better get familiar with it, because that is the mind. You are studying the cage. Them’s the bars. That’s what’s got you under arrest; it’s these tricks and vagaries. And the technology which it requires to vanquish this thing was actually in excess of the simple erasure of pictures. You had to know an awful lot. Now, that doesn’t mean it wasn’t still a simple problem and that the definitions of the mind didn’t hold, but it meant that the mind was more complex and the experiences had been far more complex than anybody had ever imagined. You see? And it was much harder for somebody to confront. Now, there’s a question of time. If picture by picture, you undertook to erase the mind, you would get into one of these binary digits I was talking to you about before. One of the things that made me come off of Dianetics entirely is I could make a Release and very often the fellow would sail off and so on. We’d called them Clears in those days and quite validly; he had been temporarily cleared. But his reactions to the entirety of existence were really in-finitely less than those of a Clear and of course infinitely, infinitely less from those for an OT. You see, after you’re Clear then you have to study up and regain what you can do. Anybody who is clever enough to mock up a mind and keep it in place and not even know about it for that long, he’s got a lot of abilities to en... he must be a very clever bunny, indeed; and so he is. But an individual has as many engrams and secondaries as he has had experiences, as he is old. Now, I don’t ask you to take my word for how old you are because it’s very impo-lite particularly to ladies to hang any vast age upon them, but if you will put yourself on a"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 11 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    109    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE meter someday and start chalking it up as to how long you’ve had a mind or something like this, you would come up with something very interesting, indeed. You’ll feel better, too. Unless you get too serious about it, and then you’ll plummet yourself right down into the middle of the reactive bank, and then you’ll have an awful time. So this – lightly, lightly, you know? A little goes a long ways sort of thing. But if you ask the question bluntly, \"How old am I?\" you would probably get a variety of answers because, of course, you are the ones who invented time. And you aren’t old. You have been in a certain state for a certain period of time and you can measure those states; but you cannot measure a total – a total, total with any degree of accuracy. You’re going to get variations all over the place. Now, you start going back in time and you’ll find out that there have been – there’s been quite a long period. Now, in view of the fact that you’ve probably averaged a pain every – well, let’s be reasonable about it; let’s say you’ve averaged a pain out of every year. Every year you have done something. You’ve stubbed your toe or you’ve had something hap-pen. Let’s say, you’ve averaged a pain in a year and a major catastrophe one way or the other every five or ten years. Now, let’s be very gross about the whole thing and say at least every lifetime you’ve had a catastrophe. I think that would be reasonable to suppose. Now, therefore, divide twenty-five into the length of time you have had a mind which reads on the meter, and I’m afraid you will get too many trillion incidents for anybody in this lifetime to sit and erase. So although theoretically it could all be erased, incident by incident, chain by chain and so forth – theoretically – you haven’t got that much auditing time and no-body has got that much patience. It would take something on the order of zaom, thousands of hours. Maybe binary digits of hours, you see? And this is impractical for a human being be-cause, I point out, the average age of the body at the time it decays totally is something around seventy, seventy-five today. See, you haven’t got enough time. Take more than sev-enty-five years to get in enough auditing to erase all of the engrams on the track. So therefore, I had to short-circuit this. I had to bring this right to basics and I had to bring it to basics of what actually did a thetan consist of rather than what was he mocking up. And then we addressed this and we addressed the mechanics of the thing, we have our current Gradation Chart, and then it is possible to clear somebody. And it’s very interesting now that anybody who came into Scientology untrained, unprocessed and so forth would, if he pressed right along with it – not too frantically, but just kept going more or less the rate at which you’re traveling at the moment – he would be at least a minimum or a maximum (depending on how hard he pressed at it) of two years to Clear. Now, you could do it much faster than that by becoming much more businesslike about it. But a reasonable assumption – a very reasonable assumption at the leisurely rate people move, and all that sort of thing, would be a couple of years to Clear. It’s – I don’t know what average time we have at the moment in the Clearing Course on the course itself. I can only make guesses, and so forth, and I knew when the technology was available – I don’t know how many Clears we’ve got now, and from that sort of thing I would guess that it’s somewhere between a ye... eight months’ and a year’s auditing. I would just guess that. That’s very reasonable auditing, you know? That’s getting tired and lazy and stupid and for-getting about it and patching it up and going to Review and then being very businesslike for two whole weeks and... You know, that kind of thing."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 12 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    110    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So that – the lower grades, however, these things are so perfected – and there is no shortcut for VI and VII. Anybody who comes along and tells you there’s any shortcut for VI and VII, he’s just trying to cut your throat. Remember that. There is no shortcut. Somebody said to me, \"I should have thought, Ron, that you would have blown the whole bank just by plotting it.\" Ho, ho, ho! Ha! Even me, no. And I was – get – I got, on en-grams, eventually so I could take a fantastic engram, you know, where you were just blown all to pieces and betrayed at the same time and totally surprised and scattered all over the en-vironment for a few minutes and that sort of thing, and blow those things just by inspection. Say, \"Oh yes, there it is.\" Whoooch! And gone, see? I got up to a point where I could do that. Huh, confronting the basic reactive bank isn’t like that. I’m not trying to scare you; I’m just trying to keep you from making mistakes. Now, your engrams are erasable and in the process of erasing them you get into vari-ous phenomena which I have already told you about but some of those now auditing them obviously didn’t listen. So, I will tell you again, nicely and politely and without – as Stan said the other day, he said, \"What’s marvelous about you,\" he says, \"you don’t scream and beat the desk, and so forth.\" I accepted the compliment, but actually some of your top executives will tell you I do scream and beat the desk every now and then, you know? Not really over stupid-ity – not over stupidity. That isn’t why I scream and beat the desk. Just to get compliance. [laughs] Now, what’s interesting about this is that the moment that you run a late engram on a chain... Let’s – you’ve probably got your nomenclature a bit tangled up and you probably should listen very carefully and you probably should get your misunderstood words out of this stuff and so on, because this is very, very important. Here you have – let’s – let’s take a picture of a ladder and we’re going down a ladder here. Now, the bottom rung of this ladder is the basic on the chain. It is more important, there-fore I’ve made it blacker. Actually this, here we put another ladder here, and we put the top rung as very black and important – that’s the way it looks. And this bottom rung, it – impor-tant at the time – was very slight. And you say, \"Therefore, the toughest incident would be the earliest incident.\" No! No, the toughest incident to try to do anything about is the – the most recent one. And the easiest one to do something about is the earliest one. Now, a chain simply means a series of incidents of similar content. There’s the hit-by-a-car chain. Now, there may only be one engram on a chain but that would be very rare in-deed. There maybe are 20 hit-by-cars chains, see, 20 on the hit-by-a-car chain. Now, if we’re speaking of this lifetime, you may find 1 or 2 on the hit-by-a-car chain that won’t erase on account of unfortunately for the reality of some people who don’t like the truth and can’t face... You know, people don’t like past lives because you – you’re pointing their attention back at a lot of agony. There’s a good reason for it, see? This guy is 41 years old – 41 years ago he died. He probably didn’t die pleasantly, ei-ther, being the kind of fellow he is. [laughter] So you tell him he’s lived before this life, you’re pointing his attention back at that horrible incident, and so forth, and he just bounces straight back to present time, shaking, actually. You think he’s mad because he’s talking"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 13 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC 111 HUBBARD STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE about past life. No! He’s terrified! \"Don’t t-don’t talk to me about-bout-bout-bout-bout p-p-p-past lives. Damn you Scientologists!\" You see? \"Oh, you dogs! Kill ‘em!\" You say, \"Sonny boy, why be so yellow?\" Now, the resolution of a problem requires that you handle the elements of the prob-lem. The resolution of a problem requires that you handle the elements of a problem. You will never solve a problem by handling different elements than the problem has. Isn't that rrroah! This is one of man’s favorite indoor sports: solving problems by using different elements than the problem contains. So, therefore, if you insist on a person staying in this lifetime, you’re going to run into the hit-by-a-car chain with 2 incidents in this lifetime which are the last of 520 incidents. And you’re trying to erase the last 2 of 520 incidents. He was first hit by a car 1,765,000 years ago, 3 months, 1 day, 1 hour and 10 seconds ago. The mind! See? Back! And when you go through an incident once and it doesn’t desensitize, and you start the fellow through again and the incident now appears a little bit heavier and massy, you better hit the silk, man. You’re probably at 897 on that chain. And you start to put this fellow through it, you try to put this fellow through it too often, and it’s just going to get heavier and heavier and thicker and thicker. And one of the symptoms of this is his bouncing out of it. Now, we’re not going to handle bouncers now and get guys repeated down into it and that sort of thing. There’s no point in doing that. There are easier ways to handle it; just erase the earlier incident. Now, it’s the – always requires the earliest incident that you can reach to totally desensitize a chain. But here’s one of the symptoms. You start through – start the pc through an engram, and when you bring him back through to go over it again, he says exactly what he says before without any change or variation. He is no longer in the time of that engram. He has bounced and he’s now running out of the lock he put into PT. He’s now busy running the present time lock. It was so heavy that it laid in a lock in present time, see? Do you follow? It hasn’t done him any harm. So, you were busy running an engram of ten or seven years ago, you see, and it’s the hit-by-a-car, and it’s bokety-bokety-bokety-bokety-bokety-bokety-bokety-bokety-bok. And then you start him through it the second time, and he goes bokety-bokety-bok, and there’s no new material shows up of any kind whatsoever, he’s not seven or ten years ago. He’s not back where it was at all. He’s erasing what he just laid in in PT. He’s just going over it again. Also, he’s learned better. He’s learned better than to go near it. And you have run into the same mechanism, exactly, of why a thetan keeps a mind – because he doesn’t want to con-front it. It would erase if he confronted it, but it is too painful for him to do so. So you’ve ac-tually got a pc a bit in over his head. You have been a bit too persuasive, and you have been locating engrams on a meter. You naughty fellow. \"Oh,\" you say, \"of course. Well, you al-ways locate engrams on a meter.\" No, you run them on a meter. You introduce a meter into the location of incidents and you’re going to run a pc over his head the whole time because the meter can see deeper than he can.

That’s the incident. No meter. Now, as we run him through it with Dianetic auditing and so forth – it’s a secondary, of course, because it contains loss – as we run him through this thing, you’re going to get meter action. Great. And you better watch your meter, too, because it’s liable to go free needle or something on you, see? If it does, forget that chain. Get onto something else. You understand now? A man can remember what he can confront. And that’s all he’s going to remember. If he had a fight at breakfast, he’s not going to want to remember breakfast. Well, if he got hit by a truck ten years ago, he don’t want to remember hit by a truck ten years ago. Now, if he talks about it at all, it’s because he’s talking about a lock which he’s moved up into PT which is comfortable. He’ll tell you all about having been hit by a truck, but he won’t give it to you in present time as though it’s just now, this minute happening. Now, you see, he can come to present time away from the incident and have a sort of a synthetic history of this incident, and he can go through that, and if you locate incidents on meters, that’s the way he will run engrams. All sort of synthetic in PT and he doesn’t want to go back down... The guy – the guy who is the most shivery, the guy who is at fear on the Tone Scale will act like he’s on a powerful spring which is shooting him straight up the track to PT. And boy, he’s stuck right here, you know? He is not going to go back anyplace. No, no, no, nopla-ce. No. \"Ah, how about breakfast?\" \"Oh, well, I don’t know anything about b... how about breakfast?\" \"Well, can you remember what you had for breakfast?\" \"Oh, I don’t know. Is that necessary?\" This is not the chap who wins medals for courage. See what I’m talking about? He acts like he’s being ejected on hydraulic thrust straight up to present time, boy, and he’s here hummmm-hummmm-hummmm! Now, you say – you say now, \"In your...\" Poor Freud. He was dealing with people of this type all the time, you see? They couldn’t co... they’re as crazy as they couldn’t confront, you see, and they were pretty nutty. And he was asking them to go back and remember their childhood. Why, man, if he’d ever – it never occurred to him to ask, \"Can you remember en-tering the office?\" Because they would have said, probably, \"I don’t know. How did I get here?\" It’s a fact. Amnesia – amnesia is simply – is not a very mysterious mechanism. It’s just a guy who is so spooked that he doesn’t dare remember ten seconds ago. Now, he’s had some ex-perience beyond which – earlier than which he is not going to remember, including the ex-perience. So he’s only willing to remember some moment after that experience. Now, we call this amnesia. He’s just scared."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 15 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    113    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, you’ll run into this all the time in varying degrees in pcs. And the worst ones off are those that are just rigid in present time. They’re going along with each click of the clock and no further back than the last click. This person will tell you he has a bad memory. That is not the only source of bad memory. A bad memory is just accumulated occlusion of it all, but it’s nevertheless nonconfront, see? Trying to train somebody with beatings would be the last way in the world that you could train anybody because you’ve given him all of his education so that he can’t confront it. Now, here – here we have then a problem – this give – tells you why some instructors are very beloved by their students and turn out genius students, you know? For some reason or other everything he gave the student, the student finds that’s the easiest thing in the world to confront, so that’s what he knows. Now, where do you find relief to this situation of the pc stuck in present time? Now, you’re going to find some pc, you’re going to find an incident, you will actually get him back into the first part of that incident, you’ll get him to roll off that incident. Maybe he’ll even go through it once. He’ll all of a sudden hold back the pain that his hip – hrrh. That’s it. He was already in it, so he said, \"Mmmm, we don’t want that; we want this.\" Pshmom! Like a diver coming out of the bottom of the sea, he comes up to the surface and he runs the next time straight along on present time where it’s nice and safe. He doesn’t want anything to do with that dirty old nasty pain that almost took his leg off. Do you see? Do you get it? So it’s all a bounce. It isn’t just a bouncer, a \"get out,\" that pushes people up to present time or shoots them about. Now, an individual actually will feel so imprisoned at some point of the track – he’s liable to feel so imprisoned that he knows he cannot progress any further than that point for-ever. And you’ll find somebody who’s totally stuck on the track. But this is somebody who is terrified of the future. And people get in this frame of mind about when they’re to be exe-cuted. If you can recall the last time you were about to be executed – [laughs] time must halt at that point. And you’ll find out that a pc seems to go back earlier very easily. So, he shoots back to the beginning of the – of anything. You can’t hold him in an incident. You say, \"Come, come, now, we’re going to run the automobile accident when you had – when you were 5 years old, and so forth.\" \"Yeah, well I – Oh, by the way, I got one now. I got one now two thousand years ago. I got one now 15 thousand. I got one a trillion years ago; got one 2 trillion years ago.\" And you say, \"Well, whoa, whoa, whoa.\" Well, recognize what you’re dealing with. This is the guy who doesn’t dare move forward with the time track. Now, you’d only get him misbehaving and a Dianetic audited pc only misbehaves when put beyond his ability to confront and then you run into all the problems of Dianetics. Now you have to know an infinite number of solutions. Now you have to be clever not ‘arf. You have to be a screaming genius with answers. You have to sit there and sweat, man, as an auditor. You’ve got to be right on the ball! So much more on the ball than you can be that you’ll flub. Why? You’re running the pc over his head."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 16 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    114    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE And one of the best ways in the world to run a pc over his head in early stages of au-diting – later on you can start using a meter – but in the early days – I mean use a meter to locate. The way to really run a pc over his head is take him bright, brassy green, no familiarity with the mind, doesn’t even know about mental image pictures, discover the source of his lumbosis, plunge him into it straightaway and try to force him to go through it. You will have a very unwilling Pc. You have to practically sit on his head; he bounces all over the place. The second time you bring him through it, he runs it in PT. He can find no other part of the chain. He can’t erase it, you know? He’s in trouble all the way. You have to therefore be very clever as an auditor. Do I make my point? It’s just you’re running him beyond his ability to confront. That is all. His ability to confront is one-millionth of a – of an attention unit. And what he’s confronting and you’re asking him to confront requires one thousandth of an attention unit. And he’s not about to stay there comfortably and do anything about it at all. Do you follow? Therefore, if you will look in this bulletin of 3 April 1966, it carefully stresses gradi-ent scales. Now, after you’ve been going a little while, yes, you can find it on a meter, but the guy’s ability to confront is up. You’re getting someplace. But the truth of the matter is if you want to make a Release this way, don’t ever locate anything on a meter, and he will come out the right end of it. He will be able to confront more and more and more, and you’ve improved his ability to confront his past experience. Now, you could almost bring about the same result with a repetitive processes – \"What can you confront?\" See, you could almost bring about the same result. But as a matter of fact, an individual can then build up, build up, build up, but he him-self is not getting an insight into his mind. With a repetitive command of this character, you’re going for broke. In other words, you’re going for result. But with Dianetic auditing, we’re not going for result. We’re trying to give you audit-ing practice, and we’re trying to have some fun. If you get results, it’s your own fault. [laugh-ter] And if you do this right, why, you will get results. And the test of it is, is does your pc feel any better afterwards? Now, if he doesn’t feel any better, you’ve done one of two things: You’ve either let him go too light or you’ve let him go too strong. See, you’ve insisted that he run some tiny, light lock that he isn’t even vaguely interested in and could confront a dozen like it, or you’ve insisted he go in over his head. Now, the mind knows what it can tolerate, so the best test is the pc, not the meter. The guy knows what he can tolerate. So, you say, you want – going to run a secondary now. Well, you can ask him for, \"Now, have you ever lost – have you ever lost anything?\" And if you wanted to be very sure, you could say, \"Recently, have you lost anything?\" See? Asking sneakily on the line. And he says, \"Yes, as a matter of fact I lost a ring.\" Run it. But now, when you’re asking for moments of loss, remember that you’re ask-ing for the whole chain of all secondaries because that is the definition by – which it has. So you could soften your question up even further. \"Do you recall a period of sadness?\" Let’s"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 17 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    115    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE attach the emotion to it. Now, we could ask for times when he was sad, times when he was afraid, times when he was this, times when he was that. You talk about throwing people in over their head. In the early days of running, there were so many techniques developed for throwing people into engrams that it was practically a snap of the fingers and over Niagara Falls the guy went. He didn’t have any choice. We were so skilled in those days of putting people into incidents, and so on, that the most remarkable dramatizations would occur – fantastic body convulsions; they’d practically fly all over the room. And I remember one chap that I snapped into an incident – and I cured something with him; it’s true that you can do something with it – of straight unadulterated terror. Terror so great, that as his body shook on the bed, he was lifting the legs of the bed off the floor and banging them down again in a chatter. [raps the desk] Sounds impossible! I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it with me own eyes! That bed was chattering against the floor! This guy was scared! [laughter] And there is a thing like an odor of fear, and that odor perme-ated the room to a point where I never thought I would smell anything like it in my life. It smelled like a terrified army in full rout. And it was an incident. It was right there. He’d been sitting in it. It was in full restim. He just – an incident he kept resisting; he couldn’t confront any part of it, and I just tripped him into it, with some skill. But it was an incident where he and a fellow scout had gone – as a couple of savages – to scout the enemy position and had been caught, and his companion had been boiled and eaten before him and then he, in an effort not to get eaten, had managed to get free and throw himself over a cliff. And it finally developed how – ever; that he couldn’t really determine whether he’d been thrown over the cliff because he had gone mad or whether he had thrown himself over the cliff. And it finally resolved, and so forth, that he had thrown himself over the cliff. But he ran this out and the emotion discharged from it. I only had to go through it five or six times and it finished it. But he was not about to go any-place else on the track. It completely changed his life, as a matter of fact. But there we were auditing for result. And undoubtedly you could bring about a fast result. And the reason we wanted to bring about fast results is because there are so many en-grams. There are just so fantastically many engrams that we were becoming choosy as to which ones we were supposed to run, and we were trying to speed up the process. Well, you’re not trying to do that. You’re just trying to learn about the mind. The faster process was the first one I ever used, which is gradient scales. Find some-thing the fellow can confront and run him through it. And, factually, I’ve made people a lot better by getting them to run the incident of walking into the room to keep their appointment with me. Managed to coax them back that far on the time track. And I had my best results with that type of an approach. So you say, \"What would you consider your chronic emotion is?\" And the fellow says – you know, you can be tricky about this – \"What would you say your chronic emotion would be?\" Well, the fellow says, \"I – I – I don’t know. I think I’m just bored most of the time.\""},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 18 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    116    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE \"Well, that’s good enough. And can you remember a time when you were bored?\" \"Oh, yes, yes.\" \"Good. Now, let’s start in at the beginning of that period.\" You’ll find a secondary, and you’ll find another secondary. And you’ll find another secondary below this. And the next thing you know there was real stuff here in being bored. You find this guy in actual fact was made to be in a place of no interest but some danger for a period of time that was very upsetting. Now, if you went and ran engrams to parallel this – you don’t have to call for en-grams to parallel this – sooner or later you’re going to come up with an incident where he was executed or something in exactly the same type of surrounding as he was waiting for while in danger. And that would be the engram which gave this other thing. Yes, it is a chronic emo-tion and you could ask for various types of emotions and this way you could sort the thing out. There are lots of tricky things you can do. I’m not trying to put any slightest block on the tricky things that you can do. I don’t care how many commands you give him while he’s running it. \"Oh, go on,\" you know, and so forth. \"Keep it up.\" \"Continue.\" Anything you want to say. I’m just saying get the guy through it. That’s what you’re supposed to do. That’s really what you’re supposed to do. Well, what does it take to do that? And I’m telling you that you’ll get your best results by not throwing the fellow in over his head. Then you won’t run into all of these things whereby you need 8,765 solutions, you see, to 50,000 problems. See, you’re not going to run into any prob-lems. The guy will run what he almost can confront, and he’ll get quite a – quite a bang out of running something he almost can confront. He’ll get quite a relief out of this. But you would just be fascinated how little some people can confront. But also you could be fasci-nated at how much some people can confront. This fellow, he’ll run through it and somatics are tearing all over the place and so forth and, \"So, the lion took another mouthful out of my left leg.\" You know? Great. It’s what the pc can do, not what you decide the pc can do. But the individual who just doesn’t run well and doesn’t seem to get anyplace and that sort of thing is of two varieties. He has two things wrong: He is either being asked to confront far, far too much, or far, far too little. And the number of them that will be confronting far, far too little are very few and far between. So, it boils down to the most commonest – the commonest thing that you’ll run into is asking them to confront too much. How much is too much? Well, it is too much for the guy you are auditing. That same \"too much\" won’t be too much for the next guy you audit. Do you understand? It varies from being to being because experience varies. Not only does ex-perience vary but different parts of the track are in restimulation. Some people are in a very tough basic incident of some kind or another which makes all other incidents – the lightest of locks – the most painful things imaginable. Now, you want to start running down a chain. Now, of course, if you call for a loss then that – you’re ask... making a bid now to run out every single engram on the whole track. So, if you want to get a little more practice, why, extend it a little bit further and call for –"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 19 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    117    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE what’s the guy’s chronic emotion, now? Well, solve that chronic emotion. Work on it as a project. And you’ll do a lot of secondaries. Secondaries will go right straight down the line. Now, some people have an idea that there is an engram and then a secondary occurs and then the secondary accumulates locks. Now, it isn’t that simple. The mind is – I’ve – just because I have given you simple answers is no reason the mind is simply built. You have all the jerry-rigged messes you ever wanted to run into. Now, listen. There will be a chain; that is to say, the original and then the repeated in-cidents, plotted in time thereafter of the same type of incident. There will be a chain of en-grams, which is to say, incidents containing pain and unconsciousness. You know, the off-with-the-head chain. The off-with-the-head chain, see? And here are 150 engrams, each one of which consists of having one’s head cut off. Now oddly enough, there will also be, in par-allel to that, the off-with-the-head motivator series. And there’ll be 49, or something like that, incidents whereby the individual cut somebody else’s head off. Now, in addition to all of that, each one of those will have accumulated locks which are conscious-level experiences which sort of stick and the individual doesn’t quite know why. A shiny piece of metal would be enough to make a lock, see? So, each one of the 150 engrams has many locks. When I say many, I would say, oh, 2 or 3 hundred thousand. Each one of the 150. Now, what’s the secondaries? Well, the secondaries, if you had a rung of a ladder, as you were looking at a ladder, and the bottom side of that rung were natural wood color and there was a stripe of black painted across the top of the rung, you would have the secondary. It’s actually lying right straight there with the engram. Now, each one of those 150 engrams has its own secondary. There’s a secondary probably for every single one of the 150 engrams. And each of those secondaries has a lock, and not only has a lock but has maybe 2 or 3 thou-sand locks. Now, worse than that, this chain cross-references and interconnects with public gath-erings, injuries during. Now, that’s not a series of locks, that will be independent – an inde-pendent series of engrams containing pain and unconsciousness, each one of the incidents, you know? Why, there was the fellow in the crowd, and he was a little boy, and the crowd surged, and they squashed him and he died, you see? I mean this type of incident. Now, those will – those engrams – the off-with-the-head chain will be the smashed-in-the-crowd chain, you see? The public gatherings, incidents in, they will be cross-referenced and their locks will intermingle. So, that the locks of one of these chains will also cross over and become the locks of the off-with-the-head chain, also. Isn’t that great! Now, let me show you where you would really get foxed if you tried to trace some-thing like this down and you would really have trouble. We want to know... And this is a typical – a typical Freudian problem – fetishism: The fellow has a fixation on hairbrushes. I can assure you the mind has enough incident in it. They just underestimated the amount of incident, you see, by about – one ten-trillionth is about all the incident they thought was there, see?"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 20 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    118    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A hairbrush would be absolutely impossible to trace back to all of its engramic and secondary influences or associators. Be impossible. It would be impossible to take any single article and trace it back to why the individual is afraid of it. That would be impossible! You could desensitize it. You could find some reasons for it. But to get the basic reason for it? Oh, no! Oh, huh! It occurs in engram chain one, engram chain two, engram chain three, secondary chain four, and 8 billion locks. And it turns out not to be a hairbrush, anyhow. It turns out to be a small black animal. [laughter] Hairbrush itself just restimulated. But to set anybody a job of tracing something like that back would be pure idiocy. There would be no point in it of any kind whatsoever. Wrong way to go about it. Wrong end to. Those are the cognitions that the guy gets out of it. \"Hey! A bridle.\" \"Yes, yes,\" you say, coaxing him, making him aware of your presence. [laughter] \"I always wondered. I always wondered why. I always wondered why. Yes, it’s the disk on the bridle. That’s what it is.\" You say, \"Well, what was that?\" \"Well, Mother always used to wear a cameo, and it matches the disk on this bridle. And it’s when I was killed – heh – at the tournament, the fellow had a disk on the side of the bridle and that hit me. And that was the last thing I saw. And I used to wonder why I got colic all the time, you see? And my mother wore this. Yeah, that’s great. I’m sure glad to get that straightened out.\" Well, you be glad to get it straightened out, too. And you be glad when he moves off of it, because he’s going to find 8 thousand more reasons before he’s through. [laughs] Do you follow? Men have experienced things. Women have experienced things. There’s hardly any-thing an individual has not been or done at one time or another of his career. And to say, \"This is a specialized thetan; he has always been a magistrate\" – don’t make me laugh. At what period in his career did he get tired of being a criminal and become a magistrate? [laugh-ter] After having been a ditch digger, a coal heaver, a counsel, an artisan, a pilot, a space op-era ranger, a writer, you know? But the individual’s experiential track is very important with regard to what he can do when he finally comes out, because we’re producing a new thing in a Clear. We’re producing a being without a bank who has experience. Never had anything like that before, see? Now, one has had main points of experience on the track which have been more em-phasized than other points, and he will tend to be better at these things than things he has not had so much experience with. But it’s a case of emphasis, not difference. Now, where your individual is being run on engrams, he can easily get in too deep, but only if you push him in. And if he’s not running up new material, if he’s not running them properly, why, you figure out why, in view of what I’ve been telling you. Now, it’s either over- or underconfront, and my bet is on that it’s overconfront. And you asked too general-ized a question and you took too vague an answer on something. You didn’t get the thing es-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"DIANETIC AUDITING AND THE MIND 21 SHSBC-435 – 28.7.66 HSDC    119    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE tablished. You didn’t decide what you were going to run. You didn’t get it all mapped out before you began it. You’re going to run some times when the guy was scared. All right, great. We’re go-ing to run some times when the guy was scared. What was the last time he was scared? All right. And the individual all of a sudden trips into this new mechanism of \"mustn’t have any future.\" Back down the track he goes, starts winding up in bad incidents, and so forth. Well, it’s simply because you sort of lost control of the whole situation. You didn’t steady him on and make him run what you started to run. You got him all involved in whether he should go earlier and he’s trying to go totally Clear on engram running. Well, if he wants to go totally Clear on engram running he undoubtedly could do so. Undoubtedly do so. It’d only take him three or four lifetimes. And I want to point out that the body goes to pieces in a fairly regular lineup at once every seventy years, or something like that, and so he hasn’t got time to do that. You understand any more about engrams? Audience: Yeah. Well, I’m talking to you about the woof and the warp and the exact thing which you’re auditing all the way to Clear. Now, I think that it’s a good time that people not only got some practice auditing but also made some bowing acquaintance with that thing which has got them in the cage. And it’s always a very good thing when you find yourself in a trap to find out what the trap consists of. I often say that to myself when I find myself in traps. But don’t despair if you have not yet been able to run an engram on anybody. You ha-ven’t been able to run an engram because you’ve disdained to run some faint lock. If all goes to pieces, and you are no longer able to make any progress – and you haven’t been able to make any progress – not no longer able – if you haven’t been able to make any progress with your pc and you haven’t been able to get him into anything, you haven’t been able to run any-thing and so forth, run breakfast. You’ll find that usually works. If you can’t run breakfast and so forth, run the time he came to the session as an incident. Do you know that people – not just that, but people can be so bad off that present time and the march of time past him in this universe is itself a continuous running engram. He is living in a moment of pain and unconsciousness. And the tick, tick of the clock is an engram in itself. Now, a person is pretty batty when they’re in that shape. They’re very batty indeed. As a matter of fact, you won’t find them around here. But that’s how bad it can get. And you’ve run into some vestige of that when you’re not able to run incidents on your pc. He just is not about to go anyplace. It’s nice and safe where he is. And so, you can always run an incident on somebody. Don’t listen to orders that \"I must run an engram.\" No, run the incident your pc can confront and run, and you will win all the way.

Audience: Fine. Thank you. Good. This is what? Audience: June the 11th. June 10th. Audience: 11th. Eleventh? I lost a day. All right, 11 June AD 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Now, this lecture today – this lecture today – reminds me very interestingly of 42 Ab-erdeen Road, and Elizabeth, New Jersey, 1949, Bay Head, New Jersey. Quite reminiscent, because this lecture concerns engrams. And I finally found out why you can’t run engrams. That’s an awful slow take on my part. There’s been something wrong with the communica-tion; the communication of the matter. And I finally found out you’ve been trying to run en-grams. And you never run engrams; you run chains of engrams. So we’ll call this technology which I’m giving you Engram Running by Chains, well understanding that nobody ever suc-cessfully ran engrams any other way. This is the way I ran engrams back in 1949. Let me tell you where it got crossed up. Oh, I fancied this up; this is very simple these days because we’ve got tremendous technol-ogy. I can give you a very close-to-rote series of actions that are very easy to do. Let me tell you where this got fancied up. You got it crossed up with repetitive processing: \"Flatten the process.\" So, naturally, you have to flatten the engram, don’t you? Hmmm! No, you only have to flatten the chain. You don’t have to flatten the engram, you flatten the chain. But re-petitive processing is what raised its ugly head and got you all mixed up on running engrams. \"Flatten that process!\" \"The way out is the way through!\" You know? That kind of thing. So you apply that to a single engram; you’re in a mess promptly for several reasons. Because it is only part of a chain of similar incidents, which in itself is only part of a time track which has all sorts of incidents on it. And you’re essentially running a time track – not a stick, not a chunk of something. These things are all related. So therefore, all engrams are handled as parts of a chain of similar incidents. And you never handle an engram all by itself. Because they don’t exist all by themselves. I’ve already said it’s part of a chain and the chain is part of a time track; how can you handle it all by itself? It’s too closely related to these other two things to be so handled."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 2 11.6.63 HSDC    122    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, if it were just one item like a hunk of mud or something, you could bring it in and mix it in water and precipitate it and so forth, and then you’d pick up another hunk of mud, and handle it in some particular way, and then pick up another hunk of mud and handle it in some particular way. Well, that would be relatively easy. But unfortunately, the \"hunk of mud\" is a chain of engrams, is never a single engram. You’ve got to handle this thing as a chain and part of a chain. Now, if you are a skilled auditor, you can pick up bypassed charge; you know why the pc is ARC breaking. You can find it out in a fast hurry. Pc ARC breaks, bang! Either you know what you’re doing – know what just must have happened – or you can shake it out of the meter in an awful hurry and locate it and indicate it and the ARC break will cease. And until you have a reality on being able to do this as an auditor, you’re going to have very upset sessions because the pc will ARC break inexplicably. You won’t ever be able to find out why he’s ARC breaking. You’ll have the trouble that we used to have in the old days where we had to have a process for an ARC break. Well, it might have gotten to it and it might not have gotten to it, and it was random. But now we could immediately and directly locate the bypassed charge that is causing the pc to ARC break. Now, that’s very, very important to engram running be-cause the bypassed charge is always the earlier incident on the engram chain, and you bypass the earlier incident on the engram chain, you get an ARC break. This is elementary, my dear Watson. Charge. There, by the way, will be quite a few bulletins out on this; two have already been written – enormous things – and there’ll be another bulletin on the material I’m giving you today. And these will be dressed up and put out into a new book on the subject. This lec-ture is the first release of this material. Therefore, I’m not releasing all of this material. I’m not telling you that in order to run an engram – I can tell you this, but not elaborate on it; let me say that – in order to run an engram you’ve got to know what the time track is and be able to handle the time track. You should know what you’re trying to handle in terms of charge. What is charge? Now, the charge, of course, is that electronic ping-bang that hits the pc in the blonk and causes him to go bunk, or blows and causes him to get better. See, you pays your money and you takes your chance on charge. You either release the charge and the pc gets better or you encyst and stir up the charge and the pc blows his stack. You get the... there’s two roads by which you can travel on charge, and there’s no middle ground; there isn’t any middle ground. Just forget the fact that you could go on and grind for eighteen years and get no change on the pc. The pc will either get better or get worse. He won’t remain the same. Now, what do we mean by getting worse? Actually, he might think better, and feel worse. You get the idea? His knowledge has increased, but the charge is still knocking his ‘ead off. Now, you can get into that situation in engram running. You can lay open a tremen-dous amount of engram – engramic information. He can get all kinds of information – you never blow any charge off of it anyplace. Well, that’s because you weren’t looking for basic; you were looking for information."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 3 11.6.63 HSDC    123    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Many an auditor falls for this because the pc wants to know how come he was on the planet Yuk-zuk in a railway conductor’s uniform, you see? What was he doing there? And that’s all very interesting and we can assuage his curiosity to some degree, but if we go in for just assuaging the curiosity of the thing – dramatizing watching TV or something like that, you see – we unfortunately get into the situation where we’re not following down an en-gramic chain. So here, you see, is another great liability in running engrams. We get so absorbed in dramatis personae and that sort of thing, that we actually aren’t running the chain of engrams at all, we are simply trying to find out. See, get that as a liability, because it is a liability. You actually can find out all about what this pc was doing on the planet Uk-zuk – you could find out all about it. The only trouble is the basic on it was on the planet Pan-wan, which was a trillion years earlier. You see? So, engram handling is engram handling in that you want the chain of engrams which lead to the basic of that chain; you want to go down that chain and get the basic of the chain. Why? Well, every time you run an engram, you open up a little valve. We have a big joke around Saint Hill about the \"weather valves.\" Workmen and I are always talking about these weather valves. And they get stuck open and they get stuck shut and various other things hap-pen. We have our opinions as to who’s doing it. We think it’s Profumo now, [laughter] and so forth. Well, if you could imagine an equally hypothetical series of valves: one between each pair of engrams, see? So let’s take basic on the chain; that’s engram 1. And then we get 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 – a little valve between each one of these pairs, see? All right, you run number 20 on the chain and you unwittingly open the valve from number 19. And the charge contained in number 19 restimulates and leaks, to some degree, into 20. So you’re trying to run the charge out of 19, by running 20. The charge is coming from 19; after a certain – a very short period of time, it’s all coming from 19 now. Well, now this is very interesting because it poses this kind of a condition: Number 20, if you continue to run it, gets sticky, solid; E-Meter action ceases; no tone arm action on run-ning it. There’s nothing on it, you see, it’s just gum. Or it’s getting more and more solid and it’ll eventually collapse on the pc. What’s making it collapse? Well, it’s the charge in 19. And you could run 20 endlessly without ever taking any charge off 19. But this makes 19 potential bypassed charge so the pc will ARC break. Do you see that now? You opened the valve and then didn’t do anything about it. So, the thing to do is to find out – by the way, you don’t have to find 19, which is quite interesting; you can sometimes find 16. But let us just keep it in an orderly progression here, and we find 19. Now, oddly enough, until we found 20, we couldn’t have found 19 because it’s as though we had a big barrier across the track. It’s all the charge there in 20, don’t you see, pre-vents us from seeing 19. And this is a very funny thing: We can say, \"Give us the earliest en-gram on this chain\" – this is inevitable – and they give you number 20, see? And the E-Meter only registers on 20 and 20 will register that this is the earliest incident on this line. It’ll do this consistently, you see, because the track is barriered. The E-Meter, the reality, nothing else can get back of 20."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 4 11.6.63 HSDC    124    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So you – although you’ve asked for the earliest, that’s true of the earliest part of the incident, you see? You always get more first part of the incident, you see; you can always find a few minutes earlier on an incident. Well, similarly, right on down to basic, why, you can always find an earlier engram. See, even though your meter kept saying that it was the earliest engram, or even though the pc and the meter said that it was the earliest part of the engram – that nothing like this ever happened before – as soon as we sweep some of this debris away, well, we find out we’re looking at number 19. It’s now the earliest, see? And it’ll continue to be the earliest till we clean it up a bit. And as soon as we’ve cleaned it up a bit, we’ve got number 18. And as soon as we cleaned 18 up, we now find the absolutely, regrettable first incident on this line. And what do we find? We find 17. And that is absolutably the first incident on this line; and we get 16. You see what I mean? Now, if you recognize some of these – they’re terribly interesting, but awfully simple, idiotic points. If you could take a hose – if you could take a piece of garden hose, or some-thing of the sort, and put clamps on it, see, and put a block of wood across it, and say this is an engram, number 20, you see? Now run this engram and then loosen up this little clamp, and you will see that the water pressure which you’ve gotten into the hose, you see – it is in each one of these balloons along in the hose sections – will go into 20, from 19, see? It’s just as fluidy and fundamental as that, you know? It’s like pouring beer steins back and forth into one or the other... But the charge always flows late; charge always goes later, doesn’t go ear-lier. Now, it’s quite interesting, many of these manifestations, but if two things come to-gether, two pictures come together, then there is bypassed charge. In other words, if two en-grams collapse or two pictures collapse – no matter what you’re running in auditing. This is true of all auditing, by the way; it isn’t a specialized subject. You got this bypassed charge, it’ll cause two pictures to come together. For instance, you’re looking there – a pc is looking at a lamppost. And all of a sudden there’s another lamppost standing alongside it, and he knows they’re not the same picture because they have different periods of architecture and so forth, and he says, \"There’s two lampposts here.\" The first thing the auditor knows is that charge has been bypassed. See? That’s what causes the collapse. Got that? Now, that’s the first thing he knows. See? Whatever else he knows, he knows that. Now, if charge has been bypassed, what’s the pc going to do in the next few minutes? He’s going to ARC break. Yeah. Sun rises – sun sets, bypassed charge – pc ARC breaks. Okay? Very inevitable. So this tells you why some auditors – some auditors are capable of running smooth sessions and some auditors are... have ARC-breaky sessions. Well, it’s just to the degree that some auditors pick up bypassed charge and some auditors don’t pick up bypassed charge, see. That’s the difference between this ARC break and no ARC break session. All right. Now, out-of-valenceness – you know, \"That’s me over there\" – is also a problem in bypassed charge. You will get this in running an engram. And you shouldn’t make a mistake, because this out-of-valenceness is quite interesting. The engram he is in, if an ear-lier engram is tapped – you see, he’s in engram 20 and you’ve just clipped or tapped number 19, and it’s bled charge now into 20 – it will simply cause a beef-up of the mass, you see, and"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 5 11.6.63 HSDC    125    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE it’ll cause a strengthening of the somatic and that sort of thing. But it probably won’t cause an out-of-valenceness. An out-of-valenceness is a missing earlier portion of the same engram you are work-ing. See? He starts getting two-pictureness. He’s getting two pictures, that sort of thing: that’s probably out of 19. You understand? But it also may be in 20. But for sure, if he goes out of valence, you haven’t picked up the beginning of 20. There’s another five days at the start of 20. We know it was the beginning because the pc said so in 20. We know that was the start of 20 because we sent the pc to the beginning of it. And he takes a look at himself, and he says, \"I’m way out of valence here.\" That is to say, \"I’m over there.\" Well, he didn’t go to the beginning of it, that’s all. There’s more beginning on this engram than he has suspected. And that’s what – that’s the charge that normally throws them out of valence. But that out-of-valenceness is also assisted by bleeding charge up from 19. You understand what I mean by out-of-valenceness? That’s very simple; that’s very elementary: just as though you were four feet over, looking at your body sitting in the chair. That is the position the pc is running from. And you find some pcs are totally in this, all up and down this lifetime. They never can have any picture in which they are (quote) in their own valence (unquote). See, they’re always out of valence all the way up and down the line. This case, by the way, also falls too low on the Reality Scale to run engrams. But this happens to any pc: They flip out of valence. Well, what happened? Well, there’s another earlier piece of this same engram is missing. And the pc gets a couple of pic-tures collapsed on one another, or pictures collapsing, well, you’ve opened the valve on 19 without finding 19. Actually, all this sounds very complicated, but actually isn’t complicated. You’re deal-ing with charge, and if you regard charge as water or cream, or something like that, it behaves in exactly the same way: It flows, and it always flows later. Charge doesn’t run back down the track, it runs up the track. Water falls; charge rises. About the only difference. All right, now, let’s look at this. We’ve got a pc. ‘e ‘its his ‘ead. It gives him a ‘ead-ache. So we run the engram – now let’s take an elementary thing, see? We’re bugged, see, on the subject that if you get your hands on something, you must flatten it, see; if you get your hands on an engram you must rub it out, see; all mixed up with \"flatten the process,\" don’t you see? They won’t recognize that this... Well now, let’s look what happens here. So he ‘it his ‘ead, so we find out we’d better run this engram in which he ‘it his ‘ead. So we roll up our sleeves and we start in. Eighteen hours later we’re still getting him walking into the cupboard and raising up too suddenly and banging his head on the door. And for some reason or other the pc is getting very unhappy and the cupboard is getting more and more solid in the picture and then it gets gummier and gummier, and then it’s collapsing and so on – the pc is pretty nattery – but you say, \"No, look, I’ve got to run this incident,\" and the pc finally goes into apathy, gets too far downscale to have a headache and you’ve \"cured his headache.\" [laughter]"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 6 11.6.63 HSDC    126    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, get that approach – get that approach. Now compare it to this approach: Pc ‘as ‘it ‘is ‘ead, and ‘e ‘as a ‘eadache. You say, \"All right. Good. Good.\" We block this incident out. He walked into the pantry and hit his head on the cupboard. All right. Fine. We start him into the pantry; we bring him through the moment he hit his head, and for some reason or an-other he just skips that whole section. His head comes nowhere near the cupboard, but we get him afterwards holding his head. Now, what’s this all about? Well, this means you’ve hit a chain of engrams called \"‘it on the ‘ead.\" And why is that area where he can’t hit his head – why is that missing? Well, the prior charge on being hit in the head is too great, that’s all. That’s simple. So you don’t try to force him through and you don’t need any interesting tricks to push him through it. You find that was 20, see? Just find 19 and block 19 out, and we find out that he was working in the carpentry shop and raised up too suddenly one day and ‘it his ‘ead. There’s no somatic there either, see? I mean, it’s just all sort of, you know, thud. And then we find – we just get that, bang, and we get that – run him through it. This is all done very formally, it isn’t asking any questions like Straightwire, see? We zip him through it; we’re moving the time track – dress-parade situation, see? We get him there to 18. We find at 19 that there’s an 18 and there – 18 there’s a 17. That’s the first time he ever hit his head, see, was 17. And then we find 16 and then we find – see? And we’re lucky and we actually do find all the way down the chain – we find it’s in this lifetime. That’s why we were lucky, because we just started out to cure a headache. And, by golly, we find him falling out of his perambulator with a dull thud, see? And it runs with full somatics, full perceptions. And we run it through and we run it through and we run it through and we run it through and we run it through. And it’s all getting thinner and thinner, and it’s less and less, and it’s disappearing, disappearing. Nothing is toughening up, and with a clank, that’s the end of that chain of being hit on the head. Well, what happens? The engram disappears, we bring him back up to present time, all these other head-hits – you could touch on each one of those, too, if you wanted to. He’d get the clonk from each one of them. You hit him on the head all the way to present time. Every one of them would hit, see? And that’s the end of this chain, and that’s the end of his head-ache. See that? Now, if we tried to approach it: \"We are going to run the engram of him hitting his head,\" we have made an error by saying the engram. We have to say the engrams of him hit-ting his head. Now, a great deal can be said, snarlingly and meanly and viciously and so forth, about what terrible things auditors have done with running engrams, but the truth of the mat-ter is I take full responsibility on the matter. I’ve pretty well desensitized that goal in the He-latrobus Implants, \"To be responsible.\" But I actually hadn’t made an adequate communication. You’ll find all about basics, you’ll find all about this type of mechanics in other material on engrams, but you won’t find this differentiation: Repetitive processes? Ah, yes. Flatten them always. An engram? The only way to flatten an engram is to flatten the chain of engrams. So the communication factor is, is you don’t run an engram, you run an engrams. See, you’ve got to run a chain every time."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 7 11.6.63 HSDC    127    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, if you’ve done any Sec Checking and had any difficulty sec checking at all, it’s because you weren’t running on the basis of the earlier overt. Now, overts will follow this, and it’s very good training finding overts; very good training. But the second that we lay a training restriction on it of \"run only overts in this lifetime,\" we, of course, have inhibited the possibility of picking up the complete overt chain. Well, \"this lifetime,\" of course, is the biggest lie of all. A person’s life is quite con-secutive. And the first time you may find actually a basic on the fact of him hitting a mule over the head as his overt on the fifth dynamic, and you find the basic on this thing at two hundred and eighty-five trillion. Well, you will get, then, all aversion to mules tearing up. The overt chain, don’t you see? Now, that’s not an engramic chain, that’s just a chain of overt acts. But there are overt engrams. So there’s two types of chains: there’s the motivator series and the overt series. And oddly enough, it doesn’t matter which you run, because the overt-motivator sequence is itself an installed sequence. Oh, yes, that’s a big swindle. But everybody is obedient to this particular swindle, and they behave that way below a certain particular level, so it’s operable. So you can use it in processing; you can relieve things. And actually it is so operatable, that if you don’t get the overts off they don’t progress. In other words, it’s sort of the overts they have committed ob-scure the overt-motivator sequence as an installed mechanism. You won’t run into this overt-motivator sequence or undo it for – oh, my God – that’s way back, and way deep, see? That’s quite fundamental in livingness. There are other things like obsessive creation, and that sort of thing, they’re equally... well, the overt-motivator se-quence isn’t as deeply laid in as obsessive create and that sort of thing. You think you’ve got it time after time, and there’s still an earlier impulse to create, you see. And they’re all en-gramic of one kind or another. They contain pain and unconsciousness and implantations and so forth. But an overt chain is handled exactly the same way as a motivator chain. We couldn’t care which we’re running, except on a motivator [overt] chain you have to keep calling for an overt of this type, you see? And on a motivator chain you have to keep calling for whatever follows its line – identifies it. Now, these two seldom entwine when you’re running engrams because they’re so fun-damental they’re hardly governed by any laws but those of livingness. They are very funda-mental. They’re the cause, effect, communication formula, the ARC triangle and matter, en-ergy, space, time and significances and perceptions (which of course is part of the communi-cation formula). And that’s about all there is to engrams. Actually they’re the most elemen-tary, uncomplicated lineup that could be; they’re the most fundamental. The most fundamen-tal laws of livingness are expressed on this channel and they undo along these lines. So you don’t have to pay too much attention to finding the overt engram to match the motivator en-gram, and all that sort of thing. Oddly enough, however, you can switch over from a motivator line to an overt line. You can switch from an overt line to a motivator line – doesn’t matter which. But I personally would never bother to run the two at once unless the pc came up with it.

Fire away. But you’re now going down an overt chain, don’t you see? You’ll get the same type of hit on the head. But unfortunately, you’ve also got to clean up the motivator chain of the same thing. Now, what point am I making here? That engram running handles the most elementary laws of livingness and thinkingness, follows the most elementary rules itself and is terribly, fantastically uncomplicated. It is so uncomplicated that you’re going to overshoot it every time. You’ll never add anything to engram running but complication. Isn’t that an interesting observation? It’s awful simple.

But you can even take a dub-in case and run them early enough to get before the dub. But that’s asking for it, so you’ve got your ARC processes. And lower than that you’ve got your MEST universe processes; you’ve got these various things that can straighten up a pc and put him into a situation. Because let me tell you this, engram running is important for this reason: You aren’t going to make an OT without it. See, it’s that important. And we now have the underpinnings that we can move any case into a situation where it can run engrams. Now, all this fancy stuff developed trying to run dub-ins of dubs on engrams; cases that were too heavily charged to run engrams. What’s the common denominator of that pro-gram case scale that runs from no time track down to total unawareness? What’s the common denominator of that thing? The common denominator of that thing is \"no duplicate.\" It’s right in the middle of the old communication formula. Years ago I used to run into a case occasionally, you’d run him on an – you’d run him on process Z on Monday and it wouldn’t bite on Tuesday, but another process would bite on Tuesday and on Wednesday another process would bite and on Thursday another process would bite. What was going on with this character? Well, I finally understood what was going on with him: The duplication was missing from the communication formula. He would not duplicate. It was dangerous to duplicate. And that actually is the swan song of this universe: That which you’re unwilling to duplicate tends to go on automatic. You could clean up somebody’s auditing in a rather rudimentary fashion. Of course, this is like all high-level processes, it’s not applicable because it’s insufficiently fundamental to reach the reality of the pc in many cases. But sometime when you’ve given or had a rough session, something like that, or your pc has given or had a rough session somewhere else or something like this, just take a crack at cleaning up the auditing on this basis: \"Since (you know, day before that session occurred) what were – have you been unwilling to duplicate?\" \"What have you been willing to duplicate?\" \"What have you been unwilling to duplicate?\" \"What have you been willing to duplicate?\" And just run the process flat, and you’ll all of a sudden find all the ARC breaks and everything else torn out."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 11 11.6.63 HSDC    131    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE We can show you a bad demonstration of auditing, a very bad demonstration of audit-ing on the TV screen, you’re unwilling to duplicate that, and you fumble the first five minutes of your next session. You get the... see? That’s showing the bad example. Get the idea? \"Unwilling to duplicate\" is the only thing it says, see? All right. You get the idea that you can’t duplicate MEST, you can’t duplicate en-grams, you can’t duplicate this action, you won’t duplicate that continuous state of being a tree, let us say, or something like that. This becomes very obsessive, begins to wear on you and you just start refusing the idea of duplicating a tree and the next thing you know, there you are, obsessively duplicating a tree because that resistance to duplication can be caved in. Now, a person’s ability to duplicate is what determines their ability to run engrams because the engram itself is a duplication of the actual event. And where they didn’t duplicate the actual event – where they duplicated the actual event but then the picture they’re running is an altered copy of the picture of the actual event, that is dub-in. So, they’ll run through the engram, and it’s this way, and they run through it that way. All engrams develop materials. All engrams develop surprising changes. And all engrams have a little bit of dub-in in one place or another. You get in the middle of this thing, you wonder, \"What’s the surgeon got in his hands? He can’t possibly have a water gun, you know? Looks like a water gun, you know? What on earth is it?\" It finally turns into a spoon or something else he’s taking your guts out with. Anyhow... [laughter] In other words, things look a little bit different. And particularly dangerous things – people don’t want to duplicate dangerous things. Very easy on this planet to give somebody a bad name, you know, the public in general. All they got to do is start riding a saw and say so-and-so is no good, so-and-so is no good, so-and-so is no good, so-and-so is no good. Don’t you see? And everybody – nobody must duplicate this person, you see, nobody must dupli-cate him. They all do it obsessively after a while. It’s a sure mechanism of making bogeymen and then making everybody into bogeymen that didn’t exist in the first place. You see, you can think up a lot of things and there’s a lot of philosophy connected with this duplication, but just add it up to what engram running is all about. A series of tests need to be developed for this sort of thing, of whether somebody can run engrams or not. The easiest way to find out whether somebody can run engrams or not is to try to run an engram on them. Now – and if they can’t run one, why, you’d better uncork the ARC triangle, that’s all. But there’s another way to do it. You say to some person, \"One, two, three, nine, seven. What did I say?\" And he says \"You said uh – p – popcorn? Uh...\" Aw, skip it, man. Of course, it’s a possibility that you didn’t speak loud enough for him to hear you, but if you spoke loud enough and you said, \"One, two, three, seven, nine,\" and he said, \"Popcorn? Pop-corn? What’s popcorn got to do with it?\" Well, you’d better not try to run engrams on that person. Now, the person who is totally unaware has tried to whip the mechanism of obses-sively duplicating everything. That’s his final answer, don’t you see? Only trouble is his du-plications then go on total automatic. And you’ll find people around who have very, very heavy engrams indeed; they are all very heavy and they have no control over them of any"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 12 11.6.63 HSDC    132    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE kind whatsoever and so forth. And the engrams also are very inaccurate. All life is an engram. Anything is an engram, so forth. But then the engram isn’t the engram. They stub their toe and they go down the street and they’ve got a picture of being run into by a truck – in full 3-D, utterly overwhelming. Gruesome. Now, you try to run an engram of stubbing their toe, it isn’t there. They run this en-gram of being hit by a truck. Well, that’s great, because if you run the engram of being hit by a truck, you unfortunately aren’t doing the case a bit of good. You’re just running off a copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy, you see? I mean, you could get into that kind of nonsense. Now, because there are such incredible things on the track anyway – such as the Hela-trobus Implants, and all sorts of things – that people get huuuh! Tell some bud of the Freudian school about these things, he’d become very puzzled about this whole thing. As a matter of fact, in the second series there are some tumbler devices – tubes, in the second series – where the thetan on the pole is locked up in a sort of a curled-up position in the middle of a tube, with a lot of lights hitting him from one quarter or another. It’s the perfect fetal position. And that’s basic on the prenatals which we used to find. And those prenatals all fly to pieces if you hit this basic on the thing, you see? But there’s so much incredible material that it would be very, very dangerous to determine on a pc whether or not he could run engrams by what was the fact of the case, see? This is very dangerous. We’ve tried this and it doesn’t work. So, therefore, you need a better test and that test would be simple duplication. You’d give him a series of questions of one kind or another. The old attitude [aptitude] test – our old driving test – is a doll because that gives you too little to understand and too much to understand, and so forth. That’s a lovely test. A person who got a very bad score on that probably couldn’t run engrams, you see, because it’s a duplication test. That’s how you’d find – not by the material the person runs, but by the person’s ability to duplicate. Now, another test of a person’s ability to duplicate is on Monday, did they get beauti-ful rocket reads on a GPM, and on Tuesday, you couldn’t get the needle to squick. That’s an interesting condition. Well, they’ve hit something they’re unwilling to duplicate, that’s for sure; and you could probably turn it back on, that’s for sure; and you can probably handle it, that’s for sure. But you also are running somebody over their heads, that’s for sure! Well, what are we running over their heads? We’re just running the ARC on this case. This case is too queasy to approach a whole lump of experience. They want to sniff around the edges of life, you know? You let them around the edges of life; don’t let them around one concrete experience of being hit on the head with a cleaver, see. Let them sniff around the edges and find out if they’re alive, you know? Let them run this thing way off, and their track will straighten out and become factual. That doesn’t mean that you’re only using the ARC processes1 to improve somebody’s reality. That isn’t their only use. It just happens to be a very good shotgun process. It works at every quarter on almost anything, don’t you see? It cleans up all kinds of things. It’ll clean up   1 Editor's note: refers to the processes given in HCOB 27 May 1963, \"Cause of ARC Breaks\", in the section \"ARC Break Processes\""},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 13 11.6.63 HSDC    133    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE auditing and it’ll clean up track and it’ll do this and it’ll do that. And it can be phrased in dif-ferent ways in order to meet different levels of case and you could do all kinds of things with this process – this new ARC setup that you have. You can also do some interesting things with this duplication process. But you do the best in this physical environment. What part of this physical environment, what action or mo-tion in this physical environment can the guy safely duplicate? When he finds out he can safely duplicate something, you’ve got the CCHs in a nutshell. That’s the only thing you’re trying to show him. That’s why the CCHs have such a heavy power, when rightly used and such a weird effect when wrongly used. You make somebody feel like he’s being punished for duplication, you run the CCHs wrong way to. All right. So much for all that. So much for all that. We’re talking about running en-grams. Well, who can run engrams? Well, it’s somebody who can get a picture of the actual event. Now, how serious is this to you? Well, it’s only serious to this degree: That if the case is not being successful in running engrams, you probably shouldn’t be running them. Now, that I think is the most elementary adjudication that you can possibly make. But let’s add to this adjudication, this one: Running them right; as long as you’re running them right. If the case just doesn’t seem to grapple with this at all and you just don’t seem to do anything about it, or something of that sort, well, you’re probably running the case too steep. That’s the most elementary adjudication that can be made on the subject. Now, engram running becomes very, very, very important to you because the Helatro-bus Implants are actually a long chain of engrams which themselves have, each one, basics. And they tend to grab the whole track together at one point. You will only be able to run on some cases as few as six GPMs before you have to start running engrams, because the RR will shut off. The things are getting too solid; thing is getting too solid. In other words, charge is bleeding. So let’s get what determines – what determines when to go earlier? First, it’s the audi-tor’s observation that they ought to go earlier – that’s always first. But the second one – and this must never be violated – is the pc’s recognition that there is something earlier that tells you the curtain has lifted. And this you never ignore, and I do mean never. Pc can state this in a thousand different ways and it all adds up to the same thing: There’s something earlier. Pc says, \"You know, I think there’s another pole trap incident ahead of this.\" Now, that’s very blunt, isn’t it? All right, let’s just find the other pole trap in-cident ahead of this, see? Simple. PC says, \"I don’t think this could be the last one on the chain. It’s too late.\" Well, go earlier. Pc says, \"Where did I get the idea that I couldn’t hold onto things?\" Go earlier. You’re trying to get through these – you’re trying to get from 20 to 19, and what is the last signal? What is the last signal – the signal that you just must not go beyond in running number 20 or number 19 or number 18 in its turn? The signal that you must not ignore is the inference that there’s something earlier. Because if you ignore this and continue to scrub away on the one you are on, you are ignoring the fact that something went down there and opened that little valve and that charge is coming up here from now on."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 14 11.6.63 HSDC    134    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE And that charge is going to make the engram that you are trying so arduously to rub out more and more solid, more and more arduous, less and less runnable. You’ve got to get back here and find number 19. Now, the second you find number 19, the charge that was leaking up goes ffttt! That’s charge off, don’t you see? But the later an engram is on the track, the less charge you can bleed out of it itself. Now, charge of course is a registry of the E-Meter. What is the registry on the E-Meter? Well, it’s the motion of your tone arm, the motion of your needle. You’re getting tone arm motion running these engrams – if you’re not getting any tone arm motion running these engrams, just hope you can get back early enough to get some tone arm motion. If you never get any tone arm motion on it, all the way back, brother, you’re taking no charge off the line at all; you are just restimulating mass and charge. You’re just restimulating; you’re not blowing anything. That condition, I don’t think, however, will obtain very usually with you. You will – you will get little blows of one kind or another. Those portions of the time track which have had the individual so much at effect that the person could not at all be cause, and attended by pain and unconsciousness, are called engrams. And the only way an engram is ever torn up is by relieving the thing which holds it in place. And the thing that holds it in place is always number 1. There’s 20 engrams in a chain, if you can’t find number 1 – and you can find number 1 if you go down the chain – but if you don’t even try to find number 1, and then don’t erase number 1, then that chain will not blow up. But you’ll see some of the funniest concatenations of charge release you ever wanted to see when you finally put your paws on number 1 and scrub it out real good. Number 1 erases. The rest do not. Now, because of the complex nature of the time track, there will be some portion of number 1, addressed to something else or some other subject, which may in itself not erase. Now you’ve got a new chain of engrams running back from number 1. Well, go ahead, run it back. Don’t get the idea of an absolute basic. There’s only one absolute basic on the time track and that is called basic-basic, and it’s going to take you a long time to find that one. That’s... basic-basic is unburdened with steam shovels and gangs of coolies and working for Lord knows how long. The ants that were emptying that granary – that’s a very good exam-ple. Fortunately, if you go ahead at it in a very businesslike fashion, you will eventually find basic-basic. The character of basic-basic is something I needn’t go into at the present mo-ment, but it contains these impulses which eventually became aberration. Now, I want to call to your attention just rapidly here, some data. There are two things you can do with dating. You can relieve charge or just identify something. Now, if you get a total dating, it goes on down to the second. It’s how many, you know, trillions, hundreds of billions, hundreds of millions, hundreds of thousands, thousands, hundreds, days, minutes, seconds ago. And if you get that accurately, and in no argument with your pc, you’re going to have a pc there who uhwuhh! He gets somatics and the thing rights itself on the time track, and that’s all very interesting. That’s that type of dating; it’s to relieve charge. You put some-thing accurately on the time track and you’ll get charge off."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 15 11.6.63 HSDC    135    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Well, that’s fine, and as an activity is quite an interesting activity in itself, but remem-ber that dating also contains identification. You want to know about the incident that was eighty-nine trillion, four hundred and fifty million years ago. So you say plus or minus. And you’ve got one that was almost – almost, see – eighty-nine trillion four hundred and fifty mil-lion – you’ve got one that was slightly more than eighty-nine million and four hundred and fifty billion, or something like that, see. And you just identify it. And sometimes your identification is as clumsy as \"that – that ninety-trillion-year incident.\" Of course you’re only hung when there’s eight in a row. So then you have to get into ninety trillion, and you have to date these into the hundred millions or something like that (sometimes you have to date them into the hundred thousands), but that’s differentiation. Mostly, mostly, you will be satisfied with your trillions. See, you say, \"Well, that incident that was not quite eighty-nine trillion years ago.\" That’s dating. That’s sufficient. That identified it, don’t you see? Fine, nothing wrong with that. Now, let me give you this operation of blocking it out. This is known as blocking out an incident and it has just exactly these steps. It’s a very precise action. You identify it by date. That’s – you get the approximate date of the thing. See, that’s an identification by date. You move the time track to that date (but of course your dating has already moved it there). You ask the pc what’s there and the pc says, \"Nothing. I can’t see nothing.\" Pc says, \"Green cats.\" Pc says, \"Solid black automobiles are stacked around. Their license plates are number 869, 942, 747, 815. And there’s a DC plate over on the other side,\" and so forth. \"And that’s there; that’s what’s there.\" And you say, in every case, regardless of what the pc said – and hear me now, hear me – in every case you say, \"Good.\" You understand? You don’t say any-thing else. It’s very interesting. The pc can say, \"But it’s all black and I can’t see a thing!\" and so forth. And you say, \"Well, there’s no reason to go on with that.\" He’s there; he’s there. So it’s all black? So he doesn’t know what it’s all about? Well, hell, he didn’t know what it was all about a few minutes ago either. Funny part of it is, time you run him through a couple of times – I’ve even seen a pc blow grief charge through something they didn’t know what it was all about, cry all the way through the whole thing, and come back to the beginning and begin to find what it was all about. Do all some – sorts of weird things happening like this, don’t you see? So it doesn’t matter what they say. This has no tendency on that; that does not influ-ence the auditor’s action at that point. Next thing you do: Find its duration. You know? \"Is this incident minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years?\" Find its duration. Block its dura-tion out fairly accurately, you know? If the answer is days, well, just get the number of days, don’t you see? Don’t go down to hours, minutes, seconds and split instants and galactic mi-croseconds, you know? I mean, this is – this wastes time. Find its duration, move the pc through it. Through. Get the difference of to and through. To get a pc at a point of the track you say, \"Move to,\" and to get them to go through something, you say \"through.\" If you want them to go through something, say through. Don’t say, \"Go to the end of the incident,\" because, of course, the pc just goes bang! and he’s at the end of the incident. \"Yeah, all right. I’m here at the end of the incident. What do you want?\" I"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 16 11.6.63 HSDC    136    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE can see auditors now – I’ve already seen an auditor do this idiotic thing – said, \"Well, go to the beginning of the incident.\" (snap) \"All right. Well, I’m here. What do you want?\" \"All right. Now move to the end of the incident.\" (snap) Bang! \"I’m here. What do you want?\" [laughter] That’s pure idiocy, see? You want the pc to pick up the incident, you had better move them through it. And let me assure you, that if it’s forty days long, I normally say, \"Move rapidly through the incident.\" [laughter, laughs] I like to be able to end my sessions on sched-ule. But you move them through to the end, then establish what was there. Just ask the pc, \"Well, what happened?\" you know, when they come to the end of the thing. Anytime the pc says anything while they’re going through the thing, you say, \"Good,\" and one more word: \"Continue.\" You want them to realize that auditing effect... command is still in effect. When they get to the end of the thing – you’ve moved it through it once – you say, \"What’s it all about?\" Funny thing – the pc doesn’t talk to you; it’s all right. Okay. Move them to the beginning of it; move them through to the end again. Simple as that. Never move them backwards through one. When they get to the end of the thing, why ask them again. I’ve seen a pc go through one several times before they could tell me anything about it. Thing wasn’t beefing up at all. Just, you know, \"What’s this?\" It’s a solid mystery. Don’t be impatient, in other words. You don’t vary this routine. Pc says, \"I don’t think I left.\" I’m afraid I’d be more prone to say, \"You left all right. Run through it.\" See? Now, if the pc keeps saying, \"I’m stuck,\" and all that sort of thing, just forget the bouncers and denyers, man. You’re just running somebody over his head, and you get them out of it any way you can and revert to ARC processes. Any time the pc is that much at effect, where the auditor has got to kick him around inside the incident and do all sorts of weird things and that sort of thing, you’re simply running engrams on somebody who can’t run en-grams. There’s no sense in my developing a technology for somebody who can’t run engrams, for you not to run engrams with. You get the difference? All right. Now, when he’s told you all about it at the end, your next step is simply to find out if anything is a little bit earlier. You know? \"Is there a little...\" because the end al-ways remains the end. You don’t have to vary the end. If there’s anything more they’ll even-tually tell you; but you don’t care about it because the charge is always earlier, you see? But always suspect the beginning. Pc says, \"Well, I just got off the train and there they were, you know?\" Aw, it’s all right. Buy it. Sounds all right, and so forth. But ask before you send them through again, \"Now is there any earlier beginning on this incident?\" and so forth. Yeah, he was shooting at them out the window for a half an hour, you see, before he got off the train, you see? There’s always that little, little tag beginning. And sometimes you’re lucky and there is none, but it just doesn’t matter; it’s whether it registers or not. Send them back to that earlier bit and tell them to move through it again."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 17 11.6.63 HSDC    137    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, up to the moment you tell them to move through it again, you’ve simply blocked the incident out. Now you know how long this incident is. The second time you tell them to move through it is, however, quite perfectly safe and can be included in blocking out an inci-dent, but I just want you to know that it doesn’t perfectly belong in blocking out an incident. You’ve actually blocked the incident out now. But to finish this incident off, just move them through it again. They’ll pick up some more stuff. That’s the time they’re going to tell you there’s something earlier. And it doesn’t much matter how many times you run them through an incident. Less than twice is suspect. That’s maybe a little careless. But might very well – if the thing appeared to be awful gummy, and so forth, and messed up – once would be plenty. There’s where judgment comes in. More than twice? Well, you’re getting into questionable ground – very questionable ground. Trying to chug them into it and make them have more view of it or more picture or get more event out of it or do something else with it than they can do at that particular time? Nah! Verboten. It’ll turn up in an earlier incident or you got no business running engrams. That’s all there is to that. Now, how long would you run one of these things? I think if a pc was terribly fasci-nated with the thing: \"You know? You know, that’s where I got shot, and that’s where I shot Bill. Yes. That’s right! And then this place id... hmmmm – hmmm – hmmm – hmmm. And I’ve often wondered whether or not, you know, hmm – hmm, this funny hole in my ear...\" [laughter] All right, that’s dandy. That’s dandy. I’m afraid I’d just go along with this as long as I was getting motion on my meter – getting some motion on my meter, had the thing going tick and tock and click and clock and bong, and he was still running through the thing and wasn’t wandering off into the fields – I’m afraid I’d run that. But I would never run it longer than, \"You know, I think we’ve had a fight before.\" All right. Hit the silk. Now, if you do not bail out of an incident and find the earlier incident when the pc sights the earlier incident, you spoil the pc’s ability to move back – you blunt it – and the pc will get tied up in this area of the track you’re trying to run. And the only reason a pc gets tied up in an area of track is by insisting he stay there; you insist he stay there. He says, \"Oh, God, I want out of this.\" Well, anybody who wants out of this, you’ve just – you’ve just gone near it and he sees that there’s a whole bunch of threshing machines and they’re cleaning up the wounded with these threshing machines, see? And he says, \"Well, I – I can’t have anything to do with that. That – that’s – that’s too much for me,\" and so forth. I’d say, \"Okay.\" I let him bounce to present time and I run ARC processes. In other words, I don’t say, \"Oh, come now. I’m sure that you could confront that part of the threshing machines,\" so forth. But if a pc started telling me, \"Eh, it’s getting awful solid around here. Pressure is get-ting heavier! A little harder to run!\" – I don’t care if I was getting tone arm action or not – I’m afraid my action would always be \"When did you spot something earlier?\" \"Oh, well! Come to that, it was about an hour ago.\""},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 18 11.6.63 HSDC    138    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Yeah, he spotted an earlier incident. And I would realize that it was my fault, as the auditor, if the pc got tied up on the track that he couldn’t get out of or was unable to run the chain, and so forth, because I would have refused to let him move earlier. That’s the one car-dinal rule of this. Now, there are several things I’ve tried to teach you here today. And one of these: You’re running an engram chain; you’re never trying to run a single engram. The only reason you run basic, is not to get rid of basic. Sometimes basic is \"I walked up and blew all of the powder out of the barrel.\" But nothing happened, see? \"Yes, I walked up – well, of course they lost the battle is the reason for it – and I blew all the powder out of the barrel.\" That’s basic, see? That’s just bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzzz-bzz-bzz-bz-bz, it’s gone. It’s all the basic there was. You look for basic to be the more powerful incident; it’s never. It’s the shorter inci-dent, it’s the simpler incident, but on that keystone – because the thetan never bothered to say that was important, you see – these other things built up, built up, tougher, tougher, bigger, bigger, bigger. You get that basic, the rest of them will tear right up. Just like one of these patent sacks, you know – a patent flour sack – you get the right – you get the right string? Well, here she goes. All right. Now, you’re running a chain. So don’t think because you’ve read Book One or snapped your fingers over engrams you know how to run engrams. Learn this as a brand-new skill. And it’s a skill which we’ll call engram chain running. And that is done by finding an incident, we don’t care how. One of your best takeoff points – the Helatrobus Implants; run a few GPMs, then you’re really making knots, you see? We don’t care how we took off on this, whether we had to prepare the case for this or not, we got our paws on an engram. And then we block it out. And we get the earlier one and we block it out, and we get the earlier one and we block it out, we get the earlier one, we block it out. And eventually we’ve got nothing over here to block out. We then decide that we have our paws on a basic for this chain. Now, as we now have a basic for this chain, this basic will erase. Okay? So we pro-ceed to erase the basic and tear up the chain. Theoretically, if you kept wandering back, some of you could make an error of winding up eventually with basic-basic. Seemed like you never got your hands on a basic. Well, you eventually did get your hands on a basic, but this appar-ently is the first engram on the track or something like this. I would erase it and suspect that I had simply discovered a basic. You see, when you discover basic-basic and erase it, all engrams and pictures disap-pear on the pc, so that is the clue to that. Now, the next point is: Never under any circumstances prevent a pc from finding the earlier incident – never do it; that’s courting disaster – even if you suspect the pc is telling you there is something earlier in order not to confront what he is going through. Because if he’s trying to bail out of incidents because he’s scared of them, I would watch this perform-ance just once or twice and then I would decide that I was misguided to be running engrams on this case; and I’d prepare the case a little bit more and get him back into running engrams later, you understand?"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"SHSBC-300 ENGRAM CHAIN RUNNING 19 11.6.63 HSDC    139    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, those are the cardinal points of running engrams and if you follow those things, you actually will be able to develop one fantastic amount of case gain because you’ll be blow-ing charge all the way. It’s the easiest running you ever did and the only mistake you’re going to make with it is to depart from the little blocking-out routine which I have given you here; depart from the earlier routine, you fail to realize you’re running a chain – you’re not running a single incident – and preventing the pc from going earlier when the pc spots something ear-lier, or this mistake: just complicating it up, man. You know? The pc says, \"I’ve got a picture here of a green house.\" \"Does it have gables?\" Blow your brains out, boy! You’ve done it; you’ve done it. You’ve finished it. You’ve wrecked the work. That’s it. You’ve had it. You just opened your mouth once too often. Do you realize what happens? You’ve pointed the pc’s attention to a large object, and the rule of the largest object goes into effect instantly at that point. And the pc will interiorize into that incident. Well, you didn’t want him interiorized into it. What do you mean you didn’t want him interiorized into it? You didn’t want that incident all swelled up, fully charged, 3-D. How can you make an incident fully charged and 3-D? By making the pc look at it and look at it and look at it, and examine it and examine it; and then prevent the pc from going earlier and look at it and look at it and look at it, and look at the largest objects in it, and feel things in it, and so on. You’re going to have a universe built around this pc to a point where you’ll never get him out of it. Got it? Well, that isn’t what you’re trying to do. If you were trying to discover the secret formulas of the Ka-bob civilization, and you got the pc into their formula security room, by all means follow this process! But make sure you don’t do it with an OT, because he hasn’t got any pictures to swell up. You actually could only do it safely with a Clear. And a Clear is so close to an OT if you’ve got him to a totality of Clear, you see – that’s dead easy – that if you just made an OT out of him, he’d remember. You understand? So it becomes a very difficult thing to stay simple enough about. I wanted you to get this data because actually there’s never been a recapitulation of running engrams mostly because I never really had my fingers on why people had a hard time running engrams. And I find out there’s a miscommunication concerning it, and I’ve given you that miscommunication, which is just the fact that people said, \"Well, if you have to flat-ten the process you have to flatten every engram you laid your hands on.\" And I think that’s where the whole thing broke down. Very easy to run them. I wish you lots of success with it. Thank you. Audience: Thank you. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" HSDC    141    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE THE TIME TRACK A lecture given on 16 May 1963 Thank you. All right, this is what? Audience: 16th May. Huh? Audience: 16 May. Sixteen May? Sixteen May AD 13. Thank you. I got to get some backflow, you know? Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, lecture on the subject of – as it develops. [laughs, laugh-ter] Ah, I’ve been scouting around and trying to keep a quarter of an inch ahead of you, and that’s difficult. But you pretty well got this taped. It’s very funny, you know, sometimes we develop a big piece of technology or something of the sort, and all the record of the devel-opment is there and there’s no summation. I very often never make a summation at the time it becomes passé, see? It’s superseded in the course of development by a new development, don’t you see? And therefore, concentration and economy of research time – if we had the – both the time and the resources of, oh, I don’t know, the Stamp Salvage Collection Depart-ment of the Bureau of Infernal Ravening of the US government – if we just had that appro-priation, you see, we might be able to do it a little more broadly. But it’s always up to me to make a summation. And it was with great astonishment that I found out that we had never made a summa-tion of engram running! Of all of the key things to leave a summation missing on! There were tremendous things learned about engram running and – over a long period of time – and it was never summated. And I was quite interested last night – before session, I was trying to get a start on a bulletin which summated engram running – and I was quite interested how easily it was summated. There’s no wonder you’re a bit confused about engram running, be-cause it changed over a period of many years. There were many types of engram running, there were many things done at one time in engram running which were found unnecessary in other times. Various mechanics and improvements came and went. And out of all of this, ac-tually, a very simple method of engram running exists. There’s not many laws of engram running. I’m not going to give this lecture on the subject of how simple it is to run an engram, because the summation of it is a very precise activity. I’m going down the line and giving the various terms and laws and so forth. And one of the things I discovered on the thing, that I think you’ll find very interesting, is we have never changed a basic tenet of auditing."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 2 16.5.63 HSDC    142    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE That is, you’ve never successfully audited anything but the time track. There is noth-ing to audit but the time track. And there is no grand key to the release of things but the time track, and it is a time track. Probably people think of engrams as something stowed in the pc’s wits like cordwood, you know? They’re just stowed there, and then there’s over in this department, you see, in this file cabinet, there’s a big bunch of stuff over there. There’s some round cylinders of some kind or another and those are valences. Then down in the basement someplace else, why, we have something else stowed there – machinery. And then locks. Locks: that belongs to an entirely separate division; has nothing to do with anything. And secondaries: well, they’re sort of stowed out in the woodshed. You know, and that they’re pieces and bits of things and that they’re not related and so forth. Actually, they’re simply different phenomena of the time track. And in trying to sum-mate the thing, I made that little discovery. And it seems to be terribly elementary but it might serve to orient you pretty well on what you are doing. It is a time track. It is the continuous record of time of the individual since the first moment he began to experience, straight on through till now; an uninterrupted 3D, fifty-two perception movie. And things happen to that movie, and it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc. Becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons: his inability to confront and the fact that the track itself can get grouped. Like you took a can of motion-picture film and it’s all stretched out there, and so you just start taking it and crumpling it up in your hand in big wads, and so forth. And various things can happen to this consecutive record of experience. Various things happen to it. And all that au-diting ever does is straighten it out and make it available and as-is it. Now I think that gives you a simplification of outlook. I was quite surprised. I was sitting there and suddenly it dawned on me I could make a very simple statement of exactly what we were auditing, what all these things were. As you go along on this track, you get a moment of pain and unconsciousness. All right, that’s just another record. It’s consecutive with the next moment which is perhaps not of pain and un-consciousness. Chains, they don’t exist in separate slots and compartments, they’re just sections of the film which happen to be interrelated. A guy is hit over the head with a hammer, therefore every incident of hitting people over the head with a hammer and being hit over the head with a hammer and being hit over – what – well, just being hit over the head with a hammer makes a chain that is a related series of experiences. And they interrelate in the association of the individual and actually tend to pull this time track down on top of one another. So you’ve got a whole group – a grouper there, so the track actually gets looped at this point. And then you’ve got the basic time the individual was hit over the head with a hammer, you’ve got the basic time the individual was – hit somebody over the head with a hammer, and then you’ve got all the times that he saw a hammer, see? Or thought somebody was going to get hit with a hammer, or something like that. Those constitute the locks, and they pack down on top of this thing, see? You eventually get a solid wad there that looks like a piece of black God-’elp-us, and there it is, and the pc of course does not have that experience available. So when the experi-ence becomes unavailable to him, it has a command value over him. He does not know what"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 3 16.5.63 HSDC    143    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE it is, and when he comes near it, it has a tendency to operate as a command level. A hammer is telling him what to do, in other words. And there’s only two classes of things involved in this time track – only two classes of things – and one is – you might call the mechanical things, which is matter, energy, space and time, see, and their interrelationships and so forth, see? There’s the matter, energy, space and time which is this track, you see? And then there’s the significance. So the time track is basi-cally composed of matter, energy, space, time and thought, and that’s all the time track is composed of. Now, people who can’t confront any part of their track – and one of the reason the psychologist can’t even deal with this thing at all – I’m not berating the psychologist. We’d train him if we could. We’ll have to, one of these days. He has a bad record with us. We don’t just have a bad record with him; he has a very bad record with us. He can’t learn and he goes off into wild departures and so forth. We’ve had quite sincere psychologists studying at the Academies. I mean, it’s not just a brush-off. And one of those blokes that I know of over in the States, I don’t know, I think he was there for about six months and he hadn’t finished the Comm Course. That’s right. First week, he was terribly interested, terribly interested. He went away and I’m sure it did him some good. We couldn’t make a Scientologist out of him, and we just sort of dusted it off and for-got about it – too hard to do. Too many good people around that you could make Scientolo-gists out of, you know, you could train how to audit. There was no real point in breaking our necks with this. Well, this actually doesn’t establish any rancor on my part at all. If a bunch of psy-chologists and so forth wanted to be set up for the training course, I would put them through a training course. But I would just make sure that it was commensurate with our experience with psychologists, which is to say, ten-year course, something like this. [laughter] I wouldn’t miss! I wouldn’t miss. They’d be happy, we’d be happy and everything would be happy. I’d just as soon process a psychiatrist, process a psychologist; it’s all the same. But remember that this bird did not make discoveries of the time track or this particular area, the very woof and warp of which the mind is made, simply because he conceives it all to consist of only thought. See, his confront is down to a point where he thinks the brain contains thought. Now, this is kind of silly. It’s like walking down the street and saying there’s nothing on this street but opinions. Street is all full of opinions, and if you just get all these opinions on this street, you’re all set. Whereas it is no opinion that is pushing the pc’s face in. It’s somebody’s fist. Well, maybe the fist might have been pushed, you see, on the time track be-cause of somebody’s opinion, but the fact of the matter is it’s not an opinion that’s pushing his face in, it’s a fist. The time track, therefore – I’m just making this point here very strongly because you’ll come up against it – is not imaginary. It should not be treated as an imaginary thing. Is a deck of cards imaginary? No. What is real? Well, what is real has mass and weight and so forth, and so does a time track. You’re into vague philosophic mutterings when you"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 4 16.5.63 HSDC    144    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE start saying, \"What is reality?\" What is reality? Oh, my! Boy, you could put on your long white robe and walk all over Greece from one end to the other making a good living almost in any century by just continuing to ask this question in a somewhat deliberative frame of mind, you know? \"What is reality?\" You know? If you put enough, if you put enough schmaltz in it, you know – [laughter] would have had it. Well, we have a pretty good idea of what reality is, but it does not really form too much of our technology – descriptions of reality. And we take the shortcut to it and we say reality is what is – you know, what is. Then we shortcut the idea of, well, is it because we’re thinking it is or is it because we’re not thinking it is? You know, just bypass all that garbage pail full of reasons not to look at reality. Just recognize that it’s a not-confront. However it got here, it is! See, it just is. And it’s sort of a – do more philosophers out of a living, this sort of a – of a direct approach. I mean, you can’t make a living saying, you know, \"Reality is.\" Well, you say, \"Yes, yes, but who made it?\" Well, that’s not germane. See, the point we’re interested in, immediately, is where we are and what we are looking at. You see, that’s the main point. Now, the secondary point is where did it come from, and a tertiary point is what’s go-ing to happen to it? But these are all not main points. The main point is we’re here and we’re looking at it, see? And what we are here before and looking at, Scientologically – just to cut the Gordian knot – is. See, it just is. There isn’t any discussion, then, of whether the pc is imagining that he is looking at a brick wall or is he looking at a brick wall? Well, it is. You see? Now, what is it the product of? Well, in the physical universe a brick wall is the product of a bricklayer, a brick maker, the economics of the society – let’s take it back step by step – a clay bank, which is part of the planet, which was made and put here. And then we get to a divergence of opinion: Was it put here religiously or by the Galactic Construction Company, you see? But that’s actually all the importance it has. It is here. Well, what put it here? Well, we have another peculiarity as we go along. We – there are some peculiar things which make a Scientologist a Scientologist. And you all fall into this category. You probably don’t think of these things very much, but you know that what is, is and – as far as you’re concerned – and where it came from is a slightly different question, and that you don’t neces-sarily have to go into these fantastic ramifications, you see? And we also sort of amongst our-selves have agreed that nothing is holy. By which I mean, nothing is proof against being in-quired into. That’s a very healthy state of mind, man! Because that does not Q-and-A with the unavailability of sections of the time track, don’t you see? And when people have said, \"Well, there are certain things you mustn’t inquire into,\" they’re just doing a Q and A on the unavailability of existence or is-ness. See, they’ve just done a Q and A with it. Now, recognizing all those things, we see then that the time track has remained undis-covered, undescribed, forms absolutely no part whatsoever of modern mental studies, forms no part of the materials of psychiatry, and so forth. Now, we must ask why. And it’s because the thing has tricks of unavailability and the beings who are working in this field do not have a confront sufficient to look past that un-availability. So you have to be just a little bit tougher to be a Scientologist, and that’s the way"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 5 16.5.63 HSDC    145    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE it is. These guys weren’t quite tough enough. They took something – the time track – consist-ing of matter, energy, space and time, and thought, and said it was all thought. And this of course leaves everything inexplicable. See? People think they are living in a house. Well, the bird who is saying this: \"These people think they live in a house. Therefore, they are utterly mad because there is no house.\" And then people have gone around and made him feel the walls, you know, and said, \"Look, there is a house here, you know?\" \"Oh, no, no, there’s no house.\" Do you recognize that’s the lockout as far as this research line has gone. Now, what’s the reason for that? Well, the time track has a great many tricks by which it becomes unavail-able. And the first of these tricks is that \"there is nothing in a mind but thought.\" And recog-nize that, as that is a trick of debarment. If there’s nothing in the mind but thought, anybody who says he’s looking at a brick building (in the mind) of course isn’t looking at a brick building; it must therefore be imaginary; so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion; so therefore he must be slightly mad. Now, this line of thought is very productive for appropriations, because I think sixteen billion dollars has just been appropriated in the United States with which to erect some ex-perimental stations – by which they mean, by the way, research and development sections. That means they’re going to train some attendants there; that’s what they mean by this, that’s all. I’ve read the bills, actually. That’s not just a crack; that’s what they mean by it. It’s all on this basis: \"Well, insane people must be mad because they say they are see-ing things.\" Well of course, this compounds the insanity. Because then the person who is sup-posed to be treating the insanity says, \"No, you are not seeing these things.\" So he makes the track less available. So the direction of sanity lies in the capability – the capability – of confronting the time track and the present time environment. And for any individual, for any one individual, existence consists of the physical universe present time – the physical universe present time and everything that is in it at this exact, precise, present time instant – and the time track, which consists of everything that has been. And that is the total is-ness as far as this thing called reality is concerned, see? Now, you can speculate on what the time track has been, by reason of the state it’s in now, but that actually is not an is-ness, you see? What condition is it in? Furthermore, you go around England, you’ll see mounds of dirt – furrows on a hillside. You’ll see mounds of mossy, overgrown whatnot. You look a little bit closer and you’ll see that it’s some old forti-fication. Be a Roman camp or a medieval castle that has long since gone to dust and the so-cialists, you see? And there it is. Well, it’s a lot of fun, you see? It’s a lot of fun to add some significance to this thing, you know, and say, \"What has it been?\" See? But that is not its is-ness. Now, it’s perfectly all right to stand as lo... as a matter of fact it’s a wonderful game to stand and look at this pile of"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 6 16.5.63 HSDC    146    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE stone and say, \"What has it been?\" I know I’ve done some of the most learned, marvelous – absolutely astonished myself by the brilliance with which I could reconstruct out of a single mound of stone the tremendous civilization which went before, you see? And the power of the fellows who erected it, and so forth. I remember one particular time I was so overwhelmed by my own brilliance and learnedness in this particular direction that I hardly heard the farmer at all when he said, \"Well, yes, that’s the silo we built last year. It fell down.\" [laughter, laughs] Now, that is a suppositional reality, see. Tremendously subject to error, but not out-lawed for that reason. But recognize its is-ness, which is just suppositional is-ness. It’s the is-ness of suppositional is-ness. Now, every once in a while on the track you’ve met some fellow in a conical hat who was saying, \"Abracadabra, hocus-pocus, if you just gaze into the pot here, I will tell you the future!\" Oh, that’s great. That’s great. Quite a game in itself. It’s probably a lot of complexi-ties. But it’s suppositional; all futures are suppositional. The odd part of it is that if they – if they’re suppositional enough, they come true. I remember with some shame telling a fortune at a party to some people – I used to tell lots of fortunes. It’s very funny, you know. You look at somebody’s facsimiles. This is very funny, you know? And you pull a wise face, you know, and you can take a look at the fac-similes and saying, \"I see you living in a house which is very close to a railroad track, you see, and there are some tall trees there – some very tall, slender trees – and it’s right there at the corner of the roads. And let me see now, let me see, now, don – don – don’t – don’t inter-rupt me. It’s Acacia Manor. Yes. I see you living at this house.\" \"Well, that’s fantastic! We just went out to look at such a house, today. In fact, we’re going to buy it.\" Of course, the character wasn’t going to buy it till you said he was going to live in it, you know? [laughter, laughs] And as a party trick, one time, I told a couple I saw them both being unfaithful and separating – you know, just dealing the cards out – and they both obedi-ently did. And I felt very ashamed of myself. [laughter, laughs] The future is always enforceable from altitude and authority, and so forth. You get somebody like Toynbee. He can predict the future, he says, you know? He’s got some for-mula that nobody knows but Toynbee, and he can predict some sort of a future out into the future, and he can tell by that that this, that and the other thing is going to happen. Of course, he’s actually found a trick method of making a postulate stick, you see? He’s making a postu-late stick by saying, \"That is the way it is going to be because I can read the future.\" See, that’s just a trick method of making a postulate stick. But it doesn’t escape the fact that it’s a suppositional reality. So if you break existence down into is-ness and potential is-ness, you can probably break down this potential into several categories and you could probably make quite an inter-esting German graph out of this thing, you know? You could extrapolate it out, cover the whole wall before you got through. And you could break this down into numbers, types, cate-gories, subclasses, and then subclasses of subclasses, and then subclasses of subclasses of subclasses of subclasses. Pretty soon nobody would know what you’re talking about. So I prefer to leave it at that, you see? There’s is-ness and there’s suppositional is-ness."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 7 16.5.63 HSDC    147    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, the time track often gives people the feeling that the \"was\" can return. And they think if they run back just a few hours, years, millennia down the track, they will once more find themselves standing up at the battle of Bennington and getting their head shot off or something of the sort, you see? And this makes them very nervous about going back. Well, I one time saw a line of redcoats and a line of militia standing up, exchanging shells, and for about, oh, I don’t know, it must have been the space of a minute or so, they were total 3D in a much greater reality than the physical universe had had to me recently, you see? I mean man, that was solid! That was solid, you know? And I expected these guys... And for a moment, I thought I had returned back down the time track, on the physical uni-verse time track, and found it all there yesterday, don’t you see? I didn’t realize I was going down my own time track. And good heavens, man! You could smell the mildew in the wigs, you know? And it was – it was all marvelous. And you know, I was all ready to duck from the next volley. Probably it’s there so solidly because I didn’t duck from the next volley. But next thing you know, just looking at it, the is-ness of it turned out to be what it was, which was simply the is-ness of my own time track. And at that moment, it fitted itself into perspective. It was an exaggeratedly solid piece of my own time track. More solid and more real because of the awareness jammed into the moment of time, don’t you see, than oth-erwise. Now, you could mock yourself up futures and so forth. You can do all sorts of things, but again, what you’re mocking up is suppositional. Now, there’s one more class that you have to take something of a look at; it’s \"what is created.\" And it’s this whole business of creating that really tends to rock people, because you see it’s half real and half suppositional. And it’s the borderline between the two. Now, it almost depends on the person who says he is going to create something. Well, somebody says he’s going to build a building, you know this fellow does build buildings and so forth, well, then you – it’s very close to reality, his statement that he is going to build a building. See, it’s quite close to reality, because you know he wis... build the building. In fact, you can already see the cornerstone, you know, that sort of thing. That’s a good reality. And some guy down in the loony bin, why, he says he’s going to plant ten thousand acres of forest, you see? Well, that’s hardly even a suppositional reality. You know darn well he’s never even going to look at a tree, much less plant a forest. So you know that thing is never going to exist. And it won’t ever exist. And so this matter of suppositional reality and creation come together. But remember that a creation is just a suppositional reality until the moment it is created. At the moment it is created, for whatever period it may endure, it is. See? So it is an is-ness; anything created is an is-ness for whatever period it endures. Now, all of this is quite pristine pure, from whether it is good for people, bad for peo-ple, nice to do, not nice to do, or anything else. These again are adjudications of what is. And that’s the opinion of what is, but that’s part of the thought of reality. Now, thought is not separate from reality. Thought is woven solidly into reality and thought is part of the is-ness of reality. For instance, BBC – ITV down here – finally begin-"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 8 16.5.63 HSDC    148    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ning dimly to learn their lessons on programing. And they’ve conducted, I think it was, a ten-million-dollar-pound test. They went to vast expense to find out who viewed television and what programs they liked. They went into great expense: They built a small studio, they bought a television set (I imagine even paid for it) and hired some children and bought some candy and comic books and got some furniture and put it in there, and then drilled some spy-holes in the wall and turned on canned programs, you see, so the children could watch the programs or talk to each other or eat the candy or read the comic books. And they very care-fully noted – I think there’s – oh, probably two or three thousand pounds of the appropriation must have been just paper to carry the notes of the reactions of the children at various points of the programs, and so forth. And they finally learned – the final lesson was (and this is why they’re going to continue it: they’ve learned something) – they learned that little children do not like to look at older children’s programs and that older children do not like to look at little children’s programs. [laughter] And so it was pretty brilliant. And that’s why they take your favorite program off every Saturday night, you see, and throw it away. [laughter] See, they’ve got a long way to go. They’ve got a long way to go. Police pull this trick all the time. Every once in a while – around Washington one time, we were doing Union Station – this walk-about process – and were going down to the airport, and so forth, and run it on airplanes and all that sort of thing. We were doing this for quite a while. We found out at the end of about a week that the \"Federal Boys Institute\" and the Narcotics Division and Interstate Commerce, and so forth, detectives had been hanging back in the wings and behind sofas and chairs and back of pillars – squadrons of these fel-lows, you know, had just been haunting every Scientologist and his preclear, and so forth. And at the end of the week, why, they finally grabbed one and they had already determined that they were not a new airline that was smuggling dope. I don’t know how they determined that. I guess they saw they didn’t have any airplanes in their pockets or something. It never occurred to them to ask anybody. This is the point I’m making, you see? It never occurred to them to establish an is-ness on a situation or to ask anybody, because they couldn’t, for some reason or other, view the thought in the is-ness. See? So they’re way up around the bend; they can’t even view the thought in the is-ness. So don’t think that it just goes to a point where people can only view the thought in the is-ness; you can get further than that, where people can’t even view the thought in the is-ness, you see, and can’t even ask for what thought there is in the is-ness. Now, there are certain opinions abroad in the world today with which we may or may not agree, but they happen to be part of the is-ness of this world. Now, whether they could be changed, that again is not part of the is-ness. They are. These thoughts are. Now, the ironmonger who weaves this sign with the curlicues, and so forth, has had a thought when he wove that set of curlicues on this sign, you see? He had a thought when he did it. And you get back and you take a look at this and you’re actually looking at iron set in space, you’re see it – perceiving it by energy reflected, don’t you see, and there is a time that you’re looking at it in, you see, and you look at it for a certain period of time – and all of this is-ness goes together. But most people overlook the fact, the curlicues are – the curlicues are in actual fact an expression of thought which is part of the physical universe. So there’s a great deal of thought woven into the physical universe that is part of its is-ness. Doesn’t have"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 9 16.5.63 HSDC    149    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE to be written up, \"go here,\" \"go there,\" \"this is a bear,\" but certainly either the bear making himself a bear, or somebody else making a bear, is expressing the thought of a bear. See, he’s using matter, energy, space and time to express the thought of. So that thought is expressed by the formation of matter, energy, space and time, and if we look this over, we’ll see that the thought is an integral part of nearly all physical universe put-together. To some degree – to some degree – thought is a part of the physical universe and is part of its is-ness. So we say the physical universe, then, consists of matter, energy, space, time and thought. And the time track consists of matter, energy, space, time and thought. And just as your broadest classifications, you have now made the simplest statement that can be made concerning a time track or the physical universe. That is the simplest statement that can be made. Now, we can complicate it; we can complicate it tremendously. We can get the suppo-sitional is-nesses, we can get the befores and afters, you see, we can get the purposes, you see, the additive utilities, and of all things, the aesthetics. Now, we really go mad when we get into aesthetics, you see? But the devil whispered, \"Is it art?\" you see? And that devil is always standing alongside the shoulder of every artist or anybody engaged in an artistic pursuit. You see, the little girl doing her sampler, see, and so on, saying, \"I think that looks nice. That really looks nice. And I’m going to make it so-and-so, and it’s going to look nice.\" And she gets to look at it, \"Yeah, but is it artistic?\" you know? \"Is it art?\" You see the concert pianist beating his fingertips off at the concert, and you very often are utterly astonished afterwards to find out that he does not consider that this is art. He could do much better or he has done much better or he will do much better. But is he doing better right now? Well, you seldom find that he is ever doing better right now. He’s always on some suppositional kick. Well, the degree that an individual is on a suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingness – his ability to confront. The amount of suppositional is-ness that is added to actual is-ness measures directly the individual’s ability to confront. Now, that’s a very involved and complicated statement, because it’s almost too broad to embrace. This fellow goes down and he takes a look at this watercolor – down at the art gallery – he takes a look at this watercolor and he says, \"He should have...\" Well, that \"should have\" has measured the amount of not-confront he is doing at the – of the watercolor. See? It’s quite interesting. Therefore, you get into this in the area of critical and you speak of people as being high-criticals. \"This fellow has a high critical,\" you say, you know? A very critical pc. Com-mon term amongst auditors: critical pc. Well, it’s the degree that he is into suppositional and not into is-ness that is critical. He’s not confronting to the degree that he is critical. Now, from being a very esoteric statement, that becomes a very, very interesting au-diting tool if you look at it just in its bare-boned fashion. A pc goes, \"Yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow-yow!\" Wow. It’s obvious whether he’s doing it misemotion-ally – \"Now, I suppose,\" he will say, you see, \"but if it... Oh, I – ho-ho, hmmm..."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 10 16.5.63 HSDC    150    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You say, \"What’s happening?\" \"Well, it sort of looks here that it might have been...\" (that’s quite acceptable – all these things are quite acceptable and quite ordinary in auditing) \"...but, it sort of looks here – I – there’s – I don’t know. There’s some kind of a wreck out here. I think there has been a wreck.\" It’s quite ordinary to have him then find out that it’s not even an airplane in front of him but a building. See, he has said – he’s given you the suppositional, see? He hasn’t given you the is-ness of it. Well now, the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of is-ness confronted by the pc. And that’s how sane and capable somebody gets. It’s measured directly by that: the amount of is-ness the individual is capable of confronting. And he’s having as hard a time as he is moving from is-ness to suppositional. Now, in view of the fact that his track is in terrible condition, you have two things at work – you have the pc’s own feelings of incompetence and you get the unrecognizableness of the track. And these two things come into combination to make a cat’s breakfast. See, the pc is sure that if he confronts it, something horrible is going to happen. He’s sure of this. You know, so he \"h-o-ul-eaahh\" you know, he \"auheaeah-w-w. I don’t know whether I want to be processed or not.\" You see it in the extremity of, the pc doesn’t want to report for his session. See, that’s merely an expression of, he’s moved over into suppositional, to that great degree. See, he supposes that it’s not confrontable. He supposes that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it. He supposes the auditor won’t be able to handle it. He supposes this, he supposes that, you see? Well, all the time he’s supposing, he’s not confronting. Now, the pc’s come downscale and sort of given up on the idea of being able to con-front very much anyhow over a long, long period of time. You can more or less measure this and call it state of morale because it’s quite volatile. It will shift with great rapidity. A thetan’s state, you see, is actually not pinned mechanically by anything. It’s just where he is and what he is doing, don’t you see? It’s not really pinned mechanically by any-thing. You see, he’s not made less of a thetan or more of a thetan. But when you surround him as intimately as the time track with a tremendous amount of threat, suppositional unconfron-tabilities, he is continuously enforced into a state of low morale. He doesn’t think he can do anything. As a matter of fact, he can’t! It’s part of the is-ness of the situation. See, he knows what’ll happen. He’s surrounded by jack-in-the-boxes to a point where he’s touched this one time and it’s knocked him flat and he’s touched that and it’s ruined something and he’s touched something else and it’s blown him down. And his attention is still terribly fixed on something else and he knows he mustn’t take his attention off of that. And then he knows also that if he doesn’t take his attention off of it, he’s going to go to pieces, you see? And then he’s forgotten that he has his attention on it. He’s in a frightful state. But you get his feeling of degradation – because of his capa-bility, you see, what he feels it is – but then you’ve got the actual state of the bank, which is 'orrible! It looks like a bunch of mad theater managers have rushed in and grabbed all of the motion pictures that have ever been shown, you see, and mixed them up with a stick and set fire to them, see? And a thetan standing in the middle of this debris – you see, it hasn’t even got a bright flame left in it, you know? And there he is in the middle of this debris and he"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 11 16.5.63 HSDC    151    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE knows that if he moves or sparks or does anything, something horrible will occur. And every bit of this has retained in full its command value over him. Just the fact he’s standing in the middle of it, is enough to depress him. But at the same time, it’s all the old tin cans he’s got. It has value. It’s all his knowingness, it’s his re-cord files. He’s like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed. He can’t even find out his own name, rank and serial number, don’t you see, without the record department. Well, that dependency and the reason that came about is also included in the record department, so he can’t even find that, you see? It’s all there and he’s gone into a terrible state with regard to all this. It’s booby-trapped. It jumps apart. If he puts a beam on it, he sticks. And he sort of feels funny because there’s a hand that vaguely shows out from under-neath a black plate and he doesn’t know whose hand it was; he doesn’t know where it’s from; he doesn’t know when it happened... [sighs] But he knows he’d better keep an eye on it. [laughter] And we’ve used other methods to approach this problem of the time track. Amongst those other methods were exteriorization. \"Try not to be three feet back of your head.\" I don’t know how many taxi drivers went out of their heads and their cabs climbed the curb in New York when they pulled that gag over the air, you know? That was pulled over the air and was done quite successfully. \"Try not to be three feet back of your head\" – over the radio. And it’s all very well and the odd part of it is, the thetan is free. You’ll have some fan-tastic experiences, but you can get a synthetic state – a temporary, momentary state of a thetan which approximates his actual state if he didn’t have a bank – by exteriorization. I’ve exteriorized people – they’ve lost their stammer, their lumbosis, everything else. The only person I had trouble with when I exteriorized him, it didn’t cure his cough. And then we found out he was coughing. Didn’t have any chest to cough with, but there he was out there, fifty, sixty feet from the body, coughing. But that state doesn’t last – doesn’t last, because the individual is in a state of low mo-rale at the time you do it. And even though you get him away from the bank, you’ve just taken somebody away from the central control office and made him leave all of his files be-hind and he sort of thinks that those files can be straightened out and he definitely knows that he must have them in order to know anything and he goes along just so far and then he’ll jump or get scared or something will happen, he’ll snap back into his head. You can do this to an individual two or three times and then he won’t come out any-more. He’s very suspicious about it. Everybody, however, can be made to exteriorize. But you’ve exteriorized them out of the bank to a marked degree, but of course the bank follows them. You can exteriorize some-body out of a body and then exteriorize him out of his bank. See, just tell him to be three feet back of the mass that he’s associated with. \"Be three feet back of your head. All right, you’ve got a black mass there? Oh, all right, that’s fine. Be three feet back of the black mass.\" The individual gets a foretaste of what it is like not to be pushed in on all sides by these black masses and things, see? But it’s a momentary foretaste, because he’ll take his at-"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 12 16.5.63 HSDC    152    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE tention off what he thinks he should hold his attention on, he’ll collapse back into the bank, the bank collapses back into the body and now, he says he doesn’t want that experience again. Actually what it does is restimulate dying. This is more or less what he does at death. But he takes the bank with him at death. Now, the only possessions a thetan has consist of this bank. He really doesn’t own anything else at a moment of death on this planet due to the laws of inheritance and other mechanisms. Various times on the track a thetan has tried very hard to straighten this up – when you died, you didn’t lose everything, see? And it has been more often true on the track that you didn’t lose everything than it has been that you did. But – so a thetan is actually con-ditioned into this and he considers it a considerable deprivation. So he very – makes very sure he keeps that bank very close to him, because it’s the only possession he knows he can hold onto. Yet it’s in terrible state and he doesn’t want it in that kind of state. It’s really no use to him, but he hopes it will be of use to him, and he couldn’t get away from it anyhow. Well, the approach of exteriorization is frankly a failure. You can do remarkable things exteriorizing people, but it is a failure. You better know something about exterioriza-tion; it’ll always help out an old buddy who’s just been knocked down by a freight train or something of the sort, and there he lays gasping his last. Well, tell him to be three feet back of his head, you know, and go on his way. Various exteriorizations: Some guy is in perfectly good shape and he’s just accidently fallen off the bridge and drowned. And they’re working on him with Pulmotors and he doesn’t start breathing again. If you happen to be around and he hasn’t been dead very long – he doesn’t smell yet – just say to him \"Hey!\" [whistles] \"There’s nothing wrong with the body, pick it up!\" All of a sudden the chest... [pants] [laughter] It’s quite remarkable. It’s part of the mechanics of existence. But as far as a solid processing mechanism, it doesn’t exist as practical processing. It’s more of, this is a piece of the is-ness of existence. Thetans do this kind of thing; you can do this kind of things with thetans. And once upon a time, every time you lost a body on Erxes, you went and picked up a new one on – at home base, you know? You’re always going back and picking up your body – picking up a new body. You didn’t necessarily lose your identity. You’d be surprised the research... the searching security regulations which sometimes would be stressed home on somebody picking up a new body. You didn’t want enemy troops in there picking up one of your own uniform bodies. And the security: \"What’s your name? Oh? You know Joe? What’s the name of the bar at Yakbung crossroads? What’s the name of the bar? What’s the name of the bartender?\" You say you come from there, \"What’s the name of the bartender? What’s his favorite joke?\" \"Ah! Have this man shot!\" [laughter, laughs] In fact it’s quite unusual – and one of the reasons why you rebel against it and people are very anxious and willing to be processed – it is very, very unusual for a person to totally forget his identity just by reason of death, and you haven’t been doing it very long. You don’t lose your whole identity and everything you’ve ever been just because you kicked the bucket. So the way it’s going now, thought is passing out of everything, and the identity passes out and the thetan not only loses his physical universe possessions by reason of death but he also"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 13 16.5.63 HSDC    153    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE loses his identity by reason of death. And he doesn’t like this. He thinks this is a can’t-have-no-have proposition. He is not in favor of this at all. And therefore, he tends to pull even more tightly on the time track. You see, you’ve denied him a new record, so he’s grabbed this record, see? Well, every time somebody wanted to get even with him on the whole track, some-body booby-trapped the record; somebody threw a bomb into the file room. That was the way it was done. You go down here to the loony bin and you can find people around there and they’re screaming about being jumped by demons and there’s a great bird that comes every night and perches on the bottom of the bed and pecks at him. Psychiatrist strokes his beard: \"This man’s insane.\" \"Why is he insane?\" \"He sees a bird.\" That’s the end of it. If he sees, he’s insane. Now what kind of a record... approach is this? This is just a further denial of record, isn’t it? That’s the way you really make them spin. \"Oh, you got a bird that comes and sees you every night? Ah-ha. Good.\" Scientologist would have an entirely different approach. He’d probably tell his buddy, \"Christ, what dub-in, you know?\" [laughter] So he says to the guy, \"Yeah, yeah? What kind of a bird is it?\" And he finds out more about this bird. He’s liable to find a honey of a series of incidents of some kind or another. But the trouble is, if you approach them from that bird, you’re liable to go straight into one of the doggonedest, awfullest messes of raarr that any-body had anything to do with. You’ve pulled him right into the middle of it. He’ll eventually collide with this bird in processing. It’s not necessarily the start of his processing, however. And you certainly don’t invalidate the bird. That’s the last thing you better do, because what-ever it is, it is. He saw it, so it is. Now, we don’t care whether other people agree that it is, or they don’t agree that it is. That’s all whether or not we agree to reality, which is another method of making a quick buck walking up and down the land with a conical hat. That’s philosophic balderdash. I mean, the more – the more you can keep off of these wild byroads, you see? \"Well, is reality really something that everybody agrees to? It isn’t, because there are people around who don’t necessarily agree to the reality. So therefore, it couldn’t be that it really isn’t real.\" Well, that’s just a method of making it unreal for somebody else, isn’t it? Reality is a miracle that it is mutual in the physical universe. That’s the miracle. It’s fantastic that it is a mutual reality. And that is the biggest proof of its is-ness: its mutual real-ity. Now, the funny part of it is, banks have a mutuality. They are not necessarily all dif-ferent. Because the tricks that have been used to wreck the file room have not been very many. And those that were really capable of messing up the film and bending all the reels up and bashing the cans in had to be pretty heroic. It really took some doing. It really took some doing. And the technology which you have, I don’t care whether you’re listing for items, run-"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 14 16.5.63 HSDC    154    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ning valences, doing an assist – I don’t care what you’re doing – you’re handling the time track, or a piece or a portion of the time track. And you have never escaped this fact. Because it is the only tried and true approach to sanity and to recovered ability, is straighten out the guy’s time track. We have approached it in many ways; we have tried to find out who is mocking up this time track. Well, obviously the thetan is mocking it up. But that’s again a suppositional reality. We can use mock-up processing; we can take over the automaticity of the creation of this track. The thing wrong with it is, is he can't find out about it, and it really gives him no opportunity to confront it. The confront factor is dropped to a marked degree by this create approach. You say, well, let’s take over the automaticity of his creation of the bank, all of a sud-den he hasn’t got a bank, therefore he’s Clear. Well, that’s a very good theory. There’s noth-ing wrong with it at all. All I can say is that after many years of hard tries, why, we have never been able to make it satisfactorily and uniformly work. As far as I’m concerned, it’s a locked road – barriered. The trick that barriers it is that when you get the individual to create, he very often strikes the button – and oddly enough, there is a goal \"to create\" in this GPM we’re handling – and he’ll hit buttons like that, and all of a sudden he goes into – the bank goes into obsessive create and it practically crushes the individual. Everything beefs up, gets hard, uh-rrr-aurghh! And it happens so often and so frequently that Creative Processing had limited usages. It was useful, but its usages are limited and it does not result in Clears who will stay Clear and we’re interested in that. So it all comes back to the fact that those processes which effectively handle, straighten out the time track, put something there to confront – that is to say untangle it enough so that it can be confronted – raise the morale... Remember, this is – this is an adjunct to this; it isn’t enough just to straighten up the track. You’ve got a pc there, too, you know, and if you lower his morale too much while straightening up his track, why, track doesn’t straighten up. You understand? Because you’re actually not raising the thetan’s confront at the same time. That’s for... our processing has got to be rather delicate. And the only thing we get into is just this: his suppositional is-ness is so great because his confront is so low in this particular zone or area. After all, look how low it must be. All the \"great savants\" of the field of the mind never even suspected this track, except Freud. And he said that the body contained some sort of a record or blueprint of its immediate past. Freud did say this: the body contained some such thing. I consider it very interesting. He never went ahead and explored it. And he went into the suppositional reality that it made everybody bar-barians and very vicious people to have this. What his conclusions are I’m not entitled to say, because I have not studied his conclusions because they again are a suppositional reality. I can only tell you that he did, however, remark that there was such a thing. And back about 1914, 15, there was some chap back there who remarked on the fact that there was such a thing as an engram – that a moment of unconsciousness was recorded all the way through. It’s a very small portion of a book, printed back then. I heard about it about 51, something like that."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 15 16.5.63 HSDC    155    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Guys trace on this and they get the hell out of there. They don’t want anything more to do with this, see? They trip over some corner of this thing, and then they say, well, da-da-da... It’s the two-dimensional worm trying to describe a three-dimension. And the third di-mension, it’s um-wah-mm. Everything’s flat! We know that! And yet here’s this pole. Occa-sionally they’ll say, \"Well, we... you run into something if you go across that particular side of the two-dimensional plate. You bump your head.\" And most of them say, \"Well, it’s im-possible to bump your head, because there are only two dimensions.\" And then they say, \"Well, then there’s nothing there.\" It doesn’t occur to most of them to say there might be three dimensions. In such a way, why, that is-ness gets blocked out and barred out. We should examine how it does, because it’s a very simple answer. How does the ex-istence of the time track get completely wiped away? Why do the great savants never remark on this particular piece of property which can be found in every and any human being, and the handling of which is the only road that we can discover, or that ever has been discovered, which straightens the person out? What is this? Why is it? It’s the same reason that you sometimes have trouble in an auditing session. These things are in two divisions. There are two things here. One is the suppositional reality of the pc sometimes presses him forward – of course, we’re... I’m now not talking about the reasons he can’t see the track; that’s pretty obvious, the unavailabilities and the tricks of it, and so on. No, I’m talking about the pc who is sitting in front of you – his suppositional reality is very low but very great. You see, it supposes; his \"I guesses\" about the track are terribly thin. And if you don’t develop those things along a very smooth line and very smoothly – you know, he supposes he has a black mass in front of his face, you see? He doesn’t see the black mass. Actually, all you’ve got to do – not make the track more solid for him, but just keep going around in the area and take what the pc says, you see, and keep working with it and this thing will start to unravel and the pc will come up and you’ll find less and less supposition. He says after a while, \"There is a black mass in front of my face.\" Don’t you see? Well, the principal barrier that you get if you’re inexperienced in this line is that you suppose, if the pc is so vague, that you can’t get anything. You take it that the pc doesn’t know what’s there, then you won't be able to find out what’s there. You don’t recognize that he is just so far down on suppositional is-ness that he is not approaching is-ness. Whatever the tricks of auditing are and how you audit engrams, it is the process of familiarization – gradient scale. You’ve got to raise the morale of the pc with regard to it and raise the avail-able thing to confront. And familiarization with it and running it, and so forth, tends to un-ravel the track and stretch it out and make it available to him and his morale comes up at the same time and you get to an is-ness. And you don’t recognize that it’s all a gradient – all a gradient from can’t to can. See, it’s just a gradient. Pc says, \"Oh, I don’t know anything about this. I never heard of such balderdash. Ron says there’s an incident here of some kind or an-other and I never heard of such a thing. It’s horrible for him to say such a thing.\" Very shortly afterwards, he starts to look. After all, he’s been given a little piece of data, something to look at and he looks – by golly it’s there, you know? And he says, \"Hey! You know? Ha-ha!\" You know, it makes him feel better. He can see it and it is there to be seen. He looks at it a little bit more, there’s more there to be seen now, you see? And then he"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 16 16.5.63 HSDC    156    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE feels better about seeing and there’s now more to be seen because you’ve gone over and de-veloped the track. You see, it’s at once a problem of getting a viewer and a stack of pictures together. You see, you’ve got to get the viewer so he can see the pictures. You see, that’s your Audi-tor’s Code and morale of a pc and all that sort of thing, and coaxing him along and giving him the right orders, you see – that’s for the pc. And then you go over the technology of arranging the pictures. And the way you arrange them is just stroke them. That’s all. Just stroke them enough times and stroke the right picture and you say, \"There, that’s a nice picture. Yeah, that’s a nice picture. Yeah, get that one all fixed.\" All of a sudden the pc says, \"My God, there’s my bird!\" You say, \"Yeah? What do you know!\" \"Yeah,\" he says, \"yeah, that’s familiar, that bird. There he is. Tsk, tsk. That’s pretty good. Let’s find out some more about this,\" see? Well, if you’ve done it smoothly, then the pc’s morale is up so he can look, and if you’ve handled the bank right, why, that’s been rubbed up so that it can be looked at. It’s this gradient approach – it’s barred out by the fact that it’s terribly simple; there really isn’t any-thing very involved about it. And that’s one of the things that makes me impatient in teaching people how to run engram, is they always want to know the command with which you run an engram. I don’t know! Give me a command for petting a cat, I mean... [laughs] All the rules of auditing have to be obeyed, and so forth, and it gets to look pretty complicated after a while, but it isn’t complicated. You’re running a Touch Assist on a picture. Of course, your pc can’t touch the picture and feels that you won’t let him touch the picture – he’s going to have an awful hard time touching it. And then if you don’t give him the right picture to touch, of course he can’t touch that. And one of the big boons you have in technology is, I’ve been finding out what pictures can be touched, which then produce a tre-mendous resurge and start untangling this track, by finding out what are the principal things – two things found out: What are the principal things that have the track snarled? And which of them can be touched? See, there’s two problems there. You see, what is snarled and what do you touch to unsnarl it? See, those are two distinctly different problems. The auditor tends to Q-and-A to some slight degree with the fact that an engram con-tains pain (and he doesn’t want to inflict pain on the pc, of course) and contains unconscious-ness (and of course, you can’t see anything when you’re unconscious). So all the great savants of all history have simply Qed-and-Aed with the pain of the engram and on the time track and unconsciousness. And they’ve simply remained unconscious of it – unwilling to approach its pain and of Qing-and-Aing with its unconsciousness. And that’s why they have never said, since time immemorial, every being has a time track. It’s just as – just as elementary a piece of nonsense as that. They say, \"Well, you can’t see it and you can’t do anything with it and there’s really only thought in the head anyway.\" And there’s lots of ways they approach this thing, but they’re actually just doing a Q and A. The thing is unavailable to the being, so the savant supposes it is unavailable to him, don’t you see? He doesn’t want to have anything to do with that pain, so he leaves it alone, and because there’s unconsciousness in it, he remains unconscious of it. And I’m afraid the problem is no more complicated than that."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 17 16.5.63 HSDC    157    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE But the auditor mustn’t fall for this, see? In the first place, I don’t think a thetan can go unconscious. I don’t think there is a level at which you could say absolute unconsciousness takes place. It’s quite interesting. You run somebody through an engram where he knew he was unconscious all the way through the engram and he doesn’t remember what happened in the incident. Well, that doesn’t mean he was unconscious in the incident. Just means he can’t remember what happened in the incident. He might have been conscious all the way through. And you start running this thing through as an engram and all of a sudden he finds out during those moments of unconsciousness he was conscious of things going on. The only real trag-edy of life, I suppose, is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unob-tainable. Well, the auditor must realize that there is no slightest portion of that time track that isn’t available. And he should go into no \"I-don’t-know-anything-about-it\" simply because the thetan he’s auditing, of course, doesn’t know anything about it. This is the expected state. He’d be a Clear if he knew all about it! Well, you – then you’re saying, \"Well, I can’t audit him because he doesn’t know anything about it.\" You’re saying, \"Well, when he gets to be Clear, I’ll give him a session.\" [laughs] It’s all by gradients. There’s a great deal of technical information about this. There’s reasons he can’t view the track and the reasons the track is unavailable to him are very mechanical. I don’t think you would be very excited about viewing a door that every time you walked up to the door it crashed open and broke your nose. I think after a while you would get out of the habit of walking up to this door. And after a while you would say, \"That door doesn’t even exist. I’m not even going to go in that part of the room.\" Because the violence that is contained on the time track cannot be, again, underestimated. Boy, it’s there! It’s there. It’s violent. And you can hit portions of the time track that’ll kick a pc right out of his head if you forced him into them. Bow! It’s a sledgehammer proposition. Let’s take a second-series-goal GPM2 and let’s force the pc into the top oppterm and then keep hammering and pounding the pc from the top oppterm down with the wrong pat-tern. Give you the shudders yet? What makes it gruesome? It isn’t that the auditor is pushing the pc; he’s not doing anything to the pc that’s very bad. What’s doing the pushing is the bank. It’s solid and tough at that point. Well, the magic of it is, is if you get the earliest moment of the earliest GPM, it runs like hot butter. It runs like nothing. Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow. Do you realize there’s just as much charge on it as there was the later one? See, as a bank, there’s just as much charge on that bank as there was on the later bank. I consider this quite interesting. You can’t run the later one, you can run the earlier one. Why? When you’re running the later one you’re trying to run that and all the banks that come before it. The pc can confront one bank, you’re asking him to confront twenty. You’re asking him to stomp right into the charge of twenty banks. He can’t do it, so he gets a big lose. So if he says, \"Look,\" he says, \"I can’t confront the bank. Look, the bank is too tough for me.\" Therefore, it’s important not to give him loses early on.   2 Editor's note: refers to the Helatrobus implant or \"Heaven implant\" which according to the findings LRH made a short time before this lecture was given in two series."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 18 16.5.63 HSDC    158    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE There’s various approaches of this kind. This is all technical know-how. This know-how is very simple know-how. It’s not very difficult know-how. You go into too much sup-positional and you have trouble. But I’ll tell you that an auditor has success in auditing if he has a good idea of the mechanics of engrams and the time track, if he kind of knows what this is all about. The next thing you know, why, he’s in there sailing. Somebody else keeps asking for a rote command. They say, \"Give me a rote command. Do you say, ‘The somatic strip will return [snaps fingers],’ or do you say, ‘[snaps fingers] The somatic strip will return,’ or do you say, [snaps fingers twice]? Just exactly how do you say this?\" I’ll show you a person that doesn’t know the mechanics of what he’s handling. Somebody gives a double command. This is the most serious thing in engram running, it confuses the living daylights out of the pc. It’s almost impossible not to give a false com-mand at one time or another because you’re right on there. And to give a wrong command, you find out about it before the pc has a chance to get snarled up with it, that’s the only sin, is not to catch it. For instance, the demonstration which you had, I told the pc to go to the point where the pc was, just one time? It confused him. Well, that’s not very serious. I immediately reme-died the thing and he got it all straightened out and there we went and see, we were on our way. What if I’d said to him, \"Go to the beginning of the incident when you go to the end of the incident because the beginning of the incident is the place where we don’t start,\" and then gotten provoked with him because he didn’t execute the auditing command? Well, I certainly wouldn’t have known very much about the bank to do something like that. But you wouldn’t make a mistake like this – this is a gross error: You say to the pc, \"Go to the beginning of the incident where the birds are.\" He doesn’t know the mechanics and behavior of an engram, see? Well, what’s wrong with the command? It seems like a perfectly innocent command. You see, this is a mistake almost anybody would make. Yeah, but the beginning of the incident was where the birds are. That was the beginning of the incident a half an hour ago. So the auditor thinks that while he handles an engram nothing happens. See, he thinks nothing ever changes. Well, why is he auditing the pc if he’s never going to get any change, see? Well, he thinks nothing is ever going to change. So he thinks the birds are going to be the beginning of this incident from here on out. Well, the birds are never the beginning of the incident, even the second time. So you say, \"Go to the beginning of the incident,\" and you suddenly make this com-mand, \"Go to the beginning of the incident where the birds are. Go to the birds. Go to the be-ginning of the incident.\" And you ask the pc, \"What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?\" \"What – what do you want me to do? Do you want me to go to the beginning of the incident or go to where the birds are?\" And the pc is all fogged up and he can’t give you the data very good and he just ne-glected to tell you that there is an incident the day before the birds arrived, when there was an edict that you mustn’t shoot any birds issued. And he’s just discovered this and may even have mentioned it, but you didn’t get its time. And you didn’t realize that was the day before. That is now the beginning of the incident."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 19 16.5.63 HSDC    159    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So you’ve told him to go twenty-four hours deep in the incident while going to the be-ginning of the incident, don’t you see? And he gets very, very confused. You got things like through and to. You wouldn’t think that through and to would make this much difference. You say, \"Move to the moment of the birds. All right, now move to the period three days later.\" And you say, \"All right, now what happened as you went through the engram?\" The pc says, \"What engram? Moved... What – what are you talking about?\" \"What happened as you went through the engram?\" \"I didn’t go through the engram.\" \"Well now, all right, you didn’t follow the auditing command. Ha-ha! [laughter] Guess I’ll clobber him,\" see? The bank follows the hop-skip-jump, you-think-you’re-there-and-you’re-there system of the thetan, see? You moved to the end. Well all right, you’re at the end, see? You’re at the beginning, you’re at the end; there’s nothing in between. So when you’re scouting, you al-ways use to and when you’re running an engram, you always use through. It’s little, simple points like this. Actually, to some degree, it is my fault for not having made these things as brilliantly and shiningly clear as I might have, some time or another. But as I say, the subject was never summated. I frankly didn’t ever think we’d need it again – just per se running an engram. Now, I found out that it makes it tremendously easier to run the bank and that on a very few pcs you will be unable to run the bank unless you get an early engramic incident out of the road. And I also found out that if you can run the overt engram that relates to these GPMs just as an engram, that a fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves, naturally, and therefore they run like – very much like hot butter. I had a little bulletin for you. Found a datum here you might be interested in. That par-ticular outfit was down toward the center of this particular galaxy and was founded at 52 tril-lion, 863 billion, 10 million, 654 thousand, 79 years, and I can’t give you a much closer than that, because when places get founded is – more or less becomes part of their lies. But it was founded a that time, and it was destroyed on the date 38 million – 38 trillion, 932 billion, 690 million, 862, 933 years ago, by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet. It was not the – part of the galaxy. It was a wildcat activity sitting there. They used to drag Magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy, let them follow the lines of force and just let them come over a system. Then when they got around to it, they’d send planes in with speakers, and so forth, and give the place the business. But the place very often was to-tally caved in for thousands of years by these Magellanic radioactive clouds which would just engulf the particular system. You got the idea? I just give you that in brief, just as a matter of interest, because I don’t think – I’ve now got good data on the dates – these dates we’re get-ting are accurate. I have now compared them up the track and squared them around. These are the dates."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 20 16.5.63 HSDC    160    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, you’re not likely to find any implant earlier than or even near 52 trillion and you’re certainly not going to find an implant closer to present time than 38.9 trillion. And if you find any other kind of an implant, you’re probably looking at a different kind of implant or somebody dramatizing it someplace else, so it’ll be a subgrade proposition. So that is the span and period of these particular things. I gave you this second date, 38 trillion, because actually that was quite a battle group that went in to clean up this particu-lar activity. You might have been part of it. Makes a very lovely overt engram that keyed you in like crazy. But that was not part of the galactic government. They were a bunch of guys that had the dream of everybody in the universe being good. And they are the people who used the Ice Cube. And you’ve all run into the Ice Cube. We often wondered who was the author of this sort of thing. Well, the Ice Cube was used by these people; I don’t say that they authored it. And therefore, you get all this beach scenery and so forth, for people on this planet that came up through the Ice Cube, see, as well as other methods. But I just thought I’d give you those dates because they are of some small interest, and that isn’t going on now. There is something going on now or you wouldn’t be here and you wouldn’t have governments on this planet the way you have them, as lousy as this. But that’s a horse of another hue and has nothing very much aberrative connected with it in comparison to the magnitude and so forth. This is the one that really keyed in the people’s time track. But there’s one thing that I’d like to point out to you. In finding the original incident on the thing, a basic on a chain is the basic on a chain. See, it’s not what I say it is or what you say it is or we hope it is, see? The basic on the chain, then, that you’re looking for very often may sail back into God-’elp-us. And I found a basic on this chain last night which was of great interest to me. It was simply an assassination attempt of a radioactive bomb thrown in a carriage. That’s the basic implant chain. See, you move the pc – the rule – you move the pc back before, back before, back before, to where he doesn’t have any somatics, heh-heh-heh-heh, to what didn’t have any part of these people at all, but that one got keyed in. That be-came basic on the chain. Got the idea? If you’re lucky, it’ll simply be the first time they saw these Magellanic clouds come in over the planet and somebody made an unsuccessful attempt to pick them up or something like this. Something of that sort. And you run that, you get the pc ahead of this and he’s got no somatics. All right, you run him into it and you find your first incident. Don’t be surprised if your first incident expands earlier, don’t you see? But if you run into it, you get your first incident out of the road, the rest of it runs relatively easily. But don’t be too amazed if the first incident is actually not on the same chain but has become terribly interlocked with the chain and you can’t do anything else until you do it. I believe somebody was running that last night. And he finally got to some kind of an incident that didn’t apparently have any relationship to this at all. Apparently had no – noth-ing to do with it. See? But it was some sort of a beam or blast in the face that left the fellow with a hanging somatic of some kind or another that then connected up into the implant chain and away we go, see?"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"SHSBC-293 THE TIME TRACK 21 16.5.63 HSDC    161    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Well, the good news I have for you is just that these guys aren’t around. But the point I’m really making is that your individual address to the problem of engram running, if it’s giving you any trouble at all – the blame is partially that I never made a summation of engram running, and the only difficulties you’re having is just lack of appreciation of exactly what it is you’re handling. It is not a matter of the rote command; it’s a matter of understanding ex-actly what is this thing called a time track, exactly what are you handling in the individual and exactly what keeps you from handling it and permits you to handle it. And you get that taped, why, all of this becomes very, very easy. Don’t blame yourself too hard. Along about 1958, 59 or something, I should have sat down and said, \"Well, let’s see, what’s everything we know about engram running?\" Well, I didn’t bother to do so, because I didn’t think we’d ever be running them again. It’s with great delight now that I find out we know far more about engram running than has ever been published, just by basis of summation, actually summatable in a very few pages. Okay?

Summer – summer’s gone now, you know? I find out when summer is gone by watching the banyan tree. It’s on the other side of the house there. And when its leaves start to turn brown, why, we know autumn is amongst us. So break out your boots and dogsleds. [laughs] This is what? Audience: Eighteen July. Eighteen July AD 13. Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, and another lecture on dat-ing. Now, I’ve already told you – I’ve already told you that dating is a very high-caliber activity, very important in auditing, and that the tone arm sticks only because of wrong dates. Got that? That’s really the real reason tone arms stick. Frankly, it’s the only reason tone arms stick. And you might have asked yourself, some time or another, \"If you do have this much track, why does everybody around believe so implicitly that they have lived only once?\" See, it might seem rather odd to you that the insistence on this fact that people have lived only once; the near-psychotic frenzy with which people go into, insisting they have lived only once. It must really take something to shut off somebody’s memory to that degree. It really must take something. Actually a GPM doesn’t account for it. The goal \"to be dead\" in the GPMs is not enough. Because that doesn’t say you’ve lived only once, that just tells you to be dead. So you might ask yourself, why is it that man is so wrong-dated? Now, when I was able to run down the common denominator of people who can’t run on the time track, I found out that the common denominator was not whether or not they got sonic and visio, but whether or not they got tone arm motion. Very good, we’ve just covered that in a lecture. And the reason they don’t get tone arm motion is wrong time – wrong dates. All right, so much for that. Behind all aberration there must be a lie. And you can mark that down in letters of fire. Aberration cannot exist in the presence of truth. Aberration can only exist in the presence of a lie. If somebody is hung with lumbosis, you can make very sure that there is a lie con-nected with the lumbosis. Elementary, my dear Watson. That is one of the common denomi-nators of Scientology.

You know, and it’s that sort of thing. And want to know something about aberration, that’s a better contribution than anything \"Wuff Wuff\" Pavlov ever dreamed up. Didn’t you know that was his name? Later part of his life, you know. His papers, as far as I’m concerned, go \"Bark-bark-bark-bark comma, bark-bark-bark comma, bark-bark-bark semicolon.\" Reg was kind enough to dig me up some Pavlov. I wanted some Pavlov. I was study-ing how not to write up technical data. I didn’t know that was why I wanted Pavlov; I just knew it must be important to do some study on this, and that’s what I found. I didn’t find that dogs were very informative; I know more about dogs than he does. But – I mean just as dogs. Dogs are friends of mine, and he didn’t like them. But, \"Wuff Wuff\" Pavlov gives us a mar-velous example of how not to write up technical information. It’s heroic, man. Try it some-time. He wanders all over the pastures and the fields and dales, and so forth, and he finally gets down to his something-or-other. It’s much more important to him that he used \"surgery comparable to that applied to human beings\" when operating on dogs. And he goes on at great length about the surgery pre-cautions taken on his dogs. And he was taking perfectly healthy, happy dogs, and cutting out half their bladder or half their esophagus or half of something. He never could go all the way, you know? He... And he admitted that this more or less damaged his laboratory animals, and therefore he had to take surgical precautions. And it isn’t a textbook on surgery. He’s giving, of course, the conditions of his experiment. He never gets around to the experiment. But anyway, \"Wuff Wuff\" Pavlov is a marvelous example of a lot of things. He is a man who is totally dedicated to the dramatization of one engram: the Darwinian Theory – man from mud. He’s a physiologist turned psychologist. And he’s in wild protest against the psychologists. Because remember, the psychologists of his day believed in the soul. Some of them were still around who did. After all, psychologist means \"psyche\"-\"ologist.\" And he’s the great physiologist. And you want to look at how you get aberrated because your neurons have turned into morons. [laughter] I was there trying to ask a question – I’m not wandering afield from what I’m talking about here – I was trying to ask – I was asking a question. Why is it that the Russians know nothing about some of the basic laws of social behavior? Why is it that they overlook these laws? And I thought, they have Pavlov, and Pavlov stresses the salivation of the dog – not his salvation, his salivation; that’s all he was interested in – the salivation of the dog when stimu-lated by beefsteak, and the whining of the dog when beaten with clubs. So they would – he would mix these two stimulus-response mechanisms up, and so on. And I wanted to know if Pavlov had ever drawn the conclusion – I haven’t found this out yet; I can’t wade through the stuff – but if he’d ever drawn the conclusion that a reward was also part of existence. That was what I was trying to draw. Do the Russians know this? Is this part of the Russian mental technology? And apparently it is not. And apparently that fact reads through Pavlov without being punched up, as near as I can tell. He doesn’t say \"exist-ence consists of reward and punishment.\" See? That is not the thesis. Now, thee and me, knowing more about this, would immediately conceive that if somebody had a dog salivating or whining under punishment or reward that he would con-"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 3 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    165    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE clude that there were two stimuli, and one was reward and one was punishment. But this is far too simple, and Pavlov never made these comparisons, apparently, as far as I can tell, wading through the stuff. Isn’t that interesting? I consider that extremely fascinating, because the whole Russian system is caving in because they haven’t got this little factor of reward. That is what is wrong with the Russian communist system. Frankly, thee and me could probably sit down and figure out a communist system that would be a gee-whizzer, that would probably work. The – probably the fault is not with communism; the fault is the lie which lies behind communism, which is the physio-logical nature of man. Now, with that lie back of communism, communism becomes a scourge. See, it be-comes an aberration. There are probably many things about communism that aren’t aberra-tive. You could probably do lots of things with the idea of the communal activity of man. You could probably do a lot of things with collectivism. We do things with collectivism. We try to make it work. The Russians are not interested in making it work because they’ve misunder-stood the nature of man. And this is not a lecture on Russia; I’m just showing you the lie back of aberration. So communism becomes fought, and communism becomes very disastrous when prac-ticed. And the poor sods that are walking around with communism wonder where their next muzhik is coming from. They don’t know. And that’s because when Pavlov did his work, he never said that life consisted of reward and punishment. He does a total anatomy of punish-ment. And here’s this drifting factor, reward, which is apparently on automatic. The reason capitalism works is because nobody has analyzed it, and people want pay and they give them pay. I almost started a riot amongst Bantus by telling them that if communism came to South Africa – this was real mean of me – why, they wouldn’t – they wouldn’t get paid, that communisms didn’t pay you for your work. And they thought this was terrible. And they were spitting on the street and stamping and damning Khrushchev, see? I mean it was very upset-ting to them. Because the one thing – the very, very commercial little culture the Bantu has... And boy, you talk about the importance of debts! Some guy owes some money, why, that debt will be passed down, and next generation – and next generation somebody’s great-great-great-great-grandchildren are still worried about those two cows, you see, that Uncle Zidd, or something, is owed. They just – the idea of commerce and money and that sort of thing is very deeply ingrained in these people. And to tell them that communism was a system of getting them to work so they didn’t have to be – so they wouldn’t be paid, that just about finished it. Now, if capitalism was earnest about fighting communism, and so forth, it would dig up a few salient truths and let them have it, see? Because that is the lie back of communism. The lie back of communism is man is a physiological animal going forward on the basis of a punishment stimulus-response. And of course, man does not – does not – respond to punish-ment stimulus-response. Very un-uniform response. You’ve had the experience yourself. You take somebody and you say, \"If you don’t so-and-so and so-and-so, I’m going to raow-rrf-rrr-rrhh-rrrhhh!\""},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 4 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    166    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE And A, that you told this to, cringed and said, \"Oh yes! All right, all right. Don’t beat me.\" And B, C and D said, \"Why you s... Knock your block off, see?\" You’d knock their heads in, and they’d get back up and they still wouldn’t do it. And you knock their heads in, and they get back up and they still wouldn’t do it. And it’s not a constant, don’t you see? In other words, not all living beings succumb to the stimulus of promised punishment. The whole Roman Empire caved in because a sect, called the Christians, moved in, who didn’t stimuli or who didn’t \"respo\" when they got the stimuli of punishment. The court said, \"We’re going to burn you at the stake.\" And they said \"Burn away! We will become martyrs.\" And the Roman Empire couldn’t handle them! [laughter] That was it! That was it. See, they’d met their – they’d met their match. Very important. Extremely important. Now, stimulus-response, then, is half of the picture, don’t you see? Man does not go as a total stimulus-response mechanism. Down in various homely locales I’ve heard \"Ya kin ketch more flies with honey then ya kin with vinegar!\" You’ve heard that sort of thing. Well, they’re talking about the reward part of existence, see? That’s very important, the reward part of existence. Now, the Christian had a greater reward promised him than the punishment. In the first place he had to die in order to go to heaven. And he simply considered this very accom-modating on the part of the Roman Empire and its courts. It got him there that much quicker. And so the Roman Empire could do nothing with the Christian, the Christian overthrew the Roman Empire, and it became the Holy Roman Empire. Literally, factually, yes, you see? Well, there was a lie. There was a lie involved, then, in the Roman Empire. So it didn’t – it didn’t survive. And what was that lie? Well, they must have been subscribing to the same thing Pavlov was writing about: that man is a stimulus-response creature who responds to punishment and threat of punishment; and that to get something done, you threaten or you punish; and if you threaten and punish enough, you will get things done. Well, I will – give it to the Roman Empire, they got quite a ways. They got further than anybody else. But there was a lie involved there, in that there wasn’t a whole statement of the proposition. There was also reward. And the funny part of it is that men will do more things for reward than they will for punishment. So they had just cut out three-quarters of the pie, and then said that the remaining quarter of the pie was the totality of the pie, and tried to carry an empire along on that basis, and of course, it folded. And what do you know! After all these years – you think things change – actually, in this very finite period of time since the Roman Empire, and the equally religious fervor of the communist Russian Empire, you get the same fault cropping up. So you have the philosophy which they adopt is the one which assures them that pun-ishment is all. They adopt this philosophy, and they have immediately adopted something which gives them a commercial upset, economic upset. And although they’re very clever people and have a great deal on the ball on the subject of economics – they say economics are nine-tenths of life; life is only one-tenth political. They’ve got a lot of things like this. They have a terrific propaganda machine. They have practically every newspaper edi-tor in the world working for them. Khrushchev has more press agents than any other single ruler in the world.

And they want to know where’s the tractor driver, and they don’t know where he is. Well, he’s down in the woods. \"Well, where’s the woods? What’s – who else is in the woods,\" this manager will be saying. And, \"Well, he’s down there, and they’re picking berries.\" \"Oh, they’re picking berries. Well, all right.\" And he goes down and he says to the guys down in the woods, \"What are you doing picking berries?\" And all the old women and everybody down there says, \"Well, got to do something to make a living!\" And they found out that they can pick berries, and put them in boxes and sell them in the local town, and they can make a couple of quick rubles. See? To hell with the collective farm. See? Half-a-ruble reward for sweating it out in the woods picking berries is much better than a no-ruble reward because they’re going to get their heads blown off if they don’t drive the tractors and plow the fields. See? You get the idea? So they’re running into this all the time. This causes them then to go into a terrific campaign of some kind or another, you know. They go into this terrific campaign, \"What you want to be is the ‘new man,‘ ‘the total communist,’ ‘the this,’ ‘the that,’ ‘the...’\" Those guys are just sweating themselves to pieces all the time. And they’re trying to compensate for this lie. They think capitalism produces, in some peculiar and mysterious way, more goods than a communism. And they don’t know why this is. They’ve never analyzed why this is because Pavlov didn’t tell them. Capitalism has many – many things wrong with it. But it hasn’t clipped off totally – not until they invented internal revenue, anyway – the total, the totality of award. So you can still – you can still – if you’re very, very clever and so on, you can still keep some of your pay, if you’re careful. But it’s still a reward system. Now, as that reward system dwindles, so dwindles the actual health of the society. And the more internal revenue and the less reward, and the more threat of punishment, and the more you can go to jail if you don’t turn over all your pounds, shillings, dollars, francs or something, to the local income-tax people, you see – the more that works, why, the more dif-ficulty their society gets into. See, you’re not spending any time to work out how to – how do you go about making a healthy economic society? They never spend any time on that. They’re just chipping away at this award and punishment. So actually they’re starting to bor-row Pavlov, too. So, here is a lie. Here is a lie: The statement that man acts totally because of punish-ment and only because of punishment; that man is a driven animal. That lie, all by itself, is destroying the social structure of man. Because man doesn’t go like that! You see? But we enter this lie upon the stage, and here we go. All you’ve got to do is have a great big lie float-ing around someplace and you have trouble. Now, it is perfectly all right to have difficulty isolating the truth, as long as you are continuing to try to isolate the truth. That’s the difference. You sit down hard on one lie, and say that now is the truth, and you’ve done the trick, you see? You say, \"Pavlov has written all there is to know about the human mind,\" and at that moment you’ve had it. Because he hasn’t. He hasn’t even written about the human mind. And the reason I mentioned his prose is be-cause it’s obvious why nobody has ever read him; you can’t. So a sort of a tradition has"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 6 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    168    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE grown up as to what Pavlov’s work is all about. See? And we have not even the work of Pav-lov motivating this kind of thing. We’ve got a superstition about what the work of Pavlov is about. It’s never been properly presented, you see? We’ve got a lot of lies around, and so forth, but we’re not betting on those lies to carry us through, see? That’s perfectly all right. You can have a whole bunch of misconceptions and still not do your nut. But the second you settle completely on a lie, and say now that that is the truth, from that moment on you’ve had it. And you’ve had it to the degree that that truth can be pervasive in your life. You can say, \"Joe is a good man\" when you know – when really the truth is he’s a bad man, and this may cause you some inconvenience, but it won’t destroy your sanity. It’ll cause you some worry. But you say, \"I have lived but once,\" and then believe it, defend it and contest it, and of course, you’re going to have trouble from there on out. It takes a lie of this magnitude to continue the aberration of man. It takes a magnitudinous one. Now, to maintain such a lie must at the same time take a fantastic amount of duress. I mean you’d have to work at it to maintain that lie. And whenever you find a maintained lie, you’ll find somebody is working at it. This guy has got a headache... Well, I don’t know that you could do an all-therapy on this basis. This guy has got a headache; you find the lie con-nected with the headache, and you could probably resolve the headache. That very well might be an open sesame to all psychosomatic healing. You know, you could probably work a whole parade of stuff out: \"Let’s find the lie connected with...\" See? \"Recall a lie about a headache,\" see? Something like that. And bang, the guy’s headache is gone. You see, you’re working now with one of these first principles, when you’re working with a lie. You got that? Now let’s carry this just a little bit further... I didn’t mean to get off into communism. I thought you might be amused. Now, carrying this off a little bit further, let’s find a lie about what. See, now that we’ve found out a lie is this pervasive, see, now, what would be the most disastrous type of lie? And the most disastrous type of lie as a common denominator – al-though there are many disastrous types of lies – would be about time. So let’s combine these two things, you see? You see what a lie can do, all by itself, that has nothing to do with time. All right, now let’s combine it with something which has the power to freeze a tone arm on a pc, that no matter – a big mid ruds on what bad things you’ve done to him in the session, no matter what horrible this-a’s and that-a’s, and what processes you were to run – without paying any attention to lies or time, you see – no matter what you do to correct this tone arm, if you do not pay attention to wrong time it will not correct. You got that? See? This is the only one capable of putting a total freeze on a tone arm. Well, a total freeze on a tone arm is a total freeze on a case. So this gets fantastic. This gets very, very, very, very dreary indeed. So we must be looking here at something like a per-vasive common denominator of aberration when we say \"a lie about time.\" This immediately brings to view processes by the ton. You start thinking up processes, you can just string them out by the hour. \"Recall a lie about time,\" you see, \"Recall a lie about time. Recall a lie about time. Recall a lie about time,\" see? This kind of a – this kind of a process would just string on and on and on and on and on, don’t you see? Now, it’s interesting that if you – if you – oh, you can think of others. You can think of others. Let’s just date everything in somebody’s life. That’s an ordinary one. He believes"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 7 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    169    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE he’s lived but once, well, let’s date everything in that life that has lived but once. Soon as we got that thing kind of dated up you’re liable to find out that he’ll fall through. Now, just think of – think of this approach, see? You might even apply this on an in-stitutional level to just getting the whenness of things. The whenness of things, you know? For instance, \"when is this E-Meter?\" Guy would have to think for a long time. He’d finally decide it was now, see? Might be quite deaberrative; might straighten out his time track most interestingly. Of course, that’s highly experimental – not advanced as something that is proven. But I’m just giving you an idea that you can extrapolate this idea of lie about time almost anyplace you want to look, and you will have some interesting results on a processing line. See, because that combines then the single action that is the most aberrative action – which is an alter-isness of truth or a denial of truth – with the one thing which if aberrated brings about, then, the greatest mess-up from the viewpoint of a person. We won’t call it any-thing technical, but it just messes him up most. Time messes him up the most. And we get these two things in combination, of course we get a lie about time, and we’re off to the races. Well, having recognized this situation, I looked it over very carefully. We have the GPMs, and we have things of this nature, and looked those over and then I said to myself, I said, \"Well now,\" I said, \"Ronnie, if you’ve gotten this far, this sort of thing, let’s just take a look at this now. You suppose some peculiarly and particularly brilliant blankety-blank somewhere on the track has also discovered this and used it to aberrate? Ah well, if that’s the case, then there must be such a thing as false time track, complete with times. Let’s see if we can find some.\" And I found some. Give somebody a false past. Implant him with a false past, complete with pictures, complete with times; and times in the order of magnitude of the thetan’s actual existence – trillions and trillions of years. We could also give him some weird and incomprehensible dates. That’d be a little fillip on the thing, you know; that would be some way to throw a new curve into it. Give him one thousand and sixty-nine times trillion to the tenth. Let him chew on that for a while. And he never can find out what date that is. And you would effectually have blocked out the past by making it so confusing to be entered, and so dreary and so terrible and so awful that nobody would want to have anything to do with it. Now, nobody ever would spend any time enhancing the powers of the thetan, unless he was more diabolical than is believable. But they’d certainly – tend to make them derogatory. They’d make the life as a thetan seem very, very dangerous, very unpleasant. Be-cause look! Look at the horrible things that can happen to you. And therefore, if all these hor-rible things can happen to you, why, then of course, you don’t want to have anything to do with it. And you could get a guy fixed up with sufficient number of false pasts, that he’d even dramatize a false past. He’d become a fiction writer or something like that. He’d even – he’d even automatically give you a false story of his past, don’t you see? He could get quite loopy on this subject, if he were driven in with enough explosion, enough bang, and so on. And if the incident itself were hung up with a double explosion, you know, left-right bang-bang, sort of a double-RI of the thing, you see? Plus and minus RI of the thing; hang it up on the track"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 8 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    170    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE real good. And just give him a good, long time track. Let’s give him – let’s give him a few trillion years to chew on, or a few trillion trillion years to chew on. And let’s give him some incident on that track. Let’s give him a nice history that goes along with that track. Let’s give him pictures. Let’s even give him some times when he’s been implanted. Of course, we couldn’t give him much of an implant, but we could give him a clue that he might have been implanted at this point. You know, let a couple of the pictures leak out – looks like they’re implant pictures. That’d sort of keep him tacking that point of the line, wouldn’t it? And by giving him enough false track, and maybe giving him four or five or six false tracks, he would rapidly get of the opinion that the one thing he shouldn’t do is to return on the time track. Because if he does it is far too painful and confusing. And you’d have him saying at last, in self-defense, \"I’ve only lived but once.\" Yes, that is one of the tricks that has been pulled. Now, you say, \"a false past.\" That’s good termi-nology, by the way. Find some auditors may trip it around on their tongue, but you can learn how to say it. \"A false past\" is better than \"phony pictures,\" or something like that. In discuss-ing this with a pc, you say \"a false past.\" Well, he understands this. And R3R is good enough to be able to find a moment when a false past was installed, date it and get its duration. Really takes some doing. Now, having dated it and gotten its dura-tion, to actually run it out. Now the incident pretends, let us say, to be many trillions of years long. And the actual duration of it is seldom more than three or four hours. So you get the appearance of enormous durations, and you get the appearance of tiny durations. You know, two or three hour duration, or eighty billion trillion squillion, to the nth tex boonk, see – years. You’ll get two durations on the thing – some vast duration and some little duration. And the incident can be run out. But don’t get mad at the pc if he keeps stepping in the mud, you know, and finding himself going to the beginning of the incident, and wondering whether or not he saw it. Now, these incidents have as a common denominator – these incidents have as a common denominator – and the very few of them I have – the few I have seen. I expect there are other kinds. I have seen some of them and they are confused to this degree: The point where you approached and the moment when you approached is quite commonly repeated in the incident. So you walked up a set of steps to get there, so you now have a visio that looks like you’re walking up a set of steps in the incident. Same set of steps. So you’ve got two walkings up the steps. One is in the incident, one is the actual one. And there’ll be two departures. There’s the actual departure, in which one was usually anaten and didn’t know whether he was going or coming, and the picture of his departure. And thetanwise, of course it’d be a picture of exteriorizing from the area; it’s getting dim in the distance. In other words, there are two beginnings and two endings on such an incident. Now, they also occasionally have a mechanism that shows troops marching away and troops march-ing to you. This is how they communicate the beginning and end of things. The beginning of things, of course, troops marching to you. The end of things, troops marching away from you. And these incidents usually start with the troops marching away from you and end with the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 9 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    171    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE troops marching to you. This was the common action – I mean, that set of pictures was ther-apy, at one time, and is used consistently in therapy, so they copied this therapy device in this other action. Only in therapy they show you the beginning of something by, I think, the troops marching to you, and in the end, they show you the end of thing, about the troops marching away from you. Sometimes they’re sailors. Sometimes they’re sailors in pompon hats. Sometimes they’re people who look like West Point cadets. But, you’ll see these two marchings con-nected with it sometimes in these incidents. So knowing these things you actually can find beginnings and ends of it. But it’s very confusing, of course, because the couple of hours there that aren’t taken up give you a whole time track. They give you some catastrophic accident that happened to you, you see, and then you remained dormant for a long time, and things were very mean, and so forth. Well, the way you can tell false track is it really doesn’t move. You’ve got motion to such a limited degree that it doesn’t make very much sense. Let me show you what I mean. As you walk in this – that door back there, you see the front of this room, don’t you? When you turn around you see some more of the room, don’t you? And when you sit down, you see some more of the room in front of you, but from a different viewpoint and level, right? And then when you look down, you have a scanned area of passing your eyes down, toward a book or a meter or something like that, you see? And you have the continuous sound channel that goes all the way along that accompanies this; any sound in the room is continu-ous. Well, that is a proper sequence – very proper sequence. Well, false track never looks like that. They’ve not got the time for it, don’t you see? They’re crowding all – this thing. So you get a picture – if the picture is in motion, and they can be – you get a picture of the front door, then you get a picture of the front of the room, then you get a picture of the book in front of you, see? And they seldom add the sound that goes with it. Many a pc who doesn’t think he has any sonic is simply running false-track inci-dents where there is none. Diabolical, isn’t it? Makes you go wog just to think about it. Now, coupled with this is the fact that there is actual track. You have actual track. And this track, of course, is more sequitur, but again can be in segmental pictures if there’s points of anaten. You’ll get the pictures right up to the point where you knocked yourself out, see? And then you’ll pick up pictures after this point. You don’t have a complete series of pictures, but they don’t go chop, chop, chop. Let me give you a – let me give you an actual one. Thetan is lying on the ground. Airplane comes overhead. Thetan sees airplane come overhead. It just sort of moves into view. Airplane falls apart. We stand up and take a look. But that’s simply a picture of the parts of the airplane falling, you see? And then airplane parts are all over the ground, only they’re plastic parts. It’s not a wrecked airplane, see? We just get jump-jump-jump-jump. See? It’s something like the movie director would cut when he was making a documentary. You know, typical modern documentary. Children starving in Armenia. Children starving in Egypt. Children starving in Wash-ington. Children starving. See? You know, cut-cut-cut-cut-cut-cut. This is typical of one of these false incidents."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 10 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    172    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, why does the thetan look at the false incident? Why is he more likely to be on false incident than he is on true incident? Well, false incident is safe. There’s no bite to the stuff. There’s a hell of a bang – now, don’t think it isn’t aberrative to get one of these bangs, at the beginnings and ends and the somatics that went with it. But once you’ve got those somatics under control, it’s much easier to look at false track than it is... just like you’d rather – a lot of people would rather look at a movie of life than live, see? See, it’s safe, because one really never lived it. They’re usually a derogatory or unhappy state of affairs of some kind or another. And they’re often quite – they’re not well plotted. There isn’t anything very good about it. It’s messy. But in running the incident out, of course the false track is part of the incident you’re running out, right? So the pc in running these two and a half hours gets the sensation of run-ning several million trillion years of track, very often, except it doesn’t take that long to do it. Only he would gasp, if he thought he was having to scan through many trillions of years of track. This would just fill him with \"Uhhhhh! Oh, no!\" you see? The time factor is too great. When he really thinks of the number of pictures there could be on just one trillion years of track, you see? He’ll say, \"Well, am I going to be here the rest of the night?\" You know? This is the idea he gets in session. Well, the longest it could take if it were one for one would be a couple of hours. Anyway, the somatics being wrong, and the scenery being wrong, and the character of the scenery being wrong, the whole thing is therefore a lie. This is a lie about time. It tells him where he has been, when. When he wasn’t there. It puts trillions of years into two hours. There couldn’t be a fancier lie about time. Now they very often have wheels running over to the side with numbers on them. So you can get all the dates you want on the side of the picture. Sound familiar? But a thetan also can do this. He also can visualize numbers to give himself – \"years ago,\" and that sort of thing. Now, the one thing you can be absolutely sure of – one thing you can be absolutely sure of, with false – with – on a question of false track and dates on false track, and that sort of thing, is that there are no GPMs that I know of – there might be signs of them implanted on the false track, but no actual, runnable GPM could possibly be on a false-track implant basis. That would just be totally pointless. In the first place, you can’t, on a false-track gag, get a guy to go over the top of the Ferris wheel several times with the full kinesthesia and motion, don’t you see, and have him struck from both sides with all kinds of firings and that sort of thing. So you know – you know that if you’re running a GPM, that you’re not on false track. Otherwise, beware. Now, it would be adventurous to say that you know you are not on false track if you are running this lifetime. I’m afraid that’d be an adventurous statement, however, because I’ve seen some false track with brownstone houses on it that I could never account for in this lifetime. Now, many a pc – many a pc starts to recover his sanity by just getting him to run, en-tering the room. See, he can verify that that is the picture. He walks in the room and sits down in the chair, and then you have him close his eyes, and he walk – he runs the incident of walk-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 11 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    173    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ing in the room and going and sitting down in the chair. Now he knows that’s his picture, and he knows that is present time, and he knows it isn’t an implant; makes him feel pretty com-fortable. Kind of a weird – a weird operation. But don’t discount it as its value in this sort of thing. Because of course, a total swamp of a memory is the target of this, and a desire not to go back into the past – these are the immediate fruits of it. Now, let’s look at actual track. What about actual track? Can you also find actual track? Oh yeah, that’s pretty easy to find. It’s pretty easy to find. GPMs are very easy to find. The dates of GPMs, this sort of thing. That’s all perfectly accurate, don’t you see? But you’re always walking there with the possibility that you’ve got some false track may turn up on this pc. So there’s two things you want to know when you’re – when you find an incident and date it. Two things you really want to know is one, does it contain opposite-firing items? Like – that is to say, is it a GPM? And the other thing you want to know about it, does it contain false track? Not, does it contain any pictures? This very often will not register. When I say, \"false track\" I’m using a term that we would use but not necessarily on a pc. Better to say, \"false past.\" Does it contain any false past? Because all these picture implants have the ambition of teaching somebody a false past. Now, you need all this data. You need all this data, as discouraging and as upsetting and as miserable and as disheartening as it is. And I know you will go home tonight and lie down and say, \"God, that’s terrible. Ooooo! Aaaah! Are my pictures real? Am I really real?\" Remember the old lady that the robbers caught, and cut her clothes up, and when she finally got home her dog barked at her, and nobody knew her, and she finally decided when she sat down, \"Can this really be me?\" you know? She herself didn’t know her after a while. Well, there’s no particular reason to get in that state, and it’s perfectly all right if you do, because it’s simply a restimulated state. And the cure of the state is, when dating, just make sure that you don’t have any GPMs in it, or if you do, maybe you’re looking for GPMs. That’s – none of the – neither of these things debar you from running the engram. But let’s just make sure we know what we’re running. You scan somebody through a GPM, and you’re going to go blang-bang-bang, and he’s going to stir it all up, but he can’t see the pic-tures, and you don’t know what’s going on. It’s much easier to just – not move him to the beginning of the incident but move him to the first pair of items. And you don’t move any-body anyhow. You just say, \"Give me the first pair of items in that GPM,\" see, after you’ve – if you want to establish what it is, you haven’t got a pattern, it’s off-date, and that sort of thing, just what are the first pair of items? He’ll give you something. Work it out. Muddle through. When you’ve got it all straight, why, you can scan him through the whole incident. It’s perfectly all right if you do that, also. But on false track, what it tells you is be very, very alert to getting a wrong date for the incident, and a wrong duration. Because any incident which contains false track is of very short duration. How long does it take to give somebody a feature-length picture in 3-D, with complete somatics hitting him in the breadbasket, of several trillion years? If you only give him a few pictures of each? See? Doesn’t take very long. Well, that’s the criteria."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 12 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    174    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now the Darwinian theory – now, I’ll give you some idea of the influence of false track upon this society. The Darwinian theory, which probably influenced Pavlov to the greatest degree, is just an implant. That is an implant from man to mud. And it starts out oddly enough with the goal, \"to persist.\" Starts with the goal \"to persist,\" which I consider very, very interesting, because there’s not another item in it. There isn’t even, \"not persist.\" There, you see, they didn’t have the word, you know? They didn’t have a double-firing item. And then they show you your arrival, which you... See, actually they have you in a cell for a while, so they show you being in the cell, and then show you arriving in the room to be implanted. Got that? So you’ve actually – if you were conscious when you went in the room, it – you’ve got now two arrivals in the same room, see? And then they show you – complete with pictures, not unlike a modern motion-picture screen – they show you all that has happened to you, very briefly; they give you background on how mean you are, and then they show you getting implanted. And actually the implantation takes place – the picture never touches the pc – I mean, never touches the person being implanted, but simply stacks mass around his body. All the time he’s looking at the picture he’s having hell knocked out of him many feet away from the picture by electronic mass stacking around his body. See, he’s being hit with waves around his body, you see? So he – this mass gets associated with the – you know, it holds it in the picture, and so forth. And there isn’t another thing said. There’s not one word said. And one of the things you’ve got to be careful of in running false past is getting the pc all mixed up with giving you a fantastic number of items, or something like this. You under-stand? But in this particular Darwinian one, nothing is said. You occasionally do get some-thing said in one of these things; you do sometimes get sonic in these false past lives, or you get conversation or you get this, or you get that. But beware – beware of running things in incidents which aren’t there. It’s almost more deadly than missing things which are there. Don’t overrun these incidents. You know, you can take a GPM and you could just pull conversation out of it by the hour. Did you know that? And every item is wrong. Did you realize that? The guy is sitting there in the middle of the GPM and you don’t know what the goal is, and you don’t even know that it’s this type of GPM – you might have landed by accident in the middle of the Helatrobus Implants, or something of the sort. Maybe the goal is \"to leave.\" And he just gives you item after item of goodbye, farewell, adios, you know? And you know, he just gives you item after item of goodbyes and farewells – it’s just the goal \"to leave.\" It’s just \"leave,\" \"nix leave,\" \"absolutably,\" see, \"left,\" \"not left\" or \"nix left,\" \"absolu-tably.\"3 You know? He’s giving you wrong items. And you’ll pay the penalty for getting wrong items sooner or later – the whole incident tends to fold up. If you want to see an inci-dent get crunchy, get a wrong date, a wrong duration, or run things out of it that aren’t in it. So this is a point that you have to watch.   3 Editor's note: The Helatrobus line plot had an established pattern in which the goal appeared in different forms in the items. The above examples are based on such items from the known pattern. More about it can be found in the lectures and bulletins of May and June 1963."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 13 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    175    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now, this incident – this incident, now with a wheel dating device which gives you a series of numbers that gives you – gives you the time of these events, shows you being im-planted, shows you finished implanting, shows you leaving – being pushed out of the implant room, even shows you a couple of your fellow crew members, or something like that, there, who are tied up ready to be put into the room, shows you being put aboard a spaceship, shows you being taken to another planet, shows you being dumped in the sea, and shows you start from the sea and become seaweed and become this – and to work up stage by stage – giving the millions of years which elapse on each step, see? And you go on and on up the line, each step – each step – each step on an evolutionary channel, and you run all the way through on these evolutionary channels. A lot of this stuff starts looking awfully 3-D after you’ve been looking at them for a while, and shows you eventually arriving at the state of being a man. See? Gives you a bit more louse-up in the way of pictures ending – pictures beginning, some-thing of this sort. And then they push you out through that exact corridor, past the exact two dummies that are tied up, to the exact spaceship, put you in the exact capsule, drop you into that exact sea, and expect you to make some seaweed and go on up the beach. We were fooled only to the degree of some of the incidents of What to Audit are actually out of that. Some of the inci-dents of What to Audit are actual, some are out of that Darwinian implant, see? Now, that’s very interesting, to recognize how they can make you live your life twice. Because that one pretends to go into the future, not into the past. Gorgeous louse-up, see? I know, I caught this with myself, but after they dumped me down at the bottom of the sea, I said \"Ho-hum, skip it!\" And went over and picked up a young fisherman’s baby, and so forth, and hung around there for a while, catching my breath. Didn’t bother to go through all this, seemed pointless. [laughs] But, the idea... that’s very finite. That’s a very short time ago. That’s only a couple of hundred million years ago. A lot of characters around here got this, most of them become sci-entists. That actually is the sole foundation of the Darwinian theory. That’s the lot. Evolution: there’s no such thing. Bodies don’t evolve. They deteriorate, but they don’t evolve. You can trace all kinds of reasons how they evolve, and why they evolve, and you can figure it all out, but the truth of the matter is when you get horses on a planet, somebody came along and mocked up some horses! Now, they also mocked up these horses with the capability of grow-ing hair or not growing hair. You’ve got adjustment factors, but not evolution factors. So you confuse the adjustment factors and prove the whole theory of evolution. And now you know man came from mud, and you can write a book like Pavlov and get the whole world poisoned. You see how this one goes? All of this is based on what? It’s based on errors in time. Errors in time. Because an individual has this incident: It’s a wrong time, wrong place, going wrong the whole way, and it took up two hours and actually looks like it takes up seven million, see? There are such in-cidents. Just before the Helatrobus Implants they were practicing these.

So they last – they’re liable to be found almost any place. Now, if you know that these things exist you can whip it. See, it’s all in what you – what you know exists. When you first collide with one, you’re going to be \"Gee-whiz!\" you know, and you’re going to be much more nervous than you need to be. If you know there is such a thing as a false-past incident and you check up for these things – at the risk of invali-dating the pc’s actual track – you get yourself sailing along there, and you got this incident, and it’s at forty-four trillion years ago, perfectly valid date, you see? The reason I’m talking to you so strenuously about this is you’re just about to be cor-recting somebody’s dates. As a matter of fact you were at it today. You start correcting the dates of incidents and you’re going to run into this other phenomenon. It’s going to drive you mad, man, if you don’t know it exists. You can’t correct dates on a case unless you know this other phenomena exists, because it’s full of false dates, see? Pc and you could work at it, correcting false dates – I don’t know, another couple of hundred hours, all out of one two-and-a-half-hour incident. The thing to do is to, when you start correcting dates of incidents, the first thing you should look for is an incident that con-tains a false past. Not an incident contains false dates. Don’t worry about false dates so much. You just want false past. But, remember that it can also contain a false future. So that mustn’t be totally dis-missed as a possibility. Fortunetellers practice that to this day; it’s very popular – false fu-tures. They get you sitting over the crystal ball, you know, and they say, \"I see a dark man coming into your life. And he’ll be six feet tall if you give me two bucks, and he’ll only be five foot eight, if you don’t give me...\" They’re tailor making future. And most fortunes de-pend on the fact that pcs have future implants that they dramatize, and tend to dramatize. They want to always know about the future. They’re really not nervous, they’re just dramatiz-ing an implant. You must ask for false past. That’ll give you the most loused-up, because future doesn’t, too often, contain dates. But also check for false futures – an incident about false futures. And between the two of these things, why, you’re all set. False present, well, every-body knows it’s false anyway. The task is not a very difficult one, providing you know this information. As far as GPMs are concerned, you go back on the track on GPMs, and you got GPMs at eighteen tril-lion, trillion years ago, and ha-ha, they start banging you in the head and firing left and right, and you’re going over the rolly coaster, and you’re doing this and you’re doing that. Yes, there’s always the possibility there could be an implant that also refers to this GPM, but that cannot be done. What type of equipment is used now, in order to implant false dates, and so on? It’s usually quite – it’s quite varied, but it really never moves off the basis of something you look into or something you look at, attended by electronic blasts. And that’s the common denomi-nator of all such equipment. In other words, you can have a room, and the person is put on a bed, and the screen"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 15 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    177    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE and so on, is at a diagonal up in front of them or at the other end of the room, and it shows a three-dimensional view of events or something like that. Meantime the person is being hit with this and that. It could be as simple as some kind of a scope that has a movie running in the back of it, you put your face or your face is put up to this scope and anchored there with some electric blasts, and at this close range, why, the thing runs off at a mad rate, and there it goes, with appropriate jolts in the right places. It could also be – it could also be a full set which is lugubriously and... this is earlier track when they didn’t mind mass so much. If you find any back there they probably have full sets connected with them. They move them like a stage set. One of the trick ways of building these things, you take these two crayons here, you notice that it – that they are not a consecu-tive line if I hold them like this. And if you pull them down like this, they look like they’re a consecutive line, don’t you see? But there’s a hole between the two of them. So the set moves up and then goes this way around the person. You understand? If a person is anchored there on a stake, or something like this you see, when they – when the set moves then, why, they just jog the set. And he passes through this slit, which he can’t see. Looks very mysterious to him. He’s in one environment, total 3-D environment, he’s in the next environment, total 3-D environment. After his sonic and visio picks up a little bit, however, he can hear the scene shift. They really make a lot of noise. And that type of thing, by the way, is used in some very early implant serieses types of pictures of this kind. The Helatrobus, the Bear and Gorilla and Glade Implants, none of them use pictures. They sometimes – there’s only – the only picture I know of used in the Helatrobus Implants is on a railroad on which you travel sideways at a vast rate of speed. And when you meet the railroad, when you come down to the railroad, you’ll see that there’s a section house right at the point where you’re put on the track. There’s a house there, see? And then as you move down the track, just before you move down the track, a board goes up in front of you, and it’s the same section house. So actually you’re moved at sixty miles an hour sideways with the same section house sitting in front of you. And this is supposed to confuse you enormously. But almost any thetan, no matter how anaten he is, can see that it’s just a board shoved up in front of him. In the Gorilla and Bear GPMs, and so on, they do put a figure on the cart with the thetan. They’ve – there’s a guy in a pink shirt with a monkey peeking out from behind him, put on the ride carts. A guy in a pink-striped shirt – very, very interesting. That’s their – that was their badge, the hoi polloi. And you’ll see this bird with a pink-striped shirt. Sometimes you have a gorilla in front of you. Sometimes it’s the gorilla who is spitting things at you, and that sort of thing. They use figures. But this is not the same thing I’m talking about. Don’t think you’re mixed up in one of these things just because in an implant, why, somebody jumps up with a picture, see, or something like that that’s just a momentary picture. This is not the same inten-tion. That’s just to get you to make pictures, or louse up your pictures, or something like that. No, we’re talking about another type of incident, another type of incident entirely, where you’re hit with electronic blasts, at the same time you’re hit with a series of pictures, which purport to be a past or a future for the individual."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 16 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    178    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE And when you run into that one – when you run into that one, why, if you don’t rec-ognize that these things can exist, why, you’ve had it. Now, this also gets in the road of run-ning an actual incident. You’ve got an actual planet-builder incident, and it looks pretty wild to you. And it doesn’t look like the pc could possibly have done it, and so forth. And you date it, and it’s got a perfectly right date, and so on. And you’ve got no read of any kind on false pasts or anything of this character, and yet there’s that picture and it seems very incredible to you that the pc could be running this at that particular level or line, and that sort of thing. You can get tangled up on this, but just don’t forget to run the incident. Get tangled up all you please, but run the incident. If it’s a right incident, it’s a right incident. If it’s a wrong inci-dent, you’ll never be able to find the beginning of it. About the most maddening activity you can get into is get into one of these false-past things, and go whirring along at a mad rate trying to find the beginning of the incident. Of course, you never make it. You eventually will find a beginning of an incident, but it’ll be an incident of such fantastic magnitude that you’ve got yourself... Aw! The hell with it! You know? It could take you four, five, six sessions, just to try to find the beginning of that se-quence of events. Well, there’s no sense in beating your brains out. If you can’t find easily the beginning of an incident, you better get interested in whether or not this thing has got a false past or a false future in it. That all depends of course on having your date right. Now, how do you clean up somebody – how do you clean up somebody with something like this? Your approved tech-nology at the present moment is clean up his wrong dates. I’m giving you this material because right now some of you are engaged in running a Prepcheck on wrong dates. And it’s a very good thing you are. You’re getting tremendous tone arm action, you’re getting results on this sort of thing, and this is all a very happy thing. Remember this: When you start correcting dates, the first thing you’re going to run into is any false-past or false-future incident that you have triggered on the pc. And you’re going to run into it head-on. So you beware of redating. Don’t redate incidents endlessly. The first order of business is get in there and pitch on the subject of an incident con-taining a false past. And when you’ve got that found – because it’ll be there – when you’ve got that found, and when you’ve got it run... Don’t just find it and date it and walk off, be-cause look, you’re not going to date anything else from there on except the track that is in it! You can date endlessly. You could run a pc maybe thousands of hours, cleaning up this false track which didn’t exist. They can see it and so forth. So, look, if you got your hands on an incident, now, here’s one of your rules of the game, when you’ve got your hands on an incident – even though it’s hell to run and upsets the pc, and everything else, and so on – when you’ve got your hands on an incident which con-tains a false past or a false future, you finish that incident. You understand? Finish it from one end to the other. Do anything necessary to get it the hell off the track. The best way to handle it, of course, is with R3R. You just do standard R3R on the thing. And remember that its pretended duration will be in the millions or billions or trillions or quadrillions. And its actual duration is probably in the matter of hours – at the most a day or two."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 17 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    179    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So I have to give you all this data now, and it’s a good thing that it’s turned-up, be-cause you just start correcting dates on a pc and about the first thing you’re going to trip into is the phenomena of false past with all its attendant false dates. And the moment you get col-lided with one of those things you’ve had it. You want to do a pc an awful lot of good, how-ever, get rid of one of them. Don’t mistake me, they’re hell to get rid of. You take the pc to the beginning of the incident, and he goes to the beginning of the incident. Only the beginning of the incident is also inside the incident, as well as at the beginning of the incident. You get the idea? He finishes up – he finishes up the incident, he leaves the incident at the point where it says he left the incident, but that’s a picture of his leaving the incident, and you haven’t run out his leaving the incident, you got the idea? These things usually have a minimum of two beginnings, identical, and two ends, identical. If you know that, why, you can sometimes pull the fat out of the fire. This thing – you don’t do anything with it, unless it starts running badly. If it runs badly, why, re-duration the actual incident itself, and square it around, and just do a routine, workmanlike auditing job. It doesn’t need anything extraordinary about this thing. The pc will eventually plow on through it. All you need is very standard auditing. Very standard R3R, just its usual steps. You get into a fight with the pc about the thing, however, it’s always perfectly kosher to tip him off and say, \"Well, are there two beginnings?\" Ask on the meter, \"Are there two beginnings to this incident?\" Pang! Pang! Well, you know you got a false past incident, see? \"There are two endings? The reason you’re having trouble with reaching the end of the inci-dent, are there two endings to this incident?\" Pang! Pang! \"Yeah, you got your two endings on the end of the incident.\" Pc says, \"Huh! There are!\" As well as another beginning and ending of the incident that merely says it begins and ends at this point, which is inside the point when it really be-gins and ends. Talk about confusion. These things are confusing to handle. But standard processing, right as of this minute, handles them. And you’re going to run into them head-on, the instant that you start correcting anybody’s dates. It’s one of the first things that’ll raise its hand, and elect to fall in your lap as an auditor, is one of these incidents. Well, what if you’re – what if you’re in X Unit, and you’ve been ordered to do a Prep-check on wrong dates on the pc, and so forth, and the pc starts sliding all over the track, and you’re not supposed to do anything but correct that? Let me tell you the wrong thing to do. Let me tell you the wrong thing to do: Get your hands on one of these false-past or false-future incidents that’s full of dates, get it dated precisely and then walk off and leave it and try to do something else. You’re not going to get anything else done. I can tell you that’s wrong. I won’t tell you what else to do, because I’ll probably contradict the orders your In-structors will be giving you. But I can tell you what not to do. Don’t walk off and leave it. Because you have run into, restimulated and excited thousands of dates. Hundreds or thousands of dates have been excited, just like that. And if somebody didn’t have that pc’s auditor’s report, and that pc ceased to be audited in some way, somebody would be wading through that for a long time trying to find the actual incident again."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ERRORS IN TIME 18 SHSBC-316 – 18.7.63 HSDC    180    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE One of the rules of auditing, one of the little rules that goes along with: don’t talk to people who are unconscious, you know – around people who are unconscious, and don’t – and all aberration is at the bottom of the aberration a lie; a lie causes aberration – along with that is the fact that when you got your paws on something, you handle it. That’s a maxim that I go by in my own auditing. When I find that lying under the needle of my E-Meter is some-thing that’s bothering the living daylights out of the pc – not because he put it there, but be-cause it arrived there in the course of auditing – I handle it. I don’t expect the pc to go on struggling with this thing as a PTP while I do something else because \"I’m supposed to.\" When I get my hands on something in a case, I handle it. You understand? It makes for a little – much less trouble with a case. You get your hands on some-thing, your – this thing is going crash! on wrong dates, crash! on wrong dates. Well, rrrr! What the hell! You got the pc right there on wrong dates; what are you going to do now? Are you going to skip that? You see? Walk off and leave it? Well, you know it’s top-level stuff. How come wrong dates? What are these wrong dates all about? Let’s deal up a few of these wrong dates. Let’s find out what this wrong date thing is. You’re unfortunately liable to find yourself in a process you’re not permitted to run. Just remember this. If you louse up your pc – well, I always make sure that you get two thousand words! And remember this: I never ask how it was done. That’s good enough, see? Somebody loused up a pc, why, bang. I’m very interested at that point. He loused up the pc. I’m not interested if he loused up the pc because the Instructor said, or because he did, or because the bulletin said, or the this said or the that said, or something else said; I’m just in-terested in that he loused up the pc, see? I have a very short-circuited view of the whole thing. Because auditing is auditing. You’re supposed to do auditing. I can lay you down thousands of rules on the subject of auditing. I can guide your footsteps very directly. I can give you information on the subject of auditing. I can do everything else. But I can’t sit in that chair and audit your pc. You understand? And auditing, from my point of view, is supposed to produce beneficial results on a pc. That’s my narrow-minded attitude. You understand? So that here’s the – here’s the pc – here’s the pc, and we’re supposed to produce good results on the pc. Well, if you don’t know how to do this or how to do that or something else, I can show you how to do this or how to do that. Well, you can’t ever tell what is going to come up in this case. When it’s going to come up. You’re not – you can’t tell. Now, when you’re auditing a pc – when you’re auditing a pc, very often a pc comes into session in no fit shape to go on with what you’re running on the pc. It’s very heroic of you to try to keep on running what he’s on, but remember that you can sometimes not accom-plish anything by doing just this. You sometimes have to handle the pc, right there in front of you. Now, similarly, you innocently set forward to do a fundamental action on a case, like straighten out his dates. And you suddenly see yourself staring down the barrel of the incident responsible for the wrong dates. Now, remember, there’s your big auditing cycle.

In this case you’re trying to straighten out the pc’s dates, right? All right, that’s your big auditing cycle, right? All right. So, you’re trying to straighten out the pc’s dates. Now, if you go ahead and handle his lumbosis, God help you, see. I mean that has nothing to do with it. You’re trying to straighten out his dates. That’s a Q and A or a mess-up, see? You’re trying to straighten out the big auditing cycle on this pc – we’re going to get the wrong dates off this case – and suddenly you are presented with something which is out-side the perimeter of the permitted process, or something like that. What do you do with it? I can tell you what not to do with it. Neglect it. Now that’s what you must not do with it. Be-cause you very often can’t get your paws on it again. You’ve made a big problem for some-body else. You can’t straight – when you've f... listen: When you’ve found the source of the pc’s upset, what other source is there to find? See? You got that? So if you’re supposed to be running, \"Which ruddy rod have you stuck between your ears?\" and you all of a sudden find yourself staring at the source of his upset about ruddy rods, I can tell you how not to help the pc: Ignore the fact that you have found the source of it. This results in an invalidation of the source, and nothing happens. You understand? You have to ask yourself, why are you running this thing about ruddy rods between the ears? That’s the big auditing cycle. Don’t ever subordinate your big auditing cycle to the minor auditing cycle. You understand? See, there’s your big auditing cycle, and then there’s your process auditing cycle – you’re supposed to flatten this process, see? But your big one is what you’re trying to – intend with the pc. And then you’re – what process you’re running on the pc, and then you’ve got your other auditing cycle, which is your repetitive give and take of auditing commands, don’t you see? All right, the second that you... some auditors can just get on this give and take of au-diting commands and neglect even the process they’re trying to flatten, see? And some, run-ning the process they’re supposed to flatten, actually can run into the denouement of the big auditing cycle. That’s the end, see? The big auditing cycle – they’ve collided with the thing. This person has been terrified of ghosts. This person has been terrified of this particu-lar subject. Every time they go to bed at night, why, they won’t turn out the lights. You see? They’ve been this way since childhood, or something of this character. And all of a sudden, you’re running this process of some kind or another, you’re straightening out something, and the big auditing cycle turns up and drops into your paws. See? They say, \"No! Not really! I’m a ghost! Ha-ha! Me! Ha-ha-ha! What do you know! I’ve always been afraid of myself.\" Now, what are you going to do from this on? What, are you going to be a complete knucklehead? Going to be a complete jackass? Having found the source, now you’re going to try to do what? I’m just bringing it to your attention, what else is there left to do? There isn’t anything else left to do. Somebody cognites his chain level – his level item assessment4 out. \"Say! What do you know!

Pain (in its various forms) is the indication of an Engram. Sensation (in its various forms) is the indication of a Secondary, which precedes the actual Engram. DEFINITIONS Somatics = This is a general word for uncomfortable physical perceptions coming from the reactive mind. Its genus is early Dianetics and it is a general, common package word, used by Scientologists to denote “pain” or “sensation” with no difference made be-tween them. To understand the source of these feelings, one should have a knowledge of en-grams, ridges and other parts of the reactive bank. To the Scientologist anything is a Somatic if it emanates from the various parts of the reactive mind and produces an awareness of reac-tivity. Symbol som. Pain = Pain is composed of heat, cold, electrical, and the combined effect of sharp hurting. If one stuck a fork in his arm, he would experience pain. When one uses Pain in con-nection with clearing one means awareness of heat, cold, electrical or hurting stemming from the reactive mind. According to experiments done at Harvard, if one were to make a grid with heated tubes going vertically and chilled tubes going horizontally and were to place a small current of electricity through the lot, the device, touched to a body, would produce the feeling of Pain. It need not be composed of anything very hot or cold or of any high voltage to pro-duce a very intense feeling of pain. Therefore what we call Pain is itself heat, cold and elec-trical. If a pc experiences one or more of these from his reactive mind, we say he is experienc-ing Pain. “Electrical” is the bridge between sensation and Pain and is difficult to classify as ei-ther PAIN or sensation when it exists alone.

These are basically “pressure”, “motion”, “dizziness”, “sexual sensation”, and “emotion and misemotion”. There are others, definite in themselves but definable in these five general categories. If one took the fork in the pain definition above and pressed it against the arm, that would be “pressure”. “Motion” is just that, a feeling of being in motion when one is not. “Motion” includes the “winds of space”, a feeling of being blown upon especially from in front of the face. “Dizziness” is a feeling of disorientation and includes a spinniness, as well as an out-of-balance feeling. “Sexual sensation” means any feeling, pleasant or un-pleasant, commonly experienced during sexual restimulation or action. “Emotion and Mise-motion” include all levels of the complete tone scale except “pain”; emotion and misemotion are closely allied to “motion”, being only a finer particle action. A bank solidity is a form of “pressure”, and when the sensation of increasing solidity of masses in the mind occurs, we say “the bank is beefing up”. All these are classified as Sensation.

A thetan is a thetan and he wants spiritual freedom and ability. A body is a body. Scientology = thetan rehabilitation. Dianetics = body improvement. All Dianeticists and Scientologists, all pcs and pre OTs should be informed of this. Using Scn to help the body and Dianetics to help the thetan is a mix of practices and the misuse of both. Even the applications are different. In Scn you handle PTPs, ARC Breaks, Missed Withholds that occur in sessions. In Dianetics you erase the session or incident in which they occurred. Dianetic processing uses a Meter, R3R and assists and TRs. It also uses an understand-ing of what the subject is for. It erases locks, secondaries and engrams or their chains.

Narrative means “Falls down stairs” “An earlier fight with brother”. By somatic is meant a pain or ache sensation and also mise-motion or even unconsciousness. There are a thousand different descriptive words that could add up to a feeling. Pain, aches, dizziness, sadness – these are all feelings. Awareness, pleas-ant or unpleasant, of a body is what we are trying to run in Dianetics. All chains are held together by one similar feeling. That is a new discovery. Chains are not held together by narratives or personnel or locations. They are held together by feelings. Thus we ask for and follow down only feelings. Those can be aches, pains, sensations, misemotion – any feeling. This brings to light a further discovery. One never assesses medical terms or symp-toms. An engram contains pain and unconsciousness. All right. Then its basic would be a physical duress not a symptom resulting from that duress. Example: The pc says “headache”. You assess headache, you try to run “headaches” and all you ever get is times a pc had a headache. Well, the headache is a symptom caused by a head injury. The engram must have contained a shot in the head or a crushed skull or some actual injury. The word “headache” would describe only how the head feels later when the engram occasionally goes into restimulation. So you would get only locks and secondaries to audit and only by chance and an al-teration by the pc of the command to find an earlier headache would you ever get to an en-gram in which the head was crushed or injured. “Headache” is the result of a head injury, and it doesn’t describe the injury which, in engram form, is now giving the pc headaches. Take the medical term Arthritis. You could ask for arthritis and get only visits to the doctor or times in a wheel chair. The physical injury contained in the engram causing the ar-thritis is not described. Alcoholism would present the same problem. If the pc listed and the auditor assessed “Alcoholism” we would only get times when he was drunk, not the engram causing the symp-tom which might contain “Feeling very dry”."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"SOMATICS   2   HCOB   26.4.69   HSDC    188    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Therefore one has more than one column on a Health Form. One would give the physical disability or complaint. The second would be Pc’s Description of the feeling. We would land the real engram every time, not only its locks or secondaries. (It is quite all right to run locks and secondaries as it is necessary to unburden the chain and increase the pc’s confront, but chains always end up in a basic engram at the bottom and if you don’t get and erase that then the chain will key in again.) In asking for list items one puts down only what the pc says. That’s an invariable rule. But when the pc says some mere symptom like “headache” or medical term like “arthritis” the auditor writes it down but also asks, “What is the feeling of that?” or some such question and writes what the pc then says and only assesses the feeling stated. Example: Pc says a complaint is “Sinusitis”. The auditor writes it down. But asks also for the feeling of it. The pc says, “A burning sensation in the nose.” In assessing the list the auditor does not call out “Sinusitis.” He says, “A burning sensation in the nose.” And marks down its meter read. If the auditor took and assessed only “Sinusitis” and then asked for incidents of si-nusitis he would get only locks and secondaries – times when the engram was in restimula-tion. And he would rarely get the real basic and engram that causes the symptom. This discovery opens the door to swift “cures”. But one is obviously not treating Si-nusitis. He is looking for an incident in which there was a ”burning sensation in the nose”. And after a few locks and upper engrams he’d find and run the real injury in which the nose was burned. L.

In Dianetics it means an engram too late on the chain to erase is in restimulation. A Scientology auditor “rehabs” overruns. A Dianetic auditor cures high TA by finding what engram (lock or secondary) is in restimulation (active). This will show up as a pain, sensation, misemotion or other present time feeling the pc has. In short, just by finding the somatic by list and assessing for longest read and running R-3-R you can cure a high TA. You handle a TA that goes up during a session by completing the chain exactly as in R-3-R. The same action you do for R,3-R also cures the high TA. By running a pc through only once each time instead of twice you leave a later inci-dent too charged for the pc to see an earlier incident. By trying to erase the somatic only, not the picture (”pc no longer has somatic”) you can leave the picture partially there. There can be an infinity of wrong ways but only one right way and the right way is R-3-R by the book. A high TA (4 or above) is simply the E-Meter’s reaction to increased mass. Mental Image Pictures have mass. The mass has what is called resistance to electricity. The E-Meter measures electrical resistance. Mass resists electricity. Thus in the presence of mental mass as contained in mental image pictures, the Tone Arm of the E-Meter rises. When you restimulate an engram, the E-Meter current flow has more trouble getting through the pc and the TA rises. When the engram (or lock or secondary) is “keyed out” (moved away) the TA comes down and the meter needle will float. If you find a long chain with many engrams on it and run a late engram the TA goes up. As you go earlier, and eventually find Basic, the TA comes down and when you erase the basic engram the TA will come down to between 2 and 3 and the needle will float."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"HIGH TA IN DIANETICS 2 HCOB 28.4.69 HSDC    190    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Old disproved theory pre-Dianetics was that the E-Meter reacted to sweat on the hands but of course a person would have to sweat and “unsweat” to make the meter behave as it does. And the idea of “unsweating” would be ridiculous. Palms of the hand do not go wet – dry with enough rapidity to account for meter reaction up and down. When you run several engrams through once or several somatic chains without erasing any you pile up too much mass and the TA will go high and stick. Even if nothing is done to repair this the pc will de-stimulate (the pictures will drop away) in from 3 to 10 days. It is a very poor show of auditing to do R-3-R other than exactly by the book. It is very easy to do it exactly right. The drill is simple. If done exactly right the result is good and in-variable. L.

Grinding means going over and over and over and over a lock, secondary or engram without obtaining an actual erasure. The sense of the word comes from the action of using an emery wheel on a hard sub-stance. The substance doesn’t get much smaller or thinner no matter how long it is done. The reason grinding occurs is that the incident is too late on the chain. There are ear-lier incidents. It is a highly undesirable action. A Dianetic Auditor who puts the pc through an inci-dent four or five times without erasure or appreciable reduction is encountering “grinding”. He should ask the pc to see if there isn’t something earlier with a similar somatic. OTs AND DIANETICS We have encountered two cases who were “OT VI” who also got into grinding without there being anything earlier. In both these cases, they did not want a session and were only going through it to be obliging. Both of these “OTs” had skipped some of their grades. The proper action would have been to review their grades, the grade known as OT III was cer-tainly out. When a person gets above Clear, oddities can be expected to occur when you try to run Dianetics on them. If they really haven’t made all their grades, however, and are physi-cally ill, the correct action is to do all possible to handle their case by Standard Dianetics and then rehabilitate or get done all the rest of the grades. What has happened here is that they were using Scientology to escape an uncomfortable body that should have been straightened out by Dianetics in the first place. The “out grade” is in fact Dianetics, failure to use it before going on to Scientology. You can therefore expect some of these Scientology cases who are “OT” but haven’t really made it due to out Dianetics, to run very well on Dianetics, by the book. The action is to handle their physical complaints with Dianetics and then rehab or get done all the Scientol-ogy grades, being watchful for grades not done at all."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"GRINDING OUT ENGRAMS 2 HCOB 1.5.69 HSDC    192    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Some of these “OT” flubs, however, can be expected to “grind” and to fail to erase en-grams.

NOT FOLLOWING SOMATIC Possibly a pc who does not go down the somatic chain but who skips from one so-matic to another could also get into grinding. THROUGH ONLY ONCE A pc not put through each incident on a chain twice before going earlier could get into grinding. The pc who is run through each incident once only before being sent earlier will certainly fail to get off enough charge to get earlier.

You almost can’t get un-complicated enough in engram running. In teaching people to run engrams in 1949, my chief despair was summed up in one sentence to the group I was instructing: “All auditors talk too much.” And that’s the first les-son. The second lesson is: “All auditors acknowledge too little.” Instead of cheerily acking what the pc said and saying “Continue,” auditors are always asking for more data and usually for more data than the pc could ever give. Example: Pc: “I see a house here.” Auditor: “Okay. How big is it?” That’s not engram running, that’s just lousy “Q and A.” The proper action is: Pc: “I see a house here.” Auditor: “Okay. Continue.” The exceptions to this rule are non-existent. This isn’t a special brand of engram run-ning. It is modern engram running. It was the first engram running and is the latest and you can put aside any complications in between. The rule is acknowledge what the pc says and tell him to continue. Then there’s the matter of being doubtful of control. Wrong example: Auditor: “Move to yesterday. Are you there? How do you know it’s yesterday? What do you see that makes you think...” Flunk, Flunk, Flunk. Right example: Auditor: “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” (Pc answers.) “What do you see?.......... Good.” Another error is a failure to take the pc’s data. You take the pc’s data. Never take his orders. EARLY ENGRAM RUNNING No auditor who knew earlier than June 1978 engram running should consider he or she knows how to run engrams. Routine 3RA is itself. It has no dependence on earlier methods of running engrams. Failure to study and learn R3RA “because one knows about engram running” will cause a lot of case failure. If you know old-time engram running there is no attempt here to invalidate you or that knowledge or make you wrong in any way. Those are all ways to run engrams and gave you a better grasp on it. I only wish to call to your attention that R3RA is not old-time engram run-ning."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 3 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    195    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ROUTINE 3RA Engram running by chains is designated “Routine 3RA.” It is a new triumph of simplicity. It does not demand visio, sonic or other perception at once by the pc. It develops them. R3RA REVISED BY STEPS The first thing the auditor does is to make sure the room and session are set up. This means, in other words, that the room is as comfortable as possible and free from interruptions and distractions; that the auditor’s meter is fully charged and set up and that the auditor has all the administrative supplies he will need for the session. Prepared correction lists for Dianetics must also be included. He has the C/S for that session. The pc is seated in the chair furthest from the door and is asked to pick up the cans. The auditor checks that the pc has had enough to eat by doing the metabolism test and also checks that the pc has the correct sensitivity setting by having the pc squeeze the cans and adjusting the sensitivity knob so that the needle registers one third of a dial fall when squeezing the cans. The auditor then starts the session by saying, “This is the session” (Tone 40). The auditor then puts in the R (reality) factor with the pc by telling the pc briefly what he is going to do in the session. PRELIMINARY STEP: Establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment. REF: HCOB 18 JUNE 78 NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM.

STEP FOUR: “What is the duration of that incident?” Accept any duration the pc gives you or any statement he makes about it. Do not attempt to meter him a more accurate duration. STEP FIVE: Move the pc to the beginning of the incident with the exact command: “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” STEP SIX: Ask pc what he or she is looking at with the exact command: “What do you see?” (If the pc’s eyes are open, tell the pc first, “Close your eyes,” acknowledge him quietly for doing so and then give him the command.) STEP SEVEN: “Move through that incident to a point (duration pc said) later.” STEP EIGHT: Ask nothing, say nothing, do nothing (except observe the meter or make quiet notes) while pc is going through the incident. If pc comments before reaching the end say “OK, continue.” STEP NINE: When the pc reaches the end of the incident say only: “What happened?” Take whatever pc says, acknowledge only as needful. Say nothing else, ask nothing else. When pc has told little or much and has finished talking, give him a final ac-knowledgement. If the TA has risen (from its position at Step 1) the auditor immediately checks for an earlier incident (Step G). If no earlier incident, he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident (Step H). If the TA is the same or lower, he runs the incident through again (Step A). In going through an incident the second or successive times one does not ask for date and duration or any description. A.

H. “Is there an earlier beginning to this incident?” or “Does the one we are running start earlier?” or “Does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident?” (If not, give command D and put the pc through the incident again. If there is an ear-lier beginning, give command EYE.) EYE. “Go to the new beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” (Followed by B. C.) POSTULATE OFF EQUALS ERASURE When it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing, after each pass through, ask: “Has it erased?” The pc sometimes thinks the incident is erasing but it’s not erasing, so you have to go back to your G. H. EYE followed by 2-9, A-EYE. In some cases this can happen several times in one chain. The postulate coming off is the EP of the chain and means that you have obtained an erasure. This will be accompanied by F/N and VGIs. Getting the postulate is the important thing. Even if you get an F/N you don’t call the F/N UNTIL you’ve gotten the postulate, at which time you have reached the EP and end off on that chain. If the pc says the chain has erased, but the postulate made during the time of the in-cident has not been volunteered by the pc ask: “Did you make a postulate at the time of that incident?” Only when the postulate has come off to F/N and VGIs can one consider that the full EP of a Dianetic incident or chain has been reached."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 6 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    198    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You must recognize what the postulate is when it comes up. If you overrun past the postulate you can really mess a pc up and he may need extensive repair. All you’re trying to get off the line is the postulate. That is what is keeping the chain there. If the pc has given the postulate to F/N and VGIs, that is it. You have the EP of that chain. GOING EARLIER Ordinarily one runs an incident through twice, (Steps 1-9 then A-C), to unburden it and allow the pa to locate earlier incidents on the chain. However, the TA rising on Step 9 is an indication that there is something earlier. If the auditor observes the TA rising, he should ask the pc if there is an earlier incident, using in the command the exact same somatic or feeling used in Step One. If there is no earlier incident he asks if there is an earlier beginning. An auditor should never solidify a pays bank by putting him through an incident twice, when by observation of the TA it is clear that the incident has gone more solid by the end of the first run through. Checking for an earlier incident after the first run through (if the TA has risen) is the solution to this. If, after the second pass through, when you have asked the pc “Is the incident erasing or going more solid?” and the pc doesn’t know or isn’t sure, ask for an earlier incident. Never ask erasing/solid in the middle of an incident. BOUNCERS If the pc is out of the session, out of the incident, bounces from the incident, etc., you would have to have him or her return to the beginning of the incident and move through the incident, returning the pc to the incident as necessary. The pc who bounces out of an incident on a “bouncer” has to be put back into the in-cident and continue running it. The commands to do this are: As soon as you have seen that the pc has bounced give him command D (“Return to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.”), followed with E, F. Fa. FLOWS 2, 3 AND 0 Step One and Step G (going earlier) commands for Flows 2, 3 and 0 are: FLOW 2: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of your causing another_____ (the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1).”"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 7 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    199    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of your causing another_____ (the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” FLOW 3: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of others causing others_____ (plural of the somatic or feeling used in Flow 1). “ STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of others causing others_____(plural of the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” FLOW 0: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of you causing yourself_____(the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1).” STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of you causing yourself_____(the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” Each of these Step One and Step G commands are run on the full verbatim 1-9, A-EYE steps as given herein. NARRATIVE R3RA A narrative item is often run to run out the physical experiences the person has just undergone. This could be for example an accident, illness, an operation or emotional shock. However, a condition or circumstance without an incident is not narrative. It’s just an incorrect item. An example of this would be trying to run the item, “Obstruction of justice.” It would not run as there is no exact incident there. Narratives are too often just run through once or twice and abandoned. This, unfortu-nately, leaves the incident still charged and affecting the pc. A narrative needs to be run and run and run on that one incident. What you are doing is running the incident narrative to era-sure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly. Most narratives will run out by themselves without going earlier even though it takes a very long time but if you want to change somebody’s life, that’s how you can do it. When you are running a narrative you always add the known incident to the command. Using the earlier beginning command in running narratives is essential. For example: If the pc is running out a death of somebody closely related to him you will find that the inci-"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 8 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    200    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE dent actually started when he heard the phone ring, then, going back earlier to when some-body looked at him peculiarly, etc. So using the earlier beginning command in narrative running is vital. The commands for Narrative are: FLOW 1: STEP ONE: “Return to the time you______(specific incident) and tell me when you are there.” Steps 2-9 are followed (3 is omitted as you have already got the pc to the incident by giving him the first command, “Return to the time...”). Earlier beginning (Step H) is checked after each run through the incident. If there is one, send the pa to the new beginning of the incident (Step EYE) then follow with Steps B and C. If there is no earlier beginning, return the pa to the incident with Step A, followed by B and C, again checking earlier beginning (Step H) at the end of each run through the incident. On third and subsequent runs through the incident use steps D, E, F making certain to check for earlier beginning after each pass through, and only when the pa is obviously starting to grind and gets no place does one then use the command, “Is there an earlier similar incident?” FLOW 2: STEP ONE: “Return to the time you caused another to/a (specific incident) and tell me when you are there.” Steps 2-9 are followed (3 is omitted as you have already got the pc to the incident by giving him the first command, “Return to the time...”).

AUDITOR KNOWLEDGE OF COMMANDS These commands and procedures as given above must be thoroughly drilled with TR 101, 102, 103 and 104 before any Dianetic auditing may be done on a pc. Pcs can be messed up by incorrect and sloppy commands."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 10 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    202    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE SPEED OF COMMANDS Some pcs run fast and some run slow. An auditor must never rush a pc or hold him up when he is ready to go on with the next command. The auditor must never keep a pc waiting for him while he handles his admin or comm lags before giving the next command. Timing and speed are especially crucial when the auditor gives the command to move through the incident after having told the pc to move to the beginning of the incident. With a slow command, the pc would wind up halfway through the incident before he receives the command to move through it. The better an auditor knows his TRs, his process commands, his meter and admin the faster and more accurately he can operate. Speed is very important, especially when auditing fast pcs. PC INTEREST In doing R3RA it is necessary that (a) one chooses things the pc is interested in and (b) one does not force a pc to run things he is protesting being run on. LAST INCIDENT FOUND If you ask if there is an earlier beginning and you have already checked for an earlier incident and the pc says there is no earlier beginning, you do not just walk off from the one he was just running. You send the pc through it again and it will erase with full end phenomena or the pc will then be able to see an earlier incident and continue with the chain. COMPLETING CHAINS If you do sloppy R3RA and do one thing after another without getting the full EP of: 1) the actual postulate which will be the erasure, 2) F/N, 3) VGIs, you will get the pc stuck up on the track. You complete each chain to full EP as above, remembering that when the postulate comes off, THAT is your EP. The chain will have blown.

THEN you call the F/N and that’s it for that chain. BLOWING BY INSPECTION An auditor may occasionally encounter a pc who erases chains before he can even tell about them. Along about Step 3 of R3RA, the TA blows down, the needle F/Ns, the pc says, “It’s gone,” and VGIs come in. This is called blowing by inspection and occurs once in a while with a fast running pc on a light chain. If it was basic for that chain and the auditor fails to recognize and handle it, the pc will go into another chain or a heavy protest. ENDING SESSION An R3RA session can be safely ended on a completed chain that ended with the full Dianetic EP as above stated... This doesn’t mean the end of all Dianetic auditing. In the next session another assess-ment will turn up more unwanted feelings, etc. ENDING DIANETICS Dianetics is ended off only when a pc has become well and happy and remains that way.

Actually, millions of words have been written or spoken on the subject of running engrams. However, oddly enough there was not one condensed, summary HCO Bulletin on the subject. Engram running, developed, was never then summated. I will therefore attempt to remedy the matter. ENGRAM RUNNING SIMPLIFIED No recapitulation or summation of materials was ever done on engram running. There-fore while all lectures and books on it are true, not one contains a final survey of engram run-ning including everything vital to this skill and the laws which govern it. The material in books and tapes should be reviewed. But the material in these HCO Bulletins should be learned thoroughly as it takes precedence over all earlier material. WHY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING ENGRAMS I have gotten very impatient with the constant plea for a rote set of commands to run engrams. The need for such commands is a testimony to the Auditor’s lack of knowledge of the mechanics of the Time Track and the pc’s behavior during an engram running session. An auditor must know the basic laws and mechanics of the Time Track in order to run engrams. There is no rote procedure and never will be that will be successful on all cases in absence of a knowledge of what a Time Track is. There is no substitute for knowing what engrams are and what they do. Knowing that, you can run engrams. Not knowing that, there is nothing that will take the place of such knowledge. You have to know the behavior of and data about engrams. There is no royal road that avoids such knowledge. If you know all about engrams you can run them. If you don’t, you’ll make a mess regardless of the commands given for use. Therefore the essence of engram running is a knowledge of the character and behavior of engrams. This is not a vast subject."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM 2 HCOB 15.5.63 RUNNING BY CHAINS HSDC    206    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE However, these three things stand in the way of learning about engrams: 1. Engrams contain pain and unconsciousness; fear of pain or inflicting pain causes the auditor not to confront the pc’s engrams and unconsciousness is after all a not know-ing condition; and 2. The auditor is so accustomed to projectionists reeling off movies and TV programs for him or her that the auditor tends to just sit while the action rolls forward, acting like a spectator, not the projectionist. 3. Failure to handle Time in Incidents. On (1) you can remedy this just by knowing about it and realizing it and surmounting it, and on (2) you can remedy the attitude by realizing that the auditor, not the pc (or some installed movie projectionist), is operating the pc’s bank. (3) is covered later. Take a pocket movie projector and any bit of a reel of film and wind it back and forth for a while and you’ll see you are moving it. Then give a command and move the film and you’ll have what you’re doing as an auditor. Many drills can be developed using such equip-ment and (2) will be overcome. (1) requires just understanding and the will to rise superior to it. THE TIME TRACK The endless record, called the Time Track, complete with 52 perceptions, of the pc’s entire past, is available to the auditor and his or her auditing commands. The rules are: The time track obeys the auditor; the time track does not obey a preclear (early in auditing). The Time Track is a very accurate record of the pc’s past, very accurately timed, very obedient to the auditor. If motion picture film were 3D, had 52 perceptions and could fully react upon the observer, the Time Track could be called a motion picture film. It is at least 350,000,000,000,000 years long, probably much longer, with a scene about every 1/25 of a second. DEFINITIONS That part of the Time Track that is free of pain and misadventure is called simply the Free Track, in that the pc doesn’t freeze up on it. Any mental picture that is unknowingly created and part of the Time Track is called a Facsimile, whether an engram, secondary, lock or pleasure moment. Any knowingly created mental picture that is not part of a Time Track is called a Mock-up. Any unknowingly created mental picture that appears to have been a record of the physical universe but is in fact only an altered copy of the Time Track is called a Dub-in."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM 3 HCOB 15.5.63 RUNNING BY CHAINS HSDC    207    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Those parts of the Time Track that contain moments of pain and unconsciousness are called Engrams. Those parts of the Time Track which contain misemotion based on earlier engramic experience are called Secondaries. Those parts of the Time Track which contain the first moment an earlier engram is res-timulated are called Key-ins. Those parts of the Time Track which contain moments the pc associates with Key-ins are called Locks. A series of similar engrams, or of similar locks, are called Chains. A Basic is the first incident (engram, lock, overt act) on any chain. Basic Basic is the first engram on the whole Time Track. Incidents are not in piles or files. They are simply a part of the consecutive Time Track. By Incident is meant the recording of an experience, simple or complex, related by the same subject, location or people, understood to take place in a short and finite time period such as minutes or hours or days. A Chain of Incidents makes up a whole adventure or activity related by the same sub-ject, general location or people, understood to take place in a long time period, weeks, months, years or even billions or trillions of years. An incident can be an engram, secondary, key-in or lock. A chain of incidents can therefore be a chain of experiences which are engrams, secondaries, key-ins and locks. A chain of incidents has only one Basic. Its Basic is the earliest engram received from or overt act committed against the subject, location or beings which make it a chain. THE INFLUENCE OF THE TIME TRACK Shakespeare said all life was a play. He was right in so far as the Time Track is a 3D, 52 perception movie which is a whole series of plays concerning the preclear. But the influ-ence of it upon the preclear removes it from the class of pretense and play. It is not only very real, it is what contains whatever it is that depresses the pc to what he is today. Its savageness relieved, the preclear can recover, and only then. There is no other valid workable road. There are valences, circuits and machinery in the reactive mind, as well as Reliable Items and Goals. But these all have their place on the Time Track and are part of the Time Track. The preclear, as a thetan, is the effect of all this recorded experience. Almost all of it is unknown to him. There are no other influencing agencies for the preclear than the Time Track and Pre-sent Time. And Present Time, a moment later, is part of the Time Track."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM 4 HCOB 15.5.63 RUNNING BY CHAINS HSDC    208    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE THE CREATION OF THE TIME TRACK The preclear makes the Time Track as time rolls forward. He does this as an obsessive create on a sub-awareness level. It is done by an involuntary intention, not under the pc’s awareness or control. The road to clear by making the preclear take over the creating of the Time Track was long explored and proved completely valueless and chancy. The road to clear by making the preclear leave the Time Track (exteriorization) lasts only for minutes, hours or days and has proven valueless. The road to clear, proven over 13 years of intense research and vast numbers of audit-ing hours and cases, lies only in an auditor handling the Time Track and removing from it, by means governed by the Auditor’s Code, the material, both motivators and overts, which, re-corded on it, is out of the control of the pc and holds the pc at effect. Listing for goals and reliable items, engram running, Prepchecking, Sec Checking, recall processes and assists all handle the Time Track successfully and are therefore the basis of all modern processing. APPARENT FAULTS IN THE TIME TRACK There are no faults in the recording of the Time Track. There are only snarls caused by groupers, and unavailability and lack of perception of the Time Track. A Grouper is anything which pulls the Time Track into a bunch at one or more points. When the grouper is gone the Time Track is perceived to be straight. Unavailability is caused by the pc’s inability to confront or Bouncers and Denyers. A Bouncer throws the pc backward, forward, up or down from the track and so makes it appar-ently unavailable. A Denyer obscures a part of track by implying it is not there or elsewhere (a mis-director) or should not be viewed. Groupers, bouncers and denyers are material (matter, energy, space and time in the form of effort, force, mass, delusion, etc.) or command phrases (statements that group, bounce or deny). When a grouper, bouncer or denyer are enforced by both material and command phrases they become most effective, making the Time Track unavailable to the pc. Unless the Time Track is made available it cannot be as-ised by the pc and so remains aberrative. The Time Track is actual in that it is made of matter, energy, space and time as well as thought. Those who cannot confront MEST think it is composed only of thought. A grouper can make a pc fat and a bouncer thin if the pc is chronically stuck in them or if the track is grouped or made unavailable through bad auditing."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM 5 HCOB 15.5.63 RUNNING BY CHAINS HSDC    209    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE THE ORIGIN OF THE TIME TRACK Through a great deal of study, not entirely complete, the following surmises can be made about the Time Track, the physical universe and the pc. The tendency of the physical universe is condensation and solidification. At least this is the effect produced on the thetan. Continued dwelling in it without rehabilitation causes the thetan to become less reaching (“smaller”) and more solid. A thetan, being a static, may be-come convinced he cannot duplicate matter, energy, space, or time or certain intentions and so succumbs to the influence of this universe. This influence in itself would be negligible unless recorded by the thetan, stored and made reactive upon the thetan as a Time Track, and then maliciously used to trap the thetan. Recent researches I have done in the field of aesthetics tend to indicate that rhythm is the source of present time. The thetan is carried along both by his own desire to have, do or be and by having been overwhelmed in the distant past by a continuous minute rhythm. This is a possible explanation of a thetan’s continuous presence in Present Time. Present Time, then, can be defined as a response to the continuous rhythm of the physical universe, resulting in a hereness in nowness. In response to this rhythm, undoubtedly assisted by overts and implants and convic-tions of the need of recording, the thetan began to respond to the physical universe in his crea-tions and eventually obsessively created (by means of restimulatable involuntary intentions) the passing moments of the physical universe. But only when he began to consider these pic-tures important could they be used to aberrate him. These are only partly permanently created. Other moments of the past become re-created only when the thetan’s intention is directed to them, on which these parts spontane-ously appear, the thetan not voluntarily creating them. This forms the Time Track. Some parts of it, then, are “permanently” in a state of creation and the majority of it becoming created when the thetan’s attention is directed to them. The “permanently created” portions are those times of overwhelm and indecision which almost entirely submerged the thetan’s own will and awareness. Such parts are found in implants and great stresses. These parts are in permanent res-timulation. The mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause a balance which does not respond to current time and remains “time-less” . Such phenomena as the overt act-motivator sequence, the problem (postulate counter-postulate), tend to hold certain portions of the Time Track in “permanent creation” and cause them to continue to exist in present time as unresolved masses, energies, spaces, times and significances. The intention of the physical universe (and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends) is to make a thetan solid, immobile and decisionless."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM 6 HCOB 15.5.63 RUNNING BY CHAINS HSDC    210    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid, mobile or immobile at will, and capable of decision. This in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of a trap. The mechanism of the Time Track can then be said to be the primary action in making a thetan solid, immobile and decisionless. For without a record of the past accumulating and forming a gradient of solidification of the thetan, the entrapment potential of the physical uni-verse would be negligible and the havingness which it offers might be quite therapeutic. It probably requires more than just living in the physical universe to become aberrated. The main method of causing aberration and entrapment is therefore found in actions which create or confuse the Time Track. A thetan has things beyond Matter, Energy, Space and Time which can deteriorate. His power of choice, his ability to keep two locations separate, his belief in self and his ethi-cal standards are independent of material things. But these can be recorded in the Time Track as well and one sees them recover when no longer influenced by the Time Track. As the thetan himself makes his own Time Track, even if under compulsion, and commits his own overts, even on provocation, it can be said, then, that the thetan aberrates himself. But he is assisted by mammoth betrayals and his necessity to combat them. And he is guilty of aberrating his fellows. It is doubtful if another type of being built the physical universe and still lurks within it to trap further. But older beings, already degraded, have continuously been about to help newer beings to go downhill. Each Thetan had his own “Home Universe” and these colliding or made to collide, probably are the physical universe. But of this origin and these intentions we are not at this time certain. It is enough for us to resolve the problem of the aberrative nature of this universe and provide a technology which assuages that aberration and keeps one abreast of it. This is prac-tical and we can already do it. Further insight into the problem will be a further bonus. And further data is already in view.

THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HANDLING THE TIME TRACK Although finding and curtailing the development of the time track at genus is not im-probable, the ability of the preclear to attain it early on is questionable without reducing the charge on the existing track. Therefore, any system which reduces the charged condition of the time track without reducing but increasing the awareness and decisionability of the pre-clear is valid processing. Any system which seeks to handle the charge but reduces the pre-clear’s awareness and decisionability is not valid processing but is degrading. According to early axioms, the single source of aberration is time. Therefore any sys-tem which further confuses or overwhelms the preclear’s sense of time will not be beneficial. Thus the first task of the student of engram running is to master the handling of time on the preclear’s time track. It must be handled without question, uncertainty or confusion. Failing to handle the time in the pc’s time track with confidence, certainty and without error will result in grouping or denying the time track to the pc. The prime source of ARC break in engram running sessions is bypassing charge by time mishandling by the auditor. As a subhead under this, taking and trying to run incidents which are not basic on a chain constitute an error in time and react on the pc like bypassed RIs or GPMs. An ARC break-less session requires gentle accurate time scouting, the selection of the earliest timed incident available and the accurate time handling of the incident as it is run. There are only a few reasons why some cannot run engrams on pcs. These are: 1. Q and A with the pain and unconsciousness of incidents; 2. Failing to handle the time track of the pc for the pc; 3. Failure to understand and handle time."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING 2 HCOB 8.6.63R BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HSDC    212    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 2 and 3 are much the same. However, there are three ways to move a time track about: (a) By Significance (the moment something was considered); (b) By Location (the moment the pc was located somewhere); (c) By Time alone (the date or years before an event or years ago). You will see all three have time in common. “The moment when you thought ______” “The moment you were on the cliff _____“ “Two years before you put your foot on the bot-tom step of the scaffold” are all dependent on time. Each designates an instant on the time track of which there can be no mistake by either auditor or pc. The whole handling of the time track can be done by any one of these three methods, Significance, Location, Time. Therefore all projectionist work is done by the Time of Significance, the Time of Lo-cation or Time alone. The track responds. Those auditors who have trouble cannot grasp the totality and ac-curacy and speed of that response. The idiotic and wonderful precision of the time track de-feats the sloppy and careless. They wonder if it went. They question the pc’s being there. They fumble about until they destroy their command over the time track. “Go to 47,983,678,283,736 years 2 months, 4 days I hour and six minutes ago.” Well, a clear statement of it, unfumbled, will cause just that to happen. The tiniest quiver of doubt, a fumble over the millions and nothing happens. Fumbled dating gets no dates. One must date boldly with no throat catches or hesita-tions. “More than 40,000? Less than 40,000?” Get it the first read. Don’t go on peering my-opically at the meter asking the same question the rest of the session. Accurate, bold, rapid. Those are the watchwords of dating and time track handling. In moving a time track about, move only the track. Don’t mix it and also move the pc. You can say “Move to .” You don’t have to say (but you can) “The somatic strip will move to .” But never say “You will move to .” And this also applies to present time. The pc won’t come to present time. He’s here. But the time track will move to the date of present time unless the pc is really stuck. In getting a pc to present time (unimportant in modern engram running) say “Move to (date month and year of PT).” In scouting you always use To. “Move To .” In running an engram or whatever, you always use through. “Move through the incident .” If an auditor hasn’t a ruddy clue about the time track and its composition, he or she won’t ever be able to run engrams. So, obviously, the first thing to teach and have passed in engram running is time track composition. When the auditor learns that, he or she will be able to run engrams. If the auditor does not know the subject of the time track well, then he or she can’t be taught to run engrams, for no rote commands that cover all cases can exist. You couldn’t teach the handling of a motion picture projector by rote commands if the operator had never imagined the existence of film. An auditor sitting there thinking the pc is doing this or that and being in a general fuddle about it will soon have film all over the floor and"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING 3 HCOB 8.6.63R BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HSDC    213    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE wrapped about his ears. His plea for a rote command will just tangle up more film so long as he doesn’t know it is film and that he, not the preclear, is handling it. If an auditor can learn this, he will then be able to learn to run those small parts of the time track called engrams. If an auditor can’t run a pc through some pleasant time track flaw-lessly, he or she sure can’t run a pc through the living lightning parts of that track called en-grams. An auditor who cannot handle the time track smoothly can scarcely call himself an auditor as that’s all there is to audit besides postulates, no matter what process you are using, no matter what process you invent and even if you tried what is laughingly called a “bio-chemical approach” to the mind. There’s only a time track for the bios to affect. There’s a thetan, there’s a time track. The thetan gets caught in the time track. The job of the auditor is to free the theta n by digging him out of his time track. So if you can’t handle what you’re digging a thetan out of, you’re going to have an awful lot of landslides and a lot of auditing loses for both you and preclears. Invent games, devices, charts and training aids galore and teach with them and you’ll have auditors who can handle the time track and run engrams. CHARGE AND THE TIME TRACK Charge, the stored quantities of energy in the time track, is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track. When this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track. This is the State of Case Scale. (All levels given are major levels. Minor levels exist between them.)

Level (4) Invisible Track (Black or Invisible Field.) — Very heavily charged areas exist. Level (5) Dub-In — Some areas of track so heavily charged pc is below consciousness in them. Level (6) Dub-In of Dub-In — Many areas of track so heavily charged, the dub-in is submerged. Level (7) Only Aware of Own Evaluations — Track too heavily charged to be viewed at all. Level (8) Unaware — Pc dull, often in a coma. On this new scale the very good, easy to run cases are at Level (3). Skilled engram running can handle down to Level (4). Engram running is useless from Level (4) down. Level (4) is questionable. Level (1) is of course an OT. Level (2) is the clearest Clear anybody ever heard of. Level (3) can run engrams. Level (4) can run early track engrams if the running is skilled. (Level (4) includes the Black V case.) Level (5) has to be run on general ARC processes. Level (6) has to be run carefully on special ARC processes with lots of havingness. Level (7) responds to the CCHs. Level (8) responds only to reach and withdraw CCHs. Pre-Dianetic and Pre-Scientology mental studies were observations from Level (7) which considered Levels (5) and (6) and (8) the only states of case and oddly enough over-looked Level (7) entirely, all states of case were considered either neurotic or insane, with sanity either slightly glimpsed or decried. In actuality on some portion of every time track in every case you will find each of the levels except (I) momentarily expressed. The above scale is devoted to chronic case level and is useful in programming a case. But any case for brief moments or longer will hit these levels in being processed. This is the temporary case level found only in sessions on chronically higher level cases when they go through a tough bit. Thus engram running can be seen to be limited to higher level cases. Other processing, notably modern ARC processes, moves the case up to engram running. Now what makes these levels of case?"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING 5 HCOB 8.6.63R BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HSDC    215    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE It is entirely charge. The more heavily charged the case, the lower it falls on the above scale. It is charge that prevents the pc from confronting the time track and submerges the time track from view. Charge is stored energy or stored or recreatable potentials of energy. The E-Meter registers charge. A very high or low tone arm, a sticky or dirty needle, all are registrations of this charge. The “chronic meter of a case” is an index of chronic charge. The fluctuations of a meter during a session are registering relative charge in different por-tions of the pc’s time track. More valuably the meter registers released charge. You can see it blowing on the me-ter. The disintegrating RR, the blowing down of the TA, the heavy falls, the loosening needle all show charge being released. The meter registers charge found and then charge released. It registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight, by DN, by a climbing TA or a TA going far below the clear read. Then as this cleans up, the charge is seen to “blow.” Charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to “charge up,” in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc. The whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing. When PRIOR charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown, we get “ARC breaks.” The State of Case, the chronic level, as given on the above scale, is the totality of charge on the case. Level (1) has no charge on it. Level (8) is total charge. The day to day condition of a case, its temper, reaction to things, brightness, depends upon two factors, (a) the totality of charge on the case and (b) the amount of charge in restimulation. Thus a case being processed varies in tone by (a) the totality of charge remaining on the case (b) the amount of charge in restimulation and (c) the amount of charge blown by processing. Charge is held in place by the basic on a chain. When only later than basic incidents are run charge can be restimulated and then bottled up again with a very small amount blown. This is known as “grinding out” an incident. An engram is getting run, but as it is not basic on a chain, no adequate amount of charge is being released. Later than basic incidents are run either (a) to uncover more basic (earlier) incidents or (b) to clean up the chain after basic has been found and erased. No full erasure of incidents later than basic is possible, but charge can be removed from them providing they are not ground out but only run lightly a time or two and then an earlier incident on the chain found and similarly run. When the basic is found it is erased by many passes over it. Basic is the only one which can be run many times. The later the incident is (the further from basic) the more lightly it is run . There is no difference in the technology required to run a basic or a later incident. It is only the number of times through that differs. Basic is run through many times. A somewhat later engram is run through a couple of times. An engram very late on the chain is gone through once. Otherwise all engrams whether basic or not are run exactly the same."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING 6 HCOB 8.6.63R BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HSDC    216    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Engrams are run to release charge from a case. Charge is not released to cure the body or to cure anything physical and the meter cures nothing. Charge is released entirely to return to a thetan his causation over the time track, to restore his power of choice, and to free him of his most intimate trap, his own time track. You cannot have decent, honest or capable beings as long as they are trapped and overwhelmed. While this philosophy may be contrary to the intentions of a slavemaster or a degrader it is nevertheless demonstrably true. The universe is not itself a trap capable only of degradation. But beings exist who, beaten and overwhelmed themselves, can utilize this universe to degrade others. The mission of engram running is to free the charge which has accumulated in a being and so restore that being to appreciated life. All cases, sooner or later, have to be run on engrams, no matter what else has to be done. For it is in engrams that the bulk of the charge on the time track lies. And it is therefore those parts of the time track called engrams which overwhelm the thetan. These contain pain and unconsciousness and are therefore the record of moments when a thetan was most at ef-fect and least at cause. In these moments then the thetan is least able to confront or to be causative. The engram also contains moments when it was necessary to have moved and most degrading to have held a position in space. And the engram contains the heaviest ARC break with a thetan’s environment and other beings. And all these things add up to charge, an impulse to withdraw from that which can’t be withdrawn from or to approach that which can’t be approached, and this, like a two pole battery, generates current. This constantly generated current is chronic charge. The principal actions are: (a) When the attention of the thetan is directed broadly in the direction of such a track re-cord the current increases. (b) When the attention is more closely (but not forcefully) and accurately directed, the current is discharged. (c) When the basic on the chain is found and erased, that which composes the poles them-selves is erased and later incidents eased, for no further generation is possible by that chain and it becomes incapable of producing further charge to be restimulated. The above are the actions which occur during auditing. If these actions do not occur de-spite auditing, then there is no case betterment, so it is the auditor’s responsibility to make sure they do occur. As the time track is created by an involuntary response of the thetan, it is and exists as a real thing, composed of space, matter, energy, time and significance. On a Level (8) Case the time track is completely submerged by charge even down to a total unawareness of thought itself. At Level (7) awareness of the track is confined by extant charge to opinions about it. At Level (6) charge on the track is such that pictures of pictures of the track are gra-tuitously furnished, causing delusive copies of inaccurate copies of the track. At Level (5) charge is sufficient to cause only inaccurate copies of the track to be viewable. At Level (4)"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUNNING 7 HCOB 8.6.63R BY CHAINS BULLETIN 2 HSDC    217    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE charge is sufficient to obscure the track. At Level (3) charge is sufficient to wipe out portions of the track. At Level (2) there is only enough charge to maintain the existence of the track. At Level (1) there is no charge and no track to create it. All charge from Level (1) and up into higher states that is generated is knowingly generated by the thetan, whose ability to hold lo-cations in space and poles apart results in charge as needful. This would degenerate again as he put such matters on automatic or began once more to make a time track, but these actions alone are not capable of aberrating a thetan until he encounters further violent degradation and entrapment in the form of implants. Aberration itself must be calculated to occur. The existence of a time track only makes it possible for it to occur and be retained. Thus a thetan’s first real mistake is to consider his own pictures and their recorded events important, and his second mistake is in not obliterating entrapment activities in such a way as not to become entrapped or aberrated in doing so, all of which can be done and should be. Engram running is a step necessary to get at the more fundamental causes of a time track and handle them. So it is a skill which must be done and done well. L.

This was the “Overt-Motivator sequence of Engrams”. An Overt, in Dianetics and Scientology, is an aggressive or destructive act by the in-dividual against one or another of the 8 dynamics (self, family, group, Mankind, animals or plants, MEST, Life or the Infinite). A Motivator is an aggressive or destructive act received by the person or one of the dynamics. The viewpoint from which the act is viewed resolves whether the act is an overt or a motivator. The reason it is called a “Motivator” is because it tends to prompt that one pays it back – it “motivates” a new overt. When one has done something bad to someone or something one tends to believe it must have been “motivated”. When one has received something bad, he also may tend to feel he must have done something to deserve it. The above points are true. The actions and reactions of people on the subject are often very falsified. People go about believing they were in an auto accident when in actual fact they caused one. Also people may believe they caused an accident when they were only in one. Some people, on hearing of a death, at once believe they must have killed the person even though they were far away. Police in large cities have people turn up and confess to almost every murder as a rou-tine."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"OVERT-MOTIVATOR SEQUENCE  2  HCOB  20.5.68  HSDC    220    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE One doesn’t have to be crazy to be subject to the Overt-Motivator sequence. It is not only used on him continually by others, it also is a basic part of his own “case”. There are two extreme stages of Overt-Motivator phenomena. One is a person who gives up only motivators (always done to him) and the other is the person who “has done only overts” (done to others). In running engrams you will find 1. All overt engrams that hang up (won’t audit easily) have also a motivator engram as the same or different incident. 2. All motivator engrams that hang up have an overt engram in the same or different in-cident. The two types of engrams then are Overt Engrams and Motivator Engrams. Example of Overt Engram – shooting a dog. Example of Motivator Engram – being bitten by a dog. The rule is that the subject matter must be similar. They can be in different points in time. When you can’t run out (erase) a dog bite engram, why then you find the “shoot dog” engram. Psychosomatic ills or aberrations that do not resolve by running one side, usually resolve by finding and running the other. When you can’t erase an engram about shooting a dog, why then there’s a bitten by dog. It’s all very simple really. There are always two sides to the coin. If one won’t run, you try the other. BASICS Finding the basic engram on a chain also applies to finding the basic overt or basic motivator engram. Engrams then hang up (won’t run out) when (a) The other type needs to be run and (b) The one found has earlier engrams on it. NONEXTANT ENGRAMS An “engram” sometimes didn’t exist. A pc can be trying to run being run over by a car when he never was. What needs to be done, when the incident won’t run, is get the pc’s inci-dent of running over somebody. It also works in reverse.

So both engrams can exist and be run or only one side exists and can be run or with a heavy foul-up on overts and motivators, one side can be non-factual and won’t run because only the other side exists. It is easy to visualize this as a matter of flows. An overt of course is an Outflow and a motivator is an Inflow. SECONDARIES It may never have been said that secondaries always sit squarely on incidents of actual pain and unconsciousness. Also secondaries can exist on the overt-motivator sequence pattern just as in engrams. This is the cause of frozen emotions or “unemotional” people. Also some people com-plain they can’t feel anymore. This works out by overt-motivator sequence. A person in grief over loss (grief is al-ways loss) who then can’t run it has caused grief and that overt-secondary can be run. Also a person misemotional over causing grief has been caused grief. It works both ways with all points on the tone scale. The last is a newer discovery and wasn’t known to early Dianeticists. The Overt-Motivator Engram phenomena did not receive adequate dissemination. The principle applied to secondaries has not before been released. It is basically Dianetic Engram running that resolves all cases in the end so one had better be pretty good at auditing Engrams and Secondaries, Motivator and Overt both. L.

If a mental image picture goes more solid on the second pass through, an earlier simi-lar incident must be found. Eventually you will find a basic incident that will erase. It will be the earliest on the chain. Follow the somatic, not the narrative content. If handling an assessed headache you ask for “an earlier headache or head pain”. Don’t ask for narrative chains such as “an earlier fight with your mother”. The rule is invariable – if it isn’t erasing or is going more solid after twice through get an earlier incident relating to the assessed somatic and run it. This was a very essential part of R-3-R but was somehow omitted from some descrip-tions of the procedure. L.

Auditor says, “Is it erasing?” Pc can’t feel somatic so he says, “It’s gone.” Auditor puzzled by no F/N but buys it. What you want to know as an auditor is “Is the picture erasing?” You can use that line to check, but not habitually. ____________________ Erasure depends in some measure on the pc getting to the beginning of the incident. Sometimes the pc keeps starting a bit late in the incident and so does not get an erasure. If you assess an item like “Dizziness after an operation” and try to run it the pc will bog utterly as the whole operation precedes the somatic called for and not only won’t erase but also won’t show as a picture. Trying to run a somatic like “my mother’s hitting me” is a narrative incident not a so-matic. It won’t erase because you can’t go earlier on the somatic as it’s not named. There’s probably a whole chain on “a stinging face” and chains are connected by somatic, not narra-tive or the same people or incident type. Feeling makes the chain. Only chains of feelings (pains, sensations, misemotions, etc) uniformly go down to a basic that will erase. L.

Cease to audit suddenly with the pc down the track somewhere. 2. Make a sudden evaluative remark in the middle of the session. 3. React or comment adversely on what the pc is running such as being critical of the pc for having such an incident. 4. Force a pc to go on when he doesn’t want to. These mess up pcs quite badly and give them a great deal of trouble afterwards. Over the years these four actions have been observed being done from time to time by persons trying to audit in Dianetics. They are just as bad in Scientology but oddly, I don’t recall them being done in Scientology, only Dianetics. Example of 1: Auditor fails to give next command or any further commands and leaves pc hanging. Example of 2: “Are you really interested in this session or not?” Example of 3: “That was a horrible thing to do.” Example of 4: “Go ahead. Get into it,” after pc has asked to stop. There are countless variations of these. In 1 the pc volunteers it’s all sort of unreal in the incident so the auditor, instead of TR 4, just ends session. These are very bad things to do. They don’t kill anybody. But they surely make pcs less auditable. L.

A. He can grind and grind and grind (ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, on and on) with the TA going up up up and never once tell the pc to go earlier. B. He can watch the TA come down to between 2 and 3 and go loose on the last incident run, ask the pc „erase or solid” get a non-committal answer and send the pc earlier. He can keep sending the pc earlier and earlier on another chain without ever noticing he’s finished the first chain. These are the two extreme cases. In Case A it is obvious from TA rise that the chain has an earlier incident. In Case B it is obvious from the TA that the chain erased. In A the student is preventing the pc from going earlier when he should. In B the student is forcing the pc to go earlier when he shouldn’t. In both cases the student hasn’t a clue of what an engram chain is. ____________________ It is marvelous how students demand „the exact phrase” to use as an effort to avoid having to really understand what he is doing in auditing. If a student hasn’t a clue about what he is doing then a thousand goofy outnesses will keep cropping up, each one requiring (a Supervisor thinks) a special instruction. After a while you get a course text weighing one ton, and all because the student didn’t grab the basic defi-nitions in the first place. A student who will do either A or B above has not grasped that an engram chain is held in place by the basic for that chain and that basic is the first time and that the clue to erasure is unburdening down to first time and erasing first time and that all picture chains are there because the first time is there. The student assumes one always asks „solid or erasing”. Or that one always does only what the pc says. Or some such consideration."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO ERASE 2 HCOB 28.5.69 HSDC    230    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE I would damned well never ask „solid or erasing” if I saw the TA start to climb. I would know the TA measured mental mass and that it was accumulating and wouldn’t erase. I’d just ask for an earlier incident. Honest, it’s awful easy. ____________________ A very odd outness a student will encounter when he is so dedicated to the exact words is the fast pc who erases before he can tell about it. Along about no. 3 of R3R the TA blows down and the needle F/Ns. A student who knew his business by understanding would ask, „Did it erase?” of course. The pc would say, „It vanished,” and VGIs would come in. A fast running pc on a light chain can occasionally blow an engram by inspection. If it was basic for that chain, one would be committing the crime described in B above. The pc is likely to go into another chain or a heavy protest. So you see, there’s no substitution for actually understanding what’s going on. There’s the pc, there’s the bank, there’s the meter needle, there’s the meter tone arm and there’s the auditor, there’s the procedure, there’s the report. That’s all the parts there are to a session. When one understands each one, one can audit. When one doesn’t understand some part of any of the above, he will require unusual solutions. Anything truly powerful is truly simple. So a student who goofs is being complex and hasn’t understood something about one of the major parts named above. I just saw a goofed-up session that went like this: PC: It (the engram) happened every day for three days. AUDITOR: ABCD. Flunk. The auditor was so deficient in knowing about chains and first time that he didn’t tell the pc to go to the first day’s engram but let the poor pc flounder in day 3! And so the chain did not erase and the pc hung up in it. If the rule of first time is really understood, one would realize a lot of things, even that the pc was beginning an incident half way through it and hadn’t begun to run the beginning of it so of course, no erasure.

The auditor’s problem is to tell which it is. Really it isn’t much of a problem. Almost all of the time C is the case. One just does Standard Dianetics – list, assess-ment, R3R, and you eventually get an erasure of the basic of the chain, with an F/N, VGIs and a cognition.

NARRATIVE CHAINS OF EXCESSIVE LENGTH These are by repeating story. By incident description. There may be 40 billion times his shoe pinched. Example: “Feeling like a shoe pinching me.” The chain is endless. On the same so-matic list was “A painful foot.” This, being a somatic, permits you to get to a basic.

But now and then there is only one incident and it never arrives at any basic. Or there are so many similar incidents you go on for days!

Never prepcheck an item that doesn’t read. These rules hold good for all lists, all items, even Dianetics. A „tick” or a „stop” is not a read. Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown (of TA). A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read or prepchecking or running an item that doesn’t read. On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens: The List is „Who or what would fly kites?” The C/S has said to „List this to a BD F/N Item”. So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a „Dead horse list” because it gave no item. The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4 on the pc to correct the situation and gets „Unnecessary action”. On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4 or any subse-quent issue of it. If you extend a „dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it will set it right. This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list „Who or what would kill buffa-loes?” The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item „A Hunter”. The C/S also says to list as a second action „Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Had he tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, „A mean hunter”. It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item „A mean hunter” is a wrong item as it is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unneces-sary action and a wrong item.

In actual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it. But an item that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank.

Always test an item for read before prepchecking or running recall or engrams. Always mark the read an item gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet.

There are many many such Scientology actions which the Dianetic Auditor will learn how to do when he studies to become a Scientology class auditor.

Situation: No item on the Health Form or list now reads, one or more have been run, the pc still has symptoms that are on the list. But they won’t read. Solution: The DN auditor nulls by suppress “button” and if needed, the invali-date button. This is normally called “getting in the suppress button” or “getting in the invalidate button”. It is called button because when you push it (say it) you can get a meter reaction. In Scientology, this is called “Nulling by suppress”. All right, the list comes out all X – nothing reading.

Auditor, reading an apparently null list: “On the item ‘dizzy feeling’ has anything been invalidated?” ”On the item ‘sore feet’ has anything been invalidated? That reads.” PC: “Yes, because it didn’t read in the first place.” “Sore feet. That reads. Are you interested in running that item?” PC: “Yes!” So the auditor runs R3R. As you will learn in Scientology, when the pc suppresses or invalidates something, the read transfers to suppress or invalidate, whichever they did. Suppress or invalidate now read, the item itself doesn’t until one puts the button (suppress or invalidate) in. Don’t let a Dianetic pc off auditing just because his unrun list items won’t read on the meter. Get in Suppress and Invalidate on the items as above. It is a rapid action, not two way comm between items. You ask the meter, not the pc. Hope this helps. L.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says, “Your needle is float-ing.” This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the sub-ject of “Floating Needles”. A lot of by-passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called end phenomena. End phenomena is defined as “those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended”. It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended. 1. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 2 HCOB 20.2.70 HSDC    246    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE But that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating nee-dle. If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know – so that’s . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t ap-pear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’s pre-mature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition. C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N van-ished and TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a begin-ning F/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a false report if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 20.2.70 HSDC    247    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changed to read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problem is not difficult. I follow this rule – I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we are han-dling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the next command due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure or Release, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Your needle is floating.” DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon. The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an era-sure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientol-ogy as a problem than to Dianetics."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 4 HCOB 20.2.70 HSDC    248    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE But ALL auditors must realize that the end phenomena of successful auditing is not just an F/N but has 3 more requisites.

Trying to run an item that didn’t read on being given or when being called. As the chain is not charged it will be hard if not impossible to run. BD items are of course the very best and almost always erase very easily. 2. Starting a new session with a new item with the TA way way up. To play it safe in Dianetic auditing (it can be handled in Scientology) the Dianetic auditor who starts a session and a new action at the same time with the TA high is very foolish. It may not be high on what the auditor is now newly trying to run. The correct action is not to start the session. Just end off with no auditing done. When the TA has settled down on another day (3 days to 10 days later) begin your new action. The pc is ill or is having trouble in life. If you were running a chain in the last session and continue it in the next, disregard the high TA. A way to get around this is get some new items from the high TA pc and take one that blows down well and you can probably bring it off. Saf-est is don’t audit a high TA pc unless to repair an unflat chain (or to run Exterioriza-tion RD). This rule is variable. But you should know it is risky to audit a new item taken from an earlier list when the pc comes into session with a high TA as it may not be high on what you are about to run and so you may get no F/N. The only remedy is to get new items and choose a BD one (or to turn the pc over to a Scientology auditor to assess a Hi-Lo TA list and handle). 3. Running a narrative item can lead to no F/N. (A Narrative Item describes only one possible incident, i.e. “dropping an ironing board on my foot” = no chain = possible no F/N.) 4. Running a pc who has exteriorized in auditing on something other than an Exterioriza-tion RD will produce a high TA and no F/N in the session. After Ext RD has been run anything can be run. 5. Probably the WORST blunder is failing to ask for ABCD again when the pc says “It’s erased” but the TA is still high. This is really a corny error. TA 4.9. Pc says, “It’s erased! All blank now,” and the auditor fails to ask ABCD once more. There is a mo-ment when the pc’s NOT-IS of the picture squeezes it into invisibility. The mass of it is still there. It takes just one or two more passes to get the BD and F/N. It’s up to the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" HSDC    258    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE auditor not to let the pc go without that additional ABCD. Then the BD and F/N hap-pen with Cog and VGIs. This error is more common than one would think. 6. Failure to ask for the Earlier Beginning will also cause a long grind (ABCD over and over) and no F/N. 7. Of course, not asking for an Earlier Incident mentioning the same item will also cause a grind and no F/N. When the item isn’t also mentioned in the command the pc can jump chains. And if the Earlier Beginning is not asked for at all of course there will be no F/N. 8. Auditing a pc under protest will cause the TA to stay up and no F/N. The skilled Dianetic Auditor knows these things cold and does not make these errors. Thus he gets his end of session F/N regularly and gets F/N at the Examiner as well when the case has had a few sessions. L.

A Cramming Officer or Supervisor can achieve a remarkable result by making an Auditor get the why of each R3R Dianetic command from the original materials. The following development and use of this Cramming technique by Mike Mauerer fol-lows: “CASE HISTORY” “George Baillie, a Flag Interne, working on his Dianetics OK to Audit, was ordered to study the 1963 Dn HCO Bs (“Time Track and Engram Running by Chains” Bulletins, Bulle-tins 1 and 2). He read the HCO Bs but had not studied them vigorously enough and for appli-cation. “As Interne Supervisor I worked with him covering these HCO Bs and Original The-sis. During the course of this action many confusions (primarily roteness) were handled. Among them were things like ‘What is the purpose of Step 6 of R3R, “What do you see?” ‘ He had previously thought it was to ‘orient’ the Pc to the incident or some such, but basically it came down to the fact he had never worked out the purpose of the command as related to the mechanics of the bank and time track. After some working he finally got the fact that Command 4 (duration) is to turn on the visio and that before moving the Pc through the inci-dent one would have to know the Pc had visio so he could move through. Conversely, if the picture was not ‘turned on’ then the duration would have to be corrected. Another was the Step 3 Command (Move to that incident) on which the Interne thought that by repeating the auditing command when the Pc ‘couldn’t get there’ you would handle the time track. This of course is failure to handle an origination and failure to handle time for the Pc. He finally real-ized that obviously the Pc didn’t have the correct date in the first place and it is the Auditor’s action to find and get the correct date and thus move the somatic strip to that incident."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"R3R COMMANDS HAVE BACKGROUND DATA 2 HCOB 27.1.74 HSDC    262    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE “Each command of R3R was taken up and its purpose demo’d out against the basic definitions and mechanics of the time track. One other of the things discovered by this Interne was that Command Nine (What happened?) has a purpose of running out the Locks created in PT, in session, by virtue of the fact that you’re reminding the Pc of Secondaries and Engrams right there! (This is of course covered in Original Thesis.) “Probably the most stunning and revealing thing covered was the fact that in Original Thesis Chapter ‘Exhaustion of Engrams’, para 3, it says, ‘The principle of recounting is very simple. The preclear is merely told to go back to the beginning and to tell it all over again. He does this many times. As he does it the engram should lift in tone on each recounting. It may lose some of its data and gain other. If the Preclear is recounting in the same words time after time, it is certain that he is playing a memory record of what he has told you before. He must then be sent immediately back to the actual engram and the somatics of it restimulated. He will then be found to somewhat vary his story. He must be returned to the consciousness of somatics continually until these are fully developed, begin to lighten and are then gone.’ This of course totally invalidates the use of a completely rote system and requires an understanding of what is happening to the Pc, bank, etc. “Needless to say, this Interne went through many changes, now feels in comm with his Pcs and not ‘stuck’ to some rote procedure which truly inhibits the real gains to be gotten from Dianetics Engram Running. As evidence to this action and its resultant gains in the In-terne’s ability to audit, the following is a brief description of a case he audited today applying 1963 engram running and Original Thesis to these cases. “Case has run many hours of Dianetics with a hidden standard to do with his hand. Has been trying since earliest Dianetic sessions to get this handled. The somatic had been addressed by many different wordings and many chains but had never blown, yet chains had apparently gone to EP. The Auditor was C/Sed to find the actual somatic and run it out. It was found in session that the somatic had been run out to ‘EP’ so an L3B was done. From the L3B the Auditor found it was one incident in restim and proceeded to flatten the somatic chain connected with it. During this the Auditor on occasion had to correct three dates and two du-rations, but the spectacular part was Pc began on Steps 9 and D to say the same thing regard-ing incident each time. This being indicative of Pc running a memory record, Auditor moves Pc to the actual Engram, somatics intensify and then blow (for the first time), Pc exterior with VVGIs. Exam result is quite spectacular. “All the above serves to once again validate the results of the Dianetics materials when they are applied in full.” L.

The Dianetic Program has been a very fast action. Rather typically Sea Org. A few weeks ago – a very few weeks ago – using volunteer auditors, most of whom had had only HDA training, we began to check up as to the workability of Dianetics for very broad release. The information had come to us that Dianetics was not being greatly used. Actually, had fallen out of use. Now, the only way anything could fall out of use, if it were being misused, or someone didn’t understand exactly what it was for. On the road to Clear, individuals have a tendency to jump all the stepping stones. Therefore, do not be surprised if they often fall in the brook. [laughter] The first stepping stone on the road to Clear and OT was and is Dianetics. There have been many breakthroughs in Dianetics. In the earliest days, it was not uncommon for people to roll up hundreds of hours of auditing. Those same results, and better results by far than these, can be achieved today in only five or six hours of auditing. I don’t say that only five or six hours of auditing totally ends the gains to be found in Dianetics, because the actual truth of the matter is the gains obtainable in Dianetics today are far superior to the gains which were uniformly attainable yesterday. In other words, the speed of the subject has been enor-mously increased. That’s important, because in the early days, people could go on for hun-dreds of hours. The workability of the subject has been enormously increased, in terms of the gain per individual: how much gain could be obtained in Dianetics. And also, in addition to that, the way that Dianetics is now applied has been so greatly simplified that it is very diffi-cult not to get results with Dianetics. A fellow really has to try. [laughter] There have been several breakthroughs over the years, and there has been a recent breakthrough which has made this new action as effective as it has been, and that is what started, to tell the truth, the actual “Let’s export Dianetics” campaign in the Sea Org. And that was that chains, which is to say the mental image pictures that a being has, are united and held together by somatics, which is to say aches and pains and misemotions. Now, that was a breakthrough, because previously we used to audit narrative. The last time your mother spanked you, the first time your mother spanked you, let’s find some other earlier time when your mother spanked you, cannot we find some time when somebody spanked you... narra-tive. And that goes on, and on, and on. But the mind tends to find that interesting, and pleas-ant – or unpleasant – and may attribute to all the times their mother spanked them, they at-tribute to that all the difficulty they’re now having."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 2 29.5.69 HSDC    268    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So they will very happily run: “Well let’s see, you don’t drive a car well. Very good. Now let’s run out all the times when you had a car accident of some kind or another. Very good.” And we run car accidents, and car accidents, and car accidents. Well unfortunately, a thetan has been on the track and has been living for a long time [laughter]. And the number of car accidents which are available to be run out are almost infinite. So the breakthrough of 1969 was the discovery that Dianetics was, as it started to be, a somatic or physical activity: it is simply the somatics, or the pictures, which an individual has, united by somatics which bring about the chain which is bothering him. And if you go down the somatic chain, it is very rapid, it’s very quick. There’ll be two, three, four, five incidents, bang, you’re right there at basic, zong zong – erased. Now, this makes it very interesting. The way we started this pro-gram – even those here may not be fully aware of this – was I got a few auditors on the ship who had had some training in old HDA work. And without advising them of anything, I set them to work. They are not necessarily the auditors who were trained and who are going out on this program. And that was a research activity, and I want to thank those preclears who suffered through that [laughter]. And so through their endeavours, we were able to put together the course as it now ex-ists, and we were able to stabilise this course, and as soon as we got it stabilised, we said “You, you, you... you and you and you, are about to save the planet.” And factually, that’s true. And then, in training those people, now training them for blood, why, we were able to bring them up to a point where they were getting very uniform results, and they could apply Dianetics in a very standard way. And so that we can say now there is such a thing as Stan-dard Dianetics. And the funny part of it is there are no variables in Standard Dianetics today. There are things you can do wrong – there are probably an infinity of things that you can do wrong but there is a very easily followed track through the middle of the morass, and it brings one through to the other side. So that is Standard Dianetics, and the advent of Standard Dianetics means a great deal. In the first place, it means that when somebody gets their certificate, he can audit. Do you understand: that’s what a certificate is. There are two qualifications to a Dianetics certifi-cate now. And those two qualifications are: has had case gains on Dianetics, and has been able to administer Dianetics so as to give case gains with it. And that is what a Dianetics audi-tor is. Is not somebody who has been through the checksheets a large number of times, or somebody who knows the Director of Certs and Awards [laughter]. And that is the tradition which we are beginning. Now there are actually, at this stage of the game, three Dianetic auditors. There is the Hubbard Dianetic Auditor, from way back and so on. There is no reason in particular to wipe out the certificate – the certificate is still valid. But that course has been taught for some time. It is not necessarily true that that person can audit Dianetics today, in comparison to the way Dianetics can be audited today. There is the next grade of auditor. He is the Hubbard Dianetic Counsellor. Now a Hubbard Dianetics Counsellor has received gains, can get gains, and is a fully trained auditor, but he is not a supervisor. Not a supervisor. He has not been trained to teach course. Therefore, as it now will be established, the Hubbard Dianetic Graduate is al-ways and uniformly trained in an official organisation. He is never trained in the field. Be-"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 3 29.5.69 HSDC    269    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE cause we have found that this is the frail point. So he is always trained in the organisation. He was trained to be an auditor – we don’t care where he was trained to be an auditor – he may have to be retrained a bit as an auditor and he certainly has to be fully trained as a course su-pervisor. And a Hubbard Dianetic Graduate is qualified to teach a course in Dianetics, and he has been trained very thoroughly in that line. And this is the way we’re going to keep this straight. So what we are actually graduating tonight are Hubbard Dianetic Graduates. And they’re going out to teach courses. And the auditors that they train, will in the largest percent-age, be Hubbard Dianetic Counsellors. And of them will not be required course supervision training. But a certain percentage of them will be pushed on through to a Hubbard Dianetic Graduate. Now a Hubbard Dianetic Graduate can go out to a Gung ho group, or a Dianetic Counselling Group – new phrase, new organisation – Dianetics is not a single man hanging out a shingle – a Dianetic Counselling Group, and will be able to train auditors if he is a Hub-bard Dianetic Graduate, and he will be able to audit preclears if he is a Hubbard Dianetic Counsellor. Now, that makes a great deal of sense. That means you're going to train a Hub-bard Dianetics Counsellor and he is going out and he’s going to try to audit somebody, and he’s going to do great, until he has to find a Scientology auditor to straighten up two or three flubs that have happened in the line up. And he’s going to know at that time this thing called a Hubbard Dianetic Counselling Group, that is to say a Dianetic Counselling Group, is really necessary to push him along, and a Dianetic Counselling Group consists of inflow, action, other Dianetic Counsellors, the ad-ministrative few people, even if only part time, to handle the admin of the unit, and a Hubbard Dianetic Graduate in order to teach Hubbard Dianetic Counsellors out in the field. And a Sci-entology auditor to hold down review. And that way we would get a minimum fall on the head. So therefore, a Hubbard Dianetic Counsellor ought to be given at least a short run-down of what a Dianetic Counselling Group is. Because if he goes out and tries to hang up his shingle and say that he is going to just audit people and audit people and audit people, I can tell you by experience his whole activity will go away and with the wind, it is no longer there. They blow away fast. I can even name you a country or two where two or three auditors with-out any idea of admin, without any idea of any qualifications actions or any repair actions went tearing into an area, got some gains on a majority of people, and then roughed up enough cases which they didn’t take care of, neglected their administration, didn't pay any attention to their PRO actions of any kind whatsoever, and muddied up the whole area. And then eventually they sort of went into a decline, and they didn’t know what was happening, and so they moved away and found another group to rough up. And that was a bad show. What they actually need, at least on a part-time basis, they need certain posts held. They need a registrar. They need somebody to answer the telephone. They need at least some version of Ethics. They need a PRO. They need these various little posts held. Now, if those posts are held, then the Hubbard Dianetic Graduate can go ahead and teach auditors, he can make Hubbard Dianetic Counsellors. There would be no lack of auditors. Soon as they start getting into hot water, they had certainly better send one of those auditors into an org to be"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 4 29.5.69 HSDC    270    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE trained fast, because they’re going to have to have a Scientology auditor sitting there in Qual to start patching up the cases which somehow or other didn’t come out right, do you follow? Now, if it is done that way, you’re going to find it growing and becoming very stable, and from the centre point of training in an org where you will be making Hubbard Dianetics Counsellors and Hubbard Dianetics Graduates, and eventually probable you practically do nothing but Hubbard Dianetic Graduates, there’ll be enough Dianetic Counsellor courses all over the place, and you have to pay attention to the fact that when you make a Hubbard Dianetic Graduate, you may have to retrain him a little bit. Maybe his training wasn't quite as sharp as it might have been. So you make sure he is a good auditor, and then you make a good Course Supervisor out of him, and then he can go out and make more auditors, and that hap-pens to be what the planet needs. Now what we’ve done, in actual fact, is make a major breakthrough in dissemination, and what I’m describing to you now is not so much the technology of what we’re doing. We take that for granted. What I’m describing to you is the technology of dissemination. There are something on the order of three billion sick human beings out there. It’s a very, very funny thing, but I think I have yet to find a well human being. It is the most remarkable thing you ever saw. I have been all over the world; I have studied twenty-one primitive cultures, including the American and English [laughter]. And in all that time I have never really found anybody who was well. They keep falling on their heads. They spend a childhood, which is happy amongst in-tervals of whooping cough, measles, scarlet fever, they go to school between pink eye, belly-aches, and just plain malingering-itis, and then they go to work, and when... And what’s most amazing is to read the letters of humanoids. It is very amazing. Particularly in the Bible belt or corn belt of the United States. If you read letters from those people, you will understand exactly what I mean. “Dear Bessy-Ann, George isn’t feeling well [laughter]. Aunt Mabel was just operated on for gallstones. [laughter] Bennie has taken up medicine. I don’t feel very well today, I keep getting these spells. Hoping you are the same.” [laughter and applause]. Now oddly enough, when somebody is this fixated upon his body, he is not likely to be very interested in his spirit. Therefore, my observation adds up to the fact there are about three billion sick human beings out there and it’s going to take an awful lot of auditors, and we never figured out before how to make that many auditors. Well, a Hubbard Dianetic Counsellor could probably be made in something on the order of – if you really pushed it home – he probably could be made in ten days – two weeks, something like that. Well, people can afford that much time. Now, those few that don’t make it in that length of time, we’ll keep them over a while. They’ll eventually make it, too. And you’ll make auditors. And if we consistently train the Hubbard Dianetic Graduates who teach the course in orgs and we keep the quality of that course up, then we’re not going to muddy up the environment with a bunch of unsolved cases, and if Dianetic auditing is done in a counselling group, why, how can you miss, how can you lose? Now, because there is a Scientology auditor sitting in this Dianetic Counselling Group, Scientology won’t drop out because it is quite obvious to one and all, all they way along the line that Scientology solves Dianetics. Dianetics is, in the main, miracu-"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 5 29.5.69 HSDC    271    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE lous. That’s miraculous, and here’s something that solves Dianetics. Do you follow? So you don’t have to do very much sales work. Now, that isn’t the only gain we have achieved here. We have achieved an entirely dif-ferent and new gain about which I have said very little. I have found out that individuals are sufficiently fixated upon their body somatics as to use the techniques designed to bring about spiritual freedom to solve their ingrown toenails. Do you talk about a sell-out? It’s a complete betrayal of the technology. Somebody gets up and he’s been ramming around and going into orgs and HGCs and so forth, and then we catch him at something on the order of OT II, and we read this and it says “he’s still trying to get rid of his injected eyeballs – he is gone to OT VI”, and “he’s gone to OT VI, and he doesn’t think he’s made it, because he still has a small rash on his nose, and he’s been trying ever since he got into an org to get rid of it,” and no-body here went out and told him “Why don't you put some salve on it, man?” [laughter]. Now what will immediately happen, as a result of this Dianetic Program is the individuals will be made into well, happy, human beings, and from that point, take off into their Grades and OT sections, and you will now really see something. People have been sort of standing around and wondering why we didn’t tip over the Empire State Building. Well, I, actually the Washington Monument’s what I had my eye on [laughter]. But they’ve been wondering what’s going on. Well, it’s actually because of an omitted Grade. And we taught the Class VIIIs that if you omit somebody’s Grades, he won’t make it. And what do you know, there was the biggest Grade of all had been omitted, and that was Dianetics. And with that Grade omitted, they weren’t making the Grade on up the line. Now you are going start to seeing people fly. You see? Now, the Graduates, here from the Flagship of the Sea Org at this time, could easily get very self-conscious and even nervous about the burden they carry and what is expected of them. But it isn’t very much, and I wish to put your mind at rest at it – all we expect you to do is convert the planet. [laughter, ap-plause] Well, we have the technology, you have the administrative know-how, we have orgs out there to back you up if we co-operate with a medical doctor, properly, I’m sure he will welcome us with open arms – I have had medical doctors time and time again trying to give me nine-tenths of their practice because they couldn’t do anything for them and were tired of them – literally true! – and you got the tech, all you have to do is make very sure when you train somebody to audit, before you put that certificate in his hand that you yourself are very satisfied that he himself has had case gains from Dianetics, and that he himself has brought about good case gains and can be counted on to do so in his preclears. And that when he tea-ches a course he knows that course well enough so that he doesn’t give opinions to make up for the fact he doesn’t know the dates of the bulletins. I made a breakthrough just a night or two ago. I found out that if the auditor was trained lightly, or slightly, on what bulletin what was in, sooner or later the course is going to go to pieces, because the student’s confidence in the course supervisor evaporates. Because he thinks that this instructor – this screwpervisor – is giving him opinions or is giving him new tech and he gets the idea there must be some hid-den data line. But if his course supervisor says to him “Oh, HCOB, 27 May, about the third"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 6 29.5.69 HSDC    272    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE paragraph, you’ll find the answer to that”, the student says “My God, this man knows his bu-siness. This is the straight dope!” and he takes it with confidence and goes out and get results. So a course supervisor is basically someone who in addition to his other duties can re-fer the person to the exact bulletin to get his information, and never tells him another thing. That gives you then the fact that a course supervisor is quite superior in his knowledge of the subject to the person who is simply auditing. But as long as you remember to turn out good course supervisors that can hit their data off one, two, three – they know exactly what it’s about – when those fellows fell out and teach auditors to audit you know there’s going to be results. Now, if the org is backing them up, they have a Gung Ho group, or a Dianetic Coun-selling Group is out there, you know very well that it’s going to get about 20 to 25% flunks, they are beyond the control of the auditor. A certain percentage of those, the fellow is all keyed in with lumbosis, and they’re simply handled by sending him to the medical doctor. And you say, “When you get rid of your lumbosis, come back for some auditing.” The remainder of those are composed of people who are in some sad effect from life ARC breaks, from some upper level put-together of some kind or another, or they’re a resis-tive case – something like this is what is wrong with them. And, what you have to do with one of those fellows is turn him over to a Scientology auditor. If you haven’t... If your Dianetics Counselling Group does not have a Scientology auditor, and so on, then that preclear should be sent to the nearest org, to the Qual of the nearest org, to be handled. And now about the highest level Scientology auditor that a Dianetic Counselling Group could count upon – about the highest one – would be maybe a IV. A Class IV. There’s nothing wrong with a Class IV. But what is going to happen is the Class IV, he’s going to handle a certain number of these cases and clean up the area to a certain degree, and then these backlog cases that didn’t get solved – there will be a few of them left – and the way you handle those is to make sure that you get a Saint Hill Graduate who is a Class VIII. Now those can be sent to the org until they get a Class VIII. In other words, we’ve got answers for it all the way up. As the area gets muddied up with a few cases that are unsolved, we start solving those cases with Dianetics and putting them back... or we start solving them... first we’re solving it with Dianetics. When it gets muddied up a bit – there are a few unsolvable cases – we solve those with Scientology and send them back to Dianetics, and when you didn’t have a high enough class of auditor in the area – it’ll narrow down and there’ll only be old Mrs Jones – and you could say, “Well, there’ll probably be a lot more old Mrs Joneses around,” before you finish up, you ought to have Class VIII in this area. And in that way, that’s true, you will cut it down to 100%. So we don’t expect a Dianetic auditor to be able to walk out there and do one hundred percent of his cases, because it isn’t a one hundred percent subject, it has to be backed up with Scientology, you see, but if it’s backed up by Scientology it becomes a hundred percentage subject, do you follow? So, we’ve got it very nicely worked out. We have an auditor who does not have to know every nicety, he doesn’t have to be trained for twelve years, he can get his job done, we can then back him up with somebody who can solve those he can’t solve, and then we can even go so far as to back that guy up with somebody who can solve the cases which a Scien-"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 7 29.5.69 HSDC    273    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE tology Class IV auditor can’t solve, do you get the idea? In other words, we can move it up the line. Now what’s going to happen all this time is you will see that in an area where you have good Dianetic gains, you will see people are very cheerful, industrious, happy and going around. You actually are going to change as new graduates go up, you are actually going to change the entire operating standards of every org you go into, you will change what they expect to have happen just by doing your job. It’s going to be so revelatory to these fellows, that you will be utterly fascinated. Now you’ll see gradually, day by day, some excitement build up on this – and if the excitement happens on staff, you will start seeing it happen in the area, and if it happens in the area I can assure you that it will happen in the world. The only thing we have been opposed by, all these years, is – and this sounds like a propaganda line – which it isn’t really – I finally isolated what it is all about – it is Russian mental technology. And they have moved that into every university there is. And it’s not a healing technology. It is a control technology. Psychology and psychiatry are control tech-nologies. Psychology and Psychiatry are control technologies. And that is all they are. And that’s why Mr Fat Cat, the “very best people,” the fascistically minded individual, sides – or the communistically minded or police state type individual – why, he sides at once with psy-chology and psychiatry. He is counting on those fellows to control the population, of which he is afraid. And these fellows are falling down on the job. As a matter of fact there is evidence to believe that in an area where you teach psychology, or where you teach psychiatry, you will get a revolt. And the revolts in every American university, in every Spanish university, Eng-lish, come about directly from having imported a Russian mental technology which will do nothing ever but brief revolt under the guise that it is controlling the population for the very best people. These are not healing technologies, so don’t listen for a moment. There has never been a time when a psychiatrist operating with that technology has ever resolved anything. In the whole world, there is not one case made well by psychiatry. There neither is one case made well by psychology. Psychoanalysis has a slightly better record, as you know that’s Austrian, eastern European, and occasionally some person has learned to live with his illness. [laughter] But what we’re going into is the fact that nobody thinks there is, or could be, a healing technology, because they have been lied to, they have been told these things are supposed to take care of these things. Psychology and psychiatry are supposed to have taken care of this, and the public at large thinks they mean that they’re supposed to heal things, and they’re not. They’re just supposed to keep somebody quiet. That’s in all their textbooks. The only reason they give people electric shocks... “Well, we gave him an electric shock, and he was quiet for three months! Didn’t make any move. No more things. Three months. Ha-ha. Gave him a Pre-frontal lobotomy, he never moved for the rest of his life!” [laughter] “We’re a success!” Now, we are a bona fide healing technology. We are not interested in control, we’re perforce more interested in helping people. We’re not interested in controlling them. And you really don't know with what resentment I have assumed any responsibility for controlling even an organisation. I don’t believe in it. I don’t believe in it. It doesn’t really add up to any-thing. I‘m taught the hard way, though, that if you don’t have a certain amount of ethics"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 8 29.5.69 HSDC    274    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE around, the staff members get knocked about by somebody who is enturbulating the area, and you’re going to find that, too. You can walk into a class, your heart is open, you’re all set, you’re going to teach these twenty-three fellows that you have in order – you’re going to teach them to audit. And then you run into... Mr. X. [laughter] And you find yourself in the position of the frog who climbed up three inches every night, and fell back four. [laughter] And you won’t be able to make it. You’ll find out all your good work’s being undone. This fellow’s going around, he’s wrecking cases, evaluating for people, jabbing at them “How do you know this stuff works?” [imitating sarcasm] “My brother’s a psychiatrist, and he says...” See? And no matter how kind-hearted you are, you are now put on a road to the left – you just go into total decay, the class goes all to pieces, you don’t make any auditors. You go to the right, you send for the Ethics Officer. And then you find out you can make some progress. And that is about the only reason I have ever gotten into control. Control itself can get out of hand very easily. You can over-control an area. You are going to start breaking auditors and people’s hearts and so forth, but that is only when control itself goes adrift and isn’t following its technology. And you will find sometime in an organisation that you have an Ethics Officer who hasn't a ruddy clue what the hell he is supposed to do. And it’s about that time that you go up and see the Executive Council and you say, “Your course ends tomorrow unless I get an Ethics Officer who knows his business today.” You mustn’t let it be used suppressively, but you will find out that you will have to use some of it just to get your job done. Well, I think, I think this is the launching of a very very successful program. I see nothing standing in its road of any kind whatsoever, the list of names which I see in front of me here as the first auditors, the first Hubbard Dianetic Graduates, I have every confidence in, and I’d be very happy to have any of them continue to audit for me. I am, as a matter of fact, just a little bit sad. I have sat up in my office every night now ever since this project began, weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks, working out of your sight, but not entirely out of your ken, and have managed to keep it sorted out and keep it C/Sed. I have found out uni-formly that a fellow who is going to turn in good sessions has a good grip on his material. And a fellow who doesn’t have a good grip on his material is not going to turn in good ses-sions. If I were going to do it again along this line, I would only let an auditor audit one ses-sion and let me look at it, before I let him audit three in a day that I got then a look at, because there’s no reason to ruin three pcs. A fellow knows and can do Dianetics as well as he himself has been through the materials, and as long as he himself is getting case gains, therefore the first class is rather difficult, because in that class you don't have a backlog of auditors who are racking up their auditing time. So it is very easy to keep a continuing class running and it is very hard just to take 25 people, teach them and somehow or another sort your way through to get enough case gains out of this, so that you make enough auditors who can do their job. Now on a continuing basis, I would let one auditor audit one PC, and I might even go so far as to, if I was really hedging my bets, let one auditor do one assessment, and then let me see it. And in that way I wouldn’t get any wrecked cases. And if he did that assessment the least bit woggle-boggle, he would go right back on the course for some more study. And that’s the way I would work it up. I wouldn’t specialise in bunging up cases, and then those auditors who have made it and are doing a good job are now, later on in the course, cleaning up those"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE DIANETICS PROGRAM 9 29.5.69 HSDC    275    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE who are lagging behind, and you eventually get this thing rolling in a sort of a cycle. You’ve got certain auditors to count on. Unfortunately tonight I'm loosing practically all of my audi-tors. What I do now I don’t know. I will send those that are still going through the course and so forth, for a polish up, and I’ll get them straight and they unfortunately have to be fired off practically at once. But again leaves with me no auditors. Somehow or another, though, I don’t think you will have much time to worry about the problems I’m having with this, be-cause those problems are about to be yours.

By “single” is meant “to self” Flow 1. This however eventually can result in a stuck flow. This is based on the fact that a flow which runs too long in one direction can “stick”. It will not flow longer in that one direction. It now has to have a reverse flow run. Thus one can run a single flow item after item. But after many items are run as single flows, a pc can get stuck and run poorly. The answer is to run Flows No. 2 and No. 3 on the same items already run in single flow. One must begin with the first item and run each item on Flows No. 2 and No. 3. Example: One ran the following items on a pc single flow (to self, Flow No. 1). • A sore jaw • Anger • A head pain • A dizzy feeling The pc seems to be doing all right but it is time to run the triples.

Pcs who drop back to a sick state during auditing must be run on the other two flows. In actual practice where a pc does not get well promptly he is given medical care as he was physically ill. Then he is given a Scientology Review (Green Form to F/N and any ses-sion repair and GF No. 40 and handle fully). Then HCOB 24 July 69. And then he is run on triples, putting in Flows No. 2 and No. 3 on all items run so far. Added to this Review can be what is known as Life Ruds and 3 S & Ds. Then and only then is the pc put back on Dianetics and all items are given Flows No. 2 and No. 3 and is run on triples thereafter. The above paragraph applies to any sick pc. The sequence of the actions in the above paragraph can be varied. One doesn’t just put in triples on the pc to “cure” him. Medical ac-tion and Scientology Review and the actions to handle a sick pc must be done. The point for this HCOB is that the pc must have all singles now done in triple and that all further items must then be done as triples. Since only one command in R3R varies in triples (see Issue II of this HCOB) any Dianetic auditor who has done a Starrated checkout on this HCOB and Issue II of this date can do Dianetic triples. Don’t get complex about it such as assessing for a Flow No. 3 or skipping around on a list or asking the pc’s permission or for his interest to do No. 2 and No. 3. It’s almost impos-sible to go wrong doing Flows No. 2 and No. 3. There aren’t any “special cases”. A Dianetic auditor should qualify for his HDC doing singles. There’s less chance of getting balled up. Or of pushing a wrong assessment. Where the pc has been run on a narrative item or a multiple item, skip it for triples. NECESSITY OF TRIPLES This is absolutely certain about triples: A pc must be run on Dianetic triples before he can be called a Dianetic completion.

This tells you that high TAs, heavy pressures and even illness can come from by-passed flows. BY-PASSED FLOWS Example: Dianetic Singles have been run on 7 items. Now the Auditor begins to run new items Triple without running Triple on the already run items. The result will be 7 unrun Flow 2s and 7 unrun Flow 3s. These will restimulate and form mass and by-passed charge. Example: Now let us say all 7 previous items have been run Triple. And the Auditor now runs a new item Quadruple. This leaves 7 unrun Zero chains. These can restimulate and form mass and by-passed charge. Example: Now let us say that Dianetics was all run Single and Grades were run Triple. This will restimulate the Dn chains F2 and F3. Example: Let us say that Dianetics and Scientology Grades were all run Triple. An In-teriorization Rundown is now run Quad. This will throw all Dianetic and Scientology unrun Flow Zeros into restimulation and give by-passed charge. Any later grade run with more flows than used in earlier actions can throw the earlier unflat flows into restim, pile up mass giving high TA and BPC giving ARC breaks. REPAIR The more the condition is repaired by L1C, L4BR, etc, etc, the worse the Mass gets."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" HSDC    284    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE SOURCE OF HIGH TA Thus High TAs have three principal sources: 1. Overruns 2. Auditing Past Exterior 3. Earlier Unrun Flows restimulated by those flows used in later actions. There are other minor ones such as Drug Background, illness, etc, as per Hi-Lo TA Assessment. REHABS One must not recklessly or continuously rehab a past major action. This causes over-run. The thetan is placed at the end of the incidents not yet in restimulation or run and the bank gets more solid. MASSY THETANS The whole trick of this universe is contained in thetans copying or picturing incidents and then getting stuck in the later portion of them. “Incidents” is the keynote. A thetan is incident hungry. This is what traps him. For some reason he has to be at the earliest end of incidents to erase them. The later he is in incidents and the later he is on the track the more solid he is. This also applies to the “auditing time track”. By omitting things like flows on the auditing time track, the thetan thus becomes massy. The whole theory of the Interiorization Remedy is based on having gone out (later) af-ter he went in (earlier). So Exteriorizing can stick him. (People buy the Int RD to Exteriorize but the remedy is only done to permit further auditing. They Ext of course when the bank is handled.) When flows of items are by-passed and then later restimulated by auditing them, mass occurs. GETTING IN ALL FLOWS When doing additional flows on earlier items or processes one must also check or re-hab those flows marked as run to F/N in worksheets. This again will leave unflat flows and BPC unless it is done. And if it is overdone it will raise the TA by overrun."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" HSDC    285    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So if one had a case that had Single Dianetics and was later run on Triple for new items (but the Singles not done into Triple) one would have to run first the missing unrun flow or flows if they read and then check the first Single Fl for flatness, then check other pre-viously run flows. The rule is run the previously unrun one or ones first if they read to get charge off, then verify or run the ones listed as run already. Then one would do the same for the next item. Run the previously unrun flow or flows if they read and then verify or run those listed as already run to be sure they F/N. All items, in chronological sequence, and all processes, would have to be run Quad. It would be a waste of time now to run in only Triples. Whether you have the Quad commands or not they are easy to figure out as you are only missing the Zero Flow, self to self. So all C/Ses and auditing actions are “Rehab or Run Fl, F2, F3, F0 if they read” when getting in all flows on things run to date. HIGH TA When you are sure an Int RD has been done correctly and its 2wc went F/N and the TA later goes high, you check the Int RD. That is the most usual reason. This simple action is amazingly subject to flubs. If the TA goes high later you can do a C/S Series 53 or a Hi-Lo TA Assessment and handle. If the TA is still high or low, you had better check the state of flows. Were more flows run on later actions than were run on earlier actions? If so, your pc has felt massy, sometimes even ill. The right action is to get in all flows from the beginning. And do it Quad. Bring all his auditing up to Quad. (If his folder is not available, he has kind of had it. I know of no way, at this writing, to recover lost Dn items but will have to work something out.) NOT IN TROUBLE If the pc is not in trouble, his best bet is to get on up the grades to Expanded OT III. IN TROUBLE If he is massy and is having trouble the best bet is to: 1. Be totally sure of his Int RD."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" HSDC    286    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 2. Check O/Rs particularly of a major grade twice or by-passed F/Ns, locate and indicate them. 3. FES, list the items and grades and do a Full Flow action from the beginning of his au-diting, raising them all to Quadruple. RUNNING ZERO FLOWS The Zero Flow in Dianetics is a bit strange. It can be done by full R3R but it often de-pends on the decision the pc made and may F/N very suddenly. It is easily overrun and can be very fast. A pc can be gotten into trouble on Zero Flows if the Auditor is slow and is not alert to his meter and misses the F/N and gives R3R commands after the flow has blown. REHAB OR RUN The Auditor getting in Zero Flows can also ARC Brk the pc by failing to verify if the previously run flows are flat. All the Auditor wants is to see them F/N on the command. If they don’t he runs them. Sometimes when he has “run them” again he finds they are being overrun or run twice and has to rehab them by finding this out. The pc sometimes doesn’t know until he actually starts to run them. Then he finds they are already run. The clue to this is a climbing TA. If the TA goes up, get off that flow and rehab it. Example: Pc at first thinks “Pain in shoulder” F2 was never run. Starts to run it. TA goes up. Auditor must pull him off of it by finding out if it is being run twice and rehab it to F/N. The moral in all these reruns is don’t firefight, keep an L1C List and an L3RD List handy and use them. RESULTS The results of straightening up the Int-Ext RD, rehabbing O/Rs and putting in all flows on a pc are fantastic. Getting an All Flows Rundown done correctly gives one all the latent gain the pc has been begging for. So send to Cramming all C/Ses and Auditors who flub. Program it right. C/S it right. Audit it right. "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" HSDC    287    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE L.

Pc says, “That’s so and so.” An auditor who says, “I’m sorry. You are wrong,” or any other invalidation is going to wreck a pc’s case. A full knowledge of the Auditor’s Code and actually applying it saves endless troubles. It is an auditing tool, not just a nice idea. REHABBING CHAINS One rehabs a Dianetic chain that, according to a previous worksheet, erased by saying, “According to session records (flow direction) (item) erased.” That’s all. One does not say, “Did the chain giving others a headache erase?” One does not run it again to find out. One does not run a single command “to see if it F/Ns again.” One can say, “Do you agree that the chain giving another a headache erased?” But the more you ask the pc to look for an erased chain the more messed up things will get. It isn’t there. But the auditor by his action can im-ply it should be there or might be there. A totally wrong approach would be “Look around your bank and see if what isn’t there any more isn’t there.” Dianetics is not Scientology. A Dianetic chain is not a release. If you try to use Scien-tology rehab tech on a Dianetic chain, you have had it. It isn’t a “release” (which is a key-out). A Dianetic chain is an erasure. You can’t rehab erasures with “How many times?”, etc. The test of this is the doing. If you try to use Scn rehab on Dianetic chains, the pc might try to find something. This causes him to key-in other unrun or similar items. It is a dangerous action at best to try to handle old erased chains. The best you can do is to tell the pc what the old W/S said. If no W/S exists leave the already erased flows alone! FLUBBED CHAINS Many times, a Folder Error Summary will give a flubbed chain and then fail to note it was repaired in the next session! A C/S and auditor would have been pretty irresponsible to just go on auditing past flubbed chains. The only safe way to handle some previous flubbed chain is to: (a) Verify in the folder if it was repaired. (b) If still unrepaired assess the L3RE on it and handle according to the L3RE. L3RE Using the new L3RE (HCOB 11 Apr 71RB) is a Dianetic action. A Scientology auditor erroneously can try to use it as a two-way comm type of list. If a chain needed one more DEF, then two-way comm on it with no DEF is not going to com-plete it."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   3   HCOB   21.4.71RC   HSDC    291    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE L3RE has its own directions. Questions not marked with directions are used to indi-cate the fact. This can amount to two-way comm as the pc chews it over. But L3RE where marked is handled by Dianetics actions. Look over the list and its directions for each question and you will see that some are given directions that are NOT 2WC. Example: “Earlier beginning” reads. You can’t just say, “The incident had an earlier beginning,” and you can’t say, “Tell me about the earlier beginning.” The pc will go up the wall. There’ll be no erasure. You have to use R3M and get him to the earlier beginning and then run it and if it still doesn’t erase, get him to an earlier similar and erase that. L3RE is a Dianetics list. It is not a Scientology list that is cleared each question to F/N by 2-way comm. OVERRUN Overruns are demonstrated by a rising TA. If as you seek to get in Full Flow Dianetics (Ref: HCOB 7 Mar 71R Rev 25 July 78 C/S Series 28RA-1R USE OF QUADRUPLE DIANETICS.

Example: While doing FFD pc’s TA has been riding at 2.2 and F/Ns. After a new FFD action it begins to ride at 2.5 and F/Ns. Something is being overrun. Find it and indicate it. And cease to stir the bank up so much! The fault is going over items already run. In doing a Full Flow Table you often find that the same or similar have been run in the past. Sometimes you find that a previous attempt to run the item a second or third time has resulted in an ARC break, the reason for which was never detected. The right action is to note the session date it was first run and just tell the pc, “Feeling surprised was run three times. On (first date it was erased) it was erased. When later run it was an overrun.” This tends to blow the later charge laid in by trying to run the same item again. It sounds so strange that erased chains can be overrun. But it is true. What happens is that pcs try to cooperate and put something there. FIREFIGHTS The action of a quarrel between an auditor and a pc is called a firefight. Restimulating earlier unrun engrams or overrunning chains upsets a pc. The best ac-tion, as soon as a pc is disturbed, is to do an L3RE fast and handle what reads the way it should be handled according to the L3RE.

He just feels awful. He tries to guess. He will ARC Brk or get sad if the auditor continues. The correct action is an L3RE. L1C is not of great use in a Dianetic ARC Brk. L3RE is. If the pc remains ARC broken, try L3RE again, particularly the whole L3RE. A Scientology session would be handled with some other list (L1C, L4BRA, etc.). A Dianetic session, including and especially FFD, is handled with L3RE. You NEVER prepcheck while doing Dianetics. This mushes up the engrams. INTERIORIZATION ALL these cautions apply as well to an Interiorization-Exteriorization Rundown, when restim occurs one uses an L3RE quickly. Int-Ext RD is essentially a Dianetic, not a Scientology, action. SAFE ACTIONS A fully genned-in auditor, well crammed, well drilled, well skilled, can be trusted with Dianetics, Dianetic Quads and an Int-Ext RD. Auditors not so handled can get pcs into seri-ous trouble with these things. A safe course is to use Quads on new, never audited before pcs. Those begun on Quads use then only Quad flows. C/S RESPONSIBILITY Any trouble a C/S is running into comes from the factors of TRs, metering, Code and incomplete or false auditors’ reports. If when I am C/Sing I ever find an auditor has omitted key session actions or has falsi-fied a report, I order that auditor not to Cramming but a full retrain of the Hubbard New Era Dianetics Course right on up. A C/S does not see these points. He can get the pc asked what the auditor is doing or did. He can get sessions monitored. This helps him fill this gap in his data. It’s what isn’t in the auditor’s report that is often the trouble. Auditors omit what they said, omit the firefight, omit session alter-is in their worksheets. All this sticks the C/S’s neck out for the axe of failure. So particularly in FFD, Int-Ext and other such actions, a C/S has to act to obtain con-fidence in the auditor’s TRs, metering, Code use and accurate worksheets."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"DIANETICS   5   HCOB   21.4.71RC   HSDC    293    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE RISK In FFD, Int-Ext RD and Power, experience has proven that if the auditor is not top grade, if the C/S is not alert, we put a pc at risk. The USUAL is what keeps the pc safe. A thorough study of his case, looking for obvious bugs (such as Int-Ext RD done twice, the case a druggie but drug engrams never run, Int done but its 2WC flubbed, to name a few serious ones), sending auditors to Cramming for the slightest flub, insisting on standard TRs USED IN SESSION, good metering, use of the Code, accurate and complete worksheets, use of standard tech, all guarantee the safety and progress of the pc. INTRODUCING FFD FFD (like the Int-Ext RD) requires flawless C/Sing and auditing or the case goes wrong. When these actions were introduced they showed up any flaws in case studying, TRs, metering, Code and worksheets. There are two ways to handle. (a) Cancel FFD and Int-Ext as actions. Obviously that is going backwards and is impossible. (b) Begin and continue a serious, effective campaign in the org to (1) Train auditors better, (2) Cram expertly on every flub, (3) Raise quality of TRs and metering.

All this sticks the C/S’s neck out for the axe of failure.

Newer auditors, not trained in the stern school of running engrams, must learn this all over again. It doesn’t matter whether the auditor has had a policy on this or not – one would think that common decency would be enough – as to leave a pc in the middle of a secondary or an engram and just coolly end the session is pretty cruel. Some do it because they are startled or afraid and „Rabbit” (run away by ending the session). Auditors who end a process or change it when it has turned on a heavy somatic are likewise ignorant. What turns it on will turn it off. This is the oldest rule in auditing. Of course people get into secondaries and engrams, go through misemotion and heavy somatics. This happens because things are running out. To end off a process or a session be-cause of the clock is to ignore the real purpose of auditing. The oldest rules we have are (a) Get the pc through it. (b) What turns it on will turn it off. (c) The way out is the way through. These now are expressed as policy. A falsified auditor’s report is also subject to a Court of Ethics.

If the pc is being audited in an auditing environment that is unsafe or prone to inter-ruption his or her confront is greatly lowered and the result is a reduced ability to run locks, secondaries and engrams and to erase them. If the auditor’s TRs are rough and his manner uncertain or challenging, evaluative or invalidative, the pc’s confront is reduced to zero or worse. This comes from a very early set of laws (Original Thesis): • Auditor plus pc is greater than the bank, • Auditor plus bank is greater than the pc, • Pc minus auditor is less than the bank. (By “bank” is meant the mental image picture collection of the pc. It comes from computer technology where all data is in a “bank”.) The difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks. The difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherence to procedure, better TRs, more confident manner, and closer observance of the Auditor’s Code. No “bedside manner” is required or sympathetic expression. It’s just that an auditor who knows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence. The pc doesn’t have to put his attention on or cope with the auditor and feels safer and so can confront his bank better. L.

This is a vital datum. It came to light from applying the rule – ask the pc what the auditor did after any failed session and get it corrected in the auditor. Speed is the main factor behind the mystery of a failed session. In auditing OTs the speed the auditor must have is far greater than required by just in off the street. This speed factor is the real reason why OTs were at first considered very hard to audit on Dianetics. All this also applies to VIII auditing and training. The better an auditor knows his TRs, his processes, his meter and admin the faster he can operate. If you train auditors only up to slow, comm laggy handling of a session you will get a lot of mysteriously “failed sessions”, ending with the TA high and the pc very low! A somewhat slow auditor auditing a new pc may be fast enough to get away with it. Put him on a person whose Dianetics is finished and some grades in, he begins to have a few “case failures”. Now put him to auditing reviews or Dianetics on a Pre OT and all sessions fail. The remedy is to speed the auditor up with TRs 101, 102, 103, 104. In assigning auditors you only dare assign fast ones to Pre OTs. For 19 years this hidden speed factor has lain behind the vast majority of our “failed sessions”. As it never appeared on the session reports (except as excessive admin for which the pc must have had to wait) anyone doing D of P work or C/S work was in mystery and tended to get desperate and even squirrel (change and invent processes).

The pc is not required to comment during this action and it is better if he does not. This action is called „Assessment for Longest Read”. It is used mainly in Dianetics. There are two Scientology assessments which are differently done. These are „As-sessment by Elimination” and „Listing and Nulling”. They are not used in Dianetics. One does not mix the three types. In Dianetic Assessment by Longest Read one uses these symbols: X – didn’t read Tick – small jerk of needle SF – Small Fall (a quarter to half an inch) F – Fall (about one to 2 inches) LF – Long Fall (2 to 3 inches) LFBD – Long Fall followed by a „blow down” or TA motion downward. All falls are to the right. A „BD” is a Tone Arm motion to the left made to keep the needle on the dial. The favoured action for an item is an LFBD and if one item on the list does so, that is it without any further assessment. The reason one assesses is that if an item does not read on the meter when assessed it is beyond the pc’s level of awareness. It is very unwise and unsafe to try to run a somatic which has not read on the list. It will be beyond the pc’s reality and beyond his awareness and will result in overwhelming him. That an item reads guarantees that the pc will be able to confront and erase the chain. So that an item reads well is a guarantee that the pc can handle it and will not get in too deep for him. The exception to this is a protest read. An item, possibly already run, is seen to read. The pc frowns. He is protesting and the meter is registering protest, not the item.

To do so will overwhelm him and give a bad result. A protest almost never blows down the TA. To be sure that the item is right, one usually asks the pc if he is interested in the item chosen. If the pc says no, he doesn’t want to run it, this is a protest read. One then picks the second best reading item on the assessment already done and checks that with the pc for interest. The pc will usually be interested in it. The pc can almost always be counted on to be interested in any item that gives a LFBD. One never simply asks the pc which on the list he is interested in as „an assessment” as it will be found the pc simply chooses at random and may choose a null item. The result may be a very unsuccessful session. An auditor may sometimes be astonished by what reads. The pc, let us say, obviously has a broken leg but what reads is an earache. One runs what reads, not what the auditor knows should be run. A „know best” in an auditor can be a fatal fault. On a second or third assessment, items which were at first null or reading poorly will be found to „come alive” and read well. The pc, by being audited, has had an increase of abil-ity to confront and, if the auditing is standard, an increase in confidence. The result is that items beyond his reach previously (and did not read well) are now available and can be run easily. The E-Meter measures the awareness depth of the pc. On things which do not read on assessment you would find his reality poor. Things that read well on assessment will be found to be things on which a pc has a high reality and a high interest level. Only if pushed to audit without a meter could an auditor assess by interest only. There is no real excuse for it if one has an E-Meter. Auditing without a meter is a chancy activity. Good assessment by longest read is the best entrance to a successful session. The same list will serve for the next item to be run and should be used rather than just asking the pc. L.

More goofy alterations can occur and more errors in this activity than any other. In Standard Dianetics if you assess the wrong item or a wrongly worded item the case won’t run, the TA goes up or the TA goes down. High TA (above 3.5) is a lot of mass coming in. Low TA (below 2) is overwhelm. Bad TRs can cause low TA as the auditor is overwhelming the pc. Too many times through without going earlier is the usual cause of these 4.5 to 5.5 TAs. But both high and low TA are in some degree caused by not quite right assessment. Pictures going off (pc gets a black or invisible field) is also caused by a wrong as-sessment. The whole subject of assessment means pick out the thing that will run. That’s all one is trying to do. As I have never had the faintest trouble listing and assessing anything or even finding the right somatic with no meter at all, it is hard for me to advise how to correct misassess-ment or assessment errors. It just evades my reality. The whole subject is too easy. Just too awful easy. So my belief is that students try to put too much into it. They try to get a pat-phrased question to ask like “What is the feeling?” They stare (TR 0) at the pc when they should be looking at the meter. Try TR 0 on the meter! An old operating definition of ASSESSMENT is: Assessment is done by the auditor between the pc’s bank and the meter. There is no need in assessing to look at the pc. Just note which item has the longest fall or BD. The auditor looks at the meter while doing an assessment."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT   2   HCOB   21.05.69   HSDC    324    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A clue to this is the continual misuse of the Azimuth meter. I keep finding them with paper pasted behind the dial. This shows they aren’t used right. One bends the stand peg to get it out of the way, and writes by looking at his pen through the glass. Then he never misses a read as the meter is between him and the item he is writing. One is assessing for pains, sensations, unwanted emotions, aches. It can get so far out that the pc is made to say only feelings like “a going in feeling” and never even mention a pain. There are so many signs and indicators that it is a wrong item when it is that I can’t see how it could be missed. On a wrong item the pc has bad indicators, the meter doesn’t read, there is no pc interest. Wow. It’s as obvious as a sinking ship. On a right item the meter reads well when the pc says it, the pc’s good indicators come in somewhat when it’s announced, the pc is very interested in running it. It’s about as obvious as sky rockets. So just given these two descriptions of the reaction to a wrong item and a right item I should think anybody could tell them. Rote procedure gets heavily in the road of a Dianetic assessment. The pc gives a list, the auditor doesn’t watch the reads and note them, then the auditor commonly goes back to assess the list. By that time the charge is off. He should have watched the meter in the first place and taken that. Why all this assessing of the finished list. Of course when you already have a list done by another with no reads marked on it, you have to read it off and mark what reads. And using a list a second time you have to read it off to the pc to see what reads. When a student demands a rote procedure for Dianetic assessment he is asking for trouble and is trying not to understand. If the student simply understood that he was trying to find an item that read well, brought in moderate GIs and in which the pc was interested and which was usefully worded and which would run, he would have it made. I get the feeling that Scientology listing gets all mixed up on a Dianetic Course. There are precision Scientology listing and nulling actions which must not be violated. These have nothing to do with Dianetics. Nothing! A Standard Dianetics list can be so sloppily done it’s hard to believe. BUT the auditor has to watch the meter and be sure he has one with the pc’s interest, worded so as to run into an engram chain. I’ve seen an incredibly botched up job as finding a somatic done this way. Pc listed, needle and TA all over the dial. Auditor picked out four somatics. Wrote them down and called them off. None read. The auditor then said the pc couldn’t be audited on Dianetics and should be sent for Scientology. Who is kidding who? The somatics read like mad. There was even one with a LFBD. Yet the auditor had to go into some goofy rote procedure or ritual and by it “discover” there were no somatics."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT   3   HCOB   21.05.69   HSDC    325    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The errors in this operation of finding a somatic can be so corny and so idiotic that I have to assume the auditor doesn’t know or understand what he’s trying to do and doesn’t even look at the meter while he does it. Honest, this action of finding the somatic to run is SO easy to do that only over-complication can block it. The auditor wants to know what aches, pains, bad feelings, misemotions the pc com-plains of and out of these takes the one that reads best while the pc is saying it or it is being called off and which brings in the pc’s GIs moderately and in which the pc is interested. The somatic must read. Now what’s so hard about that? It requires one looks at his meter when the pc is giving it or it is being talked about. There are no Scientology listing considerations in it. Now and then the pc has a discreditable somatic and the auditor has to coax the pc to give all. Now and then the pc says “My Lumbosis” and if you ran that or any medical term you’d only get him in doctors’ offices or in hospitals, as it’s a medical term, not a somatic. Evidently the student gets in such a sweat about finding a “right item” that he goes up the spout on good sense. In Scientology lists there’s only one item. On Dianetic lists there can be a dozen, for a Dianetic list isn’t really a list. It isn’t trying to isolate the mental troubles of the pc. A Dianetic list is simply the pc’s physical aches and pains. Golly, people are notorious for dis-cussing their aches and pains. Why is it so hard to find one that reads well on a meter? Well, you have to watch the meter. That’s probably the outness. Students are so socially adjusted they keep looking at the pc, maybe even trying to look pleasant rather than trying to read a meter. I feel, in trying to communicate and teach how to locate what to run, as if I am ex-plaining where the floor is. And the people I’m explaining it to are wondering how you look at a floor, what chant you intone while looking at a floor and what mathematical equation you use to make sure it is the floor. It’s that kind of a thing. I say, “There’s the floor. If you stamp on it and it is there you will get a sound.” And guys think, “Well, maybe but how loud a sound and do you use the right foot or the left foot and if that’s the floor I can’t find the ceil-ing because I have no sextant.” All I’m trying to tell you is that when you are looking for a somatic in the pc and hit it the meter reads well, the pc has moderate GIs when you tell him what it is you’ve chosen, he is interested and it will run."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT   4   HCOB   21.05.69   HSDC    326    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE And honest to Pete, that’s all there is to it.

Thus an instant read which occurs when the auditor assesses an item or calls a ques-tion is valid and would be taken up and latent reads, which occur fractions of seconds after the major thought, are ignored.

AN INSTANT F/N IS A READ Ref: HCOB 2 Nov 68R Case Supervisor Class VIII – The Basic Processes HCOB 20 Feb 70 Floating Needles and End Phenomena An instant F/N is an F/N which occurs instantly at the end of the major thought voiced by the auditor or at the end of the major thought voiced by the pc (when he originates items or tells what the command means). It will most usually be seen as a LFBD/F/N or a LF/F/N. So what does this mean, “An instant F/N is a read?” A read means there’s charge there to handle. It means there is force connected with that significance which is available to the pc to view and run. It means that item is real to the pc. An F/N means something has keyed-out. Now a key-out is what we are looking for on many processes which are run. It means “Stop. End of process, end of rud, end of action.” So an instant F/N does not always mean you should take up that item. To sort this out, you will have to understand the basic mechanics of key-out, key-in and erasure. It will then become clear why an F/N is a read and when it is taken up. To con-fuse this could really mess up a pc. For example, on ruds, Prepcheck questions, protest, overrun, rehabs, to name a few, an instant F/N would not be taken up. The EP of charge keyed-out has been attained. But to ignore an instant F/N on Dianetic items and certain correction lists etc., will leave the pc with bypassed charge and major areas of case unhandled. The key is “Is a han-dling required on the item or is an F/N the legitimate EP?” You will also have to understand that we are talking about instant F/Ns. An F/N which continues to F/N through an assessment means “No Charge.” An instant F/N on an item means charge has just keyed-out on that item, and that it can key back in again. There are actions, as in Dianetics, where a key-out is not what you are going for. You want the postulate off the basic incident of the chain, which indicates you have an erasure."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"AN INSTANT F/N IS A READ 2 HCOB 20.9.78 HSDC    330    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In Dianetics an instant F/N takes precedence over all other reads. This is because, the pc, having just keyed-out the charge on that item, will find it most real. It will be the most runnable item. An instantly F/Ning item is taken up first. LFBD, LF, F and SF follow in their usual order. The use of this thing is mainly a C/S use. A C/S can look down a column of two-way comm or look down an L and N list and spot what F/Ned. If the C/S doesn’t realize that this was the item he can then take erroneously some LFBD item or F item out of the columns of two-way comm as the resulting item for that subject. The use of an F/N as a read is almost entirely relegated to the next C/S except when used in Dianetics. Example: A C/S is looking for the actual service facsimile in two-way comm. (You usually L and N to find service facs but you may have an instance where you found one in two-way comm.) The pc mentions several and finally one F/Ns. The C/S knows at once it is the service fac. Example: A two-way comm has operated as a list and the C/S is trying to reconstruct it. Unless he knows that an F/N is a read he might overlook the actual item on that list which is the one which occurred immediately before the F/N. This is the item. When used in the session itself the auditor has to know that an F/N is a read in doing L and N. The item which F/Ned is of course the item. In a Dianetic session it is not uncommon to find a brief F/N occurring on a list or a preassessment. In Dianetics we are not interested in key-outs. We are interested in chains and erasures. So the “hottest reading item” on the list is the one that gave an F/N. Usually it will be a BD F/N. If the Dianetic auditor does not know that an instant F/N is a read he is likely to ignore the item that F/Ned. In Dianetics, you will find that an F/N taken up again, will immediately key-in but this is what the Dianetic auditor wants. The Scientology auditor is usually handling other phenomena and if he bypassed an F/N and kept on going the TA would go up and he would have trouble. So the use of this principle is a very touchy thing and has to be understood. Of course the first thing you have to know about is what an F/N looks like. This tech fully understood and applied will mean the difference between a case being fully handled and “just doing better.” Understand it and use it. You’ll see the difference in your results. L.

CLEARING COMMANDS (Ref: HCOB 14 Nov 65, CLEARING COMMANDS HCOB 9 Nov 68, CLEARING COMMANDS, ALL LEVELS HCO PL 4 Apr 72R ETHICS AND STUDY TECH) Always when running a process newly or whenever the preclear is confused about the meaning of commands, clear each word of each command with the preclear. using the dic-tionary if necessary. This has long been standard procedure. You want a pc set up to run smoothly, knowing what is expected of him and under-standing exactly the question being asked or the command being given. A misunderstood word or auditing command can waste hours of auditing time and keep a whole case from moving. Thus this preliminary step to running a process or procedure for the first time is vital. The rules of clearing commands are: 1. Under no circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the pc and tell him what the word or command means. 2. Always have the necessary (and good) dictionaries in the auditing room with you. This would include the Tech Dictionary, the Admin Dictionary, a good English dic-tionary, and a good non-dinky dictionary in the pc’s native language. For a foreign language case (where the pc’s native language is not English) you will also need a dual dictionary for that language and English. (Example: English word “apple” is looked up in English/French dictionary and “pomme” is found. Now look in the French dictionary to define “pomme.”) So for the foreign language case two dictionaries are needed: (1) English to foreign language (2) foreign language itself. 3.

Clear the command (or question or list item) backwards by first clearing in turn each word in the command in backwards sequence. (Example: To clear the command “Do fish swim?” clear “swim” first, then “fish,” then “do.”) This prevents the pc starting to run the process by himself while you are still clearing the words. 4a. Note: F/Ns obtained on clearing the words does not mean the process has been run. 5. Next, clear the command itself. Auditor asks the pc, “What does this command mean to you?” If it is evident from the pc’s answer that he has misunderstood a word as it is used in the context of the com-mand: (a) Re-clear the obvious word (or words) using the dictionary. (b) Have him use each word in a sentence until he has it. (The worst fault is the pc using a new set of words in place of the actual word and answering the al-ter-ised word, not the word itself. See HCOB 10 MAR 65, WORDS, MIS-UNDERSTOOD GOOFS.) (c) Re-clear the command. (d) If necessary, repeat Steps a, b and c above to make sure he understands the command. 5a. Note: that a word reads when clearing a command, an assessment question or listing question does not mean the command or question itself has read necessar-ily. Mis-understood words read on the meter. 6. When clearing the command, watch the meter and note any read on the com-mand. (REF: HCOB 28 FEB 71, C/S SERIES 24, IMPORTANT METERING READING ITEMS.) 7. Don’t clear the commands of all ruds and run them, or of all processes and run them. you’ll miss F/Ns. the commands of one process are cleared just before that process is run. 8. ARC breaks and lists should be word cleared before a pc gets into them and should be tagged in the pc’s folder on a yellow sheet as cleared. (REF: BTB 5 NOV 72R II, REV. 24.7.74, AUDITOR ADMIN SERIES 6R, THE YELLOW SHEET.) As it is difficult to clear all the words of a correction list on a pc over heavy by-passed charge, it is standard to clear the words of an L1C and ruds very early in auditing and to clear an L4BRA before commencing listing processes or an L3RE before running"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"CLEARING COMMANDS 3 HCOB 9.8.78 II HSDC    333    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE R3RA. Then, when the need for these correction lists arises one does not need to clear all the words as it has already been done. Thus, such correction lists can be used with-out delay. It is also standard to clear the words of the Word Clearing Correction List early in au-diting and before other correction lists are cleared. This way, if the pc bogs on subse-quent Word Clearing, you have your Word Clearing Correction List ready to use. 9. If, however, your pc is sitting in the middle of an ARC break (or other heavy charge) and the words of the L1C (or other correction list) have not been cleared yet, don’t clear first. Go ahead and assess the list to handle the charge. Otherwise it’s auditing over an ARC break. In this case you just verify by asking afterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list. All the words of the L1C (or other correction list) would then be cleared thoroughly at the first opportunity – per your C/S’s instructions. 10. Do not re-clear all the words of assessment lists each time the list is used on the same pc. Do it once, fully and properly the first time and note clearly in the folder, on the yellow sheet for future reference, which of the- standard assessment lists have been cleared. 11. These rules apply to all processes, listing questions and assessments . 12. The words of the platens of advanced course materials are not so cleared. ____________________ Any violation of full and correct clearing of commands or assessment questions, whether done in a formal session or not, is an ethics offense per HCO PL 4 Apr 72R (Rev. 21.6.75) ETHICS AND STUDY TECH, Section 4, which states: “Any auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned before a court of ethics. “The charge is Out Tech.” L.

Word Clearing Series 59RA CLEARING WORDS (Ref: HCOB 7 Sep 74 Word Clearing Series 54 Superliteracy and the Cleared Word HCOB 17 Jul 79 I Word Clearing Series 64 The Misunderstood Word, Defined) In research concerning Word Clearing, study and training done with various groups over the recent past months, it has become all too obvious that a misunderstood word remains misunderstood and will later hang a person up unless he clears the meaning of the word in the context of the materials being read or studied and also clears it in all of its various uses in general communication. When a word has several different definitions, one cannot limit his understanding of the word to one definition only and call the word „understood.” One must be able to under-stand the word when, at a later date, it is used in a different way. HOW TO CLEAR A WORD To clear a word one looks it up in a good dictionary. Dictionaries recommended are The Oxford English Dictionary or the Shorter Oxford Dictionary and Funk and Wagnalls Standard English Dictionary. The first step is to look rapidly over the definitions to find the one which applies to the context in which the word was misunderstood. One reads the definition and uses it in sen-tences until one has a clear concept of that meaning of the word. This could require ten or more sentences. Then one clears each of the other definitions of that word, using each in sentences un-til one has a conceptual understanding of each definition. The next thing to do is to clear the derivation – which is the explanation of where the word came from originally. This will help gain a basic understanding of the word. Don’t clear the technical or specialized definitions (math, biology, etc.) or obsolete (no longer used) or archaic (ancient and no longer in general use) definitions unless the word is being used that way in the context where it was misunderstood."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"CLEARING WORDS 2 HCOB 23.3.78RA I HSDC    336    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Most dictionaries give the idioms of a word. An idiom is a phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of the words. For example, „give in” is an English idiom meaning „yield.” Quite a few words in English have idiomatic uses and these are usually given in a dictionary after the definitions of the word itself. These idi-oms have to be cleared. One must also clear any other information given about the word, such as notes on its usage, synonyms, etc. so as to have a full understanding of the word. If one encounters a misunderstood word or symbol in the definition of a word being cleared, one must clear it right away using this same procedure and then return to the defini-tion one was clearing. (Dictionary symbols and abbreviations are usually given in the front of the dictionary.) EXAMPLE You are reading the sentence „He used to clean chimneys for a living” and you’re not sure what „chimneys” means. You find it in the dictionary and look through the definitions for the one that applies. It says „A flue for the smoke or gases from a fire.” You’re not sure what „flue” means so you look that up: it says „A channel or passage for smoke, air or gasses of combustion.” That fits and makes sense so you use it in some sen-tences until you have a clear concept of it. „Flue” in this dictionary has other definitions, each of which you would clear and use in sentences. Look up the derivation of the word „flue.” Now go back to „chimney.” The definition „A flue for the smoke or gases from a fire,” now makes sense so you use it in sentences until you have a concept of it. You then clear the other definitions. One dictionary has an obsolete definition and a geological definition. You would skip both of these as they aren’t in common usage. Now clear up the derivation of the word. One finds in the derivation that it originally came from the Greek word „kaminos,” which means „furnace.” If the word had any synonym studies, usage notes or idioms, they would all be cleared too. That would be the end of clearing „chimney.” CONTEXT UNKNOWN If you don’t know the context of the word, as in Word Clearing Methods 1, 5 (when done from a list), 6 or 8, you should start with the first definition and clear all definitions, derivation, idioms, etc. as covered above."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"CLEARING WORDS 3 HCOB 23.3.78RA I HSDC    337    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE „WORD CHAINS” If you find yourself spending a lot of time clearing words within definitions of words, you should get a simpler dictionary. A good dictionary will enable you to clear a word with-out having to look up a lot of other ones in the process. CLEARED WORDS A cleared word is one which has been cleared to the point of full conceptual un-derstanding by clearing each of the common meanings of that word plus any technical or specialized meanings of that word that pertain to the subject being handled.

Poor TRs or rough auditing easily drive the TA down. A TA can go low during a run like on engrams, and can come back up when actual erasure occurs. Usually a person whose TA goes below 2.0 when run on incidents too steep for him will get low TA. A low TA is of course any TA below 2.0. An occasional cause of this is as simple as the meter not being trimmed. Sweaty hands, improper electrodes, and sometimes a faulty meter also cause a “low TA” to appear. Heavy processes like LX 1-2-3 are sometimes an overwhelm. An invalidative look on an Examiner’s face can drive a TA down a bit. Cold cans can send it UP high. Lack of rest or time of the day gives some cases a low or high TA. At 2:00 a.m. TAs often are very high, for instance. Persons with low TAs tend to be somewhat inactive in life and non-causative. When audited with poor TRs or on processes too steep some persons’ TAs go low (be-low 2.0). An F/N is never an F/N when above 3.0 or below 2.0. Life repairs and auditing repairs, light processes and no goof auditing are the proper actions for low TA cases. Auditors whose pcs’ TAs go low should look to the flawlessness of their auditing, the ease of their TRs and refuse any heavy overwhelm type C/Ses for such pcs. Good Two-Way Comm on troubling subjects, use of prepared lists on life, mild close to objective processes, no forcing over protests, never running processes that don’t read first, getting the pc out of being effect and toward being cause, extroverting the pc’s attention with objective processes all work well on low TA cases."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"LOW TA HANDLING 2 HCOB 8.06.70 HSDC    344    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The actual technical reason for low TAs is found in higher levels and does not concern and would be of no use to lower level pcs.

Remimeo All Levels F/N EVERYTHING Whenever an auditor gets a read on an item from Ruds or a prepared list (L1B, L3A, L4B, etc., etc.) it must be carried to an F/N. To fail to do so is to leave the pc with by-passed charge. When a pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to F/N, it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason. As one has done the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong? The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not car-ried to F/N. This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it Flag Auditing. When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible. Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared list would F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning. So the rule: Never walk off from a reading item on a rudiment or a prepared repair list be-fore you carry it down (earlier similar) to an F/N. Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N, Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc. until he gets an F/N. Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns. Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there an earlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list. Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on it that read, by 2WC or other process, to an F/N. So there is a much more general rule: Every item that reads must F/N. In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure, F/N, Cog, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 2 HCOB 14.3.71R HSDC    350    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N.

On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N. So another rule: Every major and minor action must be carried to an F/N. There are no exceptions. Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc. Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained.

C/S Series 1 AUDITOR’S RIGHTS AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/SES An auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/S) of what to audit on a pc is not discharged of his responsibility as an auditor. The auditor has a series of responsibilities that are part of every C/S he gets to audit. ACCEPTING THE PC No auditor is required to accept a specific pc just because the pc is assigned to him. If an auditor does not believe he can help that particular pc or if he dislikes auditing that particular pc the auditor has a right to refuse to audit that pc. The auditor must state why. The Case Supervisor, Director of Processing or Director of Review, nor any of their seniors, may not discipline the auditor for refusing to audit a particular pc. An auditor who refuses to audit his quota of hours or sessions is of course subject to action."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 2 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    354    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Thus refusing to audit a particular pc, so long as one is not refusing to audit other pcs, is not actionable. “I do not wish to audit this pc because ______. I am willing to audit other pcs,” is the legal auditor statement in the matter. Some pcs get a bad name with some auditors, some don’t appreciate the auditing, some conflict with a particular auditor’s own personality. There are such instances. It does not mean certain pcs cannot be helped by others. It is also true that an auditor who dislikes a pc may not do a good job so the rule also has a practical side to it. One auditor disliked young men and did a bad job on them. Another disliked old la-dies and chopped them up in session. One pc had messed up several Scientologists and couldn’t find anyone to audit him at all. We are not auditing people to make amends to the world. Thus an auditor has a right to reject or accept the pcs he is given. ACCEPTING A C/S When the auditor gets a C/S to do on a case and if he thinks it is not the correct thing to do he has the right to reject the C/S for that pc and require another one he can agree to. The auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the ses-sion except as noted below. The auditor may NOT C/S in the auditing chair while auditing the pc. If he has NO Case Supervisor at all the auditor still audits from a C/S. He writes the C/S before session and adheres to it in session. To do something else and not follow the C/S is called ‘‘C/Sing in the chair’’ and is very poor form as it leads to Q and A. STALE DATED C/S A C/S that is a week or two old or a Repair (Progress) Pgm that is a month or two old is dynamite. This is called a “Stale Dated Pgm’’ or a ‘‘Stale Dated C/S” meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss. It is dangerous to accept a Repair (Progress) Pgm if it is old. The auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justified in demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 3 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    355    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A program written in January may be completely out of date in June. Who knows what may have happened in between. Use fresh C/Ses and fresh Pgms. Stale Dates only occur in poorly run backlogged Divisions anyway. The real remedy is reorganize and hire more and better auditors. ENDING THE SESSION When the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/S. Ending the session is totally up to the auditor. If the auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could be completed it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic engram the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and simi-lar actions would be an auditor error. The judgement here is whether or not the auditor’s action is justified in ending the ses-sion. Even though he may have made an error, the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc on something else whose ruds are out is a Major Auditing Error. Even if the C/S omits ‘‘Fly a rud” or “Fly ruds” this does not justify the auditor auditing the pc over out ruds. The auditor can do one of two things: He can Fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. The Dianetic Auditor is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in an HGC must be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for a new C/S. Better still he should learn to Fly ruds. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS If an auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is justified in start-ing a Green Form. The auditor solution to no F/N on ruds is to do a GF whether the C/S said to or not. This is an expected action. It is understood the auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to Fly ruds."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 4 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    356    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE SESSIONS FAR APART When a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions days apart, ruds must be flown. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds. This can develop mental mass. Optimum session scheduling is a series of sessions or a whole program done in a block of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s ruds out be-tween sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there. UNREADING ITEMS When an item the auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, even when the auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the auditor must not do anything with the item no matter what the C/S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn’t read he will be expected not to run it. LISTS When an auditor whose C/S told him to list “Who or what ______” or any list question finds that the list question does not read, the auditor must not list it. When doing a list ordered by the C/S it is assumed that the auditor will test it for read before listing and that he will not list an unreading question. (A read is an actual fall, not a tick or a stop.) LIST TROUBLE When an auditor has trouble doing a list and getting an item it is expected he will use a Prepared List like L4B to locate the trouble and handle it. As it is very hard on a pc to mess up a list it is expected the auditor will handle the situation then and there with no further C/S directions. HIGH TA When the auditor sees the TA is high at session start yet the C/S says to “Fly a rud” or run a chain, the auditor must not try to fly a rud and he must not start on a chain."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 5 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    357    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Trying to bring a TA down with ARC Brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren’t the reason TAs go up. Seeing a high TA at start the Dianetic auditor or SCN auditor up to Class II does not start the session but sends the folder back to the C/S and for a higher class auditor to do. Seeing a high TA at start the Scientology auditor (Class III or above) (a) checks for exteriorization in a recent session and if so the session is ended and the C/S is asked for an “Interiorization Rundown”; (b) if the pc has had an Interiorization Rundown the auditor asks the C/S for permission to do a “C/S Series 53’’ or a Hi-Lo TA assessment or whatever the C/S indicates. The Int RD may have been (usually is) overrun and needs rehab or correction and it is usual to check it – it is included in a “C/S 53’’ and a Hi-Lo TA. These actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the C/S. GOING ON HOPING When a case is running badly session to session the LAST thing you do is go on hop-ing, either in auditing or C/Sing. “Let’s try _____”, ‘‘Then this”, “Then this”, is not going to solve the case. You get data. You can get data by a White Form (Pc Assessment Form). You can get data from a GF fully assessed (Method 5). You can get data by 2-way comm on various subjects. You can have the D of P interview and get answers. You can even ask his mother. You look for case errors. You study the folder back to where the pc ran well and then come forward and you’ll find the error every time. Do not just go on session after failed session hoping. That’s pure idiocy. You get data! from prepared lists, from life, from the pc, from the folder. Find the bug! Ah, good Lord, he is a Pinkerton Agent sworn to secrecy! He does yoga exercises af-ter every session. He was tried for murder when he was 16 and nobody has run the engram of it. Various auditors ran the same engram chain four times An auditor ran Int RD twice. After Power she had her baby and nobody ran the delivery. He doesn’t like to talk but is a “Grade Zero”! A dozen dozen reasons can exist. An auditor does not let a C/S C/S hopefully.

A Folder Summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up. Over it there must be a program on which the case is being audited. But just because it’s covered, never neglect entering a session and what was run on the Folder Summary (FS). If Hold it Still is ordered, see if it was run before.

RUDS GOING OUT When the ruds go out during the session the auditor recognizes the following: Pc Critical = W/H from auditor Pc Antagonistic = BPC in session No TA = Problem Tired = Failed Purpose or no sleep Sad = ARC Break Soaring TA = Overrun or Protest Dope Off = By-passed F/N or not enough sleep No Interest = Out Ruds or no interest in the first place. An auditor who isn’t sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc (except on lists which he handles at once always) is smart to end off the session quickly, write down the full observation and get it to the C/S.

Sad = ARC Brk = locate and handle, Itsa ear-lier Itsa. Soaring TA = O/R or Protest = find which and handle. Such an O/R is usually by rehab. Dope Off = lack of sleep or BP F/N = check on sleep, or rehab F/N. No Interest = no interest in first place or Out Ruds = check for interest or put in ruds. List goes wrong = BPC = handle or do L4B or any L4 at once. Ruds won’t fly = some other error = assess GF and handle. The auditor has no business trying to do the C/S given when it collides with and isn’t designed to handle any of the above. If the previous session disclosed such an error and this session C/S was designed to handle and doesn’t, the auditor should end off and the next C/S should be “2-way comm for data”. CASE NOT HANDLED When the auditor or the Examiner collides with a pc who is asserting his case has not been handled, there should not be a new set of actions based on little data but the auditor should end off and the C/S should order a “way comm on what hasn’t been handled”. The auditor should not at once take this up as part of any other C/S. In other words an auditor doesn’t change the C/S to a 2-way comm on something not called for by C/S. MAJOR ACTIONS An auditor should never begin a major action on a case that is not “set up” for it."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 8 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    360    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE As this can occur during a session it is vital to understand the rule and follow it. Oth-erwise a case can be bogged right down and will be hard to salvage as now a new action to repair has been added to an unrepaired action. Now, if the auditor starts a major action on a case not “set up” we get 2 things to repair where we only had I as the major action won’t work either. Repair = patching up past auditing or recent life errors. This is done by prepared lists or completing the chain or correcting lists or even 2-way comm or prepchecks on auditors, sessions, etc. Rudiments = setting the case up for the session action. This includes ARC Brks, PTPs, W/Hs, GF or O/R listing or any prepared list (such as L1C, etc.). Set up = getting an F/N showing and VGIs before starting any major action. It means just that – an F/N and VGIs before starting any major action. Such may require a repair action and rudiments as well. Major Action = any – but any – action designed to change a case or general considera-tions or handle continual illness or improve ability. This means a Process or even a series of processes like 3 flows. It doesn’t mean a grade. It is any process the case hasn’t had. Grade = a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. Program = any series of actions designed by a C/S to bring about definite results in a pc. A program usually includes several sessions. The vast bulk of auditing errors come about because C/Ses and auditors seek to use a Major Action to repair a case. It is a responsibility of an auditor to reject a C/S which seeks to use one or more major actions to repair a case that isn’t running well. The auditor must understand this completely. He can be made to accept a wrong C/S for the pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error and mess up the case. Example: Pc has not been running well (no real TA or had a grumpy Exam report). Auditor sees C/S has ordered a major action, not a repair by prepared lists, ruds, etc. The auditor must reject the C/S as he will be made to fail in session by it. Example: Auditor gets a C/S, “(1) Fly a rud; (2) Assess LX3; (3) Run 3-way recall, 3-way secondaries, 3-way engrams on all / / X items”. The auditor can’t get a rud to fly. Does the LX3. In other words he flunks by failing to SET UP the case. It could also go this way. Auditor can’t get a rud to fly, does a GF, gets no F/N. He must not begin a major action but must end off right there. It is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if the case is not F/N VGIs. The pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not F/N VGIs must be set up by repair actions! Simple rudiments, life ruds, O/R list on life, even assessing prepared"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 9 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    361    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE lists on life, these are repair actions. The pc will sooner or later begin to fly. Now at session start you put in a rud, get F/N VGIs and CAN start major actions. So the auditor has a responsibility not to be led up a garden path by a C/S which or-ders a major action on a pc who isn’t repaired or by not being able in session to get an F/N VGIs by repair. The only exceptions are a touch assist or life ruds or the Dianetic assist all on a tempo-rarily sick pc. But that’s repair isn’t it? PROGRAM VIOLATIONS When an auditor receives a C/S and sees that it violates the pc’s program he should re-ject it. The pc, let us say, is supposed to finish his Dianetic Triples but is suddenly being given a Group Engram Intensive. That violates the program and also the grade. If the pc is running badly, a repair should be ordered. If not, the program should be completed. Example: An effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack. This is a program con-taining several major actions which probably consists of several sessions. Before this program is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack, the C/S orders “(1) Fly a rud, (2) 3 S & Ds”. The auditor should recognize in 3 S & Ds a major action being run into the middle of a program and reject it. The correct action is of course the next backtrack process. GRADE VIOLATIONS A pc who is on a grade and hasn’t attained it yet must not be given major actions not part of that grade. Example: Pc is on Grade I. C/S orders a list having to do with drinking. It is not a process on that grade. It could be done after Grade I is attained and before Grade II is begun. The C/S is incorrect and should not be accepted. ABILITY ATTAINED Now and then before the full major action is complete or before all the grade processes are run, the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of the action. This is particularly true of valence shifters or Interiorization Rundowns and can hap-pen in grades. The auditor should recognize it and, with the F/N VGIs always present at such mo-ments, end off."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 10 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    362    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE I know of one case who had a huge cog about Interiorization on Flow I Engrams and was pushed by both C/S and auditor to do Flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badly that it took a long while – weeks – to straighten the case out. The ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on. On the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse. “I think he cogged to him-self so we ended off.” It must be a real “What do you know!” sort of out-loud cog with a big F/N and VVGIs and directly on the subject to end off a major action or a program or a grade before its actions are all audited. REVIEWING REVIEWS An auditor who gets a C/S or an order to repair a case that is running well should re-ject doing the action. I have seen a case ordered to repair who had Ext Full Perception Doing Great. The re-pair bogged the case. The case then got running well again but a second C/S ordered a new repair which of course bogged it. Then major actions were done. The case was again repaired and rehabbed and became OK. Three times the auditor should have said NO. FALSE REPORTS The vilest trick that can be played on a pc is for an auditor to falsify an auditing report. It may be thought to be “good Public Relations” (good PR) for the auditor with the C/S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. Integrity is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc. OVERTS ON PCS When an auditor finds himself being nattery or critical of his pcs he should get his withholds on pcs pulled and overts on them off. An auditor who goes sad is auditing pcs over his own ARC Break. An auditor worried about his pc is working over a Problem. Getting one’s ruds in on pcs or C/Ses or the org can bring new zest to life."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS 11 HCOB 23.8.71 HSDC    363    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE AUDITORS DON’T HAVE CASES In the chair no auditor has a case. If breath shows on a mirror held to his face he can audit. Faint afterwards if you must but see that the pc gets to the Examiner with his F/N. Then get yourself handled. “WHAT HE DID WRONG” An auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCO B have been violated. But an auditor’s TRs can go out or his listing and nulling is in error. After a session that went wrong somebody else (not the auditor) should ask the pc what the auditor did. This sometimes spots a false auditing report. But it also sometimes is a false report by the pc. In any event, the auditor has a right to know. Then he can either correct his auditing or his know-how or he can advise the C/S the pc’s report is untrue and better repair can be done on the pc. Savage action against an auditor is almost never called for. He was trying to help. Some people are hard to help. Not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCO B, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCO B or tape. Don’t be party to a ‘‘hidden data line’’ that doesn’t exist “You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. ‘‘You violated HCO B page ____” is the charge. No auditor may be disciplined for asking, ‘‘May I please have the tape or HCO B that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming. “ If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCOB it is not true and no auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. “If it isn’t written it isn’t true’’ is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. ____________________ These are the rights of the auditor with relation to a C/S.

It also happens that a D of P becomes incapable of getting auditors to audit per the schedule he writes. 121/2 hour intensives drop out. Auditing falls back to the bit and piece game. The C/S finds all his work in programming wasted as the programs stale date or just get abandoned. Hours fall. Lines tangle. Tech Services cannot get assignments done. The major why of this and many such confusions can be traced to an abuse of \"Auditors' Rights\" in picking and choosing pcs on the grounds of \"feeling they cannot help the pc\". This \"right\" is also abused by auditors seeking pcs who F/N easily at the Examiner. See HCO B 15 June 72, C/S Series 80, \"Dog Pcs\". The refusal to audit is in fact an admission, in most cases, of a feared inability to audit. Therefore, an auditor may only refuse to audit a pc if a direct personal relationship ex-ists such as husband and wife or some friend's wife or familial relationship. An auditor advising others about this or that \"dog case\" or seeking to exclude pcs from auditing by abusing his \"right to choose pcs\" is subject to CommEv and suspension of cer-tificates until retreaded. For the real why of it is his inability to handle TRs, meter, use the Code or apply Tech. Nearly every \"Dog Pc\" has out lists or incomplete chains or is not being run on what needs to be handled. In other words they are simply problems in repair which modern tech handles easily.

An Auditor is expected to take a Pc who has red tagged back into session immediately and handle with the right Correction List for that process or rundown, or as authorized in the original HCO B 23 Aug 71, “Auditor’s Rights”. It is strictly forbidden for an Auditor or any other Auditor to take a Pc back into ses-sion without C/S clearance, after the fact of a second red tag. The Auditor has only one chance to repair the Pc with the right Correction List. If this does not handle, the Pc is still red tagged and the folder must be gotten to the C/S fast and the Out Tech corrected within 24 hours of the original red tag. The earlier issue of this Bulletin which permitted Auditors to count auditing hours lost on a salvage red tag session is cancelled. Additionally, if a red tag pc is not handled immediately by the Auditor concerned, the existing penalty of loss of the auditing hours which resulted in the Red Tag session is dou-bled. For example, if the Auditor audited a 2 hour session, he is penalized 4 hours if he fails to take his Pc straight back into session. This double penalty is purely for the Auditor concerned and does not affect or change other penalties connected – the Examiner’s 24 Hour Rule per HCO PL 8 Sept 70R and the Paid Comps penalty per HCO B 30 Aug 71 RC, Rev. 6 Feb 74."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"AUDITOR’S RIGHTS ADDITION REVISED 2 BTB 28.12.72RA HSDC    368    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The intention here is to increase Auditor responsibility for the preclear and eradicate the incidence of Out Tech.

Coach with a purpose. Have for your goal when you are coaching that the student is going to get the training drill correct; be purposeful in working toward obtaining this goal. Whenever you correct the student as a coach just don’t do it with no reason, with no purpose. Have the purpose in mind for the student to get a better understanding of the training drill and to do it to the best of his ability. 2. Coach with reality. Be realistic in your coaching. When you give an origination to a student really make it an origination, not just something that the sheet said you should say; so that it is as if the stu-dent was having to handle it exactly as you say under real conditions and circumstances. This does not mean, however, that you really feel the things that you are giving the student, such as saying to him, „My leg hurts.” This does not mean that your leg should hurt, but you should say it in such a manner as to convey to the student that your leg hurts. Another thing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with. Be inventive in present time. 3. Coach with an intention. Behind all your coaching should be your intention that by the end of the session your student will be aware that he is doing better at the end of it than he did at the beginning. The student must have a feeling that he has accomplished something in the training step, no matter how small it is. It is your intention and always should be while coaching that the student you are coaching be a more able person and have a greater understanding of that on which he is being coached. 4. In coaching take up only one thing at a time. For example: Using TR 4, if the student arrives at the goal set up for TR 4 then check over, one at a time, the earlier TRs. Is he confronting you? Does he originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really intend for you to receive it? Are his acknowledg-ments ending the cycles of communication, etc. But only coach these things one at a time; never two or more at a time. Make sure that the student does each thing you coach him on correctly before going on to the next training step.

This does not mean that you should be „never satisfied”. It does mean that a person can al-ways get better and once you have reached a certain plateau of ability then work toward a new plateau. As a coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coach-ing. Never allow yourself to do a sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your student a disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice. If you are ever in doubt about the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing, then the best thing is to ask the supervisor. He will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct ma-terials. In coaching never give an opinion, as such, but always give your directions as a direct statement, rather than saying „I think” or „Well, maybe it might be this way,” etc. As a coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are ob-tained on the student. This does not mean, of course, that you are totally responsible but that you do have a responsibility toward the student and the session. Make sure you always run good control on the student and give him good directions. Once in a while the student will start to rationalize and justify what he is doing if he is doing something wrong. He will give you reasons why and becauses. Talking about such things at great length does not accomplish very much. The only thing that does accomplish the goals of the TR and resolves any differences is doing the training drill. You will get fur-ther by doing it than by talking about it. In the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under „Training Stress” and „Purpose” on the training sheet. These training drills occasionally have a tendency to upset the student. There is a pos-sibility that during a drill a student may become angry or extremely upset or experience some misemotion. Should this occur the coach must not „back off”. He should continue the training drill until he can do it without stress or duress and he feels „good about it”. So, don’t „back off” but push the student through whatever difficulty he may be having. There is a small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when he has gotten the drill right or he has done a good job on a particular step. Besides correcting wrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness. You very definitely „flunk” the student for anything that amounts to „self-coaching”. The reason for this is that the student will tend to introvert and will look too much at how he is doing and what he is doing rather than just doing it. As a coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and don’t become so interested in what you yourself are doing that you neglect the student and are unaware of his ability or inability to do the drill correctly. It is easy to become „interesting” to a student; to make him laugh and act up a bit. But your main job as a coach is to see how good he can get in each training drill and that is what you should have your attention on; that, and how well he is doing."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"COACHING   3   HCOB   24.5.68   HSDC    371    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE To a large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coach-ing.

When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can’t be heard, doesn’t ack, doesn’t give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has out-TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over-acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc’s attention onto himself. So the pc’s attention, not being on his bank, doesn’t as-is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by-passes F/Ns or calls F/Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc „That reads” „That blew down” etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of In-Session.

He does not leave the pc to make a session out of it. The auditor makes the ses-sion. He doesn’t wait for the pc to run down like a clock or just sit there while the TA soars after an F/N.

The maximum talk is the standard model session and the TR 0 to 4 Auditing Comm Cycle only. It is a serious matter to get a pc to “clarify his answer”. It is in fact an Ethics matter and if done habitually is a Suppressive Act, for it will wipe out all gains. There are mannerism additives also.

INVALIDATION To say \"You did not speak loud enough _____\" or any other use of \"you\" is an invali-dation. The pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her. The Auditor is responsible for the session. Therefore the auditor has to assume respon-sibility for all comm breakdowns in it. EVALUATION Far more serious than Invalidation above, is the accidental evaluation which may oc-cur when the auditor repeats what the pc said. Never repeat anything a pc says after him, no matter why.

To say, pointing, \"You mean this item, then,\" is not only an evaluation but a nearly hypnotic command, and the pc feels he must reject very strongly. Don't tell the pc what the pc said and don't gesture to find what the pc meant. Just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again. That's the correct ac-tion. DRIVING IN ANCHOR POINTS Also, do not shove things at a pc or throw things to a pc. Don't gesture toward a pc. It drives in anchor points and makes the pc reject the auditor.

It should be emblazoned upon the foreheads and minds of TR Course Supervisors and all students on TRs Courses in training to become audi-tors. It should be known broadly and understood and emphasized. In 1971, due to the following factors, I found it necessary to modernize TRs 0 to 4. 1. The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs. 2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit. 3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, the balance of the course will fail and supervisors at upper levels will be teaching not their sub-jects but TRs. 4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic proc-esses stem directly from inability to do the TRs. 5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further. 6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. The preclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubs without ARC breaks. These factors hold very true today and always will. Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. Profes-sional TRs Courses are not a tea party. The TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy and HGC and in the future should never be relaxed. A more gradient approach to TRs is taught on specially packaged co-audits for those with no prior technical training, where the same degree of flawlessness and skill demanded of a professional auditor is not demanded of the untrained co-auditor. And there is still another gradient of TRs found on courses for new public in Division 6, where the person is getting his first experience in handling communication in his life and livingness. But on a Professional TRs Course for auditors absolutely no standards are lowered. Professional auditors in training are given real TRs – rough, tough and hard. To do oth-erwise is to lose 90% of the results. There is nothing pale and patty-cake about TRs. This HCOB means what it says. It does not mean something else. It does not im-ply another meaning. It is not open to interpretation from another source. THE A-R-C TRIANGLE As TRs are methods of drilling the communication cycle, one cannot expect to master TRs without familiarity with that cycle.

There is no attempt here to repeat all of the existing data on the ARC Triangle and its use. Any student put on TRs must first have done a sound study of this theory. The data exists in the books: THE PROBLEMS OF WORK, Chapter 6: Affinity, Reality and Communication THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THOUGHT, Chapter 5: The ARC Triangle DIANETICS 55! and in various HCOB Bulletins in the Technical Volumes. A student ready for TR drills would know and would have demonstrated how Affinity, Reality and Communication interrelate. He would be familiar with how one improves the level of ARC by first raising one side of this important triangle in order to raise the next side and the next, and how ARC brings about Understanding. When he has that data he’s better prepared to handle the comm cycle. THE FULL CYCLE OF COMMUNICATION Communication Defined If one were to put it very simply, it could be said, correctly, that communication is the interchange of ideas across space. A finer statement of this is given in the following definition from Axiom 28: Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or parti-cle from source-point across a distance to receipt-point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt-point a duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source-point. The simplest statement of the formula of communication is Cause-Distance-Effect. When we do a close inspection of this formula and the cycle involved, its many ele-ments come to view. The Parts Of The Full Communication Cycle The full cycle of communication is made up of these components: Observation, Confront, Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Par-ticle or Impulse or Message, Distance, Estimation of Distance, Control (Start-Change-Continue-Stop), Direction, Time and Timing, Velocity, Volume, Clarity, Interest, Impinge-ment, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Answer, Acknowledgement, Understanding. It also includes Nothingness or Somethingness."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  4  HCOB  16.8.71RA  HSDC    386    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Each TR drill is designed to train the student in one or more of these various compo-nents, until he has become expert in handling each part of the communication cycle and the communication cycle as a whole. When a student understands and has fully demonstrated the basic theory of communi-cation in clay, including the theory of the ARC Triangle and how it works in practice and the use of the communication cycle and all of its parts, he is well equipped to begin his training in TRs. DRILLING TRS ON A PROFESSIONAL TRS COURSE The student first studies the TR, clears any misunderstood words in it and makes sure he understands it. Then he drills it. He must do TRs. If during the drilling he has questions about the TR, he restudies it and gets right back onto drilling it. At no time may a coach or supervisor give a verbal interpretation of the HCOB. All queries and questions are handled by referring the student to the HCOB, getting him to restudy or re-word clear the drill. Then getting him to do the drill. In addition to this Bulletin, the supervisor may have the student and his twin study, in HCOB 18 Apr 80 TR CRITICISM, the section on the specific TR drill they are trying to do. On professional TRs, done the hard way, students drill each TR to a pass, one at a time. This is the rough, tough way it was done earlier, in the ‘60s, with results. The earlier action of getting a student through each TR itself, one at a time, and increasing the gradient of toughness as he does that TR, is what has proven successful. If a student has trouble and hangs up and can’t pass an upper TR, he hasn’t made it on the lower TRs. This has been proven conclusively. Start him back at the be-ginning of the TRs again. He re-drills each TR until he does it competently to a pass. If he then hangs up on the lower TRs, you would put him all the way back to restudy ARC and the cycle of communication, as there will be something there he hasn’t grasped. TRs are coached and supervised with attention and with the intention of getting the student to win. By win we mean honestly mastering each TR as he goes. There’s got to be a supervisor there to ensure this occurs. Lax, permissive coaching or lax, permissive supervision have no place on a Profes-sional TRs Course. They are simply an extension of the permissiveness of modern education where nobody winds up educated. This is not how we train. Permissiveness is nothing more than a symptom of the inability to confront. A professional TRs Course is taught and taught hard, not permissively. The above points are those which make up the expertise of how it is done.

NUMBER: OT TR 0 1971 REVISED 1980 NAME: Operating Thetan Being There THEORY: OT TR 0 is the drill which provides an undercut to the actual use of the communi-cation formula. For any communication to take place, it requires somebody there. On OT TR 0 the student is drilling simply being there as potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Receipt-point. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Two students sit facing each other with eyes closed, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train the student simply to be there comfortably. The idea is to get the student able to BE there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there and not do anything else but be there. TRAINING STRESS: Students sit facing each other with eyes closed. There is no conversa-tion. This is a silent drill. There is no twitching, moving, confronting with a body part, „sys-tem“ or vias used or anything else added to be there. One will usually see blackness or an area of the room when one’s eyes are closed. Be there, comfortably. This does not mean the stu-dent is supposed to be completely unfeeling or unaware. And he does not get into a figure-figure or go into weird additives or considerations. There is no complexity to this drill. It means exactly what it says – simply be there, comfortably. Students do not coach each other on OT TR 0. The Supervisor does the coaching, covering the whole classroom, spotting any twitches, squirming, etc., and flunking them. If a student goes to sleep or starts boiling off, the supervisor gets him back onto the drill. He simply keeps the students at it. PATTER: None for students. Supervisor starts the drill with „Start“ and uses„That’s it“ to terminate the drill. When he needs to flunk a student he uses „Flunk“ and indicates what the flunk is on. When a student can BE there comfortably for some time, the drill is passed. NOTE: OT TR 0 would only be coached on a student by his twin if the student had flunked a later TR and been put back onto OT TR 0. It is then up to his twin to get him through, coach-ing him as the supervisor would, with the supervisor also keeping an eye on it. This means the student coach (who would have his eyes open for this coaching) sits across from the student who is doing OT TR 0, observing him and flunking twitches, squirming, etc. During this coaching, the coach would use „Start“ „Flunk“ and „That’s it“ as given in the Patter section above.

NUMBER: TR 0 CONFRONTING REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting. THEORY: On TR 0, in addition to potential Cause or Source-point or potential Effect or Re-ceipt-point, the following parts of the comm cycle are entered in: Observation, Distance, Con-sideration, Attention, Confront. COMMANDS: None. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other with eyes open, a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront another person with auditing only or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably in a position three feet in front of another person, to be there comfortably and confront and not do anything else but be there and confront TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making any con-versation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and do noth-ing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle, be embarrassed or anaten, or ex-hibit any reactive body motion which would be distractive to a preclear. TR 0 requires some coaching. It can be done uncoached for an initial period to accustom stu-dents to confronting and to permit some time for student to get through the initial manifesta-tions he may encounter when first doing the drills. Thereafter, the drill is coached on a student by his twin, and vice versa, on a turnabout basis. It will be found the student tends to confront with a body part, rather than just confront, or tends to use a system of confronting rather than just be there. This can show up in any number of ways including fidgeting, giggling, twitching, or any distractive motion or manifestation. Flunks are given for those as they are indications of non-confront, and they would be taken up and coached on the drill. Automatic body functions which are not distractive, such as normal breathing, swallowing, blinking, are not taken up by the coach or the supervisor. To clarify what has been known in the past as „Blinkless TR 0“, the statement should be made that this does not mean the person never blinks. It is defined here finally and in full to mean that when a person’s TR 0 is in he doesn’t exhibit manifestations of inability to con-front, including blinking nervously or flinching or doing anything else that would be distrac-tive to a pc and shows a non-confront. PATTER: When TR 0 is coached, coach uses „Start“ to begin the coaching period. He uses „Flunk“ when the student shows any manifestation of non-confront, indicates what the non-confront is, and uses „Start“ to begin the drill again. „That’s it“ is used to terminate the drill."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  7  HCOB  16.8.71RA  HSDC    389    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE NOTE: The drill is mis-named if Confronting means to do something to the person. The whole action is to accustom an auditor to being there three feet in front of another person without apologizing or moving or being startled or embarrassed or defending self. Confront-ing with a body part can cause somatics in that body part being used to confront. The solution is just to be there and confront. On a Professional TRs Course the student passes when he can just be there and do a straight, uninterrupted 2 hours of good, acceptable confront. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957 to train students to confront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessive compulsions to be „interesting“.

NUMBER: TR 0 BULLBAIT REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Confronting Preclear Bullbaited. THEORY: On TR 0 Bullbaited the student drills being there as potential Cause or Source-point and being there as Effect or Receipt-point, with Duplication. He is also drilling Obser-vation, Distance, Consideration, Attention, Confront and particularly confronting a preclear who is being Cause or Source-point. The gradient of confront is increased on this drill, with emphasis on the fact that the student is confronting a preclear no matter what the preclear says or does. COMMANDS: Coach: „Start“ „That’s it“ „Flunk“. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart – about three feet. PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing or with nothing. The whole idea is to get the student able to be there comfortably and confront a preclear in a position three feet in front of the preclear without being thrown off, distracted or reacting in any way to what the preclear says or does. It is on TR 0 Bullbaited that the student learns to confront a preclear. TRAINING STRESS: After the student has passed TR 0 and he can just BE there comfortably and confront, „bull baiting“ can begin. Anything added to being there and confronting the preclear is sharply flunked by the coach. Twitches, sighs, fidgets, anything except just being there is promptly flunked, with the reason why. PATTER: Student coughs. Coach: „Flunk! You coughed. Start.“ This is the whole of the coach’s patter as a coach. Coach then repeats whatever he had said or done that caused the student to react. He continues to coach the student on that „button“, flattening it to a win for the student before going on to another button or other bullbaiting."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  8  HCOB  16.8.71RA  HSDC    390    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Button: An item, word, phrase, subject, voice tone, mannerism, anything that causes a person to react, causes him discomfort, embarrassment, upset or to laugh uncontrollably, etc. It is called a „button“ because when you push it you get a reaction. PATTER AS A CONFRONTED SUBJECT: Bullbaiting is done on a gradient, giving the stu-dent lighter situations to begin with so student is not plunged into overwhelm at the start. Coach gets the student through the lighter situations and confronting those, then gradually stiffens the gradient, giving the student more and more to confront. The coach may say any-thing or do anything except leave the chair. The student’s „buttons“ should be found (these will be spotted by the coach during drilling) and each button flattened before it is left. A but-ton is never left unflat. Any words that are not coaching words may receive no response from the student. If the student responds, the coach is instantly a coach (see patter above). Student passes when he can BE there comfortably and confront a preclear without being thrown off or distracted or reacting in any way to anything the coach says or does. HISTORY: Developed by L.

NUMBER: TR-1 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Dear Alice THEORY: On TR 1, the student is using Observation, Consideration and confront as previ-ously drilled. He is also drilling being Cause or Source-point, awareness or Effect of Receipt-Point, and as Cause getting a Message (or Impulse or Particle) across a Distance to Receipt-point with Attention, Interest, Control, correct Direction, correct estimation of Distance, Time and correct Timing, correct Velocity, correct Volume, Clarity and Impingement, and with the Intention that it is received and duplicated at Receipt-point. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver a command newly and in a new unit of time to a preclear without flinching or trying to overwhelm or using a via, and to deliver a command with the intention that it is received. COMMANDS: A phrase (with the „he said“ omitted) is picked out of the book Alice in Won-derland and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where he is. In other words it must be received by the coach. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to the coach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural not artificial. Diction and elocution have no part in it. Loudness may have."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED  9  HCOB  16.8.71RA  HSDC    391    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The coach must have received the command (or question) clearly and have understood it be-fore he says „Good“. The operative word here is received. The communication must be re-ceived at Receipt-point as when that has occurred duplication can take place. Any datum that every command must sound exactly like the last command is false. Each question or command is delivered in a new unit of time. When that does not occur the same tonality will be noted, command after command, and the student appears robotic. A command delivered naturally is one that is delivered newly in a new unit of time. Don’t buy an unchanging student or a wrongly done TR. If a student is unchanging (delivers 3 or 4 robotic TR-1s in a row) flunk him, coax him to do it correctly, make sure he knows and understands the drill and do all possible to get him de-livering a command naturally that arrives. But if there is still no change, put him back on OT TR 0 as he hasn’t made it on his lower TRs. PATTER: The coach says „Start“, says „Good“ without a new start if the command is re-ceived. He says „Flunk“ if the command is not received. „Start“ is not used again. „That’s it“ is used to end the activity or to terminate for a brief discussion. Any discussion is kept to a minimum. If student has a question it is acknowledged, student studies the TR again for any necessary clarification and is put back on the drill. If session is terminated for a discussion, coach must say „Start“ again before it resumes. This drill is passed only when the student can put across a command naturally, without strain or artificiality or elocutionary bobs and gestures, and when the student can do it easily and relaxedly. When the coach thinks the student has done it he asks the student if he has done it. If the coach is satisfied that he is receiving the commands, each newly in a new unit of time, and the student is satisfied that he has done it, he passes on to the next TR. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to teach the communication formula to new students. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard 1961 to increase auditing ability. Fur-ther revised by L.

THEORY: On TR 2, the student is using all of those parts of the comm cycle previously drilled. He is also drilling switching from Cause (Source-point) to Effect (Receipt-point) in order to receive, Understand and Duplicate the preclear’s Answer, and then back to Cause to give the Acknowledgement. The real emphasis here is on the drilling of Control (the Start-Change-Stop of a communica-tion), as he uses the Acknowledgement to bring the communication to a full stop. Timing, Velocity, Volume and Impingement also enter into this drill. PURPOSE: To teach the student that an acknowledgement is a method of controlling preclear communication and that an acknowledgement is a full stop. The student must understand and appropriately acknowledge the comm and in such a way that it does not continue the comm."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 10 HCOB 16.8.71RA HSDC    392    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from „Alice in Wonderland“ omitting the „He said“ and the student thoroughly acknowledges them. The student says „Good“, „Fine“, „Okay“, „I heard that“, anything only so long as it is appropriate to the pc’s comm – in such a way as actually to convince the person who is sitting there as the preclear that he has heard it. The coach repeats any line he feels was not truly acknowledged. POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knows it was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and under acknowl-edgement. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgement across, then even him out. Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle of communica-tion or an encouragement to the preclear to go on and that an acknowledgement must be ap-propriate for the pc’s comm. The student must be broken of the habit of robotically using „Good“, „Thank you“ as the only acks. To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc with an acknowledgement or can take a pc’s head off with an acknowledgement. PATTER: The coach says „Start“, reads a line and says „Flunk“ every time the coach feels there has been an improper acknowledgement. The coach repeats the same line each time the coach says „Flunk“. „That’s it“ may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate the ses-sion. „Start“ must be used to begin a new coaching after a „That’s it“.

PURPOSE: To teach the student that a half acknowledgement is a method of encouraging a pc to communicate.

NUMBER: TR 3 REVISED 1961 RE-REVISED 1980 NAME: Duplicative Question. THEORY: On TR 3 the student is drilling using all the parts of the comm cycle, with empha-sis on getting a communication duplicated and completed. PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each time newly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions, and to acknowledge it. To teach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked. COMMANDS: „Do fish swim?“ or „Do birds fly?“ POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unit of time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone be-fore. Duplicating the auditing question without variation in a new unit of time does not mean a robotic duplication of tone of voice, command after command. It means that the original ques-tion asked is asked in a new unit of time without variation of the question. Any idea that the student must give every command sounding exactly like the last command is a false datum and only serves to mis-train the student into robotic delivery. The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in one unit of time. The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she fails to repeat the exact questions, if he or she „Q and As“ with excursions taken by the coach. Q and A means: Asking a question that is based on the last answer. It never completes any cycle. (REF: HCOB 5 APR 1980, Q & A, THE REAL DEFINITION.) The student is also flunked for ro-botic delivery of the question or command. PATTER: The coach uses „Start“ and „Flunk“. „That’s it“ is used to terminate the session. „Start“ must be used to begin a coaching session again after a „That’s it“. The coach is not bound after starting to answer the student’s question but may comm lag or give a commenting type answer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer. Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the stu-dent.

Anything except commands, acknowledgement and as needed, the repeat statement is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement is flunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A is flunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utter the next command (or with a long comm lag) is flunked. A choppy or premature acknowl-edgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) is flunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, „Start“, „Flunk“, „Good“ or „That’s it“ should have no influence on the student except to get him to give a repeat state-ment and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, „I’ll repeat the auditing com-mand.“ „Start“, „Flunk“, „Good“ and „That’s it“ may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Any other statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If he succeeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as „I just had a cognition.“ ‘Coach divertive’ statements should all concern the student, and should be de-signed to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of what the student is doing. The student’s job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, using only command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or her hands to prevent a ‘Blow’ (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than the above, it is a flunk and the coach must say so. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to overcome variations and sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a comm bridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is no longer needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. This TR was redesigned to improve that frailty. Further revised by L.

THEORY: On TR 4 the student drills handling another’s origination of a communication cycle as well as handling his own cycle of communication, and ensuring that both of these cycles are completed. All the parts of the cycle of communication come into play in this drill. PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination. COMMANDS: The student runs „Do fish swim?“ or „Do birds fly?“ on coach. Coach answers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list (see Attachment of this HCOB, taken from the Preclear Origination Sheet at the back of The Book of E-Meter Drills). Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart. TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1. Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feels abruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he cor-rects the student into better handling. PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concern the auditor. Otherwise the coach’s patter is the same as in TR 3 („Start“, „Flunk“, „That’s it“ and „Start“ to resume the coaching session after a „That’s it“). The student’s patter is governed by: 1. Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving the repeat statement „I’ll repeat the auditing command“, and then giving it. Anything else is a flunk. The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem that concerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3.) Flunks are given if the student does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session. Flunks are also given for too abrupt a shift of attention or too slow a shift of attention back to the session, or for failure to return the pc to session at all. Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiate between these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as „pc“ is a flunk."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 14 HCOB 16.8.71RA HSDC    396    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should not always read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. By Originate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. By Comment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations are handled, Comments are disregarded by the student. The coach uses the Comments & Originations Sheet, attached to this issue, choosing items at random to drill the student in handling. When the student has mastered 1. Understanding; 2. Acknowledging; 3. Returning pc to session, the gradient is upped and the student is flunked for any part of the comm cycle being out. This would include non-confront, failure to get a communication across, using a half acknowl-edgement improperly (and thus inviting the pc to continue endlessly when the pc isn’t even answering the question asked) when a full stop acknowledgement is required, failure to en-courage the pc to continue when it is necessary, failure to get the question answered or to de-liver each command in a new unit of time, as well as any flub in handling preclear origina-tions. The drill is passed when the student can handle cycles of communication smoothly and natu-rally. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stay in session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditor more about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks, Further revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1980 to include theory on the comm cycle. As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the comm course TRs despite its appearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors. ROBOTIC TRS Stiff, unnatural TRs are robotic TRs. Students and auditors who haven’t mastered the TRs will handle communication robotically. Anatomy Of A Robot It can be said of robots that: 1. They don’t know what a comm cycle is. 2. They have never really passed OT TR 0. 3. They have never really passed TR 0. 4. They have never really passed TR 0 Bullbait."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED 15 HCOB 16.8.71RA HSDC    397    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 5. They don’t do TR 1 in a new unit of time each time they give it, so they all sound alike and they probably have TR 3 mixed up with TR 1, or they are stuck in an unflat 0 Se-ries (OT TR 0, TR 0, TR 0 BB). 6. They don’t realize their TRs are addressed to the person in front of them but are probably addressed to the instructors for a pass. And so, with a combination of the above, these students and auditors will look like robots. They would never get the product of a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. And it’s possible that they don’t know that that is their product. The point is, how-ever, that it would be almost impossible for any student or auditor to go on looking like a ro-bot if he actually did the TRs. The remedy for robotic TRs is to put the student back onto re-study of the basics, the ARC Triangle and the cycle of communication, and then to re-drill the TRs from OT TR 0 on up, each one this time to a real pass. With these standard actions done he will reach the EP and wind up a Valuable Final Product. VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCT AND END PHENOMENON OF TRS ON A PROFESSIONAL TRS COURSE The Primary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A Professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep a pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor. The Secondary Valuable Final Product of TRs is: A person with the session and social presence of a professional auditor and that pres-ence can be summed up as a being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation no matter how rough. The End Phenomenon of TRs is: A being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out.

He volunteers something all on his own; and do you know that is a very good index of case – whether the person volunteers any-thing on his own? An old-time auditor used this as a case index. He said, “This fellow isn’t getting any better. He hasn’t offered up anything yet.” You see, he didn’t originate – he didn’t originate a communication. So remember that the preclear is as well as he can originate a communication. That means he can stand at Cause on the communication formula. And that is a desirable point for him to reach. But how about in the walk-away world – the world that is ambulant and moving around and spinning quietly, or noisily, as the case may be? Do you ever have to handle an origin in it? Well, I dare say that every argument you have ever got into was because you did not handle an origin. Every time you have ever got into trouble with anybody, you can trace it back along the line you didn’t handle. If a person walks in and says, “Whee! I’ve just passed with the highest mark in the whole school,” and you say, “I’m awfully hungry, shouldn’t we go out and eat?” – you’ll find yourself in a fight. He feels ignored. He originated a communi-cation to have you prove to him that he was there and he was solid. Most little kiddies get frantic about their parents when their parents don’t handle their originations properly. Han-dling an origination merely tells the person, “All right, I heard it, you’re there.” You might say it is a form of acknowledgment, but it’s not; it is the communication formula in reverse. But the auditor is still in control if he handles the origin – otherwise, the communication for-mula goes out of his control and he is at effect point, no longer at cause point. An auditor con-tinues at cause point. So let’s look this over. The handling of an origin has a great deal of use and, until re-cently, it was the least pat step in Scientology. How did you handle an origin? And we finally found out. I finally had a cognition myself. I tried for a long time to communicate this to peo-ple and they still blundered on it occasionally. And I finally found out something that did seem to communicate."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"STEP FOUR – HANDLING ORIGINATIONS 2 HCOB 30.3.73 I HSDC    404    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE There are three steps in handling an origin. Here is the setup: The preclear is sitting in the chair and the auditor is sitting across from the preclear, and the auditor is saying, “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” and the preclear says, “Yes.” Here is the factor, now, entering: “Do fish swim?” The preclear doesn’t answer Do fish swim, the preclear says, “You know – your dress is on fire,’’ or “I’m eight feet back of my head,” or “Is it true that all cats weigh 1.8 kilograms?” You see, wog-wog – where did this come from? Well, although it is usually cir-cuitry or something like that at work when it’s that far off beam, it is, nevertheless, an origin. How do you handle it? Well, you don’t want the preclear to go out of session, and he would if you handled it wrongly, so (1) you answer it; (2) you maintain ARC (you don’t spend any time at it, but you just maintain ARC); and (3) you get the preclear back on the process. One, two, three. And if you spend too much time in (2), you’ll be doing wrong. What is an origin? All right, he says, “I’m eight feet back of my head.” It’s an origin; what are you supposed to do with it? Well, you’re supposed to answer it. In this particular case, you would say to him something in the order of, “You are?” (You mean something like, “I’ve heard the communication – it’s made an effect on me.”) Now, in maintaining ARC you can skimp that second one if you handle the third one expertly enough. The least important one is the second one, but the most deadly thing you can do is utterly to neglect the second one of maintaining ARC. That’s deadly. But you can skip it if you really punch it into the third one, which is to say, get him back into session. So he says, “I’m eight feet back of my head,” and you say, “YOU ARE???” (What he said really hit, you know.) He’s kind of wog-wog about this – he’s not sure what this is all about. You say, “You are?” and the fellow says, “Yes.” “Well!” you say. “What did I say that made that happen?” “Oh, you said ‘Do birds fly?’ and I thought of myself as a bird and I guess that’s the way it is, but I am eight feet back of my head.” “Well, that’s pretty routine,” you say – reassure him, maintain the ARC. “Now, what was that auditing question?” “Oh, you asked me ‘Do birds fly?’ “ And you say, “That’s right. Do birds fly?” Back in session, you see. You can’t do this: You can’t put it into a can and put a label on it and say “This is how you do it always,” because it’s always something peculiar; but you can say these three steps are followed. I will give you another example. You say, “Do birds fly?” and he says, “I have a blinding headache.” “You do?” you say. “Is it bothering you (that’s the ARC) too much to carry on with the session (and you’ve reached number three at once)?” “Oh no – it’s pretty bad though.” “Well, let’s go on with this, shall we?” you say. “Maybe it’ll do something with it (maintaining ARC).”"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"STEP FOUR – HANDLING ORIGINATIONS 3 HCOB 30.3.73 I HSDC    405    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE He says, “Well, all right,” and you’re right back onto it again: “Do birds fly?” One of the trickiest of these is “What in my question reminded you of that?” The fel-low says, “Well, so and so,” and he explains it to you and you say, “Well, good. Do birds fly?” and you’re right back in session again. Three parts, and – that is the important thing – you have to learn how to handle these things. L.

The mood of an auditor, particularly if fixed and chronic, can color the ses-sion and the results he obtains. TRs are a matter of sound, not how an auditor feels. When an auditor has a stuck or fixated mood, such as monotony, timidity, dullness, showing up in his TR drills or in session, this can slow up a pc’s progress or rough up or upset a pc. The auditor’s TRs should sound live and interested and natural. Mood Drills have been developed to handle fixed, uncontrolled or unsuitable tone lev-els in an auditor. These drills consist of drilling TR 1 over and over at each tone level of the full Tone Scale (HCOB 25 SEPT 71RB, REVISED 1 APR 78 TONE SCALE IN FULL). You start low on the scale and do TRs at each tone level in that tone. then up to the next tone, and the next, i.e., TR 1 done over and over at “Dying,” then at the tone of “Useless,” and so on up the scale. The coach simply has the student do TR 1 at the particular tone level so that the coach and the student are both satisfied that the student has conveyed that tone and the student has a win. A technical fact is that moods or emotions are usually “automatic” which means they are not necessarily under control but tend to control the person himself. It is as if he is under other-determinism. Technically, you can “take over” the automaticity and put it under a be-ing’s control just by having him consciously do it over and over. You can also change a chronic tone level by shifting a person’s attention from it by making him do something else. (Reference: “Ability 36” and “Ability – Straight Wire.”) Body position, voice tone, facial expression and attitude are all part of conveying the mood or tone level. For example, the student doing Mood Drills is on TR 1 working on the tone “Anger.” He gives a line from Alice in Wonderland. and it sounds a bit weak. Coach’s patter: “That’s it. It sounds a bit gentle. Let’s get some more G-r-r-r-r in it. Start.” Student repeats the line, but smiles a bit although he sounds more angry. Coach: “That’s it. It sounded more angry, but you smiled. Do it again – you feel angry. Start.” Student gives the line again, this time frowning fiercely and in a very snarly tone of voice, leaning forward aggressively. Coach: “Good! Do you feel you did it?” Coach continues until the student is certain he can do"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"MOOD DRILLS 2 HCOB 21.1.79 HSDC    408    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE it easily. The coach must be able to identify the various emotions and if he is in question about it the dictionary should be resorted to until both student and coach are in agreement on what the tone is or means and that it is being accurately and demonstrably expressed. A student drilling these must beware of Mis-Us and the coach must make sure that he and the student both understand each mood (tone). Any moods that are too easy to do should be spotted by the coach and repeated until the automaticity is broken. If a mood is too hard for the student to master, have him do TR 1 in different being-nesses, e.g., a timid student who is trying to sound antagonistic could be asked to do TR 1 as a panther, a lion, a villain, etc. If you had him do it as a timid bird or some such timid thing that would never be antagonistic you would probably have your student where he lived. Again, do such things to a student win and don’t use it to harass him. The whole point is to get him to do TR 1 antagonistically. These shifts of beingness help to shift his attention off a repulsion to an emotion he cannot easily do. Once begun, Mood Drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the audi-tor doesn’t get stuck on the Tone Scale but can do any mood easily and without strain. When an auditor is upset about his voice, you can have him try speaking melodiously, boringly, en-thusiastically, until he can change his voice mood about at will. Mood Drills should be done when the auditor sounds mechanical, or his tone is brush off, not interested or some set emotion. An auditor can be drilled on assessments in the E-Meter Drill Book with Mood Drills, when his assessment is dull or monotonous. Any set emotion like “sweet,” “light and airy fairy,” or sad, dreary, deadly serious, indifferent can be handled by drilling with Mood Drills. 50 FOOT MOOD DRILLS 50 Foot Mood Drills can be used to cure a fixed mood that doesn’t seem to budge with regular Mood Drills. Student and coach go to an area where they can do some shouting with-out disturbance. The coach and student are at least 50 feet apart and the Mood Drill is done, as described above, at this distance. Mood Drills are not only fun to do, but also enable an auditor to be at cause over how he sounds in a session, without strain and without his own feelings interfering with the ses-sion and thus to get maximum gain for the pc.

There is no guarantee that a scrap or non-standard meterr will behave properly. 4. The only way known to learn to use an E-Meter is use one, handle one, practice with one.

Play catch with it. Don’t just read books about it. 6. Put various persons on the meter. Check them out on Security Checks, rudiments checks, and release checks. Check out dates of incidents. 7. Do Dynamic Assessments. Do goals assessments. 8. The person who says the meter is not a precision instrument is either unfamiliar with one or has something to hide. The auditor’s questions can be off. The meter never is."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 3 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    411    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE B. THEORY 1. The meter tells you what the preclear’s mind is doing when the preclear is made to think of something. 2. The meter registers before the preclear becomes conscious of the datum. It is therefore a pre-conscious meter. The meter passes a tiny current through the preclear’s body. 3. This current is influenced by the mental masses, pictures, circuits and machinery. When the unclear PC thinks of something, these mental items shift and this registers on the meter. 4. Some preclears are in denser masses than others. Therefore the Tone Arm reads very low (most dense), very high, or normal. 5. A low-toned preclear may not be able to influence his mind or body at all and reads the same as a dead body around two or three without action. A low-toned person may read at two or three on the Tone Arm with a sticky needle. 6. A middle-toned preclear reads actively on the meter both Tone Arm and Needle, with low sensitivity setting. 7. A very high-toned person (clear) reads at two or three on the Tone Arm with a free needle. 8. The key difference between a low-toned preclear and a high-toned one is seen in nee-dle response, the low toned having a sluggish needle or a sticky one, the high-toned person having a free needle. 9. The low-toned person cannot answer questions about help intelligently. 10. Thus we see that the E-Meter basically registers the body at two (female) or three (male) on the Tone Arm. If a thetan is ‘dead’ he doesn’t add to or subtract from the reading. If a thetan is ‘partially alive’ he adds or subtracts from the reading. If a thetan is ‘fully alive’ he is not necessarily inside the body he controls and so does not add to or subtract from the reading. "},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 4 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    412    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE C. PRACTICE THE TONE ARM 1. The three general states have many way stops. There is always a lower-toned mockery of higher tones. A low-tone case, to the relatively unskilled, can be at clear read, unre-active on a sticky sort of needle. He cannot however do things in Life. He or she can-not answer questions intelligently about Help or Control. 2. The first advance of a very low-toned case may be to drop into the minus two area on the Tone Arm Dial. 3. Because of the construction of an E-Meter, the Tone Arm cannot pass through the bot-tom of the dial. As a low-toned case gains responsibility, the Tone Arm goes from three or two to 1.5 to 1 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 (for a male) and then to 2 (for a female). This occurs over a long term of processing, of course, and takes many, many hours of proc-essing and the Tone Arm ebbs and flows back and forth. 4. Very few cases are in a ‘dead’ state. Most cases will be found on the Tone Arm around 4 or five. 5. The Tone Arm registers Density of Mass (ridges, pictures, machines, circuits) in the mind of the preclear. This is actual mass, not imaginary, and can be weighed, meas-ured by resistance, etc. 6. Therefore the Tone Arm registers State of Case at any given time in processing. 7. The Tone Arm also registers advance of case during processing by moving. An un-moving case has an unmoving Tone Arm. A moving case has a moving Tone Arm. 8. If a case is not moving, no matter what the preclear says, the Tone Arm is not moving. 9. If a case is moving, no matter what the preclear says, the Tone Arm is moving during processing. 10. If the Tone Arm shows motion, continue the process, until the EP of that process is reached. 11. If the Tone Arm shows no motion, you can change the process. 12. To change a process while the Tone Arm shows good motion will leave the pc with By-Passed Charge. The process should be continued to the EP of that process. 13. When a level of the Pre-Havingness Scale is flat for terminal, the Tone Arm is show-ing very little motion. One must reassess for a new level for the same terminal on the Scale, whereupon the Tone Arm will again show motion. 14. When all levels that needle-register on the Pre-Havingness Scale are flat, the Tone Arm will no longer show motion, but neither will it stick in a frozen way."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 5 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    413    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 15. It is a nice judgment when to leave a process. The judgment is done by the Tone Arm action. 16. When the Tone Arm slows down and isn’t moving more than a quarter of an inch up or down, it is time to reassess. To go longer would stick the Tone Arm and make nee-dle action too stuck for a reassessment to be possible. You will always find any unflat level in future reassessments on the Pre-Havingness Scale so it is not dangerous to so leave one. It is dangerous to leave a level of the Pre-Havingness Scale when the Tone Arm shows motions of one inch up or down the Tone Arm Dial, as the preclear will get confused. 17. Take hold of the Tone Arm of your E-Meter. Set it at 4.5 on its dial. Move it to 3. Move it to 5. Now pretend a period of twenty minutes. Move the Tone Arm from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 4.5, then from 4.5 to 3.5, then from 3.5 to 4.8, then from 4.8 to 4. If all that happened in twenty minutes of processing, that is terrific Tone Arm motion. The case would be changing very, very well. You would not change a process. You would go on running the same process. 18. Take the Tone Arm in hand again. Set it at 3.5. Pretend a period of twenty minutes. Move it from 3.5 to 3.3. Move it from 3.3 to 3.6. Move it from 3.6 to 3.4. If that’s all that happened in twenty minutes of processing, be alert, for you’d better reassess for a new level for the termination the Pre-Havingness Scale. The Tone Arm may be getting ready to stick. 19. But don‘t be surprised if the Tone Arm motion suddenly picks up again. If it does, carry on with the same process. 20. The above give you two extremes of Tone Arm motion. The first example is excellent motion. The second example is poor motion. Between these two examples you have a variety of types of motion. 21. In using the meter you are trying to (a) assess for a process that will produce Tone Arm motion and (b) run the motion out of the Tone Arm. 22. When the Tone Arm does not move under processing one of two things is true: (a) you didn’t get the right process to run, or (b) you have run it flat. The remedy for (a) is to do better assessment and run another process. The remedy for (b) is to do another as-sessment. 23. That the Tone Arm moves under processing denotes a change in the preclear’s mind. That the Tone Arm doesn’t move under processing denotes no change of mass, pic-tures, machinery or circuits in the preclear. 24. When a preclear is clear he may occasionally get some Tone Arm motion due to purely body electronics but in the main reads at male or female on the arm (3 or 2) ac-cording to his or her sex. 25. As a preclear nears clear, an assessment plus a few commands will ‘blow’ the con-nected masses and thus flatten the terminal chosen. As a preclear gets even nearer, as-sessment alone blows the remaining masses. Therefore, when the state is approached,"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 6 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    414    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE the Tone Arm motion gets less and less, no matter what you do. But the condition is self-evident when observed, the preclear gaining more and more effect on his bank with less and less time necessary to remedy a condition.

The Tone Arm stops moving and sticks because the assessment and process have dragged in a picture, chain, or mass upon the preclear that the command as-ises only part of. When the process is no longer as-ising the picture or mass, yet is still restimu-lating it, the Tone Arm registers that the picture, chain or mass is there but not chang-ing. Another process from the Pre-Havingness Scale for the same terminal is now needed to as-is another portion of the picture, chain or mass. Thus the Tone Arm starts moving again. 2. When you overrun a process level of the Pre-Havingness Scale, particularly early in processing, you can pull this picture, chain or mass in so strongly (running a stuck Tone Arm) that reassessment becomes very difficult as nothing moves the meter. 3. Stop running a level while you can still read the meter. 4. If you do overrun too far, still try to read the meter for a new level of assessment. If you can’t, run the change process to get back action and then reassess the same termi-nal. You will now be able to read the meter. To have to do this, however, is pretty dull. 5. Processes move in or activate pictures, chains, masses, machinery, circuits, and nullify them, thus clearing people. Life is doing this to them all the time without running them out. 6. The mechanics of the mind in clearing are only those mentioned in this section. To try it without a meter, or without knowing a meter well, is of course beyond the observa-tional ability of Homo Sapiens. 7. Only a meter registers these mechanics. Only processes blow these barriers to living. "},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 8 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    416    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE E. THE SENSITIVITY KNOB 1. The sensitivity knob increases the swing of the needle. 2. To run with too high a sensitivity makes the auditor’s work unreliable. 3. To run with too low a sensitivity makes the needle unable. 4. The sensitivity knob is adjusted at the start of the rudiments, any assessment, or any process or when the auditor wants to know. 5. The exact setting of the sensitivity knob is done as follows: Have the preclear hold the electrodes (cans) in his hands with the cans in contact with the cups of his palms and all his fingers and both thumbs in a comfortable grip. Set the sensitivity at 5 and adjust the position of the needle to set. Have the preclear squeeze the cans with an even gradual pressure, not a sudden hard squeeze. Watch the distance the needle drops. If the distance the needle fell is less than one-third of a dial drop, raise the sensitivity some and get another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you’ve got the sensi-tivity setting that gives you one third dial drop on the can squeeze. If the can squeeze gave you more than one-third dial drop at Sens. 5, lower the sensitivity setting a bit, test another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you get one-third of a dial drop. In other words, keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than one-third of a dial drop, until you get the correct sensitiv-ity setting. 6. On older meters, as the preclear gets to release, you can’t get just one-third of a dial - you get more even with the knob on the lowest sensitivity. Set it as low as you can and use it anyway. 7. In short, adjust the sensitivity knob to get a third of a dial drop on the can squeeze, or as close to that as you can. 8. If at any time the needle doesn’t react and you want a comparative reaction between two or more questions, increase the knob, read the question responses, and then set it back again for running. 9. If you change the sensitivity knob during an assessment, you have to do the whole assessment again on the new setting as the amount of needle fall will be changed. 10. In running rudiments, when suspicious, set the sensitivity knob higher. 11. In looking for suspected withholds in particular, read with a high knob. 12. By holding a constant sensitivity knob during an assessment or during a process, you find out how the preclear is reacting on the needle relative to the start of the assess-ment or process.

A needle is monitored by the sensitivity knob, the Tone Arm and the momentary or changing reactions of the preclear. 2. There are ten main needle actions: (1) Stuck (2) No reaction (nul) (3) Fall (4) Change of characteristic (5) Rise (6) Theta bop (7) Rock slam (8) Free needle (9) Body reactions (10) Stage Four 3. In a totally stuck needle (1) the preclear would not even register being pinched. It looks stiff. In a nul needle (2) the question does not change the needle behaviour. In the presence of an ARC break with the auditor, the needle is liable not to register any reaction at all, and to look like a nul needle; therefore, before writing off any as-sessment item, prep-check, or security check question as nul, be sure to check for - and repair - any ARC break. 4. A falling needle (3) makes a dip to the right as you face the meter. A fall may consist of half a division (about one-eighth of an inch) or may consist of fifteen dials (the whole meter face dropped fifteen times). It is still a fall. A fall always happens at the exact end of the question asked. It is also called a drop, a dip and a register. It denotes that a disagreement with life on which the preclear has greater or lesser reality has met the question asked. 5. A fall is the most used and observed needle action. It means to the auditor, ‘I’ve found it’, or ‘I’ve gotten a response in the bank‘. It is the click of the light switch illuminat-ing where we are going. 6. Falls are measured relative to falls. That’s why we leave the sensitivity alone when we are looking for something question by question. 7. Given two falls, the longer fall is the right one. For instance, a question about ‘Joe’ gets three-eighths of an inch of fall. A question about ‘Mabel’ right after gets five-eighths of an inch of fall. The right answer is Mabel."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 10 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    418    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 8. Any fall denotes there is something there. Any fall at any sensitivity level on rudi-ments questions denotes the presence of a bad reaction to the room, an ARC break, a withhold, or a present time problem and must be cleared no matter what the preclear says. 9. A fall follows at once at the end of the last word of the question asked.“ 10 A fall is the diagnostic meter action. Set for falls a still needle as given under Sensitiv-ity above. 11. In starting out the first thing you want to know is, ‘Is the preclear reading on this me-ter?’ You get the preclear to squeeze the cans. You get a fall as he does. Oh. He or she is reading on the meter. The meter is not broken or turned off or disconnected. It is the fall that tells us. 12. The next thing we want to know is rudiments. It is the fall that tells us what we must handle. 13. The next thing is the assessment. It is degree of fall that tells us what is right, for we always take the greatest fall we can obtain, the sensitivity being kept constant. 14. The next thing is the running. We ignore the fall now and watch the Tone Arm instead. The needle, of course, has to move if the Tone Arm is going to move, but, until we want more rudiments type answers or until we want a new assessment, we ignore the needle and watch only the Tone Arm. 15. Change of characteristic (4). Sometimes, as in old Dynamic Assessment, we cannot get clean falls on what we are looking for. Another guide is ‘change of characteristic’ of the needle. 16. The needle is doing a pattern of small rises and falls. We ask a question, it stops mov-ing. We ask another question, it resumes idly rising and falling as before. That stop is a change of characteristic. Or the needle is stopped while we ask a long series of ques-tions but suddenly does a small dance. That is a change of characteristic. 17. Change of characteristic occurs when we hit on something in the preclear’s bank. It occurs only when and each time that we ask that exact question. As the question or item alone changes the needle pattern, it can be further explored with the suppress and invalidate buttons to see if it develops into a SF, F, LF or BD, which then can be used.5 18. A question that stops a rising needle is a change of characteristic question and like a fall means we have struck something. Further exploration may develop it into a fall. 19. By using ‘change of characteristic’ we can sometimes get our foot in the door and get into a channel that brings about falls. 20. A whole assessment can be done by change of characteristic as well as by falls but it is not usual and, in fact, will develop falls anyway if you are on to something hot.   5 Editor’s note: In the original version before Revision by HCO PL 21 Feb 79, this sentence read: „As the questi-on or item alone changes the needle pattern, we must assume that that is it and we use it.“"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 11 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    419    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 21. It is not much used but must be known as it may have to be used sooner or later when we can’t get falls. The only needle reactions in which you should be interested are those which occur INSTANTLY, i.e. An instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which oc-curs at the precise end of any major thought voiced by the auditor. 22. Rises (5). A rising needle means ‘no confront’. 23. Of course a needle must rise at times or the Tone Arm would never move. But it still means that the preclear has struck an area or something he isn’t confronting. One never calls his attention to this. But one knows what it is. 24. The only use a rising needle has at this time is to stop going up the Pre-Havingness ladder with a terminal assessment when the needle begins a marked rise. You have ex-ceeded the preclear’s reality and he isn’t confronting, so you’d better turn around and go down the ladder again before you get things too unreal for him by asking if the terminal can do things the preclear can’t imagine it could do. 25. The right circuit, valence, machinery, called off, will stop a rising needle. This was once used but is not necessarily employed at this time. 26. The rising needle is, therefore, not much employed, but one should recognize one. It is a steady, constant movement of the needle, rather slow, from right to left. 27. A needle returning to position after a fall is not a rising needle. 28. A Theta Bop (6) is a small or wide steady dance of the needle. Over a spread of one-eighth of an inch, say (depending on sensitivity setting - it can be half an inch), the needle goes up and down perhaps five or ten times a second. It goes up, sticks, falls, sticks, goes up, sticks, etc., always the same distance, like a slow tuning fork. It is a constant distance and a constant speed. 29. A theta bop means ‘death’, ‘leaving’, ‘don’t want to be here’. It is caused by a yo-yo of the preclear as a thetan vibrating out and into the body or a position in the body. It’s as if the needle is jumping between two peaks across a narrow valley. Mention death to anyone (or make them think about it) while they’re on a meter and you’ll see a theta bop. 31. Its use is to detect whether a preclear is being left stuck in death, or to locate death or departures. 32. If a preclear wants badly to get out of session he or she may start theta bopping with-out being stuck in a death. But few theta bops mean the preclear wants to leave ses-sion. It’s most often turned on for ‘desire to leave session’ during as security check. 33. If you get a ‘bop’ turned on during an assessment (or a security check) it takes it quite a while, sometimes, to turn off. The next several questions after a ‘bop’ turns on are therefore seldom validly readable. Just keep on with an assessment but be careful to go over the ground again and again if you’re getting a ‘bop’. Theta bops turn on fast and turn off slowly."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 12 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    420    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 34. They are not very important in diagnosis. They’re more interesting than vital. 35. Rock slam (7). In assessing or running you occasionally get a Rock Slam. A Rock Slam means a hidden Evil Intention on the subject or question under discussion or au-diting. 36. A Rock Slam is a crazy, irregular, left-right slashing motion of the needle. It repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely, faster than the eye easily follows. The needle is frantic. The width of a Rock Slam (R/S) depends largely on sensitivity set-ting. It goes from one-fourth inch to whole dial. But it slams back and forth. It means hot item in an assessment and takes precedence over a fall or it means that you have left rings on the pc’s hands or have a loose connection in the leads or meter. If the lat-ter two items verify as not present you are looking at a Rock Slam in the pc. 37. It differs from a theta bop, which has no precedence over a fall, in that a theta bop is even and gentlemanly and a Rock slam is as crazy as a Commie agitator. 38. If found in an assessment, use it, but make sure of what turned it on before you buy. It means the item is hot. 39. If found in running a process, just carry on. It means the going is hot, so for Heaven’s sakes don’t stop the session. 40. Free needle (8). This is probably the least understood term and needle action in all of E-Metering. 41. It means the same as a Floating Needle, which is a rhythmic sweep of the dial at a slow, even pace of the needle, back and forth, back and forth, without change in the width of the swing except perhaps to widen as the pc gets off the last small bits of charge. Note that it can get so wide that you have to shift the Tone Arm back and forth, back and forth, to keep the needle on the dial in which case you have a floating tone arm. 42. Man, it’s really free. 43. You’ll know one when you see one. They’re really pretty startling. The needle just idles around and yawns at your questions on the subject. 44. It can occur after a cognition, blowdown of the Tone Arm, at a release point, or on the erasure of a Dianetic chain. 45. Use NUL as a word, not Free, if you’re in doubt about it. A NUL just doesn’t fall on a question. It might fall on a similar question. A Free Needle wouldn’t fall if the psy-chiatrists surrendered in a body or the Empire State Building fell down. 46. A Free Needle or Floating Needle is one of the parts of the End Phenomena for any process or action. 47. Tight needles (stuck) are far from free. A stuck needle can be made to fall by advanc-ing the sensitivity way up. Thus even a ‘stuck needle’ can be ‘nul’. But a Free Needle is not stuck or nul. It just floats around."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 13 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    421    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 48. Body reactions (9). The deep breathing of a preclear, a sigh, a yawn, a sneeze, a stom-ach growl can any one of them make a needle react. 49. Get a person on the cans. Turn the sensitivity high. Make him do the following one at a time: sigh, yawn, breathe deeply, cough, laugh, knock the cans together, lift a finger off the electrode (can), convulsively grip the cans, scratch his head while holding the cans, scratch his leg, rub a can against his or her shirt or skirt, rub his fingers together without letting the cans touch, and stretch. Note the needle reactions. Now have the person do all these things again as you read them off. Now turn down the sensitivity knob so that the needle drops one-third of a dial (about one and a half inches). Now with that setting, read off the list to him and watch the needle. 50. Do you see now why you don’t run with high sensitivity? 51. These are body reactions. 52. The meter will also read Basal Metabolism, interesting because it tells you if the pre-clear really is eating, or has eaten breakfast. Have the preclear on the cans take a very deep breath. If a moment later the needle falls half a dial (two inches or more) the pre-clear has a good high Basal Metabolism. If he hasn’t eaten breakfast, it won’t fall like that. On the second or third deep breath let out, the Basal Metabolism stops register-ing, so the first time is the test, not subsequent tries. 53. You can also make a high sensitivity set needle jump by ‘imagining’ the preclear’s hands being better connected to the cans and ‘seeing’ a whitish glow between cans and finger tips. That is, if you’re in good shape. You can also do it by ‘seeing’ this glow in the area of a preclear’s old injury. That’s the extent of your influencing the preclear and the meter reading outside of auditing. 54. You can also (after you’ve been talking to, not processing, a preclear) set the meter on yourself, then give the cans to the preclear and he or she will read the same adjust-ments for a few moments. 55. These are all more or less Body Reactions. They get in your road as to movement and sneezes and they don’t affect your processing as to ‘cross currents’ between auditor and preclear So bear up under them and skip them. They’re not important once you know what they are. 56. Stage Four (10). This is the sole survivor of an old system (20th ACC) that used four stages of meter reaction as a test of state of case. 57. A Stage Four Needle is still important to identify when met as it means this preclear is from Noplace as a case. 58. A Stage Four is below a merely stuck needle. The preclear’s thoughts and few of your questions have any bearing on the preclear’s case. This is most promising as CCH stuff. But not only a Stage Four takes CCH. (See Director Processing Check Type One for case reactions that take CCH.) 59. Possibly the change process or attention process may bite here."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 14 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    422    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 60. A Stage Four needle goes up about an inch or two (always the same distance) and sticks and then falls, goes up, sticks, falls, about once a second or so. It is very regular, always the same distance, always the same pattern, over and over, on and on, and nothing you say or the preclear says changes it (except Body Reactions). 61. Break through this meter action by pulling withholds or unkind thoughts or the Jo’burg Security Check or the CCHs or processes, and you have busted the lowest level of the case. 62. But it’s a disheartening phenomenon. The E-Meter just doesn’t react to anything ex-cept a kick in the head. Up, stick, fall, up, stick, fall. On and on like a metronome set for the Dead March of Saul. Know it when you see it. Until you break it, there’s no case change.

The Thirty-six Havingness and Confront Processes are tested for on the E-Meter in an exact way. 2. The Havingness Process is located on the needle by the preclear squeezing the cans before the command is tested and after it has been run five to eight commands. 3. If the second squeeze shows the needle looser (wider swing) than the first squeeze did, you’ve got it. The command you are testing is the Havingness Command for the pre-clear and may thereafter be used at intervals to set up the room in Rudiments, gain havingness before or after processes and at session end, using only ten or twelve commands at a time. 4. The Confront Process from the Thirty-six Presessions is located on the Tone Arm. If eight or ten commands of one of these moves the Tone Arm, that’s the Confront Proc-ess to be used after other processes and before the Havingness Process. 5. Havingness is tested on the Needle with can squeezes. 6. Confront is tested on the Tone Arm by its motion. 7. If the process tested for Havingness tightens the needle during the test, get rid of it. Don’t bridge off. Just get off now. 8. If the process being tested for Confront fails to move the Tone Arm during test after eight or ten commands, get off it, don’t bridge off. (No more commands of it.) 9. The Havingness Process selected, even if the right one, if run too much (more than ten or twenty commands), will start running the bank. It doesn’t harm the preclear, but that isn’t its use. The Tone Arm may ‘blow down’ toward clear if you run fifteen min-utes or half an hour of the Havingness Process. Again, it might not. The purpose of a havingness process is to get the preclear stabilize in is environment. It will also do other things if overrun, none bad, but other processes do them better. 10. The Confront Process gets the preclear to present time from areas on the track where his attention was fixed by an earlier process. 11. Use of the Havingness Process of the preclear (ten to twelve commands at a time) plus the Confront Process of the preclear (run ten or fifteen minutes, ended with preclear in or near present time) followed by the Havingness Process, followed by the Confront, etc., etc., just as above, often can bring the preclear down to his clear reading if carried on. This is known as stabilizing a case. It should be done before a person is a release. It is never done now to start a case, despite the name of the Thirty-six Havingness and Confront Processes (Presessions). We can now start cases faster using SOP Goals or attention or change or the CCHs. But the meter behaviour and the necessity of Hav-ingness and Confront Processes remain the same. It must be done at some stage of the case. It is usually done after the first SOP Goals terminal and goal are flat on the Pre-"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 16 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    424    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Havingness Scale, and should be done before the person is pronounced a Release.

In using the meter for Security Checking you establish needle response to common (non-meaningful) questions. Seeing this, you do not mistake a real fall when it comes. 2. On meaningful questions you look for falls. A fall means ‘Oh, oh! He’s got me.’ You don’t leave a question that is getting a fall response until you are sure you have been told all and the needle no longer falls when you ask that question. 3. If the needle still falls on the question, you have one of two things: (a) the preclear hasn’t told all; or (b) there’s an earlier similar overt or withhold. 4. In the case of (a) you keep asking in various ways until it’s cleared (no fall even with a high sensitivity knob - and you do turn up the knob on a question that didn’t respond well at first and then turn it back before you go on to the next). 5. In the case of (b) when there’s an earlier similar overt or withhold, you must ask for it and get it. 6. A person being security checked is subject to mental dispersal. You may get only one fall and then no fall at all for one or two repeats and then a fall. You haven’t asked quite the right question. The preclear is trying to ignore it. The rule is, if you get a trace of a fall or reaction on a question, beat at by varying your wording of the ques-tion or slightly shift the type of question. In any event, be sure not to leave a trace of a reaction or a single reaction until you are certain it won’t develop. 7. If the preclear tells you a withhold, you get all the data and handle it earlier similar withhold as necessary to an F/N. 8. The fall comes out if the preclear tells all. The fall stays or gets worse if the preclear is hedging. 9. On a security check, follow up every change of characteristic, if it is instant, before you go on. Change of characteristic, if it amounts to anything, will develop into a fall. 10. If the preclear hasn’t told all or there’s an earlier similar overt or withhold, the meter won’t clear. 11. Don’t be fooled by excuses. Don’t discredit the meter (the preclear’s first attempt when he’s in a really tight spot). 12. The meter is right. 13. If a question won’t clear it’s (a) or (b) above and that’s the total of it. 14. Grim experience of a decade has taught me that it’s (a) or (b) and never ‘I moved the needle myself’ or ‘I feel nervous just generally’. The E-Meter is right even when it seems to make the preclear wrong, except when it’s a false read which can be checked for."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 18 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    426    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 15. The mark of a good Security Checker is thorough, swinish suspicion and no belief in mankind or the devil - only the meter. 16. PEOPLE’S CASES WILL NOT MOVE UNTIL THEY ARE CLEAR ON ALL WITHHOLDS, SO A THOROUGH CHECK IS REALLY A KINDNESS AFTER ALL."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 19 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    427    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE I. METER ODDITIES 1. There are few exceptions to the rule with E-Meters. They are a study composed of facts which have right or wrong answers and the answers to E-Meter questions are all in black and white. 2. These are the known exceptions: 3. Some people (a very few in very bad shape) get a rise when they are asked to squeeze the cans. This is a reverse action. It means nothing except they need to be started in low levels. 4. Some preclears, in very bad shape, rock slam when security checked and one can’t find what is rock slamming. As nothing clears the slam, they have to be flunked, au-dited, and tried again. 5. In South Africa a Bantu’s withholds read not on the needle alone but on the Tone Arm as well. The Tone Arm goes up as much as two divisions (3 to 5) just before you get off a bad withhold on one. 6. High Tone Arms on anyone (or very low) mean lots of holds - but they might not be conscious of them all at once. They come off session by session as we run along. 7. Holding the two cans in the right hand with a paper between so they don’t short is the way to free a preclear’s hands for pointing out things. If you change hands and he holds them in the left, the meter will read differently. This only means he is electroni-cally imbalanced (old Epi-Centres) and has no other use. 8. Preclears claim sometimes they are pushing the meter about, ‘that’s why it reads’. You could also ask, „Then why didn’t you prevent it from reading?’ - but don’t really ask them that. 9. The meter ‘knows’ more about the preclear than the preclear. It is reading created masses he is withholding himself from. The preclear won’t confront all he is creating. Hence the omniscience of the meter. 10. Dating things on a meter is not as important as it was, I but a skilled auditor should be able to do it. It isn’t covered here because few can do it well and it looks so compli-cated you might miss the important things and they are all in this book. Dating is well covered in ELECTROPSYCHOMETRIC AUDITING, the first book on the meter, and the later book, THE HUBBARD ELECTROMETER. 11. Another E-Meter oddity occurs when asking a preclear to do a lie reaction test. Some will get a fall only on the truth. Some will get a fall every time they are asked to an-swer only in the negative, or will get a fall only with the positive replies. This is not very important. The important thing about a lie reaction test is whether or not the per-son is reading on the E-Meter and the characteristic needle response to vital questions remains unchanged. The lie reaction test is given to study needle pattern for the pre-clear, not to establish his lies."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"E-METER ESSENTIALS 20 1961, REV. 21.2.79 HSDC    428    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE J. METER FRAILTIES 1. E-Meter faults occur in new meters or after long use. They are few. 2. If the meter doesn’t register the squeeze the preclear gives the cans, it isn’t turned on or connected up or it isn’t working. See the mechanical direction sheet for setting up a particular meter and follow it before you decide a meter is out of order. 3. If a meter registers the can squeeze, it is usually in good working order. 4. The batteries rarely run down in a British Hubbard Electrometer, the drain being ‘the shelf life’ of the battery even if you left it on for weeks day and night. This is not true of the American Hubbard Electrometer (steel case). Its batteries can run down if it’s left on for days. 5. If the meter is not in working order when you get it, send it to the manufacturer or the Director of Materiel in a Central Organization or HCO for repairs. Don’t try to fix it yourself. 6. If it is responding to a can squeeze when turned on according to directions, it is un-doubtedly faithfully all right throughout. The Hubbard Electrometers don’t go slightly Wrong. They either work or they don’t. 7. One exception: The British and American Hubbard Electrometer early models includ-ing the Mark V until February 1979 had a ‘carbon pot’ which is to say the Tone Arm was in ‘pure carbon bearings’, if you could call it that. A speck of dust can get in the ‘pot’ and cause the needle to rock slam whether connected to the preclear or not. Pull the lead wire jack (disconnecting cans) and if the slam continues, it’s the ‘pot’ that’s wrong. Work the Tone Arm vigorously for a while. If that doesn’t stop it, turn it in to be repaired. Later models of the British and American Hubbard Electrometer have ‘wire wound pots’ and this doesn’t happen. 8. If the batteries go down after a year or two, the ‘test’ won’t register in its needle dial area. Be sure the meter is set up for use before you use Test as in the British meter Test can be thrown off by the zero setting knob (‘Trim’) and you’ll think the batteries are down when they’re not. If they‘re down get some new ones. They’re available anywhere there’s an electric shop. Anybody can install them. It’s cheaper than ship-ping, but HCO will do it if you like. 9. The ancient tube (valve) meters that connected to the Mains still work on all the above rules. But they pass an uncomfortably strong current through the preclear and some-times shock him. Also, after the 1950 models, they became too fancy in design with too many dials and knobs for intelligent use - too many variables could be run in on them. 10. Squirrel meters or home-built meters maybe right or wrong but they are noted for in-accurate needle behaviour. Some don’t show bops because the Potentiometer used was too cheap. Some register a half a second or a second late on questions. Some are so lightly needled that they register everything they can.

The Tone Arm’s most looked for reactions are: (a) change of position, and (b) ceasing to change position. 8.

These are the result of minor thoughts which may or may not be restimulated by the question. Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudi-ments, What questions, etc. The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall, double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end of the major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (the end of the major thought) the question is nul. By „major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by the auditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are „prior reads”. Reads which occur later than its completion are „latent reads”. By „minor thought” is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the major thought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They are ignored. Example: „Have you ever injured dirty pigs?” To the pc the words „you”, „injured” and „dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minor thoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter. The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts „you”, „injured” and „dirty”. Therefore the E-Meter needle may respond this way: „Have you (fall) ever injured (speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs (fall)?” Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (bold-italic type in the sentence above) indicates anything. If that last reaction was absent, the whole sentence is nul despite the prior falls."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"INSTANT READS 2 HCOB 25.05.62 HSDC    434    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You can release the reactions (but ordinarily would not) on each of these minor thoughts. Exploring these prior reads is called „compartmenting the question”. Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case, written in 1960, of „getting P.D.H.ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can prove anything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major thought: „Have you ever been P.D.H.ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such a silly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the major thought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P.D.H.ed by a cat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the whole thought. Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random per-sonal restimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’s thinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare. We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought without lag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc. That is what is called an „instant read”. There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudi-ments in one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the only apparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudi-ments in one sentence. A clumsy question which puts „in this session” at the end of the major thought can serve the auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, „In this session have you......?” You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analyti-cal thought will not react instantly. The reactive mind is composed of: 1. Timelessness. 2. Unknownness. 3. Survival. The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reacts instantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind. If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear. An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter. Only reactive thoughts react instantly. You can „groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third time if it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior reads drop out leaving only the whole thought. If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughts you will get lost.

In rudiments, What questions, et al, you want the instant read only. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning a rudiment or a What question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle. The exceptions to this rule are: 1. „Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at the ex-act end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data not related to the whole thought. 2. „Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the same as the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a whole thought reacting. You say „there” or „that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at as you say it, recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the whole thought clears or has to be further worked and cleared. You can easily figure-figure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter reads unless you get a good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole ex-pressed thought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for the answer to the question you asked.

Since being audited quite a few rock slams have been observed on me. In the rudiments, on lists, between comm lags, button checks, in fact any method of auditing which required the use of an E-Meter. With the advent of R2-12, I had many lists, all chock full of items that had rock slammed at one time or an-other. The supposedly phantom rock slam served to hang up many sessions and auditing be-came quite a drag even though one true package was found in spite of the rock slams that went on forever. Recently I was sent to get HGC auditing and the rock slams were ever present until my Auditor, Joe Fortner, got a little suspicious and had me take off the two rings I wore, one on either hand. They disappeared. Hundreds of things that had rock slammed no longer rock slammed. Hundreds of almost, not quite reliable items are dead now and in all truth, most of them have no meaning to me anyway.

Whereas a Sens 16-128 will show reads and F/Ns. A pc can be hindered by the auditor not setting the Sensitivity high enough to show reads and F/Ns. Items are missed as well as F/Ns. TOO HIGH When auditing a flying pc or a Clear or OT the auditor who sets the Sensitivity too high gets weird impressions of the case. „Latent reads” on such a case are common. They aren’t latent at all. What happens is that the F/N is more than a dial wide at high Sensitivity and a started F/N looks like a read as its sweep is stopped by the pin on the right of the dial. In this way uncharged items are taken up, the case is slowed, overrun and general up-sets requiring repairs occur. On one hand electrode an OT VII sometimes has a ¾ dial wide F/N at Sens 5-32. This would mean a 3/4 dial F/N at Sens 2-32 with two cans. A Clear sometimes has a floating TA at Sens 32-32 instead of an F/N. He would have to be run at Sens 3-32 two cans to keep him on a dial or detect F/Ns. This is a very important matter as the auditor will miss F/Ns, think beginning F/Ns are reads and as the Pre-OT is off the dial, miss reads. Thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed.

It can be as small as 1 “ or as large as dial wide. It does not fall or drop to the right of the dial. It moves to the left at the same speed as it moves to the right. It is observed on a Mark V E-Meter calibrated with the TA between 2.0 and 3.0 with GIs in on the pc. It can occur after a cognition blowdown of the TA or just moves into floating. The pc may or may not voice the cognition. It, by the nature of the E-Meter reading below the awareness of the thetan, occurs just before the pc is aware of it. So to give a “That’s it” on the occurrence of the F/N can prevent the pc from getting the cognition. Pcs and pre-OTs often signal an F/N with a “Pop” to the left and the needle can actu-ally even describe a pattern much like a Rock Slam. Meters with lighter movement do “pop” to the left and R/S wildly for a moment. One does not sit and study and be sure of an “F/N”. It swings or pops, he lets the pc cognite and then indicates the F/N to the pc preventing overrun. A one hand electrode sometimes obscures an F/N and gives false TA. If used, use higher sensitivity and get the TA from 2 cans when needed. L.

Auditors have also called F/Ns which were ARC break needles, thus falsely indicating to the pc. These two actions – disregarding actual F/Ns because the TA was not between 2.0 and 3.0 and calling “F/Ns” that were actually ARC break needles – have upset many preclears. The outnesses here are: A. not considering pc indicators as senior and B. not noting pc indicators when calling an F/N and C. ignoring and giving junior importance to the technol-ogy covered in false TAs. (See list of references at end of this HCOB or the Subject Index of the HCOB Volumes.) Auditors have even been led to falsify worksheets (giving TA as in range when it ac-tually was not when calling an F/N) because they might “get in trouble” for calling an F/N in the wrong range, such as 1.8 or 3.2. The correct procedure for out of range F/Ns is: 1. Look at the pc’s indicators. 2. Call the F/N regardless of its range. 3. Mark down the actual TA position. 4. Handle the false TA at the earliest opportunity when it will not intrude into the current cycle on which the pc is being audited. (You don’t interrupt a Quad R3RA, for in-stance, to handle false TA; you complete it and then, when directed by the C/S, you handle the false TA.)"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"SCIENTOLOGY F/N AND TA POSITION 2 HCOB 10.12.76RA HSDC    450    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 5. On any pc you suspect has had his F/Ns disregarded because of false TA, you C/S for and get run a repair and rehab of this error. E-Meter cans can monitor or change TA position when the palms are too dry or too wet or when the cans are too big or too small or when the wrong hand cream is used. The E-Meter does not read on hand moisture alone as was long believed by people in electronics. But TA depends upon resistance to electrical current in the palms, leads, and meter as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them. To simply tell some interne “Always disregard an F/N not in correct range” is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes. The correct information is that an F/N which isn’t in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an F/N or not. AND indicates you better get the false TA handled fast as soon as it won’t interrupt the current cy-cle. And you always note where it F/Ned so the C/S can C/S for false TA handling. Where an ARC break needle (which looks like an F/N) is observed, whether it is in range or out of range (2.0 to 3.0 or below 2.0 or above 3.0) you look at the pc and establish the pc’s indicators before falsely calling an F/N. A pc who is about to cry is not an F/Ning pc and if you indicate an F/N to that pc you will further the ARC break and suppress the emo-tional charge that is about to come off.

Auditors have falsified their worksheets as to TA position and thus built up withholds and made themselves blowy. 2.

That a briefing and drilling of all internes and auditors must occur on this HCOB. 4. That a brief program of clean-up of disregarded F/Ns and falsely called ARC break F/Ns be done on every pc. 5. That every such pc be considered as having false TA troubles and these must be C/Sed for and corrected. 6. That all auditors and internes be drilled on all HCOBs relating to pc indicators.

DIANETIC F/NS An F/N seen by the auditor in running R3RA is not called until the full Dianetic EP is reached. An auditor running R3RA is NOT looking for F/Ns. He is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running. The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in its place. Release the postulate and the chain blows. That’s it. The auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/N and end off auditing that chain. An F/N seen as the incident is erasing is not called. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate, the erasure has occurred. The auditor will see an F/N and VGIs. NOW the F/N is called. F/Ns are not indicated until the EP of postulate off, F/N and VGIs is reached. It’s the postulate – not the F/N that we are going for in New Era Dianetics. POWER F/NS F/Ns are disregarded in Power.

End Phenomena will also vary depending on what you’re running. The definition of End Phenomena is “those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended”. Misapplication of this definition can result in underrun and overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC. TYPES OF EPS In Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/N until he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thus Power auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs. In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and good indicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist, under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you would expect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. The cognition could simply be “the chain blew”. In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc on an L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled. Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually after charge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge being handled moves off. In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off, indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it. Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have an ability regained.

It invalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’t blown the charge and can’t do anything about it. In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors of chopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abuse which has largely been handled. That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in the direction of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘it erased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition or what an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on, expecting an “EP”. OTs AND EPs An OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If the auditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting for an “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets. This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcs or never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads. Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed. This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the same problems that blew back again. REMEDY The remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected with EPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words. The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related metering HCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPs of processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc and meter. TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drills and correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at a glance. Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin at increasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. When the auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things by inspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104,"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 21.03.74 HSDC    455    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE on a gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up at speed and do so smoothly. Then you’d really have an OT auditor. And that’s what you’ll have to do to make them. SUMMARY Overrun and underrun alike mess up cases. Both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of EPs and inexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed. Don’t overrun pcs and have to repair them.

This fact tells you at once why you cannot do three major actions in a row in the same ten minutes. This was the bug behind “Quickie Grades” (0 to IV in one session. This also occurred in Power when it was run all in one day). The auditor would attain a bona fide full dial F/N. The pc was still cogniting, still in a big win. The auditor would “clear the next process com-mand”, he would see an F/N. He would “clear the next process command”, and see an F/N. But it was the same F/N! Result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case. This is really what is meant by “Quickie Grades”. In 1958 we got real Releases. You could not kill the F/N for days, weeks. Several processes had this effect. Today’s real Clear also goes this way. You couldn’t kill the F/N with an axe. By running a lot of Level Zero processes, for instance, you can get a real swinging unkillable F/N. It not only gets to the Examiner, it comes in at the start of the next day’s session! Now if in one session you ran all of Level Zero and went on up to Level One, you would just be auditing a persistent F/N. The pc would get no benefit at all from Level One. He’s still going “Wow” on Level Zero. If you ran Level Zero with one process that got a big wide floating F/N and then “ran” Level I, II, III and IV, you would have just a Level Zero Release. The pc’s bank was nowhere to be found. So next week he has problems (Level I) or a Service Fac (Level IV) and he is only a Grade Zero yet it says right there in Certs and Awards log he’s a Grade IV.

F/Ns on pcs audited up to (for that session) a persistent F/N always get to the Exam-iner. If you only have a “small F/N” it won’t get to the Examiner. However, on some pcs maybe that’s good enough. May take him several sessions, each one getting a final session F/N a bit wider. Then he gets an F/N that gets to the Examiner. After that, well audited on a continuing basis, the F/N lasts longer and longer. One day the pc comes into session with a dial-wide floating swinging F/N and any-thing you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that F/N. It’s a real Release man. It may last weeks, months, years. Tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remain-ing hours (if sold by the hour) as undelivered. Or if sold by result, chalk up the result. If the F/N is truly persistent he will have no objections. If it isn’t, he will object. So have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing.

It can occasionally happen that an auditor misses a read on an item or question and does not run it as it “has not read”. This can hang up a pc badly if the item was in fact a read-ing item or question. It does not get handled and exists in records as “No read” when in fact it did read. Therefore all Dianetic auditors whose items occasionally “don’t read” and all Scientology auditors who get list questions that don’t read must be checked out on this HCOB in Qual or by the C/S or Supervisor. These errors come under the heading of Gross Auditing Errors as they affect metering. 1. An Item or Question is said to “Read” when the needle falls. Not when it stops or slows on a rise. A tick is always noted and in some cases becomes a wide read. 2. The read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared. This is the valid time of read. It is duly marked (plus any blow down). THIS reading defines what is a reading item or question. calling it back to see if it read is not a valid test as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list. 3. Regardless of any earlier statements or material on Reading Items, an item does not have to read when the auditor calls it to be a valid item for running engrams or listing. The test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in Clearing it? 4. That an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it or list it. Pc Interest, in Dianetics, is also necessary to run it, but that it did not read again is no reason to not use it. 5. When listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter not necessarily the pc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any BD and how much. This is enough to make it a “reading item” or “reading question”."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"METER READING ITEMS 2 HCOB 28.2.71 HSDC    462    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 6. In Clearing a listing Question the auditor watches the meter, not necessarily the pc and notes any read while clearing the question. 7. An additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not a valid action if the item or question read on origination or Clearing. 8. That an item is marked as having read on an earlier Dianetic list is enough (also checking interest) to run it with no further read test. 9. To miss seeing a read on an origin or clearing is a Gross Auditing Error. 10. Failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any BD seen during pc origina-tion or clearing the question is a Gross Auditing Error. EYESIGHT Auditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the proper glasses while auditing. GLASSES The rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at the worksheet or pc. If this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision. WIDE VISION A good auditor is expected to see his meter, pc and worksheet all at one time. No mat-ter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves. If he cannot do this he should use an Azimuth Meter and not put paper over its glass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper—the original design purpose of the Azimuth Meter. Then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is in his line of vision. CONFUSIONS Any and all confusions as to what is a “reading item” or “reading question” should be fully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or confusions can be responsible for case hang-ups and needless repairs. NO READ Any comment that an item or question “did not read” should be at once suspected by a C/S and checked with this HCO B on the auditor."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"METER READING ITEMS 3 HCOB 28.2.71 HSDC    463    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Actually non-Reads, a non-reading item or question means one that did not read when originated or cleared and also did not read when called. One can still call an item or question to get a read. That it now reads is fine. But if it has never read at all, the item will not run and such a list will produce no item on it. It is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read. But it is a useless ac-tion if the item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him.

The cause of false TA is in the physical universe and that is where the check is done. It is not done by asking the pc or checking the questions on the pc for meter reads. So the auditor would feel the hands of the pc to establish if they are dry or wet, would feel the pc’s hands with cream on them to see if the cream has dried up, would see if the pc’s hands cup so as to form an area that does not touch the cans and so forth.

When a meter is not left on a minute or two before trimming, it can drift in the session and give a slightly false TA. “The trim can quietly be checked in mid-session by snapping out the jack where the cord goes into the box and putting the TA on 2, seeing if the needle is now on SET.

The excessively dry hand is seen as shiny or polished looking. It feels very dry. The cor-rect treatment is to use a hand cream, but not a greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the hand and leaves no excess grease. Hand cream is usually smeared on, rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wiped off.

And it now should no longer feel dry. (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB Re-revised 25 May 80) The correct treatment is to use a hand cream but not greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the skin and leaves no excess grease. This restores normal electrical contact. Such a hand cream would only have to be applied once per session – at session start – as it lasts for a long while. If a cream leaves smears on a can, it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed. (HCOB 23 Apr 75A Re-revised 25 May 80) 17.

For a time all left right motions of the needle were considered and called “Rockslams” until it was found that a smooth left right flow was a symptom of release or key out and this became the “Floating Needle.” There is yet another left right motion of the needle called the “Theta Bop.” This occurs when the person has or is trying to exteriorize. “Theta” is the symbol for the person as a spirit or goodness; “bop” is an electronic term for a slight hitch in the sweep of a needle. A “Theta Bop” hitches evenly at each end of the sweep left and right and is very even in the middle of the sweep. Neither the “Floating Needle” nor the “Theta Bop” can be confused with a “Rock-slam.” The difference of the Rockslam is uneven, ragged agitation left and right; even the distances traveled left and right are likely to be different in each swing from the last. A “Rockslam” can be caused sometimes by leaving rings on the pc’s fingers or by a short circuit in the meter or by the cans (electrodes) touching something like a dress. These are the mechanical considerations and must be ruled out before the pc can be considered to have “Rockslammed.” If the pc is not wearing rings and if the meter needle is calm with the lead unplugged, if the lead is okay, and if the pc is not jiggling the ends of the cans against his clothes, then the pc’s Rockslam is caused by the pc’s bank. One has to be very careful about the correctness of the pc actually having Rock-slammed while on the meter that it was actually observed, that it was not mechanically caused as above. One puts the R/S down on the worksheet and also gives exactly what was asked. And also that the mechanical points were checked without distracting the pc. One must always report a Rockslam in the auditing report, note it with session date and page inside the left cover of the pc’s folder and report it to ethics including the question or subject which rockslammed, phrased exactly."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"R/SES, WHAT THEY MEAN 2 HCOB 10.08.76 HSDC    476    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Why? Because the Rockslam is the most important needle manifestation! It gives the clue to the pc’s case. In 1970 I began a full-scale research project into the subject of insanity and its rela-tionship to cases and case gains and suppression. It was only then that the full significance of the Rockslam was unearthed. This research developed into what is now called Expanded Dianetics, a series of special processes and actions with their drills and training which per-mits the auditor to handle a specific case type. This was, by the way, Man’s first system of positive detection and handling of psychosis and the first full understanding of what psychosis is. While this bulletin is not in any way a two minute course in or a substitute for full training in Expanded Dianetics, any auditor who audits, sec checks, or handles people on a meter has to know what a Rockslam is and how it behaves and what he should do about it. The first thing is to be able to recognize one and to quickly with the scan of the eye and unplug of the meter cord (without any distraction of or notice by the pc) make the checks for a mechanical Rockslam as given above. You can make a meter “Rockslam” with no pc or cord connected to it by (a) turning it on; (b) put the sensitivity at perhaps 2; (c) put the needle at “set”; (d) rapidly, very rapidly, move the TA back and forth maybe a quarter of an inch and do it unevenly. That, if you did it very fast and unevenly, would be something that resembled a Rockslam. But no matter how fast you made your fingers move, a real R/S is a trifle faster. If you do that you will see what an R/S looks like. The needle in this experiment is not made to hit the sides of the meter. Now if you take the same setup and smoothly slowly move the tone arm back and forth about 2 times a second without any roughness and the same distance right and left, you will have a Floating Needle. Note it very well as this comes at a time of release and is the thing a good auditor hopes to see and gives him the end-off signal for a process. It has to be well known as you never bypass one in a session and to do so makes an uncomfortable pc. (The pc will often cognite – and get a realization about himself or life at this point and one does not stop him from doing this.) This is the thing you indicate to the pc. You don’t ever indicate Rockslams or Theta Bops. When you see it and, without stopping or interrupting the pc’s cognition, you always say, “Your needle is floating.” Now the Theta Bop can also be shown to yourself by you. Set up the meter as above.

Then do it to the right. And so on. This is a Theta Bop. It is different than a Floating Needle only in that it hitches at each end of the swing. So learn to recognize it. There is a vicious smooth right direction slash that occurs when a pc hits a certain area of the bank that is called a “Rocket Read” and there is of course the small fall, long fall (which both go to the right and indicate a charged question or reaction) and there is the grad-ual rise to the left. But these do not repeat back and forth which is the characteristic of the Rockslam, Floating Needle and Theta Bop."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"R/SES, WHAT THEY MEAN 3 HCOB 10.08.76 HSDC    477    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE All right, so we know exactly what it looks like when we talk about a Rockslam as a read of the meter. We know how it can be mechanically caused. And we know what we have to record and report when it is seen. But exactly what does a Rockslam mean with regards to the pc? If you don’t know this you can miss on the pc, on the case, on the org and humanity. A Rockslam means a hidden evil intention on the subject or question under dis-cussion or auditing. Two things underlie insanity, or to be more specific, there are two causes and condi-tions both of which have been lumped together by man and called insanity. He could not of course define it as he didn’t know what caused it. The first of these two things does not concern us overly much here and is the subject of a separate checksheet training and is called PTS or Potential Trouble Source handling. A “PTS” is a person who has been or is connected with somebody who has evil intentions. A PTS can feel uncomfortable in life or be neurotic or go insane because of the actions upon him of a person with evil intentions. Most of the people in institutions are probable PTSes. The second of these two things is insanity caused to the individual himself (let alone others) by hidden evil intentions. The extent of these intentions and what the person will do (and hide) in order to carry them out is quite shocking. These people are covert or overt criminals and many of them are insane – meaning beyond all rationality in their acts. Because their evil intentions are hidden and because they are often very plausible such individuals are what make “behavior so myste-rious” and “man looks so evil when you see what mankind does” and all sorts of fallacies. It is this last type, the chronic, heavy Rockslammer, which Expanded Dianetics han-dles. One Rockslam doesn’t make a psychotic. Or a total menace to everyone. But it does mean there could be more and it might in rare cases mean you have, seeing enough of these R/Ses, a very dangerous person on your hands and in your vicinity. And that person must be handled by Expanded Dianetics. You won’t see a great many Rockslams in auditing people so you could be totally thrown off by surprise when you see one. And mess it all up because you are surprised. So know what it is and don’t get all quivery and make mistakes and blow your confront. Just carry on. If you don’t note the exact question that was asked and the exactly worded statement the pc made when the R/S was seen, you can muck it up for the Expanded Dianetics guys. They won’t be able to get it turned back on again easily and will lose a lot of time. So you have to be sure your auditing report is accurate, that the R/S is written big on the column and circled and, no matter what else you do in the session, you have to get it recorded in the left front cover of the folder giving the date and page of the session and you have to report it to Ethics. And also you don’t third party the pc and give him a bad time in the session because of it."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"R/SES, WHAT THEY MEAN 4 HCOB 10.08.76 HSDC    478    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now R/Ses most easily turn on during Sec Checks or Integrity Processing or when pulling withholds or trying to investigate something. So the people who see these most often are those engaged in that activity and not routine auditing (when they can also but more rarely turn on). Further the most likely person to collide with “needing to be sec checked” is an R/Ser, which again increases the numbers of R/Ses seen in these activities compared to rou-tine auditing. But a very heavy R/Ser will also turn them on in routine auditing. It is the exact point of the R/S in the session, the exact question that was asked and the exact subject or phrase where the R/S turned on that are important. And these are very impor-tant as then the person can be fully handled with a full Expanded Dianetics rundown by a qualified Expanded Dianetics Specialist. When, of course, the person gets to that point on his grade chart. (The grade chart points are after Dianetics (like Drug RDs etc) but before Grades, after Grades but before Power, after Power but before Solo, and after OT III or after any sin-gle grade above OT III. These are the only points where Expanded Dianetics can be delivered and the R/S fully and completely handled.) Now here is how you can turn off an R/S and mistakenly think it is handled: 1. The overt-motivator sequence has two sides. One is what the person has done (overt) and what is done to the person (motivator). You can ask, when the person R/Ses on something, if anyone has ever invalidated him on that subject or action. He will find some and the R/S will turn off and won’t even be faintly handled but only sub-merged. One can believe he had “handled” the R/S. Not true. He has just turned it off and maybe made it harder to find next time. One can ask what the person has done to the subject mentioned and while this may unburden the case and make the person a bit better, the R/S is not handled, only turned off or submerged. It’s almost as if there are so many overts and motivators on this subject or in this area that the push-pull of it makes the needle go wild (R/S). And indeed, this may be the energy cause, in the bank, of the needle reaction. But neither overt nor motivator handles an R/S finally because the cause of the R/S is an intention to harm and it isn’t all that likely the basic intention will be reached. 2. Another apparent way the R/S can get “handled” and isn’t is to take the R/Ser earlier-similar on the subject of the R/S. The R/S will probably cease, go “clean.” But in ac-tual fact it is still there, hidden. 3. The third way an R/S can be falsely “handled” is to direct the person’s attention to something else. If, when this is done, the exact subject of the R/S is not noted by the auditor, it will be difficult to find it again when the person goes into Expanded Dianetic auditing. 4. Yet another, and probably the last way to falsely “handle” an R/S is to abuse the per-son about his conduct or behavior or the R/S, or to “educate” him to do better, or to “modify” his behavior with shocks or surgery or other tortures like the psychiatrists do. In other words one can seek to suppress the R/S in numerous ways. Maybe the R/S won’t occur (being too overburdened now) but it is still there, buried very deep and possibly beyond reach now."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"R/SES, WHAT THEY MEAN 5 HCOB 10.08.76 HSDC    479    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So if you understand the above four points you will see that although you can ease off the R/S, you have not handled it. It has merely gone out of sight. All right, what then does handle an R/S? I warned you that this isn’t a two minute course on Expanded Dianetics and it isn’t. An R/S is handled by a fully qualified Expanded Dianetics auditor delivering full Expanded Dianetics to the person at that point on the grade chart where Expanded Dianetics is supposed to be delivered. If anyone thinks it can be done effectively any other way or if he C/Ses it to be done and the auditor is stupid enough to try to do that C/S, then it’s Committees of Evi-dence and Suspended Certificates all around. With that warning, and only with that warning, I can briefly state what has to be done with the case. This is not what you do if you are not delivering full Expanded Dianetics at the right point on the grade chart. It is a brief statement so that you can understand what lies un-der that R/S. The pc with an R/S on any given subject and who R/Ses while discussing that or re-lated subjects has an evil intention toward the subject discussed or some closely related subject. The pc intends that subject or area of life nothing but calculating, covert, under-handed harm which will be at all times carefully hidden from that subject. Thus, the Expanded Dianetics Specialist, in handling that case (at the proper point on the grade chart) has to be able to locate each and every subject and question and R/S in that person’s folder as noted by Sec Checkers and previous auditors or cramming officers or why finders. He has to have the complete list of R/S subjects. If they are noted as to session date and page and if all sec checking papers and cramming papers are in that person’s folder, then the Expanded Dianetics Specialist can do a full and complete job. Otherwise he has to do a lot of other time wasting actions to get the R/Ses found and turned on again. What the Expanded Dianetics Specialist actually does is locate exactly the actual evil intention for every R/S on the case and handle each one to total conclusion. When he is fin-ished, if he has done his job well, the person’s behavior will be magically improved and as to his social presence, menace and conduct, well that will be toward survival. When you see an R/S, if you are not an Expanded Dianetic Specialist doing Expanded Dianetics at the correct point on the grade chart, you don’t say, “Hey, you’ve got an evil in-tention!” and you don’t ask “Say, what’s that evil intention?” or do corny things like that be-cause you’ll get the pc self listing, you may get a wrong item, you won’t know what to do with it and you’re just likely to get the auditing room wrapped around your neck right there. No, you quietly note it, make sure it isn’t a mechanical fault, write it big on the work-sheet, write down everything the pc is saying swiftly, note what question you were asking and let the pc talk and ack him and go on with what you are doing with the pc at the time. And after session you note it in the left-hand cover of the folder and send a report to Ethics. And some day, when he’s done his Drug Rundown or gotten to one of the points on the grade chart where a full XDN can be done, why then it will be handled. And a good C/S will program or tip the case for that to be done."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"R/SES, WHAT THEY MEAN 6 HCOB 10.08.76 HSDC    480    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE So that’s the know-how you have to know about R/Ses to really help the guy and the society and your group.

When an auditor has smooth, usual TRs, does his metering expertly and without at-tracting the pc’s attention, when he follows the Auditor’s Code (particularly regarding Evaluation and Invalidation) and when he is interested, not interesting as an auditor, the pc cognites and makes case gains. Further, according to the axioms, a bank straightens out by as-ising its content. If the pc’s attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so As-Ising cannot occur. The definition of In Session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor. When this definition describes the session in progress, then of course the pc will be able to as-is and will cognite. By THE ORIGINAL THESIS, the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pc’s bank. When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can’t be heard, doesn’t ack, doesn’t give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has out-TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over-acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc’s attention onto himself. So the pc’s attention, not being on his bank, doesn’t as-is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by-passes F/Ns or calls F/Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc „That reads” „That blew down” etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of In-Session.

(Present Time Prob-lem); (2) The Overt Act (with its withholds of all varieties); and (3) The ARC Break (a sud-den drop in Affinity, Reality and Communication). The following facts are some of the best substantiated facts in the whole of our technology: The Present Time Problem (1) The presence of a Present Time Problem in a session, unless handled, will prevent all gain. If a “PTP” exists in the pc and you try to audit something else and ignore the PTP, the pc’s personality graph will show no change, the TA (Tone Arm of the Meter) will not move well, the pc will not make his or her session goals and auditing may eventually cease. The Overt Act (2) In the presence of an Overt Act undisclosed to the auditor and withheld from him, no matter how openly it may once have been done, the auditing cycle of communication be-tween auditor and pc (as in TR’s 0 to 4) cannot occur, as the pc is withholding. Therefore, nothing can vanish in the pc’s reactive mind and auditing becomes painful. The graph will not change, nor will the TA move well. The ARC Break (3) In the presence of an ARC Break, the pc’s attention is so distracted by the reactive charge that has been bypassed (restimulated, but overlooked by both pc and auditor) that the strain of splitting attention between the charge in the bank and the auditor will operate to worsen the pc’s case, reduce the pc’s graph and freeze the tone arm of the meter. Therefore, one must not pursue an auditing cycle during an ARC break, but may only locate and indicate the bypassed charge. The Main Point If an auditor doesn’t handle these three things competently, the pc will eventually cease to be audited.

At the same time this form of rudiments can lead an unex-perienced auditor into a robotic use of them, merely checking the questions for reads but not getting in communication with the pc. Alternatives for bringing ruds in exist, but they need a much higher qualified auditor – such as Class III for 2WC – or do not cover the most frequent out ruds – such as Big Mid Ruds. Thus the Qual Board recommends that lower classed auditors – Class 0, Class I, HSDC, HRD – are trained on the following form of rudiments and use these in session until they are higher classed. Where the auditor is higher classed but the pc is a beginner on his first grades, life repair or Dianetics, the C/S can use this form of ruds at his discretion.

The thetan who holds facsimiles to the body has chosen to have the energy in spite of the perceptions and significances in it. He is attempting to have the energy and not have the aberrative quality of it. Thus he has posed the problem of trying to reject the thought and ac-cept the energy and thus he cannot do either. In Dianetics we gave him the energy by processing out the significances (perception) in it. When well exteriorized a thetan may have his energy so far reduced that he becomes unhappy. Having him create and snap in anchor points upon himself (not the body) will rem-edy this unhappiness. Matched terminalling, admiration processing and any other process which reduces en-ergy, at length “starve” the thetan for energy. All these conditions are remedied by remedying the “havingness” of the thetan. As we saw in Acceptance Level Processing (PAB 15) only certain energy forms may be acceptable to the thetan. This is regulated by the screens he has erected against things. By setting up a resistance to certain energies, he creates an eventual appetite for them. He sets up screens to resist the form and the screen becomes plus for the form on the far side and nega-tive for the form on the near side. As the screen caves in upon him (by being pounded by the unwanted form) it eventually causes an appetite (vacuum) for the form. Thus he actually starves for a form he once detested. This is the dwindling spiral of the Mest Universe. The thetan believes he has to have the form to survive. The remedy of havingness is necessary for all cases at and below Step IV of SOP 8. An auditor remedies havingness by “starting an avalanche”, by making the preclear begin an automatic inflow of acceptable things, then graduates the preclear rapidly to ava-lanches of stars, planets, heavy masses and spaces. It is density and mass which count, not specific items."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"HAVINGNESS   2   HCOB   3.05.72   HSDC    490    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Degradation begins when the thetan is interiorized into unwanted mass. It is completed when, having developed an appetite for heavy mass, he is exteriorized from it. In this lifetime the downfall of any thetan began with his loss of some heavy mass. The heaviness of the mass was the value of the mass. For instance, an auditor wishing to trace the feeling of degradation in a preclear would look for a time when the preclear lost or was removed from a massive object. The auditor then has the preclear mock up the object and change its quality better or worse until it “snaps in” automatically on the preclear. Then the auditor has the preclear mock up enough of the object to create an avalanche. The preclear must then add more and more to the inflow, then add planets, stars and black stars until the preclear can comfortably throw several dense objects away in mock-up. A reverse (outflow-ing) avalanche is then begun and run. Outflowing and inflowing avalanches are run on the preclear until his “hunger” is sati-ated. Numerous facsimiles may appear. The auditor continues with the dense masses in ava-lanches, not the facsimiles. The facsimile will “blow”. This process, run for four or five hours, will create a Book 1 Mest Clear. Perceptions are turned on by running “acceptable” smells, lights and sounds in ava-lanches. Masses are more important than perceptions. L.

Without the repair and remedy of havingness no real gains become apparent. A preclear will not progress when his havingness is impaired. What are the symptoms of loss of havingness? Running any as-ising techniques the preclear may become anaten, slightly nervous, agitated, want a cigarette, or seem to break out of the session in some fashion. In either case, he is “down on havingness.” In other words he has burned up, used up, or as-ised, too much of his physical body energy in the auditing itself. In view of the fact that every subjective technique puts a sort of hole in the middle of the elec-tronic mass surrounding a preclear, parts of that mass then begin to cave in on the preclear. Thus running an as-ising technique on a preclear beyond the ability of the preclear to sustain the consequent loss of havingness will bring on in the preclear many new engrams which he did not have before. A technique which as-ises energy, if used without a repair or remedy of havingness, will bring about a worsening of the case of a preclear. Now exactly what is happening is very simple. A preclear starts to go anaten and the auditor keeps on running the process. He hasn’t realized that he ought to interrupt a process at any time if the preclear demonstrates a loss of havingness. Anaten is such a demonstration of loss of havingness. All right, another example: the preclear becomes agitated or upset; he reaches for a cigarette; he begins to twitch; his foot begins to wobble; he begins to talk excit-edly; he begins to cough while being audited. All of these things demonstrate a loss of hav-ingness. These same conditions, by the way, can result from the preclear believing that the auditor has broken the Auditor’s Code in some fashion or has overcome his power of choice. Both a repair and remedy of havingness are immediately indicated on the observation of anaten or agitation on the part of the preclear. In addition the auditor should carefully go over the session itself to find out, if anywhere, the preclear believed his power of choice was being overcome, or if the preclear believed the Auditor’s Code had been broken. You understand that the auditor didn’t necessarily have to overcome the preclear’s power of choice or break the Auditor’s Code in order that the preclear should believe that this has happened. However, this could be overlooked entirely if the auditor had been careful enough to repair or remedy the havingness of the preclear. The slightest drop of alertness on the part of the preclear, or the slightest agitation or somatic, should immediately indicate to the auditor that havingness has dropped and must be immediately repaired or remedied.

It is better to “waste” time spent repairing and remedying havingness than to blunder on through. Now there is another thing I have noticed with regard to this. Auditors are running these days toward cognition. Very well, if they expect a preclear to cognite they should not expect him to pull in a bank upon himself. If an auditor runs a very obvious process which should bring the preclear to-ward cognition, runs it several auditing commands and then stops and repairs and remedies the preclear’s havingness, and then after that asks him the same auditing question two more times, he will discover that he has blown a cognition into view. In other words you could remedy the havingness of a preclear while his mind was on one particular subject and bring a cognition into existence. This becomes particularly important today, since a few months ago I discovered that you could remedy the havingness of anybody, and I mean just that!! You can remedy any-body’s havingness and you can turn on mock-ups on anybody. The fact that the preclear who has a black field can be caused to mock up blacknesses or invisibilities and shove them into his body brings us into an era of being able to make anybody turn on mock-ups. Getting the preclear to postulate that the mocked up blackness is bad for the body will cause that black-ness to snap into the body. By getting the preclear to postulate that the invisible mass he has mocked up is bad for the body it will snap into the body. Of course, after this has been done a few times, the consideration of the preclear will change. Then perhaps the blackness or in-visibility will only snap in when the preclear postulates that it is good for the body. He may also have a residue left. It is very important to get rid of these repair and remedy of having-ness residues. By various postulates such as that the residue is a threat to the body, it is good for the body, it is bad for the body, the residue too will snap in. Let’s differentiate at once here the difference between a repair of havingness and a remedy of havingness. We used to call repair of havingness “giving him some havingness.” It needs a better technical term. Therefore let us call this “Repair of Havingness.” It means hav-ing the preclear mock up anything he can mock up, and in any way it can be done get him to shove (never pull) that mock-up into the body, and by similar means to get rid of the residue which went along with the mock-up. That is a repair of havingness. It is a one-way flow; it is an inflow. Now a remedy of havingness is getting him to mock up and shove into the body enough masses to bring him to a point where he can eventually throw one away. In other words repair of havingness is simply having him mock up things and having him shove them into the body, and a remedy of havingness is having him mock up and shove in and throw away the same type of mock-up. Remedy of havingness is always a superior operation to a repair of havingness. Repair of havingness is a very crude stop-gap, but can be used any time. However, a preclear who is working well, and on whom havingness can be remedied, should, at all times, have his havingness remedied, not repaired. In other words any type of mock-up should be both shoved into the body and mocked up and thrown away. This should be done in considerable quantity until the preclear is quite relaxed about that particular type of mock-up. One does this, remember, every time the attention of the preclear drops, or he becomes agi-tated."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVINGNESS 3 HCOB 8.5.72 HSDC    493    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE There is one other little point connected with this which is quite important, and that is, auditors very often audit a preclear into an area of time when the preclear exteriorized. This, on a preclear who does not exteriorize easily, brings on a considerable grief and sadness. The way to get rid of this is, of course, to remedy the preclear’s havingness or only repair it, and to ask the preclear to recall times when he was not exteriorized. This will bring up at once times when he did exteriorize and where fear of exteriorization was built up considerably. I have noticed another special condition regarding this exteriorization phenomena which is quite important. A preclear will occasionally repair and remedy havingness up to a point where the body disappears for him. He doesn’t quite know where to put the mass he has mocked up since he cannot find the body. This is particularly true of preclears who have a very low threshold on havingness. An auditor would be stupid indeed to simply plow along beyond that point where the preclear has already said that he couldn’t find any body to push any havingness into. The moment the preclear does that the auditor should suspect that the preclear has gotten into an exteriorization type incident. It is not, however, necessary that he immediately flounder around and try to find this incident as recommended in the paragraphs just above. He can also repair and remedy havingness in this fashion, and it is very important to know this. Although it is disastrous for a preclear to be asked “What could your body have?” since he will simply strip the bank of various old facsimiles, it is a very, very good repair of havingness to ask a preclear “What is there around this room (area) which your body could have?” and then have him pick out specific objects in the environment which he says the body could have. If he does this he will come up the gradient scale of havingness, and his havingness will be repaired immediately or directly on the Sixth Dynamic. With a preclear who cannot get mock-ups and where the auditor has either been too clumsy to get the preclear’s mock-ups turned on or it really was impossible, more or less, the preclear’s hav-ingness can be repaired by having him do this process. So this is a very, very important proc-ess, and one that ought to go down in red letters. This whole subject of repair and remedy of havingness and its effect upon auditing, and the fact that it has not been stressed at all in training, being up there at Level Six in the old Basic Processes, brings us to SLP Issue 8. The entirety of Level One in SLP 8 will be de-voted to the repair and remedy of havingness. In SLP Issue 7 we have a great many phenomena associated with the remedy of the body’s havingness. The reason for their position is to bring about an adjustment of the condi-tion of the body before one goes on to other and more complicated ways of processing. Now, in Issue 8, all of these various things will be retained, but they will be paralleled with a com-plete remedy of havingness and that particular level of SLP will be gone over. In actual ex-perience it is better to remedy the havingness of a preclear, no matter where he is on the tone scale, and no matter by what process, than to run any significant process. Further, if a preclear cannot at least repair his havingness, to run Waterloo Station is to invite disaster, because in this particular process of Level 2 he is liable to get himself into a “down havingness” situation and of course will not be able to not-know anything. He may be chewing up too much energy while trying to not-know. Thus we would have the failures which have occasionally occurred in Waterloo Station. They were simply havingness failures, not a failure of Waterloo Station. Further there has been a new command suggested for Waterloo Station: “What would you be"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVINGNESS 4 HCOB 8.5.72 HSDC    494    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE willing to not-know about that person?” This seems to be a better command, at least for the British Isles. We also take care of the vacuums and separatenesses and everything else with repair or remedy of havingness and running it in with certain other things, such as problems, etc. When we discover by two-way communication a weak universe, we could then ask the indi-vidual preclear, “Invent a problem that person (weak universe) could be to you.” Then, watching him very carefully, and repairing his havingness on the subject of that person’s pos-sessions, get a very rapid separation of universes. I have noticed that the weak universe came about when the person elected by the preclear to be a weak universe first began to put mest anchor points around the preclear. In other words, valuable presents. I am as pleased as can be to get a finger on this point and I know well that if East, West, North and South would begin to repair and remedy havingness and stop specializing in significances without repair or remedy of havingness, we are going to start shooting people up to the top of these Scientometric graphs. We can’t help it. Let me call your attention specifically to the old phenomena of the emotional scale and the engram. We found out that when one engram was keyed in, it fixed the emotional tone of the individual. Then we had him run this and as he converted the engram to usable having-ness, we found that his tone rose. We discover on these Scientometric charts that the “un-happy” section does not move if we don’t change the mass of the preclear. SACRIFICES The latest news from the research front has to do with the fact that the GE demands and requires and has to have, evidently, sacrifices. The GE does not run on an overt act-motivator sequence, which makes one suspect he is not a thetan. A GE runs exclusively on being sacrificed to. If you have the preclear mock up sacrifices to the GE, you will find these become very readily assimilated. On a lower level the body accepts motivators; as soon as it is through this motivator band, it accepts sacrifices and finally comes up to a point where it will accept live bodies. When one considers that eating is entirely a matter of absorbing death, one sees this death hunger in processing by running Sacrifices. A person who has had bad legs should have a sacrifice of legs run on him and so forth. This is astonishing material. It is almost unbeliev-able that the GE will not be sacrificed to anything, but will only be sacrificed to, and this phe-nomenon that the GE is thereby demanding death tells us at once that the atomic bomb will be used and that there are people in the world who will actually crave this sacrifice of cities and even nations. Aside from being a fantastically workable process, more of which anon, this matter of sacrifices tells us at once a great deal about the future. There will be no moral restraint where the atomic bomb is concerned. For about the highest level in some areas of the world, as to case, is “operating GE.” This tells us, too, why soldiers will go to war. This explains a great deal of conduct."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVINGNESS 5 HCOB 8.5.72 HSDC    495    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The GE evidently operates on the postulate that as long as anything else is alive it can’t live. However, it is becoming more and more doubtful that there is any more life in the body than the thetan puts there, and that the body is a single machine operating on some im-planted postulates contained in the energy masses which are activated by the thetan somewhat on the order of the old “pole” theta trap. Many of these considerations can be changed around rather easily. Nothing changes them quite so fast as these sacrifice processes. In mocking up sacrifices the auditor should use all the skills of creative processing and ensure that the preclear is actually mocking up and is not dragging in old facsimiles from the bank and restimulating genetic line incidents. This can be obviated by having the persons in the mock-ups dressed in modern clothing; mocking up the incident as happening tomorrow; altering the mock-up in some manner, such as turning the face green or something of this na-ture. Any reasonable way in which you can ensure that you are dealing with mock-ups and not past track facsimiles. This gives auditors another tool with which to handle chronic somatics. There is another process which has a great deal of workability with chronic somatics. I know that some months ago and earlier than that it seemed rather fatal to us to continue to fixate the preclear’s attention on the chronic somatic. But that is not a problem with us right now. It ceased to be a problem the moment I invented an auditing command exactly as fol-lows: “Invent a problem that (leg, arm, nose, eye, body) could be to you. “ Running this command, which is in itself a sort of remedy of havingness, and repairing and remedying the havingness of the preclear as we go, we will discover that practically any and all phenomena associated with the service facsimile will come away and clear up, and the limb, nose or eye will get well. This can be used as a word of warning: Only on actual terminals. Never use this command, and I mean never, on actual conditions. Never ask him to invent problems lameness could be to him. Never ask him what problem blindness could be to him. Lameness and blindness are conditions. We want to know what problems legs or eyes can be to him, since legs and eyes are terminals. In running this command we reduce havingness too rapidly whenever we are stressing conditions. Therefore we run it only on terminals. In running it use only terminals. Handled in this way we do have the answer as of this moment, to chronic somatics. With these processes in SLP and the adequate repair and remedy of havingness we can push our preclears right up through the top. L.

There is a vast amount of material on havingness and the remedy of havingness in early pub-lications and other HCOBs to be found in the Technical Volumes – data the student will ac-quire as he continues to train up the levels and on the SHSBC. This issue is to give the beginning auditor a working knowledge of the subject of hav-ingness. “HAVINGNESS: 1) that which permits the experience of mass and pressure. 2) the feeling that one owns or possesses. 3) can be simply defined as ARC with the environment.... 6) the ability to duplicate that which one perceives, or to be willing to create a duplication of it.... 8) havingness is the concept of being able to reach or not being prevented from reach-ing.... 4) that activity which is run when needed and when it will not violently deflect the pc’s attention.” (From the Technical Dictionary.) The above are all valid, but the final definition of havingness can be simply stated as: Havingness is the concept of being able to reach. No Havingness is the concept of not being able to reach. Inherent in the ability to reach is the willingness and ability to duplicate. That which makes communication work in processes is the duplication part of the communication formula (Axiom 28 Amended). The position of a being on the Tone Scale is determined by his ability to reach (and thus his willingness and ability to duplicate, to communicate and experience). The lower the tone of the being the less willing he is to reach, communicate with and experience his present time environment, and the less willing he is to reach and duplicate events of the past or permit them to happen again. This is remedied by Objective Havingness Processes. These are processes that deal with observing and touching objects in the auditing room or in the environment.

Thus we find the pc’s Havingness Process early on in auditing and use it to gain or remedy havingness before or after processes or at session end. FINDING AND RUNNING THE PC’S HAVINGNESS PROCESS The preclear’s Havingness Process is tested for on the meter in an exact way. You test it on the needle with can squeezes from the pc. Use HCOB 6 October 1960R, Revised 8 May 74, “Thirty-Six New Presessions.” 1. Set the sensitivity for 1/3 of a dial drop when the pc squeezes the cans. (See E-Meter Drill 5, The Book of E-Meter Drills. ) 2. Run 5 to 8 commands of the first Havingness Process on the above bulletin, with the pc on the meter. 3. Then have the pc squeeze the cans, noting the size of the needle read now. If this sec-ond can squeeze shows the needle looser (wider swing) than the first can squeeze did, you’ve got it. The Havingness Process you’ve tested is the Having-ness Process for the preclear and may be used to remedy his havingness as necessary. 4. If the process tightens the needle during the test, don’t use it. Don’t bridge off. Just get off the process now and test the next process, or the next, continuing until you find a Havingness Process that does loosen the needle and gives a wider swing. One will be found among the list of Havingness Processes on HCOB 6 Oct 60R. 5. The correct Havingness Process selected is then run 10 to 12 commands at a time, usually just before ending off a session. A pc’s Havingness Process can change as the pc changes with auditing. If at some point in the auditing the Havingness Process which has been being used fails to get the de-sired result, simply re-test for a new Havingness Process, find one that works and use it. Even the right Havingness Process, if run too much at one time (more than 10 or 20 commands) will start running the bank. It doesn’t harm the preclear but that isn’t its use, as there are other processes that run the bank better. The purpose of a Havingness Process is to get the preclear stabilized in his environ-ment.

Auditors and C/Ses are often weak on Administrative. They think general tech results improve only by more tech study. If they continue to think this way they wind up squirreling. For they are working on a wrong target for improvement, a wrong why or reason. Auditing is a team activity. The day of the individual country doctor is dead. Even if an individual field auditor starts out as an individual he goes one of two directions – he over-works and squirrels himself into failure or he builds up a team – may only be a receptionist and an apprentice auditor but he is still building up a team. I have never seen individual audi-tors succeed over a long period. Failing to form or become part of a team, they eventually fade out or squirrel. The reason is simple enough. These rules apply: To improve tech results you must improve administration. And I don’t mean just writing better in folders. DEFINITION ADMINISTRATION consists of the formation and handling of the lines and terminals involved in production. Unless an auditor understands this fully, he will never insist on a Tech Sec, a Tech Es-tablishment Officer, D of P, C/S, Examiner, Pages, Folder Admin and himself will begin to omit keeping a Folder Summary and then omit the session actions and then, with big loses, retire from it all. If I were an auditor and saw some of these things missing, I’d be liable to say, “Are you guys kidding? I thought we were here to audit pcs.” Without the correct pattern of lines and terminals you don’t get results, you get head-aches, mad neighbors and refunds."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET RESULTS IN AN HGC 2 HCOB 25.08.71 HSDC    506    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Auditing on lines, an auditor should regard himself as a highly skilled expert, a techni-cal specialist whose work requires respect and service. And Case Supervising on lines, a Case Supervisor should consider himself a sort of Czar whose word is so law even the Exec Director thinks several times before he approaches – duly servile of course and bowing the prescribed three times as he exits. A Class XII on Flag is listened to by others with a hush even if he is only commenting on the weather. These are the stars of the team. Their worldwide reputation for smooth flubless audit-ing is an administrative result! Short of space, overloaded, short of admin personnel, turning out the highest well done hours in the world, Flag’s Div IV produces because of an Admin system. The highest of these C/Ses and auditors goes to Cramming if he misplaces a comma or drops a TR 1. If the sessions’ exams at Examiner drop from 90% F/N the whole place gets over-hauled. Folders are Folder Error Summaried by an FES section. The Folder Summary is kept up each session (or Cramming). The folder is studied and C/Sed. The D of P assigns the ses-sions. The C/S is done correctly (or Cramming). The folder travels on its lines. The tests are done. In short it is a complex but constantly flowing pattern of moving pcs, folders and ex-aminations interspersed with testing and interviews and re-registration. There is a right way to do it. RESULTS If an org has only 65% of its sessions F/N VGIs at Examiner the right answer is to or-ganize the place. Why? Well, the first answer is that the third dynamic is stronger than the first dynamic. An auditor auditing alone is a first dynamic. The pc is a first dynamic. As it is the auditor plus pc that must be greater than the reactive mind, one can easily work the rest out. If the auditor is part of a functioning third dynamic, not just an individual, the auditor plus pc versus the bank is a LOT more than the bank. Another answer is that an auditor knows the pc, if only because of sessions, and per-sonal opinion enters into it. That is not a pure technical view as a C/S’s must be. Another answer is that an auditor in a group gets more auditing done. Individually practicing auditors often fail because nobody is taking care of the auditor as a person. Further they get loses. No one sends them to Cramming. When they get loses they often start squirreling. Then they really get loses."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"HOW TO GET RESULTS IN AN HGC 3 HCOB 25.08.71 HSDC    507    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE That ends them as auditors. An auditor working in a good on policy organization is given service. He does get sent to Cramming. He does keep his tech updated. He gets wins. When he doesn’t he’s put back on standard tech. So he happily keeps going and makes lots of happy people. So if I were auditing in a group I would insist as a condition of work that Div IV and Div V be good on policy divisions, fully organized with no nonsense. I know whereof I speak. As a part-time duty I work as a consulting C/S with a good IV and a good V. Sometimes I have had to take over the whole C/S line. When the organization bogs in any way I know the whole thing is heading toward single-handing the lot. So I get the lines back in and get people to Cramming and get the F/N at Examiner ratio approaching 100% again. Thus, the advice you get about C/Sing is live-live-live, not canned theory. ORG WINS Being on administrative lines to all orgs, I can tell you pointblank that Their stats depend on their volume and quality of service. That isn’t propaganda. It’s pure fact. The F/N-no F/N at Examiner ratio tells you at once if Divs IV and V are organized and operating or if they are just fooling about. At 50% to 75% F/N at Examiner the administrative functions of Divs IV and V are stinking bad. C/S Series 25 is out. Cramming is out. Hidden data lines exist. HCO Bs, books and tapes are not used. The public, at that % of F/N, will stay away in droves. Registrars will go batty and adopt “Hot Prospect Systems”. The staff will go low pay and the execs will be a perpetual dark shade of purple from yelling. The cash-bills ratio will be the subject of finance missions and the neighbors will be phoning the police. Why? Because an org is itself a technical delivery organization and 50% to 75% F/N at Ex-aminer is an overt product. The Academy has already failed to apply student study tech and word clearing. Qual is a joke. There is no library of tech available and if available isn’t read.

Orgs should be selling more training than processing. But why train if you can’t interne them in a good Qual and HGC? They’ll never amount to anything as auditors unless they work in an organization that is on tech and on pol-icy. So you need an HGC. Tech, done in a proper administrative framework, works. Some orgs really don’t believe they could ever attain the flubless auditing quality of Flag. But they can. It is even easy. It is even easier to attain flubless quality of auditing than any other kind. You put in a real on policy admin pattern in IV and V. You begin with a Qual Interne Course.

It contains the Meter details, Pc’s indicators and the Pc’s statement. The Summary Report Form is written by the Auditor after the session on a fill-in type standard form and is simply an exact record of what happened and what was observed during the session. The Auditor’s Report Form is made out at the end of each session and is an outline of what actions were taken during the session. The Worksheets are the sheets on which the Auditor writes a complete running record of the session from beginning to end, page after page, as the session goes along. A Correction List is a list of prepared questions on a mimeoed sheet which is used by the Auditor for the repair of a particular situation, action, or Rundown. An L&N List (Listing and Nulling List) is a list of items given by a Pc in response to a Listing Question and written down by the Auditor in the exact sequence that they are given to him by the preclear. Each list is done on a separate sheet. A Dianetic Assessment List is a list of somatic items given by a Pc and written down by the Auditor with the reads marked that occur on the Meter. A Miscellaneous Report is a report such as an MO Report, a D of P Interview, an Eth-ics Report, a Success Story, etc, which is put in the Pc’s folder and gives a C/S more informa-tion about the case. The reports filed in the folder from one session consist of: The Worksheets stapled together with the Auditor’s Report Form on Top.

The folder is foolscap size, light card. The pc’s name and Grade is printed (using a fat felt pen) on the front of the folder and also along the spine. It’s on the spine so you can pull it out of a stack, if they are lying in piles. Folders of pcs on Advanced Course levels are marked “Confidential” and striped on the front cover with green tape for R6EW and Clear, and gold (yellow in practice because gold tape not so readily available) for OT I – VIII. Expanded Dn folders are marked with red coloured tape, from the front cover round the back of the bind, so they can be picked out of a folder stack. If an Org has two HGCs, coloured tape can be used similarly to distinguish which folder goes to which C/S. Tape colour flashes so far in use are: Red – Expanded Dianetic Folders Green – Folders of pcs at Advanced Courses Levels R6EW and Clear Gold – Folders of pcs at Advanced Courses Levels OT I – OT VIII and these colours should not be used for any other purpose.

A rubber band or elastic garter is placed around each folder to prevent loss of contents and make for easier handling. NEW FOLDERS HGC Admin should not let the folders get too fat as this wrecks the folder and makes handling difficult. When the current folder gets too fat (approximately 2½’’ or 6 cms) a new folder is started. The Case Progress Sheet, Yellow Sheet, Folder Summary, OCA Graph and Program Sheets are all carried forward to the front of the new folder. The Invoice Form, Routing Form, Dn Flow Table and FES are also transferred to the back of the folder. The new folder is given a folder number (for example 2) which is marked boldly on the bottom left-hand side of the front cover and along the spine.

All auditing reports of whatever type of action are simply filed chronologically in the current HGC folder. The only separate category of folders is Solo Folders held by Advanced Courses. STORAGE OF FOLDERS Old folders and those of pcs not currently on auditing lines are filed in alphabetical order in a store. A log book of pc folders is maintained. This includes the number of folders for each pc (and where stored if not in current use). TRANSPORT OF FOLDERS Folders are never handed to the pc. They are handled as per C/S Series 25. When pc folders are sent to another Org (such as an AO or Flag) the folders are checked for completeness, packaged securely, and tied with string which is sealed (with a sealing wax). A “Mail Slip” system is used to ensure that the folders are not lost in transit. The mail slips are done in 3 copies: plain paper or 3 copy invoice books can be pur-chased. The original is kept by the sender. The other two copies (and they must be dark and legible) go inside the mail pack. They may not be put in an envelope in the pack. They are left on the top visible. The package is addressed to “The Director of Tech Services” of the Org to which it is being mailed. On receipt of the folders, one of the copies is sent on normal dispatch lines back to the originating Org to complete the cycle. NO ADMIN FOLDER The practice of starting a separate “Admin Folder” to hold all the admin bits and pieces is not necessary and is not standard admin.

Auditor Admin Series 14R THE WORKSHEETS The Worksheets are the sheets on which the Auditor writes a complete running record of the session from beginning to end, page after page, as the session goes along. A Worksheet is always foolscap, 8 x 13 inches, written on both sides and each page is numbered, back and front, top center of page. This is so an Auditor can say, „Now the R/S occurred on page 25,” which saves a lot of time. Further it gives the proper number of pages the session went. The Worksheet is written in two columns. The Auditor writes down the left-hand col-umn and then down the right-hand column. CONTENT OF WORKSHEET The most important parts of the session to be noted are: A. When the TA goes up (on what?) B. When the TA goes down (on what?) C. When an F/N occurs (on what – any cog?) D. When VGIs occur (on what?) E. When BIs occur (on what?) F. How the process ran (what commands are being run?) G.

All reading items are circled in green after the session. R/S items, Ethics situations, Ser Facs and Evil Purps are marked, after the session, by ringing them on the W/S with a red pen. SHORTHANDING Auditors usually develop a system of shorthanding the session actions being done, so that session speed is not hampered by Admin. For example, the repetitive process: Recall a change Recall a no-change Recall a failed change is run as a bracket (the pc is given the first command, then the second and then the third and then the first and then the second, etc.). The first command can be abbreviated to 1, the second to 2, and the third to 3. The W/S therefore would look like: 1232   2.8        a 9 failed 9 (note that each word of the command is cleared before clearing the command as a whole) change 9 no-change 9 recall 9  F/N    1.         cleared 2.       cleared 3.       cleared "},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"THE WORKSHEETS 3 BTB 6.11.72R VII HSDC    541    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 1249   2.6        1.

Whatever system of abbreviation is used by the auditor, the worksheet must communicate to the c/s what actions were taken during the session. LEGIBILITY Worksheets should be written legibly. They are never recopied. The Auditor should always read over his W/sheets before turning in the folder to the Case Supervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read, they should be put in in block print, in red. Example:   TOTALLY     ← (red) want to get ΤΘΣΔΛΛΨ well ↑ (illegible word) This can be overdone, to the extent that it is almost sarcasm. At the most it should just run into one or two corrections to a page. If the Auditor is having to correct the page more than that he should learn how to write rapidly and legibly.

When a C/S has auditors who can’t write well and rapidly, he gets misunderstood words when he tries to read the worksheets. One temporary solution is to make the auditor block print the word in red above each hard to read word. Some auditors go to an extreme of block printing the whole W/S. The more permanent solution is to have Auditors in Cramming practice writing well and clearly no matter how slowly and then, maintaining the same clarity, speed it up. The auditor after many such practice sessions winds up writing clearly and fast. This can be in-creased until an auditor can write clearly as fast as people talk. The occasional headaches a C/S might get are not from the restim of the case he’s studying but are from the words on W/Ses he can’t make out. If a C/S does not insist on both block print clarification and auditor writing practice, he will wind up not reading worksheets and may even get foggy about certain cases. A remedy is to go back to the first folders not understood and get the words clarified and then keep this C/S Series HCO B IN. L.

Both copies are left in the folder. The C/S initials the one for Ethics and sends it on. The other stays in the folder. Sometimes one finds another person’s offences than the pc’s in getting off withholds. These when serious should be reported to Ethics for investigation. Pcs can be sent to Ethics (i.e. for PTS handling, Court of Ethics for refusing to answer an Auditing Question, etc, etc) but the following rule applies: There is no direct routing of preclears to the ethics officer except through the channels of the qualifications division. When the C/S decides to send the pc to Ethics, he marks a small goldenrod card “ETH”, clips it to the folder and sends the folder to the Examiner. The Examiner checks over the folder, and calls pc in via Qual I&I for an Examination. If folder not okay, it is returned to the C/S with appropriate Cramming Orders. If all is correct the Examiner sends the pc direct to Ethics. If not, pc is routed back to the HGC and the Examiner or Cramming Officer writes up the required Cramming Orders. When pc has finished his Ethics Cycle he is routed back to the Examiner and is re-turned to the HGC via Qual I & I. It is D of P’s responsibility to keep a tension line in with Ethics to make sure the Eth-ics cycle is completed and the pc is returned to Tech lines. If the pc is returned to HGC lines for a PTS situation to be handled by auditing, a small yellow card is clipped to the outside of the folder by the C/S until the pc finishes the PTS R/D. All data about such actions are filed in the folder, including a copy of the Ethics Offi-cer Interview notes. It is the responsibility of HGC Admin to see that Conditions Orders and Ethics Orders that affect the preclear’s auditing progress get put in the pc’s folder for the C/S to see. Cases undergoing Ethics actions, Comm Evs, amends projects or low conditions should not be audited until the Ethics matter is cleared up and complete. It only louses up their cases to audit them when under such stress. Pcs in lowered conditions should be encouraged to work out of the condition and when they reach Emergency the auditing may be resumed.

The Invoice is used for pc scheduling, verification of payment before delivery of ser-vice, and preparation of the weekly income report. The Invoice does not go into the pc auditing folder and must not be lost as this could prevent scheduling, delivery of service, or result in auditing without payment. The Invoice details are filled in on the Form (see attached) at the back of the folder. The Invoice is placed in the basket of invoices for the weekly income breakdown sheet, and afterwards filed in a weekly envelope with the Tech copy of the weekly income breakdown sheet in Tech Services. Advance payment invoices received are filed alphabetically in files in Tech Services. When the invoice indicating final payment of service is received, all related invoices for that person and service are pulled out of the alphabetical AP files and stapled to the final payment invoice, and the name and date of expected arrival posted up on a board in Tech Services. The invoices are filed alphabetically in a special file containing only paid up invoices, which are the Tech Div “hot” files for new students and pcs. The Routing Form is paper-clipped to the front of the folder.

Two gross goofs I have noticed since case supervising folders on the RSM is that Auditors have not been turning in Ethics cases to the MAA. In one instance, a Pc was audited by 2 auditors in 2 different sessions, got a R/S on crimes against Scientologists and M/W/Hs and neither auditor turned the Pc in to Ethics. This is not the only instance. The second thing is that Auditors are very evaluative of the Pc’s case as indicated by their comments on the Summary Report. This is incorrect; this report is used simply as an exact record of what hap-pened during the session. It is not up to the auditor to evaluate the Pc’s Case, this is the Case Supervisor’s job. The auditor may suggest what is to be run, at which time the Case Supervi-sor will review the session, what was run, how the Pc went in relation to what was being run and then give his directions. ____________________"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF HOW TO WRITE AN AUDITOR’S REPORT, 3    HCOB    7.5.69    WORKSHEETS AND SUMMARY REPORT, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HSDC    561    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Auditor Report Forms or W/sheets are never recopied.

On the worksheets you note, in abbreviated form, the technical actions taken by the auditor, the pc response, time and TA. The Case Supervisor expects a synopsis of the incident or what the pc says, e.g. in Dianetic auditing the auditor writes down sufficient for the Case Supervisor to see what sort of incident is being run and if it is on the correct chain. One should not go to the other extreme by noting only the auditor's tech actions as this gives the C/S no means of evaluating the session. The auditor who just sits and lets the pc roll on and on running a sort of solo session will seldom get results. It is a pretense of auditing. The auditor controls the session. The audi-tor does not supersede auditing by admin. Never hold the pc up while you write or the pc will go onto automatic. Because he does not see the pc's pictures the auditor in some cases feels he cannot control them or that they do not really exist. The pictures do exist. They respond to the auditor not the pc. Auditor plus pc is greater than the bank. A stenographer is not an auditor. An auditor controls the session, has excellent TRs and gets results. Brian Livingston CS-5 for L.

C/S Series 97 AUDITING REPORTS, FALSIFYING OF Probably the most covert and vicious crime in auditing is falsifying an auditing report. At first glance, to someone who is trying to PR himself as an auditor or to escape con-sequences of session goofs, this might not seem to be the huge crime that it is. When an auditing report is falsified, means of repairing the pc are denied, out tech and a need for restudy or redrilling of materials is covered up, out tech is spread about and the repute of the org and Scientology are at risk. There are many ways of falsifying an auditing report. Chief amongst them is omission of vital data in the report. Another is faking the things run or the pc’s actions or reactions. To the person doing this it may seem that he has covered up his incompetence but in actual fact it is eventually detected. A twice declared person recently messed up the cases of several VIPs by simply omit-ting some of their disagreements with what was being done. Three SPs, now declared, some years ago had a mutual understanding that they would not put down each other’s withholds. These three also falsified auditing reports to the effect that they had run certain things on pcs “and there was nothing on them,” when in fact they either had not run them or there was reaction which they did not put into the report. They messed up about a dozen people before they were caught and it took many, many hours of careful C/Sing and auditing to salvage those cases (and it also took about two years). They made several hundred serious enemies for themselves and today I doubt any Scientologist would even speak to them and their names are remembered with scathing contempt. It is not only easy to detect a falsified auditing report, it is also inevitable that it will be detected."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"AUDITING REPORTS, FALSIFYING OF 2 HCOB 26.10.76 HSDC    566    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The person whose auditing reports have been falsified is easy to spot in folders and re-cords. The auditor marks “VGIs, F/N” and the Examiner notes bypassed charge and bad indi-cators. An auditor seeking to prevent this being detected has been known to take the Exam-iner Report from the folder but that there is no Examiner Report would be the first thing a C/S would notice. Examiner Reports have been forged and exchanged with the actual one but this too is very visible. Lack of a proper success story points directly to out tech and if it is not visible in the folder then that folder contains falsified auditing reports. The pc in the midst of his auditing, refuses to re-sign for more. An inspection of folder either finds the out tech in the auditing reports or it doesn’t. If the Folder Error Summary finds no out tech, the next thing that is looked for is falsified auditing reports and this is ex-tended to looking at the other cases this auditor has handled to see if there is any similarity of reaction. A D of P interview with the pc will reveal falsified auditing reports. It will contain data that does not appear in the auditing reports. The first thing suspect is the auditing reports. Basically, correct tech applied by a competent auditor who has been trained and in-terned, works and works every time. When it “doesn’t work,” a C/S begins to look for the real scene. There are many ways he can ascertain the actual scene. Amongst these are outside-the-door session taping, monitors, interviews, lack of success stories, failures to declare, failures to re-sign, Examiner Reports at variances with the session reports, personal check-up into the case and many others. The only thing which temporarily misleads a C/S is a falsified auditing report. But in all our experience with these, the detection of such reports is inevitable even if it occurs a long time afterwards. The person who would falsify an auditing report is usually found to be a suppressive with abundant R/Ses and evil intentions who never should have been trained in the first place. Therefore, the penalty for knowingly falsifying an auditing report in order to make oneself seem more competent than one is or to hide departures from the C/S or to omit vital data necessary to C/Sing, resulting in upsets to a case and time spent in investigation by sen-iors, is actionable by a Committee of Evidence and if the matter is proven beyond reasonable doubt, a cancellation of all certificates and awards, a declare and an expulsion order are man-datory. Should the person perpetrating the falsification of auditing reports run away (blow) before action can be taken, the result is the same and is enforceable even if the person is not present. A green auditor may look upon the offense as slight. If he is too untrained to realize that proper application of tech works every time and that improper application is a gross overt act, he may not realize the seriousness of his action. This however cannot be pleaded as a de-fense.

A Case Supervisor, as well as a Folder Error Summary Auditor and the Auditor himself can be impeded greatly by folder omissions. Loss of folders entirely is a much greater catastro-phe. While cases and even folders can be reconstructed and eventually handled (at enormous trouble and time to the pc and technical people) this does not minimize the offense. Usually Folder Pages are regarded too lightly as a post and are subject to much transfer even when posted. The Director of Tech Services is often far too lax in posting a Folder Ar-chives I/C even as a double hat. Space restrictions often impede the careful preservation of folders in orgs. But all these posts and spaces are vital to a smooth delivery of auditing and should not be lightly looked upon. The commonest (and most senseless) omissions from folders are: 1. Word Clearing Worksheets. These are done in Academies or training or Interne areas as well as the HGC and it is often an omitted action to forward them to the person’s pc folder. Often the lines to do so are unknown or completely missing. Yet every metered word clearing action should not only be the subject of a worksheet but also must be in-cluded in the person’s pc folder in date order. Word clearer can fail to F/N a chain or even fail to clear a word as a chain when it doesn’t F/N. Such goofs can mess up cases and leave a C/S perplexed as to how the pc was running well one day and badly the next – yet there is no word clearing worksheet there, so the fact of another auditor on the case is hidden. 2. Qual Why Finding Actions. As why finding also includes listing, possibly the most vicious omission is the failure to include Why Finding worksheets in the person’s folder or even do a worksheet on it. Yet at least one org has been temporarily wrecked by indiscriminate “why finding” in Qual that resulted in wrong items and wrong lists and messed up the cases of whole staffs.

It is urgent that you know of these in advance. DRUG RUNDOWN The effects of an omitted or incomplete Drug RD are severe enough to deny a person any lasting case gain. This is covered in HCOB 31 May 74 “Unhandled Drugs and Ethics.” Some orgs have taken this HCOB so literally however, that they have taken pcs off Adv Cses Grades, refused to do assists on ill pcs and some showed pcs the HCOB and invaled their gains. This was not the intention of the HCOB. The C/S Series remain valid. The Drug RD belongs on the Grade Chart after Life Repair. A Drug RD cannot be done over out ruds and a Life Repair may be necessary to get in a pc’s ruds. Life Repair is not a prerequisite for the Drug RD, however, and if done is not to be dragged out intensive after intensive. In some cases a pc could not complete Life Repair without a Drug RD.

EXPANDED DIANETICS Ex Dn by the way belongs ideally after Grade IV Expanded, but can be done after Dn, after Power but before Solo, and after OT III or any single OT Level above OT III.

Martians? “Got to secretly do everybody in” probably applies to Apeville some long date ago and he’s never come up to PT. The best answer is to bring the pc up the Grade Chart to Grade IV then do his Ex Dn unless the pc would need XDN to make it at all. (See HCOB 15 Apr 72 “Expanded Dianetics Series 1R” and HCOB 29 Nov 70 “C/S Series 22.”) The prerequisites for Ex Dn are covered on HCOB 23 April 74R “Ex Dn Series 22R, Expanded Dianetics Requisites.” GRADE II Some orgs specialize in Grade II, especially on org staff. The pc is always getting Confessionals or his O/Ws pulled on so and so. If you look on the Grade Chart you will find withholds and overts are Grade Two. Below Grade Two lies Grade I (Problems) and Grade Zero (Communications). And below that is Dianetics and at the bottom end of Dianetics is the drug handling. Now how do you expect a fellow who has unhandled drugs (or omitted drug items be-cause of “no interest”) to even know (no Grade 0) that other people are around or that (Grade I) he is caved in with problems he’s never cognited on? And he’s supposed to have enough responsibility to answer up on Grade II? With real overts and withholds? This does not mean you must never Sec Check.

Also, some cases do not know they have recovered. It is Scientology that addresses improved awareness, not Dianetics. Dianetics accom-plishes an eradication of the unwanted condition and when it is gone it is gone. The pc will not again mention it in many cases and it would be an error to hammer him about being better now. Therefore a second Health Form gives a comparison. The somatics and pains not men-tioned in the second which were in the first can be considered to be gone. A second form done later gives the auditor and (when a Case Supervisor is also on the case) the Case Supervisor an indication of the actual improvement. A few days, weeks or months can elapse between giving the form. This gives an indication of improvement. Any number of Health Forms can be given. One of the old problems of Dianetics was that the pc recovered from his arthritis fully and then only nagged the auditor about a new symptom. It wasn’t that the pc had to have an illness (only the 19th Century psychologist believed that it was no use to cure anything as the patient just got something else). The fact is that the symptoms of the pc are several, not just one. You take up and audit each symptom or complaint to erasure of its picture, one after the other. This is a new advance in Dianetics – that a preclear’s illness or upset has more than one source. His illness or upset is a composite. You audit the most available symptom first until the picture causing it is erased. Then find the next one and audit it to erasure of its picture, then the next, etc."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"HEALTH FORM 2 HCOB 19.5.69 HSDC    578    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The symptom which has the longest read and also in which the pc is interested is the one to do first. You run its chain to erasure of basic and it vanishes. Then do the one which has the longest read (omitting the first from the list) and in which he is interested and run its secondary or engram or chain to erasure. Now find the next symptom, etc. Sooner or later the pc will have a well, healthy body, health, stability and a sense of well-being. One finds “an incident which could have caused that”, dates it loosely, runs it as an in-cident without pushing hard, gets an earlier similar incident and runs that, or even a third or fourth earlier similar (each time earlier) incident until a floating needle or the pc indicates the picture is gone (has erased). Then one finds out what may now be bothering the pc by new assessment and does the same action on it. You can expect each chain to end with Good Indicators, pc smiling and happy. It is not all done in one session. You only end a session really when the pc is smiling and happy after an erasure of the basic picture on the chain. Sooner or later the pc will become bright, happy, symptom free, stable and has a well body. Then one shifts the preclear off into Scientology auditing to bring about maximum in-telligence and ability. Symptoms are pains, emotional feelings, tiredness, aches, pressures, sensations, unwanted states of the body, etc. If you are auditing without a meter, you take the pc’s interest as the indicator. You au-dit the symptom in which he is interested and cease to audit it when it is gone. This however is very chancy and often fails, so an E-Meter is recommended. You can use whatever is given on the original Health Form that was done until the form is no longer valid or until the pc’s good indicators are in. When the pc brightens up, that’s the end of the Health Form. A new one must be done when the pc is again feeling bad, tired or worried. The purpose of any session or series of sessions is to get the pc feeling well and happy. Sometimes the pc’s condition is obvious and the engram equally obvious. The pc has just had a child. The delivery of it and any earlier similar engram is of course audited at once. Any recent experience is so handled. If a pc wants no auditing and yet is ill or miserable, one finds out why he doesn’t want to be audited by getting him to explain (when he will become auditable) or one finds and runs as secondaries, engrams or chains bad experiences with treatment. The best answer to a diffi-cult pc is to send him or her for a Scientology Review and then begin Dianetics."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"HEALTH FORM 3 HCOB 19.5.69 HSDC    579    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE If the pc doesn’t recover at all, then the Auditor’s Code has been violated or the en-grams were overrun or not run long enough to erase or the pc was very ill medically and should have had a medical examination first. But even with poor auditing it is rare for a pc not to recover. Of course, the more skilled (follows the Auditor’s Code, knows his meter, knows his Dianetics) the Auditor is, the more certain recovery becomes. The worst crime is overwhelming the pc by telling him what’s wrong, not letting him tell you. The Health Form is of very great assistance in handling all this. The use of it is as fol-lows: 1. The Auditor sits down with the pc (usually the pc on a meter) and explains he’s going to do a Health Form and try to help the pc. 2. The Form is completed. 3. The Auditor picks out by meter or by asking the pc which symptom he has his atten-tion on. 4. The Auditor finds an incident that had that symptom in it, dates it and runs it as an in-cident as per R-3-R. 5. The incident picture (and symptom) erases or the auditor finds an earlier similar inci-dent, etc until the pictures and symptoms are gone. 6. A new symptom is located on the Health Form by meter and its chain is erased. Each chain erased should leave the pc cheerful if not completely well. 7. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated. 8. A new symptom is located on the Health Form or by pc’s complaint. 9. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated. 10.

It is metered. Don’t try to handle items as the PC gives them unless an item BDs and the PC is inter-ested. Otherwise assess after it is done. It also should be reassessed for additional items to run. If the PC gives you a medical term (e.g. Migraine Headache) as an illness, write it down in the first column then ask PC what the somatic is (e.g. Pain in Head), write that down in the second column and note beside it any read. There is no rote command. Get somatics (not incidents) that can be assessed and run. If the PC gives you a somatic don’t then ask for the feeling of it. Just write it down in the second column with its read and carry on down the list. If the PC gives several somatics in response to one illness, write down each as a separate somatic. Assess only the second col-umn. Do not assess multiple somatics (i.e. several somatics as one item) and do not assess items that are not somatics. Do not assess narrative items. Do not accept or assess considera-tions. Remember that an illness has more than one somatic to be audited out before it is wholly gone. Persons medically ill should be sent for medical exam. Cross those off that have been run until form is completely handled. The end product of this form is entirely to pick out what to audit.

It is done in a formal Dianetic auditing session in an auditing room with the pc duly signed up, and in session. WHO DOES THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET The auditor assigned to audit the preclear does the assessment. It is included as part of the preclear’s auditing time as it is valuable data collection on the preclear’s case, done with the preclear on the meter. PURPOSE OF ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET The purpose of this form is to provide essential data regarding the preclear to the C/S, the D of P and the auditor, and to better acquaint the auditor with the preclear at the onset of auditing. HOW IS THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET DONE The assessment is done with the preclear on the meter. The preclear is given the R-Factor that you will simply be asking him for essential data about himself for the purpose given above. The auditor notes down the data as the pc gives it. He does not take up the pc’s answers to the questions, except, when necessary, to make sure the question is answered and the auditor has the facts straight. TA at start and end of the assessment is noted, along with any TA action during the as-sessment. Needle reactions to the questions are noted when the question is given plus any needle reac-tion that occurs during the pc’s reply. NEATNESS OF ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET The data should be written plainly and neatly on the assessment sheet so that it is readable, as the information is wanted. Auditor does not delay or hold up the pc giving answers, however, while he completes admin. WHERE DOES THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET GO WHEN COMPLETED When completed, the Original Assessment Sheet is kept in the preclear’s folder.

The Dianetic CS-1 is done on the pc’s auditing time. It is done to give the pc the necessary data and R-Factor on basics and Dianetic proce-dure so he fully understands and is able and willing to be audited successfully. The auditor should know his materials very well and should have a Tech Dictionary, his HCOB pack, a regular but simple dictionary in the language being audited, ready in the CS-I session for reference and for clearing up any misunderstoods or questions the pc may have. A) To clear the various Dianetic terms, use the Definitions Sheet attached to this issue (Attachment No. 1), where the definitions have been taken from the glossary at the back of the book Dianetics Today and from the Tech Dictionary. Also make full use of the Tech Dictionary, Dianetics Picture Book, plus BTB 11 Dec 69R “Dianetic Illustrations” and other references listed at the end of this issue. If further references are needed, ensure you use source materials. B) When the pc has read and grasped the definition of a Dianetic term have him give you the definition in his own words and if necessary have him give you sentences using it correctly. Have him give you examples – “real life” examples where possible, using his experiences or those of friends or relatives. Have him demonstrate the word or item, using a demo kit.

Get the pc to explain the difference between a comm cycle and the auditing comm cycle. Have him demonstrate it. You can also ask him questions like: “Have you eaten dinner?” (or breakfast or lunch) and when he replies, ask “What did you do when I asked you that ques-tion?” 6. Work with TRs on the pc until he has a good idea of auditing. 7. Clear the words: a) charge b) mental mass. 8. Go over with the pc what the meter does (registers interest and charge/mental mass). For demonstrations, you can do a “pinch test” where you explain to the pc that to show him how the meter registers mental mass you will give him a pinch as part of the dem-onstration. Then get him to think of the pinch (while he is holding the cans) showing him the meter reaction and explaining how it registers mental mass. 9. Define: floating needle.

If it is done in more than one, the session should be ended off at the end of a step or completion of a word or demonstration – never in the middle.

DIANETICS: Man’s most advanced school of the mind. From the Greek dia, through, and noos, soul, thus “through soul” or “through thought.” THETAN: From THETA (life static), a word taken from the Greek symbol or letter: theta, traditional symbol for thought or spirit. The thetan is the individual himself – not the body or the mind. The thetan is the “I”; one doesn’t have or own a thetan; one is a thetan. MIND: A control system between the thetan and the physical universe. It is not the brain. The mind is the accumulated recordings of thoughts, conclusions, decisions, observations and perceptions of a thetan throughout his entire existence. The thetan can and does use the mind in handling life and the physical universe. BODY: The organized physical composition or substance of an animal or man whether living or dead. It can also mean a grouping or gathering, or any whole of anything. PICTURE: An exact likeness; image. A mental image. MENTAL IMAGE PICTURES: Mental pictures, facsimiles and mock-ups; a copy of one’s perceptions of the physical universe sometime in the past. REACTIVE MIND: Reactive bank. The portion of the mind which works on a stimulus-response basis (given a certain stimulus it will automatically give a certain response) which is not under a person’s volitional control and which exerts force and power over a person’s awareness, purposes, thoughts, body and actions. It consists of locks, sec-ondaries, engrams and chains of them and is the single source of human aberration and psychosomatic ills. BANK: Reactive bank; reactive mind; engram bank. The mental image picture collection of the preclear. It comes from computer technology where all data is in a “bank”; portion of the mind which contains engrams, secondaries and locks. AUDITING: Processing, the application of Dianetic or Scientology processes and procedures to someone by a trained auditor. The exact definition of auditing is: the action of ask-ing a preclear a question (which he can understand and answer), getting an answer to that question and acknowledging him for that answer. AUDITING SESSION: 1. a precise period of time during which the auditor listens to the pre-clear’s ideas about himself. 2. a period in which an auditor and preclear are in a quiet place where they will not be disturbed. The auditor gives the preclear certain and exact commands which the preclear can follow."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"DIANETIC CS-1 7 HCOB 9.07.78R HSDC    607    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE PRECLEAR: From pre-Clear, a person not yet Clear; generally a person being audited, who is thus on the road to Clear; a person who, through Dianetic and Scientology process-ing, is finding out more about himself and life. AUDITOR: A person trained and qualified in applying Dianetics and/or Scientology proc-esses and procedures to individuals for their betterment; called an auditor because auditor means “one who listens.” An auditor is a minister of the Church of Scientol-ogy. COMMUNICATION CYCLE: A completed communication, including origination of the communication, receipt of the communication, and answer or acknowledgement of the communication. A communication cycle consists of just: cause, distance, effect, with intention, attention, duplication and understanding. AUDITING COMM CYCLE: This is the auditing comm cycle that is always in use: 1) is the pc ready to receive the command? (appearance/ presence), 2) auditor gives command/question to pc (cause, distance, effect), 3) pc looks to bank for answer, 4) pc receives answer from bank, 5) pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect), 6) auditor acknowledges pc, 7) auditor sees that pc received acknowledgement (attention), 8) new cycle beginning with (1). CHARGE: The stored quantities of energy in the time track; stored energy or stored or recre-atable potentials of energy. The electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. Harmful energy or force accumulated and generated in the reactive mind, resulting from the conflicts and unpleasant experiences that a person has had. MENTAL MASS: Mocking up matter, energy, space and time. Its proportionate weight would be terribly slight compared to the real object which the person is mocking up a picture of. FLOATING NEEDLE: A floating needle is a rhythmic sweep of the dial at a slow, even pace of the needle. It can occur after a cognition, blowdown of the tone arm, or just moves into floating. The pc may or may not voice the cognition. In Dianetics the auditor will only indicate the F/N when full end phenomena of the process has been reached. MENTAL IMAGE PICTURE: (Already defined earlier) LOCK: A mental image picture of an incident where one was knowingly or unknowingly re-minded of a secondary or engram. It does not itself contain a blow or burn or impact and is not any major cause of misemotion. It does not contain unconsciousness. It may contain a feeling of pain or illness, etc., but is not itself the source of it. SECONDARY: A secondary is a mental image picture of a moment of severe and shocking loss or threat of loss which contains misemotion such as anger, fear, grief, apathy or"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"DIANETIC CS-1 8 HCOB 9.07.78R HSDC    608    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE “deathfulness.” It is a mental image picture recording of a time of severe mental stress. It may contain unconsciousness. ENGRAM: A mental image picture of an experience containing pain, unconsciousness, and a real or fancied threat to survival. It is a recording in the reactive mind of something which actually happened to an individual in the past and which contained pain and un-consciousness, both of which are recorded in the mental image picture called an en-gram. It must, by definition, have impact or injury as part of its content. These en-grams are a complete recording, down to the last accurate detail, of every perception present in a moment of partial or full unconsciousness. INCIDENT: The recording of an experience, simple or complex, related by the same subject, location or people, understood to take place in a short or finite time period such as minutes or hours or days. DURATION: Length of time; time during which anything continues. (Thorn dike Barnhart Dictionary) CHAIN: A series of incidents of similar nature or similar subject matter.... A series of re-cordings of similar experiences. A chain has engrams, secondaries and locks. Example – Head injury chain in the sequence encountered by an auditor and run by R3RA – sporting goods display window seeing it (lock), losing a bat (secondary), hit in the head with a bat (engram). The engram is the earliest date, the secondary a later date, the lock the most recent. ERASURE: 1. The action of erasing, (rubbing out) locks, secondaries or engrams. 2. Appar-ent removal of the engram from the files of the engram bank and refiling in the stan-dard bank as memory. POSTULATE: A conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to con-clude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pat-tern of the past.... We mean, by postulate, self-created truth. A postulate is, of course, that thing which is a directed desire or order, or inhibition, or enforcement, on the part of the individual in the form of an idea.... Postulate means to cause a thinkingness or consideration. COGNITION: A pc origination indicating he has “come to realize.” It’s a “What do you know? I...” statement. A new realization of life. It results in a higher degree of aware-ness and consequently a greater ability to succeed with one’s endeavors in life. FLOW: An impulse or direction of energy particles or thought or masses between terminals. The progress of particles or impulses or waves from point A to point B. A progress of energy between two points. SOLID: When the meter needle is not floating the TA is registering mass, mental mass. When you see a TA going up, up, up you know the picture isn’t erasing but is getting more solid. Strongly put together; hard; firm. AFFINITY: Degree of liking or affection or lack of it. Affinity is a tolerance of distance. A great affinity would be a tolerance of or liking of close proximity. A lack of affinity"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"DIANETIC CS-1 9 HCOB 9.07.78R HSDC    609    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE would be an intolerance of or dislike of close proximity. Affinity is one of the compo-nents of understanding; the other components being reality and communication. REALITY: The agreed upon apparency of existence. A reality is an data that agrees with the person’s perceptions, computations and education. Reality is one of the components of understanding. Reality is what is. COMMUNICATION: The interchange of ideas or objects between two people or terminals. More precisely the definition of communication is the consideration and action of im-pelling an impulse or particle from source point across a distance to receipt point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt point a duplication of that which emanated from the source point. The formula of communication is: cause, distance, ef-fect, with attention and duplication. Communication by definition does not need to be two-way. Communication is one of the component parts of understanding. ARC BREAK: A sudden drop or cutting of one’s affinity, reality or communication with someone or something. It is pronounced by its letters A-R-C break. PROBLEM: Anything which has opposing sides of equal force; especially postulate-counter-postulate, intention-counter-intention or idea counter-idea; an intention-counter-intention that worries the preclear. PRESENT TIME: A specific problem that exists in the physical universe now, on PROBLEM: which a person has his attention fixed.... Any set of circumstances that so en-gages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited. WITHHOLD: An undisclosed harmful (contra-survival) act. MISSED WITHHOLD: An undisclosed contra-survival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed. This is a withhold which another person nearly found out about, leaving the person with the withhold in a state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not. EXAMINER: Preclear Examiner.

In New Era Dianetics Dianetic assessment has been summarized and simplified and added to. These New Era Dianetics assessment steps are precise. And they will detect and isolate the things that have to be handled to make a pc a well and happy being. It is important to understand what assessment is and what you are attempting to ac-complish when doing an assessment. If you simply understand that you are trying to find an item that reads well, brings in the pc’s indicators, in which the pc is interested, an item which was usefully worded and would run, you would have it. In New Era Dianetics, several different kinds of assessment are used to get items to run out R3RA on the pc. The New Era Dianetics Original Assessment Items This is the first assessment done in New Era Dianetics. It has been known by various names, “Health Form,” “Preclear Assessment Sheet” and is now reissued with only minor changes as HCOB 24 JUNE 78R NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 5R, ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET. It contains the pc’s physical history and background, and gives the auditor and C/S a picture of the case. It is an assessment as it is done on the meter and enables the auditor and C/S to see what needs to be handled. Original Item The original item is a condition, illness, accident, drug, alcohol or medicine, etc. that has been given by the pc to the auditor. This will come from the Original Assessment Sheet, from another New Era Dianetics rundown or may simply be offered by the pc. Original items tend to be general in character, such as “lame” or a medical condition, and are either lacking things you will find on the Preassessment List or are too broad to be"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 2 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    614    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE audited. Pcs normally give items this way when asked for them on the New Era Dianetics Original Assessment Sheet, NED Series 5R. Preassessment Preassessment is a new procedure in New Era Dianetics. It is done with a prepared Preassessment List and determines what categories of somatics are connected to the original item, and which of these is the most highly charged. It is called the preassessment because it comes before the assessment of the actual item to run out R3RA. (The item to be run out is now called the running item.) Preassessment is done on the original item with the Preassessment List. Preassessment List This is found in New Era Dianetics Series 4-1. A prepared list of categories of somatics which is assessed in connection with the original item. (The list includes pains, sensations, feelings, emotions, attitudes, misemotions, unconsciousnesses, sorenesses, compulsions, fears, aches, tirednesses, pressures, discomforts, dislikes, numbnesses.) Preassessment Item The largest reading item obtained on an assessment of the Preassessment List. This item is used to get running items. LISTING FOR RUNNING ITEMS The auditor now takes the preassessment item and makes a list on a separate sheet of paper and asks the pc, “What (preassessment item found) are/is connected with (original item found)?” The auditor writes down exactly what the pc says in a column and notes the meter reads at the exact moment the pc ends the statement of the running item. The result is a list called the “running item list.” If the pc gives you an exact feeling (“feeling scared,” “a burning feeling in my ear,” “a sharp pain in my toe”) the feeling is simply run out R3RA Quad if it reads and the pc is inter-ested. An item which states a somatic and is runnable is called a running item. Running items are exactly stated pains, sensations, feelings, emotions, attitudes, misemotions, uncon-sciousnesses, sorenesses, compulsions, fears, aches, tirednesses, pressures, discomforts, dis-likes, numbnesses. If the pc gives you a general type item like “stomach problems,” a drug, alcohol, medicine, medical term or narrative, which does not state a feeling (etc.), the feelings (etc.)"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 3 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    615    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE for the item must be found so they can be run. The preassessment is done to get running items. Running Item The auditor takes the best reading item on the running item list (possibly an LF or an LFBD or an instant F/N) and checks with the pc, “Are you interested in this item?” and if so it becomes the running item which you will run by R3RA Quad. Running items are sometimes abruptly volunteered by the pc and if they are within the categories of the assessment list they can be run, but be careful of: 1) jumping onto some other subject than the original item you are trying to handle or 2) upsetting the pc because you refuse to audit it. Warning: If you go off New Era Dianetics assessment procedure you will be pot shooting all over a case and never finish it. All this New Era Dianetics procedure is leading up to finding running items that will run and resolve the case. So the thing you are after in assessment is the running item and it is most accurately obtained as above. This is done by taking the original item, say “stomach problems,” doing a preassess-ment on it, and with the preassessment item, finding a running item. (Example: Stomach problems is the original item. A preassessment is done and “sore-nesses” is the largest reading item on the Preassessment List. The auditor then lists for run-ning items, using sorenesses, and gets “A dull soreness on my left side.” This is the running item, which will be handled with R3RA Quad.) PREASSESSMENT Previous to New Era Dianetics you would have taken a Dianetic item such as a drug or a chronic condition or an accident and you would have asked the pc to give you the attitudes, emotions, sensations and pains connected to the item. I have just developed a new procedure on the handling and running of Dianetics. It is called the preassessment. This is how it works. 1. The auditor obtains an original item from the pc. This will be from a drug list, the Original Assessment Sheet or other New Era Dianetics rundown. (It will be a drug, a condition, an illness, an accident, etc.) 2. He then preassesses the feelings on the Preassessment List to find out which preas-sessment item is the most highly charged in connection with the original item. 3. From the preassessment item (the largest reading Preassessment List item) the auditor can get specific somatics called running items from the pc. These running items will be the ones the pc is most interested in. 4.The running item found in Step 3 is run R3RA Quad."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 4 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    616    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Example: The original item is “bronchitis.” The auditor assesses the Preassessment List below by asking the pc: “Are __________ connected with bronchitis?” pains   compulsions   sensations   fears   feelings   aches   emotions   tirednesses   attitudes   pressures   misemotions   discomforts   unconsciousnesses  dislikes  sorenesses   numbnesses   He gets an LF on misemotions. This is the largest read. “What misemotions are connected with bronchitis?” As the pc tells him, the auditor takes them down, noting meter reads while the pc is giving the items. (And that’s all there is to the preassessment.) PREASSESSMENT ITEM This is in turn the largest reading item on the Preassessment List above and then sub-sequently lesser reading items from the same list are taken up. With the preassessment item gotten, the auditor can list to find the running items. (Example: The preassessment item is “misemotion.” The auditor asks, “What misemo-tions are connected with bronchitis?”) He writes down all the answers the pc gives him, with their reads. • Feeling like I want to give up X • Worried about my lungs LFBD • Feeling angry about not breathing F • Scared to death sF The auditor would first run “worried about my lungs” R3RA Quad and then would re-turn to the next best reading item, in this case, “Feeling angry about not breathing. “ RUNNING ITEM The auditor chooses the largest reading item the pc has given and checks interest for the next chain. This is the running item."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 5 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    617    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ACTUAL AUDITING Having found the running item the auditor then runs it out R3RA Quad. FINDING THE NEXT RUNNING ITEM The auditor has a choice of taking a lesser reading item from the Preassessment List or the running item list or (safer) do a new preassessment on the same original item. (You don’t stop working on the original item until it is gone completely and forever.) Having done a preassessment on the same original item you do a new running item list, take the best read (fall, LF, instant F/N) and use it as your new running item. ASSESSMENT COMMANDS Commands for the Original Assessment Sheet of the New Era Dianetics Rundown: 1) Ask the question on the Original Assessment Sheet. Write answer and note meter read. 2) “Are (preassessment item being called) connected with (original item being preas-sessed)? “ 3) “What (largest reading preassessment item) are connected with (original item)?” 4) “Are you interested in running (largest reading or instantly F/Ning running item found in 3 above)?” 5) Go straight into R3RA Quad, using the item in 4 if the pc is interested. HANDLING SOMATICS The Preassessment List is designed to locate somatics which the auditor can then han-dle with R3RA. By somatic is meant a pain or ache, sensation, misemotion, or even unconsciousness. There are a thousand different descriptive words that could add up to a feeling Pain, aches, dizziness, sadness, they are all feelings. All chains are held together by the general various awarenesses which are named on the Preassessment List. One generally identified difficulty given by the pc on the original assessment is, in ac-tual fact, in almost all cases composed of pains, sensations, feelings, emotions, attitudes, misemotions, unconsciousnesses, sorenesses, compulsions, fears, aches, tirednesses, pres-sures, discomforts, dislikes and numbnesses as well as one or more postulates. It is very pos-sible that any major Original Assessment item contains 3 or 4 full chains for each one of these."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 6 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    618    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Hence an auditor really hasn’t got a prayer of eradicating a major Original Assessment unless he runs 64 or more complete chains thoroughly and accurately. Some might give up with less and some might require many more. If you follow the New Era Dianetics assessment procedure perfectly and flawlessly, well you have every chance of achieving a well and happy human being. HANDLING NARRATIVES A narrative is a story, an account, a tale. For many years narratives were held in disrepute and auditors were sometimes warned against running them. The reason for this is that when you try to solve a case on narratives alone it takes several thousand hours of auditing. However to abandon narratives totally is to abandon some of the most dramatic case changes you can get. Occasionally the pc will come into a session after a physically or emotionally painful experience, an accident, illness, loss or great emotional stress. Running these incidents out narrative erases the psychic trauma the person has undergone and speeds recovery. You sometimes find that a person’s whole life changed around the death of a relative or child or a divorce or an auto accident or some other similar catastrophe. This is usually found and handled in Action Nine in the HCOB 22 JUNE 1978R NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 2R, NEW ERA DIANETICS FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE. When running a narrative, one is running out the narrative incident. A narrative needs to be run and run and run on that one incident. You are running that incident to erasure and you only go earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly. The trick in running narratives is to find the earlier beginning each time the person is moved through it. (See Action Nine, New Era Dianetics Series 2.) A condition or circumstance without an incident is not narrative. An example of this would be “obstruction of justice.” It would not run as there is not an exact incident. “Hitting a cop” is a narrative. “Feeling sick about cops” is not a narrative as there is no story connected with it, but there is a somatic. RUNNING NARRATIVES To run a narrative item, the auditor must first find out exactly what happened with the pc, then, by asking the pc “What shall we call this incident?” he will have the preclear’s wording and can run it narrative using the New Era Dianetics narrative commands. One would run a narrative item ONLY if it reads well and the pc is interested in running it out. Narrative handling to its full EP can give miraculous results, but it can take a long time to get the pc through it. A full Dianetic EP of postulate off (which is the erasure), F/N"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 7 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    619    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE and VGIs must be reached. If the pc gives a cognition which is not the actual postulate from the incident or doesn’t sound like it to the auditor, the postulate is asked for. NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT COMMANDS 1) Ask the questions called for on the Original Assessment Sheet. 2) Note any original items that contain recent losses, illnesses, accidents, upsets or deaths and ask: “Are you interested in handling (description of item on the Original Assessment Sheet)?” 3) If the pc signifies that he is, go immediately into R3RA Narrative. ASSESSING TONE OF VOICE The auditor does the assessing by asking the question as a question, not as a statement of fact. To assess the question as a statement tends to evaluate and can even invalidate the preclear. You can go around asking questions with a tape recorder going. Play it back and you will notice the voice tone rises on a question and goes down on a statement. So the right way to assess the questions would be to have a slight upcurve at the end, and actually assess it as a question. Assessment is done by the auditor between the pc’s bank and the meter. There is no particular need in Dianetic assessing to look at the pc. Just note which item has the longest Fall or BD. The auditor looks at the meter while doing an assessment. Rote procedure gets heavily in the road of a Dianetic assessment. The pc gives a list, the auditor doesn’t watch the reads and note them, then the auditor commonly goes back to assess the list. By that time the surface charge is off. He should have watched the meter in the first place and taken reads while the pc was originating the item. Why all this assessing of the finished list? Of course when you already have a list done by another with no reads marked on it, you have to read it off and mark what reads. And using a list a second time you have to read it off to the pc to see what reads. In Dianetics one always handles an instant F/N first, then any LFBD, LF, F or sF, in that order. The largest reading items are the ones the pc can most easily confront. When the largest reading item is handled go on to the next biggest reading item (and so on) until all reading items have been handled. This same principle applies to all New Era Dianetics audit-ing. Take up the biggest reading areas and handle those first. You may find there is something plainly visible that is wrong with the preclear, like a broken leg, yet it may not read at all. Instead the meter is reading on the pain in his arm. You do the standard action of handling the items that the meter reads on."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM 8 HCOB 18.06.78R HSDC    620    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In assessing a prepared list such as the Preassessment List always take up the item which got an instant F/N first followed by the next largest read. In a list like the running items list you continue listing until the pc says that’s all or you’ve got an F/N item. If you get in trouble right after listing a running item list on a pc and the pc seems upset and you are not a Scientology auditor, go get a Scientology auditor Class IV fast and have him repair the list for you as it may have become a Scientology list either through auditor error or inability to read a meter or missing a read or whatever. The laws of listing and nulling always apply to Scientology lists and sometimes on rare occasions apply to a Dianetic list and can on these cases cause trouble. Listing for a running item on the running item list usually doesn’t cause trouble as it is already taken from the Preassessment List and is not a very broad question. This and a failure to follow New Era Dianetics assessment and R3RA procedure ex-actly or failure to actually erase the basic on a chain is about all the trouble you’d run into.

The most violent session ARC Brks occur because of list errors under the meaning of listing and nulling. Other session ARC Brks even under withholds are not as violent as those occurring because of listing errors. Therefore when a violent or even a “total-apathy-won’t-answer” session upset has oc-curred in Dianetics, one must suspect that the preclear is reacting under the laws of listing and nulling and that he conceives such an error to have been made. The repair action is to assess the prepared list which corrects listing errors. This is L4BRA – HCOB 15 Dec 68 amended to 18 March 71. It is used “On Dianetics lists” as the start of each of its questions when employed for this purpose. When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be found the C/S should suspect some listing error and order an L4BRA to be done “On Dianetic lists “ at the start of each question. Each read obtained on the list is carried earlier similar to F/N as per HCOB 14 Mar 71 “F/N Everything” or, preferably the list is found in the folder and properly handled in accor-dance with what read on L4BRA. Dianetic lists can be carried to an item that blows down and F/Ns. This does not mean the item found is now wholly clean. Even though it F/Ned it will in most cases need to be run on secondaries and/or engrams (R3RA Quad) to erasure and full Dianetic end phenomena. (Ref: New Era Dianetics Series 1 through 18.) A C/S must be alert to the fact that: (a) Extreme upsets and deep apathies are almost always list errors. (b) That a Dianetic list can be conceived to be a formal list and can behave that way.

It is known as an “after the fact item.” First, why do you get erasures only because you ask for earlier beginnings or earlier similars? Because the thetan’s mind where pictures are concerned parallels the time track. Late things hang up where earlier like things exist. For some reason best known to thetans, you have to get the earlier like thing before you can erase the later like thing. This is built into R3RA. But what isn’t built in is preventing the pc giving or the auditor choosing an “after the fact” running item. An “after the fact” running item is one which clearly has an earlier thing before it, yet, by its very wording, prohibits reaching the earlier thing. Example of an “after the fact” running item: “Repression.” Now clearly something had to happen before in order to have something repress. The pc dutifully begins to run “Feeling repressed.” But what happened that caused it is not part of the item. So he is forced to run late in the incident. Example: “Feeling blue about hospitals.” This will find him in hospitals but will avoid letting him run what put him there. The item is after the fact of having been run over. The way to handle “after the fact” running items is: 1. Learn to recognize them. 2. Don’t choose one off a running item list. Choose something else that read. L.

What you can do in that case is: 1. take the pc off auditing for a few days while the persistent F/N dies out and the envi-ronment keys something in and continue then with the assessment of that original item or 2. go on with some other original item that does read and make a big clear notation in the pc’s program to come back to the original item after you have run some other original items on the case.

In assessing, some auditors have made assessment questions into statements of fact, which of course is a cousin to evaluation. A downcurve at the end of an assessment question contributes to making it a state-ment. Questions should go up at the end. WRONG  RIGHT cycles/sec or note A remedy for this is to record ordinary conversation. Ask some normal questions and make some normal statements and you will find that the voice tone rises on a question and goes down on a statement. Assessing with a statement’s tone of voice instead of a questioning tone of voice re-sults in evaluation for the pc. The pc feels accused or evaluated for rather than assessed and an auditor can get a lot of false and protest reads. It’s all tone of voice. Auditors have to be drilled in asking questions. Assessment questions have an upcurve at the end. Get it? Then drill it. L.

In the chair opposite the student is a doll, occupying the position of the pc. PURPOSE: To familiarize the student with the delivery and use of the Preassess ment List. TRAINING STRESS: This drill is not coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and Preas-sessment List exactly as in a session. He starts the assessment and delivers a complete preassessment on the doll, keeping full admin and using all stan-dard procedures of NED Series 4 to get items for running. Student uses nonsense terms or harmless ones for the original item. He then delivers a preassessment on that. Student then selects the preassessment item from the Preassessment List and asks: “What ______(preassessment item) are connected with (the original item)?” The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good assessment TRs, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion, and can maintain proper assessment admin."},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS COMMAND 3 HCOB 17.07.69RB HSDC    633    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE TR 100-A NAME: Preassessing A Doll Coached COMMANDS: Same as TR 100 POSITION: Same as TR 100, with coach holding the E-Meter cans, and seated beside the student. Coach provides nonsense and harmless items for the student and squeezes the can to simulate E-Meter reads. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver and use the preassessment procedure. TRAINING STRESS: Coach provides a list of original items as from one of the New Era Dianetics rundowns or assessment sheets. The student must choose the best reading original item and deliver the Preassessment List to the doll on that item. All reads on the preassessment must be correctly noted and marked. Student must then select out the correct preassessment item to list for a run-ning item and ask the correct question. As the coach gives running items the student must get these down accu-rately with their reads. Then he must select which he would run on R3RA Quad and in what order. The student must reassess and extend the list of running items and use Sup-press and Invalidate buttons as needed until the list is exhausted. The student must then reassess the Preassessment List, find the next preas-sessment item and handle. Flunks are given for any out TRs on the doll, any incorrectly marked reads, any missed or altered item given and any incorrect selection of an item. Stress is on the student’s ability to make a distinction between an item which requires a preassessment and one that does not. Student must not try to run drugs, medicines, medical terms or multiple somatics. Drill is passed when the student can do the full preassessment procedure with good TRs, proper commands, without comm lags or confusions, can maintain proper assessment admin. TR 101 NAME: R3RA To A Wall COMMANDS: R3RA commands including earlier incident and earlier similar commands. Included in this drilling are the handling of bouncers, checking for erasure, and checking for postulate command actions, as well as are the handling of narrative incident commands. POSITION: Student seated facing a wall."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS COMMAND 4 HCOB 17.07.69RB HSDC    634    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE PURPOSE: To get the student able to give all R3RA commands accurately, in correct order without hesitation or having to think what the next command should be. TRAINING STRESS: This drill is not coached. The student sits facing a wall with a copy of the R3RA bulletin in his lap. The student gives the commands, in order, to the wall maintaining good TR 0 and TR 1. When the student falters or is un-certain of the next command he re-reads the commands from the bulletin then continues to give the commands to the wall. When the student can con-fidently give all the possible R3RA commands accurately without any slightest comm lag, he has passed this drill.

In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the pc. PURPOSE: To familiarize the student with the materials of auditing and coordinate and apply the commands and procedures of New Era Dianetics in an auditing session. TRAINING STRESS: This drill is not coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and work-sheets exactly as in a session.

TR 103 NAME: Auditing On A Doll Coached COMMANDS: All R3RA commands, situations and procedures of New Era Dianetics ex-cept the preassessment procedure. POSITION: Same as in TR 102 except that a coach sits beside student calling out com-mand numbers and situations and the student following them and keeping admin and his meter."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS COMMAND 5 HCOB 17.07.69RB HSDC    635    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE PURPOSE: To give the student total certainty in the use of R3RA commands despite any distraction. TRAINING STRESS: Coach calls for commands at random by stating the letter or number of the command or the situation by saying “solid,” “erasing”” “solid but noth-ing earlier.” The student addresses the right command or action to the doll, handles meter and admin. The coach also uses pc responses such as “That’s all,” “I can’t find one,” etc. These are called for in quick succession and in any order. Coach starts in on a gradient gradually getting the drill faster and becoming sharper on flunks for any comm lags, uncertainties, groping for commands or breaks in TR 0-4. If the student becomes too confused the coach has probably proceeded with too steep a gradient and given the stu-dent too many losses. In such instances have the student go through the commands in proper sequence a few times and then continue with random commands building up the drill on a gradient. The use of the correct command (including those for handling boun cers, checking for erasure, and checking for postulates, as well as correct narra-tive procedure) is required at the appropriate point. TR 104 NAME: R3RA Coached And Bullbaited COMMANDS: All R3RA commands and procedures. POSITION: As for auditing on a doll (TR 102) with coach seated beside student and a bullbaiter as “pc” across from the student instead of a doll. PURPOSE: To train the student to deliver a standard session with correct commands and procedure and without session additives of any kind despite distractions. TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the “pc” coach bullbaits the student auditor during the session in an attempt to throw the student off session while the second coach calls the numbers as on TR 103. Flunks are given for any improper commands, procedure, comm lags, breaks in TRs or improper session admin. The second coach does the “Start,” the flunking or “That’s it.” If the student is not making the grade he is returned to the earlier TR that is out. This drill is coached tough and only passed when the student is totally competent, exact and correct in all com mands, procedures, auditing actions and session admin with excellent TRs and no slightest variation from or additives to New Era Dianetics. Coach ensures the student has total certainty on the application of all R3RA commands and sequences including handling bouncers, checking for era-sure, checking for postulates, and handling narrative incidents.

In TR 103 the “session” is between student and doll. TRs are done on the doll not the coach. 2. In TR 103 the coach is not obliged to answer all of the commands – he may or may not. If he doesn’t, the student assumes the DOLL has answered and proceeds accord-ingly. 3. In TR 103 and TR 104 never give dates and durations, as a coach, in actual units of time – use something else. “4 Figs”, “2 potatoes”, “horsefeathers” are all perfectly good “dates” for coaching purposes or in bull-baiting. 4. Likewise never use real somatics in coaching or bull-baiting TR 103 and TR 104 – use nonsense terms or harmless ones. 5. In TR 103 the coach occupies the position of a bull-baiter who interjects distractions, bull-baiting and disruptive remarks into the “session” between student and doll. He can throw in answers on behalf of the doll which the student must abide by; but the coach does not play the part of “pc”. Don’t go playing the role of “pc” on a real set of process commands!

In that 30 years I have found much that could improve results if properly applied. And in that 30 years, many issues have been written by others that were a bit altered and some materials have been lost. New Era Dianetics corrects these points. Also, recently, I have done additional research and have come up with a few break-throughs. In 1950, I said we should build a better Bridge. Well, in 1978, here is a better Dianetics section of the Bridge. Old-timers in Dianetics will only approve these upgrades. There is no invalidation of what they know already to be true. But there are refinements about which they are jumping with joy. New Era Dianetics is even more acceptable, even more workable. I did this review to move Dianetics back into the “miracles as usual” band and the stu-dent studying it and the auditor practicing it will find that if he follows its precision drills with precision he will be able to handle life and the spirit as never before. Of course I cannot claim or guarantee that anyone audited on Dianetics or New Era Dianetics will become cured of illnesses which would best be handled by immediate medical treatment and I cannot promise any pc that all of his undesirable conditions will be eradicated since that depends on the state of training and the accuracy of application by the student. THE STUDENT What does a student need to know and do to acquire the skill of a Dianetic auditor? 0. The student needs to have completed the Student Hat. He needs to be able to handle study tech. Without that, his misunderstood words will wipe him out. Study tech is contained in the Student Hat. The definitions are in the Tech and Admin dictionaries"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":" HSDC    642    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE and standard dictionaries. The student must not go by a single word he does not know the definition of. 1. He should know the background of Dianetics as contained in several books on the sub-ject, particularly the ORIGINAL THESIS and DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH. 2. He needs an E-Meter and must know how to handle it. 3. He should have good TRs as acquired in a TR course. 4. He should have a good grasp of Objective Processes, both to make him a better audi-tor, and to enable him to do full Drug Rundowns. Objectives are actually Scientology processing but if a Dianetic auditor doesn’t know and cannot do them he is dependent on a Scientology auditor to finish up the Drug Rundown. The training of a Dianetic auditor in Objectives is not as complete as a Scientology auditor’s. But it is sufficient to enable him to do those Objective Processes necessary to get a person off drugs or to get him in condition to run Dianetic processes. 5. He should have a good grasp of the materials of New Era Dianetics. 6. He should be able to make and assess lists of Dianetic items as called for in specific assessments of a preclear in order to complete rundowns and preclears. 7. He must be able to do TR 101 to 104 flawlessly. using the commands of New Era Dianetics. 8. He must know how to do Dianetic Assists. 9. He must be able to assess and handle a Dianetic Repair List and do repair actions. 10. He must be able to handle Dianetic remedies and all other actions called for in a com-plete Dianetic course or processing. 11. He needs to be able to apply what he knows. If the student can acquire the above skills he will achieve fine results. It does not require mile long checksheets to make a good Dianetic auditor. It does require study and hard effective drilling. And it requires a desire to help oneself and others and really make a better Bridge and a better world by putting it there in terms of faultless application. Scientology goes on and is above Dianetics. But Dianetics is the solid base of all this research. So learn and apply it well. L.

R3RA COMMANDS This is a short list on R3RA commands. STEP 1: “Locate a time when you had_______.” STEP 2: “When was it?” (Note: You accept any time or date or approximation the pc gives you. Do not attempt any dating drill.) STEP 3: “Move to that incident.” (This step is omitted if the pc keeps telling you he is there already.) STEP 4: “What is the duration of that incident?” (Accept any duration the pc gives you or any statement he makes about it. Do not attempt to meter him a more accurate dura-tion.) STEP 5: “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” STEP 6: “What do you see?” (If the pc’s eyes are open, tell the pc first, “Close your eyes,” acknowledge him quietly for doing so and then give him the command.) STEP 7: “Move through that incident to a point (duration pc said) later.” STEP 8: If pc comments before reaching the end say “OK, continue.” STEP 9: When pc has reached the end of the incident ask “What happened?” If the TA has risen (from its position at Step 1) the auditor immediately checks for an earlier incident (Step G). If no earlier incident, he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident (Step H). If the TA is the same or lower, he runs the incident through again (Step A). In going through an incident the second or successive times one does not ask for date and duration or any description."},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"R3RA COMMANDS 2 HCOB 28.06.78 HSDC    644    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A. (When the pa has told what happened and the auditor has acknowledged) “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” B. “Move through to the end of that incident.” C. (When the pa has done so) “Tell me what happened.” Ca. “Is that incident erasing or going more solid?” (TA rising means the: incident has gone more solid so the question is unnecessary if TA is higher.) If the incident is erasing, go through it again (Step D). If it has gone more solid, ask for an earlier incident (Step G) and if no earlier incident, ask for an earlier beginning (Step H). D. “Return to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” E. “Move through to the end of that incident.” F. “Tell me what happened.” Fa. “Is that incident erasing or going more solid?” (TA rising means the incident has gone more solid so the question is unnecessary if TA is higher.) If the incident is erasing, go through it again (Step D). If it has gone more solid, ask for an earlier incident (Step G) and if no earlier inci-dent, ask for an earlier beginning (Step H). G. “Is there an earlier incident when you had a (exact same somatic)?” Continue on down the chain of the same somatic using Steps 2-9, A, B. C, D, E, F. G. H and EYE. H. “Is there an earlier beginning to this incident?” or “Does the one we are running start earlier?” or “Does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident?” (If not, give command D and put the pc through the incident again. If there is an earlier beginning, give command EYE.) EYE. “Go to the new beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” (Fol-lowed by B. C.) When it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing, after each pass through, ask: “Has it erased?” The pc sometimes thinks the incident is erasing but it’s not erasing, so you have to go back to your G. H. EYE, followed by 2-9, A-EYE. In some cases this can hap-pen several times in one chain. POSTULATE OFF EQUALS ERASURE The postulate coming off is the EP of the chain and means that you have obtained an erasure. This will be accompanied by F/N and VGIs."},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"R3RA COMMANDS 3 HCOB 28.06.78 HSDC    645    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Getting the postulate is the important thing. Even if you get an F/N you don’t call the F/N UNTIL you’ve gotten the postulate, at which time you have reached the EP and end off on that chain. If the pc says the chain has erased, but the postulate made during the time of the in-cident has not been volunteered by the pc ask: “Did you make a postulate at the time of that incident?” Only when the postulate has come off to F/N and VGIs can one consider that the full EP of a Dianetic incident or chain has been reached. You must recognize what the postulate is when it comes up. If you overrun past the postulate you can really mess a pa up and he may need extensive repair. All you’re trying to get off the line is the postulate. That is what is keeping the chain there. If the pc has given the postulate to F/N and VGIs, that is it. You have the EP of that chain. GOING EARLIER Ordinarily one runs an incident through twice, (Steps 1-9 then A-C), to unburden it and allow the pc to locate earlier incidents on the chain. However, the TA rising on Step 9 is an indication that there is something earlier. If the auditor observes the TA rising, he should ask the pc if there is an earlier incident, using in the command the exact same somatic or feeling used in Step One. If there is no earlier he asks if there is an earlier beginning. An auditor should never solidify a pc’s bank by putting him through an incident twice, when by observation of the TA it is clear that the incident has gone more solid by the end of the first run through. Checking for an earlier incident after the first run through (if the TA has risen) is the solution to this. If, after the second pass through, when you have asked the pc “Is the incident erasing or going more solid?” and the pc doesn’t know or isn’t sure, ask for an earlier incident. Never ask erasing/solid in the middle of an incident. BOUNCERS If the pc is out of the session, out of the incident, bounces from the incident, etc. you would have to have him or her return to the beginning of the incident and move through the incident, returning the pc to the incident as necessary. The pc who bounces out of an incident on a “bouncer” has to be put back into the in-cident and continue running it. The commands to do this are: As soon as you have seen that the pc has bounced give him command D (“Return to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.”), followed with E, F.

You almost can’t get un-complicated enough in engram running. In teaching people to run engrams in 1949, my chief despair was summed up in one sentence to the group I was instructing: “All auditors talk too much.” And that’s the first les-son. The second lesson is: “All auditors acknowledge too little.” Instead of cheerily acking what the pc said and saying “Continue,” auditors are always asking for more data and usually for more data than the pc could ever give. Example: Pc: “I see a house here.” Auditor: “Okay. How big is it?” That’s not engram running, that’s just lousy “Q and A.” The proper action is: Pc: “I see a house here.” Auditor: “Okay. Continue.” The exceptions to this rule are non-existent. This isn’t a special brand of engram run-ning. It is modern engram running. It was the first engram running and is the latest and you can put aside any complications in between. The rule is acknowledge what the pc says and tell him to continue. Then there’s the matter of being doubtful of control. Wrong example: Auditor: “Move to yesterday. Are you there? How do you know it’s yesterday? What do you see that makes you think...” Flunk, Flunk, Flunk. Right example: Auditor: “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” (Pc answers.) “What do you see?.......... Good.” Another error is a failure to take the pc’s data. You take the pc’s data. Never take his orders. EARLY ENGRAM RUNNING No auditor who knew earlier than June 1978 engram running should consider he or she knows how to run engrams. Routine 3RA is itself. It has no dependence on earlier methods of running engrams. Failure to study and learn R3RA “because one knows about engram running” will cause a lot of case failure. If you know old-time engram running there is no attempt here to invalidate you or that knowledge or make you wrong in any way. Those are all ways to run engrams and gave you a better grasp on it. I only wish to call to your attention that R3RA is not old-time engram run-ning."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 3 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    651    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ROUTINE 3RA Engram running by chains is designated “Routine 3RA.” It is a new triumph of simplicity. It does not demand visio, sonic or other perception at once by the pc. It develops them. R3RA REVISED BY STEPS The first thing the auditor does is to make sure the room and session are set up. This means, in other words, that the room is as comfortable as possible and free from interruptions and distractions; that the auditor’s meter is fully charged and set up and that the auditor has all the administrative supplies he will need for the session. Prepared correction lists for Dianetics must also be included. He has the C/S for that session. The pc is seated in the chair furthest from the door and is asked to pick up the cans. The auditor checks that the pc has had enough to eat by doing the metabolism test and also checks that the pc has the correct sensitivity setting by having the pc squeeze the cans and adjusting the sensitivity knob so that the needle registers one third of a dial fall when squeezing the cans. The auditor then starts the session by saying, “This is the session” (Tone 40). The auditor then puts in the R (reality) factor with the pc by telling the pc briefly what he is going to do in the session. PRELIMINARY STEP: Establish the type of chain the pc is to run by assessment. REF: HCOB 18 JUNE 78 NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM.

STEP FOUR: “What is the duration of that incident?” Accept any duration the pc gives you or any statement he makes about it. Do not attempt to meter him a more accurate duration. STEP FIVE: Move the pc to the beginning of the incident with the exact command: “Move to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” STEP SIX: Ask pc what he or she is looking at with the exact command: “What do you see?” (If the pc’s eyes are open, tell the pc first, “Close your eyes,” acknowledge him quietly for doing so and then give him the command.) STEP SEVEN: “Move through that incident to a point (duration pc said) later.” STEP EIGHT: Ask nothing, say nothing, do nothing (except observe the meter or make quiet notes) while pc is going through the incident. If pc comments before reaching the end say “OK, continue.” STEP NINE: When the pc reaches the end of the incident say only: “What happened?” Take whatever pc says, acknowledge only as needful. Say nothing else, ask nothing else. When pc has told little or much and has finished talking, give him a final ac-knowledgement. If the TA has risen (from its position at Step 1) the auditor immediately checks for an earlier incident (Step G). If no earlier incident, he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident (Step H). If the TA is the same or lower, he runs the incident through again (Step A). In going through an incident the second or successive times one does not ask for date and duration or any description. A.

G. “Is there an earlier incident when you had a (exact same somatic)?” Continue on down the chain of the SAME somatic using Steps 2-9, A, B. C, D, E, F. G. H. and EYE. H. “Is there an earlier beginning to this incident?” or “Does the one we are running start earlier?” or “Does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident?” (If not, give command D and put the pc through the incident again. If there is an ear-lier beginning, give command EYE.) EYE. “Go to the new beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.” (Followed by B. C.) POSTULATE OFF EQUALS ERASURE When it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing, after each pass through, ask: “Has it erased?” The pc sometimes thinks the incident is erasing but it’s not erasing, so you have to go back to your G. H. EYE followed by 2-9, A-EYE. In some cases this can happen several times in one chain. The postulate coming off is the EP of the chain and means that you have obtained an erasure. This will be accompanied by F/N and VGIs. Getting the postulate is the important thing. Even if you get an F/N you don’t call the F/N UNTIL you’ve gotten the postulate, at which time you have reached the EP and end off on that chain. If the pc says the chain has erased, but the postulate made during the time of the in-cident has not been volunteered by the pc ask: “Did you make a postulate at the time of that incident?” Only when the postulate has come off to F/N and VGIs can one consider that the full EP of a Dianetic incident or chain has been reached."},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 6 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    654    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE You must recognize what the postulate is when it comes up. If you overrun past the postulate you can really mess a pc up and he may need extensive repair. All you’re trying to get off the line is the postulate. That is what is keeping the chain there. If the pc has given the postulate to F/N and VGIs, that is it. You have the EP of that chain. GOING EARLIER Ordinarily one runs an incident through twice, (Steps 1-9 then A-C), to unburden it and allow the pa to locate earlier incidents on the chain. However, the TA rising on Step 9 is an indication that there is something earlier. If the auditor observes the TA rising, he should ask the pc if there is an earlier incident, using in the command the exact same somatic or feeling used in Step One. If there is no earlier incident he asks if there is an earlier beginning. An auditor should never solidify a pays bank by putting him through an incident twice, when by observation of the TA it is clear that the incident has gone more solid by the end of the first run through. Checking for an earlier incident after the first run through (if the TA has risen) is the solution to this. If, after the second pass through, when you have asked the pc “Is the incident erasing or going more solid?” and the pc doesn’t know or isn’t sure, ask for an earlier incident. Never ask erasing/solid in the middle of an incident. BOUNCERS If the pc is out of the session, out of the incident, bounces from the incident, etc., you would have to have him or her return to the beginning of the incident and move through the incident, returning the pc to the incident as necessary. The pc who bounces out of an incident on a “bouncer” has to be put back into the in-cident and continue running it. The commands to do this are: As soon as you have seen that the pc has bounced give him command D (“Return to the beginning of that incident and tell me when you are there.”), followed with E, F. Fa. FLOWS 2, 3 AND 0 Step One and Step G (going earlier) commands for Flows 2, 3 and 0 are: FLOW 2: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of your causing another_____ (the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1).”"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 7 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    655    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of your causing another_____ (the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” FLOW 3: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of others causing others_____ (plural of the somatic or feeling used in Flow 1). “ STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of others causing others_____(plural of the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” FLOW 0: STEP ONE: “Locate an incident of you causing yourself_____(the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1).” STEP G: “Is there an earlier incident of you causing yourself_____(the exact somatic or feeling used in Flow 1)?” Each of these Step One and Step G commands are run on the full verbatim 1-9, A-EYE steps as given herein. NARRATIVE R3RA A narrative item is often run to run out the physical experiences the person has just undergone. This could be for example an accident, illness, an operation or emotional shock. However, a condition or circumstance without an incident is not narrative. It’s just an incorrect item. An example of this would be trying to run the item, “Obstruction of justice.” It would not run as there is no exact incident there. Narratives are too often just run through once or twice and abandoned. This, unfortu-nately, leaves the incident still charged and affecting the pc. A narrative needs to be run and run and run on that one incident. What you are doing is running the incident narrative to era-sure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly. Most narratives will run out by themselves without going earlier even though it takes a very long time but if you want to change somebody’s life, that’s how you can do it. When you are running a narrative you always add the known incident to the command. Using the earlier beginning command in running narratives is essential. For example: If the pc is running out a death of somebody closely related to him you will find that the inci-"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 8 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    656    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE dent actually started when he heard the phone ring, then, going back earlier to when some-body looked at him peculiarly, etc. So using the earlier beginning command in narrative running is vital. The commands for Narrative are: FLOW 1: STEP ONE: “Return to the time you______(specific incident) and tell me when you are there.” Steps 2-9 are followed (3 is omitted as you have already got the pc to the incident by giving him the first command, “Return to the time...”). Earlier beginning (Step H) is checked after each run through the incident. If there is one, send the pa to the new beginning of the incident (Step EYE) then follow with Steps B and C. If there is no earlier beginning, return the pa to the incident with Step A, followed by B and C, again checking earlier beginning (Step H) at the end of each run through the incident. On third and subsequent runs through the incident use steps D, E, F making certain to check for earlier beginning after each pass through, and only when the pa is obviously starting to grind and gets no place does one then use the command, “Is there an earlier similar incident?” FLOW 2: STEP ONE: “Return to the time you caused another to/a (specific incident) and tell me when you are there.” Steps 2-9 are followed (3 is omitted as you have already got the pc to the incident by giving him the first command, “Return to the time...”).

If they are narrative seconda-ries they are run with the same commands as Narrative R3RA engrams.

AUDITOR KNOWLEDGE OF COMMANDS These commands and procedures as given above must be thoroughly drilled with TR 101, 102, 103 and 104 before any Dianetic auditing may be done on a pc. Pcs can be messed up by incorrect and sloppy commands."},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS 10 HCOB 26.6.78RA HSDC    658    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE SPEED OF COMMANDS Some pcs run fast and some run slow. An auditor must never rush a pc or hold him up when he is ready to go on with the next command. The auditor must never keep a pc waiting for him while he handles his admin or comm lags before giving the next command. Timing and speed are especially crucial when the auditor gives the command to move through the incident after having told the pc to move to the beginning of the incident. With a slow command, the pc would wind up halfway through the incident before he receives the command to move through it. The better an auditor knows his TRs, his process commands, his meter and admin the faster and more accurately he can operate. Speed is very important, especially when auditing fast pcs. PC INTEREST In doing R3RA it is necessary that (a) one chooses things the pc is interested in and (b) one does not force a pc to run things he is protesting being run on. LAST INCIDENT FOUND If you ask if there is an earlier beginning and you have already checked for an earlier incident and the pc says there is no earlier beginning, you do not just walk off from the one he was just running. You send the pc through it again and it will erase with full end phenomena or the pc will then be able to see an earlier incident and continue with the chain. COMPLETING CHAINS If you do sloppy R3RA and do one thing after another without getting the full EP of: 1) the actual postulate which will be the erasure, 2) F/N, 3) VGIs, you will get the pc stuck up on the track. You complete each chain to full EP as above, remembering that when the postulate comes off, THAT is your EP. The chain will have blown.

THEN you call the F/N and that’s it for that chain. BLOWING BY INSPECTION An auditor may occasionally encounter a pc who erases chains before he can even tell about them. Along about Step 3 of R3RA, the TA blows down, the needle F/Ns, the pc says, “It’s gone,” and VGIs come in. This is called blowing by inspection and occurs once in a while with a fast running pc on a light chain. If it was basic for that chain and the auditor fails to recognize and handle it, the pc will go into another chain or a heavy protest. ENDING SESSION An R3RA session can be safely ended on a completed chain that ended with the full Dianetic EP as above stated... This doesn’t mean the end of all Dianetic auditing. In the next session another assess-ment will turn up more unwanted feelings, etc. ENDING DIANETICS Dianetics is ended off only when a pc has become well and happy and remains that way. And there you have it, engram running superior to any engram running ever done and giving superior and faster results.

Unread-ing flows are not run. One of the governing laws of auditing is that you don’t run unreading items. It doesn’t matter what you are auditing. You don’t run unreading items. And you don’t run unreading flows. You don’t run an unreading anything. Ever. For any reason. Auditing is aimed at reactivity. You run what reacts on the meter because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind. A read means there is charge present and available to run. Running reading items, flows and questions is the only way to make a pc better. This is our purpose in auditing. To run unreading flows, etc. requires the pc to run “analytical” an-swers or to “run” things that aren’t there or to put something there to “run.” The most trouble you can get a pc into is running him on uncharged items or flows. For an auditor to sit in session watching a meter that didn’t read, looking expectantly at the pc for an answer to an uncharged question, flow or item is a GAE and will wreck cases faster than anything you can do. So you must check questions, flows or items before running anything. If it doesn’t read you just say “Thank you” and go on to the next one. You would, of course, use the buttons to ensure nothing was suppressed! invalidated or misunderstood before leaving an unreading item, flow or question. This is probably one of the reasons that it has been observed that I can audit a pc for 2½ hours and get the same result that another auditor might get in 25 hours. There’s nothing mys-terious about it. I never run a pc on things that aren’t charged. And I don’t miss reads. I expect no less from you. L.

POSTULATE OFF EQUALS ERASURE The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in place. Release the postulate, the chain blows. That’s it. You must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/N and end off auditing on that chain. Even if you get an F/N as the incident is erasing, you don’t call it until you’ve gotten the postulate. 1. When it appears that you have reached the basic incident of the chain and that it is erasing, after each pass through the auditor asks, “Has the incident erased?” 2. When the pc has stated that it has erased the auditor should also expect a postulate to be volunteered by the pc. 3. If the pc says the incident has erased, but no postulate (made during the time of the in-cident) has come off and been volunteered by the pc the auditor should ask, “Did you make a postulate at the time of that incident?” (Note that the postulate will usually come off in the form of a cognition. However the pc may give a cognition which does not contain a postulate. If this is the case, simply ask, “Did you make a postulate at the time of that incident?”) 4. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate, the chain has blown. You will have an F/N and VGIs. This is a full Dianetic EP. Now you call the F/N. Do not call F/Ns until you have reached the EP. You must learn to recognize a postulate when you hear one. It is a vitally important skill as postulates can be confused with bouncers and denyers when they are in no respect similar and require totally different handlings. “Women are no good” is an obvious postulate. “That’s the way men are” is a postulate. “I can’t stay here” is a bouncer. “I can’t remember this” is a denyer. To push a pc earlier after he has given the postulate is a severe invalidation of the era-sure and you will soon have the pc believing that nothing erases, anyway."},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"POSTULATE OFF EQUALS ERASURE 2 HCOB 16.09.78 HSDC    664    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE To cause a pc to search for further, earlier incidents on a chain (which is no longer there) will get him into some very serious overrun.

Dianetic overruns are repaired by assessing and handling the L3RF. But the real cure is to flawlessly handle Dianetic EPs by getting the postulate, F/N and VGIs and then promptly ending off on that chain with a bright and happy pc.

What you’re erasing, actually, is the basic postulate that made the chain occur in the first place. OVERRUN OF NON-BASIC In engram running by chains, when you demand a pc go through the incident more than twice, and it is not basic that incident will grow more solid. A good Dianetic auditor watches his TA and the moment that TA starts to rise while running an incident on the chain he knows there is an earlier similar incident. It is told to him by the TA, which is saying this incident is getting more solid. When he sees this, he immediately asks for an earlier incident after either Step 9 or Step C of R3RA.

A Dianetic auditor works for the eradication of a chain. The Dianetic auditor could get lots of TA if he overran every non-basic engram, but it is this that he does not want. The Dianetic auditor is not concerned with the amount of TA that he gets. A TA has to go up before it goes down. In running an engram chain if you let a non-basic engram raise the TA more than a thousandth of an inch at Step 9 or Step C and do not immediately ask for an earlier incident, you goofed as you will make the pc’s bank more solid.

Pcs have been experiencing tremendous and quite amazing gains and resolving areas of their cases which have never before been handled so fully. This new and more precise Dianetics tech can and is changing the lives of many across the planet. When this tech was researched and developed I wanted to get it into your hands im-mediately. Now that it is in broad use, there is a wealth of data coming in on its application and the use of the new commands and handling of EPs. From this, I have located a point where NED, as originally issued, could go wrong on some pcs where earlier Dianetics did not. As it has always been my practice to provide you with the most accurate, proven and workable tech as it is developed, and as NED is a more powerful tech than any earlier Dianet-ics, it is important that you have this data. The point referred to above is on the auditor asking for earlier beginning or earlier in-cident. The basic stable datum is and always has been: TA up even slightly at the end of pc’s run through the incident = something earlier. The “something earlier” could be an earlier in-cident or an earlier beginning to the incident being run. There is a slight difference between the way these two are handled in R3RA Engram Running By Chains and R3RA Narrative running, because of what the auditor is trying to accomplish with each. The difference is in the order of importance of earlier beginning and earlier incident. R3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS In R3RA Engram Running By Chains you are following down and erasing a somatic chain. Here, in almost all cases, an earlier incident on the chain takes precedence over an ear-lier beginning to the incident being run."},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"R3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS AND 2 HCOB 13.09.78 NARRATIVE R3RA – AN ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCE HSDC    668    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Therefore, if the TA is even slightly up at the end of the pc’s run through an incident on the chain, the auditor asks first for an earlier incident and if there is none (or none the pc can yet see) he asks for an earlier beginning to the incident being run. Where you find an earlier beginning to an incident on the chain that is not the basic incident you rerun that incident only once more through from the earlier beginning to the end of the incident. If TA does not come down on that run through, there’s an earlier incident. The whole point being made here is that on engram running by chains you always want the earlier incident as soon as that is available. Thus, you ask for the earlier incident first, then, if necessary, for an earlier beginning. R3RA NARRATIVE RUNNING In R3RA Narrative running you are handling one single narrative incident, such as an accident, a physically or emotionally painful experience, an illness, loss, or period of great emotional stress, which is not, ordinarily, part of a chain. You are running that one incident many, many times through to erasure. The clue to erasure of a narrative incident lies in locating earlier beginnings to the incident. It will be found that the pc finds earlier and earlier moments when he was told or had an awareness that the incident was going to occur. Thus, in running R3RA Narrative, it is the earlier beginning that takes precedence, and that is what the auditor asks for after each run through a narrative incident. Only if the inci-dent starts to grind (no change of content, etc.), after having repeatedly searched for an earlier beginning, would you ask for an earlier similar narrative incident. This data on earlier beginning is a new breakthrough on narrative incident running and erasure, and the NED auditor should fully understand it and the tech on which this addi-tional difference between the two procedures is based. As pointed out in other issues, erasure of the somatic chain or the narrative incident occurs when the postulate is obtained, and it is vital that the auditor not go beyond that. New Era Dianetics Series 6 and 7 have been revised to incorporate this difference in earlier incident and earlier beginning handlings. I wanted you to have the full and exact data on why these commands are being slightly revised. This should make for even smoother running of New Era Dianetics all around. L.

A Cramming Officer or Supervisor can achieve a remarkable result by making an Auditor get the why of each R3R Dianetic command from the original materials. The following development and use of this Cramming technique by Mike Mauerer fol-lows: “CASE HISTORY” “George Baillie, a Flag Interne, working on his Dianetics OK to Audit, was ordered to study the 1963 Dn HCO Bs (“Time Track and Engram Running by Chains” Bulletins, Bulle-tins 1 and 2). He read the HCO Bs but had not studied them vigorously enough and for appli-cation. “As Interne Supervisor I worked with him covering these HCO Bs and Original The-sis. During the course of this action many confusions (primarily roteness) were handled. Among them were things like ‘What is the purpose of Step 6 of R3R, “What do you see?” ‘ He had previously thought it was to ‘orient’ the Pc to the incident or some such, but basically it came down to the fact he had never worked out the purpose of the command as related to the mechanics of the bank and time track. After some working he finally got the fact that Command 4 (duration) is to turn on the visio and that before moving the Pc through the inci-dent one would have to know the Pc had visio so he could move through. Conversely, if the picture was not ‘turned on’ then the duration would have to be corrected. Another was the Step 3 Command (Move to that incident) on which the Interne thought that by repeating the auditing command when the Pc ‘couldn’t get there’ you would handle the time track. This of course is failure to handle an origination and failure to handle time for the Pc. He finally real-ized that obviously the Pc didn’t have the correct date in the first place and it is the Auditor’s action to find and get the correct date and thus move the somatic strip to that incident."},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"R3R COMMANDS HAVE BACKGROUND DATA 2 HCOB 27.1.74 HSDC    670    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE “Each command of R3R was taken up and its purpose demo’d out against the basic definitions and mechanics of the time track. One other of the things discovered by this Interne was that Command Nine (What happened?) has a purpose of running out the Locks created in PT, in session, by virtue of the fact that you’re reminding the Pc of Secondaries and Engrams right there! (This is of course covered in Original Thesis.) “Probably the most stunning and revealing thing covered was the fact that in Original Thesis Chapter ‘Exhaustion of Engrams’, para 3, it says, ‘The principle of recounting is very simple. The preclear is merely told to go back to the beginning and to tell it all over again. He does this many times. As he does it the engram should lift in tone on each recounting. It may lose some of its data and gain other. If the Preclear is recounting in the same words time after time, it is certain that he is playing a memory record of what he has told you before. He must then be sent immediately back to the actual engram and the somatics of it restimulated. He will then be found to somewhat vary his story. He must be returned to the consciousness of somatics continually until these are fully developed, begin to lighten and are then gone.’ This of course totally invalidates the use of a completely rote system and requires an understanding of what is happening to the Pc, bank, etc. “Needless to say, this Interne went through many changes, now feels in comm with his Pcs and not ‘stuck’ to some rote procedure which truly inhibits the real gains to be gotten from Dianetics Engram Running. As evidence to this action and its resultant gains in the In-terne’s ability to audit, the following is a brief description of a case he audited today applying 1963 engram running and Original Thesis to these cases. “Case has run many hours of Dianetics with a hidden standard to do with his hand. Has been trying since earliest Dianetic sessions to get this handled. The somatic had been addressed by many different wordings and many chains but had never blown, yet chains had apparently gone to EP. The Auditor was C/Sed to find the actual somatic and run it out. It was found in session that the somatic had been run out to ‘EP’ so an L3B was done. From the L3B the Auditor found it was one incident in restim and proceeded to flatten the somatic chain connected with it. During this the Auditor on occasion had to correct three dates and two du-rations, but the spectacular part was Pc began on Steps 9 and D to say the same thing regard-ing incident each time. This being indicative of Pc running a memory record, Auditor moves Pc to the actual Engram, somatics intensify and then blow (for the first time), Pc exterior with VVGIs. Exam result is quite spectacular. “All the above serves to once again validate the results of the Dianetics materials when they are applied in full.” L.

A Dianetic session given in the absence of an understanding of the basic laws of the time track and how the R3RA commands handle and control the time track is a chancy propo-sition. You will not have confidence in yourself as an auditor of New Era Dianetics nor get uniformly good results with R3RA until you know this. No rote procedure, L3RF, TR4, or any remedy or solution can take the place of such an understanding. Every New Era Dianetics auditor is to study the references and demo out what each R3RA command does (showing how it affects the pc and the bank) to a full understanding.

Cease to audit suddenly with the pc down the track somewhere. 2. Make a sudden evaluative remark in the middle of the session. 3. React or comment adversely on what the pc is running such as being critical of the pc for having such an incident. 4. Force a pc to go on when he doesn’t want to. These mess up pcs quite badly and give them a great deal of trouble afterwards. Over the years these four actions have been observed being done from time to time by persons trying to audit in Dianetics. They are just as bad in Scientology but oddly, I don’t recall them being done in Scientology, only Dianetics. Example of 1: Auditor fails to give next command or any further commands and leaves pc hanging. Example of 2: “Are you really interested in this session or not?” Example of 3: “That was a horrible thing to do.” Example of 4: “Go ahead. Get into it,” after pc has asked to stop. There are countless variations of these. In 1 the pc volunteers it’s all sort of unreal in the incident so the auditor, instead of TR 4, just ends session. These are very bad things to do. They don’t kill anybody. But they surely make pcs less auditable. L.

New Era Dianetics Series 2R NEW ERA DIANETICS FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE As a person goes through life and lifetimes he collides with secondaries, losses, deaths of those he is closely connected with, injuries, accidents, illnesses, operations and emotional stresses. These of course are not all, but cover the main complaints and symptoms of pcs. Dianetics lends itself to handle the current, past and occasional complaints and symp-toms as above. It achieves its results by addressing and handling the spirit and is in no way to be con-fused with medical or other practices. The end phenomena of Dianetic auditing is a well and happy pc. These steps as laid out below if all done and with precision will give just that. NEW ERA DIANETICS FULL PROGRAM OUTLINE: The actions of the New Era Dianetics full program are to be run in the order they are given. The product is a well and happy pc and this is the direction you go, step by step to achieve that product. ACTION ONE: ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET This sheet is thoroughly filled out with the pc on the meter. It gives you the pc’s his-tory, what drugs and alcohol he has taken in this lifetime, illnesses, operations, present physical conditions, mental treatment, medicines and perception difficulties. (Ref: HCOB 24 June 1978R New Era Dianetics Series 5R, ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET). At this point the data is taken only. Do not attempt to handle any of the items on this step. (Ref: HCOB 24 June 1978R NED Series 5R). ACTION TWO: HANDLE ANY PTSNESS"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 2 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE HSDC    678    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE It must be noted that you have to handle any PTSness before you can begin any audit-ing. Pcs who are PTS will not hold their gain. Therefore any PTSness must be handled before auditing is begun. (Ref: HCOB 10 Aug 73 PTS HANDLING, HCOB 20 Apr 72 SUP-PRESSED PCs AND PTS TECH, HCOB 9 Dec 71RC PTS RD). ACTION THREE: OBJECTIVE ARC I have added a new process to be done before the full battery of Objective Processes. It is called Objective ARC. This is the first process to be done on a pc and will bring a person up to present time. (Ref: Objective ARC is covered in HCOB 19 Jun 1978, New Era Dianetics Series 3, OBJECTIVE ARC). ACTION FOUR: SWEAT PROGRAM A Sweat Program will be necessary if the person has taken LSD or Angel Dust. It may also be indicated when a person has been subjected to exposure to toxic substances which have lodged in the tissue and fat of the body. In future times psychiatrists or others of ill repute may develop other compounds such as LSD which lodge in the sys-tems; a Sweat Program may be indicated in these. (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION FIVE: OBJECTIVES A battery of Objectives is done on this step. This consists of the following Objective Processes properly and fully done to their complete EP for each process: CCH 1-10, SCS on an Object and SCS (Note: SOP 8C and Op Pro By Dup are run on a later step.) (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION SIX: HARD TR COURSE On this course, the preclear will thoroughly do TRs 0-9. (Ref: HCOB 15 July 71RA III Rev 27 Jun 78, Re-Rev 19 Sep 78, New Era Dianetics Series 9R, DRUG HANDLING, HCOB 16 Aug 71R, TRAINING DRILLS REMODERNIZED, HCOB 7 May 68, UPPER INDOC TRs, BPL 18 Sep 78 New Era Dianetics Hard TRs Course). ACTION SEVEN: CS-1 Before we can even begin a pc on Dianetics we have to indoctrinate him into what Dianetics is and what is expected of him as a pc. This is standardly and effectively accomplished by using the Standard Dianetics CS-1, HCOB 9 Jul 78R, DIANETIC CS-1. ACTION EIGHT: DRUG RUNDOWN QUAD It has been proven time and time again that until you audit out, each by name, the drugs, alcohol and medicine a person has taken, he does not make good case gain."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 3 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE HSDC    679    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A person who has been on drugs, alcohol or medicine seldom runs any other type of engram, seldom goes backtrack well, and is subject to somatic, emotional and percep-tic shut-offs, making any other type of Dianetic or Scientology auditing a difficult ac-tivity. Therefore if drugs, medicine or alcohol, or individual names of them read on the meter on the Original Assessment Sheet, they are handled first and foremost . (Note: You do not ask the pc for whole track drugs. You want only drugs, medicine or alcohol he has taken in this lifetime.) In New Era Dianetics the Drug Rundown has five parts: 1) The Original Assessment in which the names of drugs, medicines or alcohol the pc has taken in this lifetime are obtained, 2) The running of each reading drug, medicine or alcohol Narrative R3RA Quad, 3) The preassessment of each of these and the running by R3RA Quad of the items, 4) The prior assessment to drugs or alcohol for each, 5) The final step of bring-ing the pc fully into PT and stabilizing him by the running of further Objectives, SOP 8C and Op Pro By Dup. 1. The Original Assessment This has already been done as Action One. It may be necessary to get the preclear to add to the list and it is highly possible that he has taken more types of drugs in this lifetime than he remembered at the time the Original Assessment was done. You have to have all drugs, medicines and alcohol by their actual names as known to the pc. It is not enough to use an item like “drugs,” “alcohol” or “medicine” as you will get no-where. They have to be “heroin,” or “penicillin” or “bourbon.” 2. Narrative Handling of Drugs Before any other handling, the pc runs out each of the reading drugs, medicines or al-cohol’s Narrative R3RA Quad. This is done first. 3. The Preassessment New Era Dianetics handling for drugs includes the use of the Preassessment List. This is a new procedure on the handling and running of Dianetics. Previous to this you would ask the pc for attitudes, emotions, sensations and pains connected with an item. Instead the preassessment is done. It ensures that every somatic is gotten off in con-nection with whatever you are handling. (Ref: HCOB 18 Jun 78R New Era Dianetics Series 4R, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM). Each item found by preassessment is run by R3RA Quad as soon as the running item is found in every case. Then one continues with further preassessment until all possible drugs, medicines and alcohols are fully handled R3RA Quad."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 4 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE HSDC    680    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 4. The Prior Assessment After all reading drugs, medicines and alcohols have been preassessed and run out R3RA Quad, the prior assessment to drugs or alcohol is done. This step locates and runs out all the feelings, attitudes, misemotions, pains, etc. the pc had prior to first tak-ing each drug, medicine or alcohol. (Ref: HCOB 15 Jul 71RA III, Rev 27 Jun 78 New Era Dianetics Series 9R, C/S Series 48RB, DRUG HANDLING). ACTION EIGHT-A: 5. The Final Step – More Objectives As a final step, the pc is brought fully into present time with further Objectives: SOP 8C and then Op Pro By Dup, each run to its complete EP. This completes the Dianetic Drug Rundown. ACTION NINE: RELIEF RUNDOWN Where the Original Assessment Sheet has shown losses by death or other severe changes in a person’s life such as losses of position or pets or objects it will be found that the person’s life changed for the worse at that point. The auditor spots these points of change either on the Original Assessment Sheet or by asking the preclear. These points are then handled with New Era Dianetics procedure. It will be found that when all such great changes in a person’s life have been handled the person will experience a considerable relief about life. (Ref: HCOB 3 July 1978R, NED Series 10R). ACTION TEN: DIANETIC REMEDIES – OPTIONAL The Picture and Masses Remedy and the Past Life Remedy are optional and are only done when you run into trouble. They are run after the Drug Rundown because unhan-dled drugs are the cause of most of that trouble. The Picture and Masses Remedy (Ref: HCOB 22 Jul 69 HIGH TA ASSESSMENT HCOB 24 Jul 78 DIANETIC REMEDIES) Past Life Remedy (Ref: HCOB 16 Jan 75 PAST LIFE REMEDY HCOB 24 Jul 78 DIANETIC REMEDIES) ACTION ELEVEN: COMPLETE HANDLING ON THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET You have handled all drugs, alcohol and medicine and all losses the pc has had fully and completely. The pc is now set up to go ahead with handling the rest of his com-plaints and symptoms."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 5 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE HSDC    681    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The full procedure of handling the remainder of this Original Assessment Sheet is laid out in full in HCOB 28 July 71RA Rev 25 June 78 New Era Dianetics Series 8R DIANETICS, BE-GINNING A PC ON and HCOB 18 June 78R New Era Dianetics Series 4R ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM. Follow these issues exactly. ACTION TWELVE: REASSESSMENT OF THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET When all Original Assessment Sheet items are handled as above, the Original Assess-ment Sheet is reassessed. The pc’s memory will have improved if you’ve done a good job of auditing so far and his targets in processing will have changed. So we reassess the Original Assessment Sheet and handle any now reading area. (Ref: HCOB 4 Jul 78R New Era Dianetics Series 12R, SECOND ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT) . ACTION THIRTEEN: DIANETIC STUDENT RESCUE INTENSIVE This is an optional step to be taken if your pc is having any trouble with study. It takes up and handles any and all somatics connected with the subject of study. A Student Rescue Intensive is not run until the pc has been completed up to ACTION ELEVEN as it would interrupt his program because drugs, if he has taken any, are a probable contributory cause to being unable to study. Also the Dianetic Student Res-cue Intensive is not a substitute for proper Word Clearing of Dianetic, Scientology and earlier courses and training. It does however make the latter much more effective. (Ref: HCOB 2 Jul 78 New Era Dianetics Series 11, DIANETIC STUDENT RESCUE INTENSIVE). ACTION FOURTEEN: PREPARED ASSESSMENT FORM This is an early step I developed in Dianetics which fell into disuse and abandonment. However it can produce some amazing results and so is being put back as a standard step in the running of Dianetics. It is done by assessing a prepared list of types of somatics and fully handling each one using New Era Dianetics. When you have an F/Ning list and the pc is VGIs it is the end of this step. The procedure and list is covered on HCOB 1 Jul 78 New Era Dianetics Series 13, DIANETICS PREPARED ASSESSMENT RUNDOWN. ACTION FIFTEEN: DISABILITY RUNDOWN This rundown handles anything the pc considers a disability; mental, physical or oth-erwise. It handles everything from being too short to not being able to speak Arabic or not wanting to go to parties. It takes each disability and handles it with R3RA. (Ref: HCOB 29 June 78 New Era Dianetics Series 14, DISABILITY RUNDOWN). ACTION SIXTEEN: IDENTITY RUNDOWN"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"NEW ERA DIANETICS 6 HCOB 22.6.78R FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE HSDC    682    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE We have never before had a Dianetic process specifically directed to getting a pc into valence. The Identity Rundown now handles that. It specifically takes up and handles valences the pc may be in by using the New Era Dianetics tech. (Ref: HCOB 20 Jun 78 New Era Dianetics Series 15, IDENTITY RUNDOWN). ACTION SEVENTEEN: AUDITING OUT SESSIONS – OPTIONAL Now and then it is necessary to audit out an auditing session or all auditing. One does this by R3RA, running the incident narrative to erasure and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind very badly or, if all auditing, handling it session by session as a chain. (Ref: HCOB 23 May 69 AUDITING OUT SESSIONS HCOB 26 Jun 78RA II NED Series 6RA; ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS HCOB 18 Jun 78R NED Series 4R; ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM). IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE If you run into any trouble on these Dianetic steps, use the L3RF and handle all read-ing items to EP. Or go to Cramming on Dianetics. (Ref: HCOB 11 April 71RC L3RF). SUMMARY Completing all the above steps thoroughly and completely ensuring that all chains are run to full end phenomena is the only way you will have a well and happy pc. L.

A person who has been on drugs, alcohol or medicines seldom runs on any other type of engram, seldom goes backtrack well, and is subject to somatic, emotional and perceptic shut-offs making any other type of Dianetic running a vain activity. Drugs since 1962 have been in very widespread use. Before then they were rare. A worldwide spread of drugs occurred. A large percentage of people became and are drug tak-ers. By drugs (to mention a few) are meant – tranquilizers, opium, cocaine, marijuana, pe-yote, amphetamine and the psychiatrist’s gifts to Man, LSD and Angel Dust, which are the worst. Any medical drugs are included. Drugs are drugs. There are thousands of trade names and slang terms for these drugs. Alcohol is included as a drug and receives the same treatment in auditing. By alcohol (to mention a few) is meant whiskey beer, wine, vodka, rum, gin, etc. – in other words any fermented or distilled liquor or drink of any kind or fumes of such with some percentage of alcohol content. Drugs are supposed to do wonderful things but all they really do is ruin the person. Even someone off drugs for years still has “blank periods.” The abilities to concentrate or to balance are injured. The moral part of it has nothing to do with auditing. The facts are that: (a) People who have been on drugs can be a liability until the condition is handled in au-diting. (b) A former drug user is a resistive case that does not make stable gains until the condi-tion is handled. (c) Auditing is the only successful means ever developed for handling drug damage. DRUG ENGRAMS People who have been on drugs are sometimes afraid of running engrams. In fact, it is almost a way to detect a “druggie.” The drugs, particularly LSD and even sometimes antibiotics or other medicines to which the person has an allergy, can turn on whole track pictures violently. These tend to overwhelm the person and make him feel crazy. Some of these people are afraid to confront the bank again. If a person “doesn’t like Dianetics” and doesn’t want to be run on engrams, it is neces-sary to put him through the Hard TRs Course and Objectives. If Dianetics has been run but poorly, it should of course be repaired fully with an L3RF (list used to correct Dianetic er-"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"DRUG HANDLING 3 HCOB 15.07.71RC HSDC    691    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE rors). But if the person still flinches. the Hard TRs Course and Objectives successfully com-pleted will handle. THOSE ON DRUGS Objective Processes are numerous. It may be necessary to run these on a person still on drugs and even put the person through a Hard TRs Course to get the person off drugs. Do-ing this usually avoids the painful “withdrawal symptoms,” particularly present in coming off heroin or psychiatric “treatment” drugs. (Note, some persons have been put on some thera-peutic drug by an M.D. – such as insulin and possibly should remain on it until well advanced into auditing. But these are not the usual drug. It is up to the pc, the auditor and the doctor what should be done in such cases. Tranquilizers are not acceptable, however.) DONE FIRST Drugs are done first. Why? Because drugs make a resistive case! Other Dianetic actions and Scientology as well will get loses if drugs are not handled first. Any current Dianetic case failures are from flubby Dianetic auditing or the person has been on drugs or alcohol which were not handled by Dianetics. It hasn’t harmed anyone to omit drug handling. But it made it hard or impossible to get stable case gain. Thus any Dianetic pc who has had drug handling omitted must be run on drugs as soon as possible before more auditing is given. I repeat, drugs or alcohol in most instances make a resistive case so the point must be handled before the case will attain and hold case gain. Any pc who is not making it in auditing should be checked for a drug or alcohol history. DISCOVERY In investigating a series of cases who were not making it. I found in each one that the person had been on drugs or alcohol and that drugs or the alcohol had not been run out. Drug data was not covered fully enough in the Dianetics pack. Only Prior Assessment to Drugs was given. Thus I have found several Dianetic pcs were only run on the Prior Assessment to Drugs. This is not good enough as it is only a partial handling."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"DRUG HANDLING 4 HCOB 15.07.71RC HSDC    692    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE FULL DRUG RUNDOWN Here is the full New Era Dianetics Drug Rundown. 0.

So you always ask earlier beginning but if it is necessary you ask earlier incident with the question, “Is there an earlier incident when you took whiskey?” Pcs commonly tend to wind up way back down the whole track at this stage of their auditing and that is not what you’re aiming for here either. What you’re interested in is this lifetime, this body. But this doesn’t mean you don’t run track on the Drug Run-down; just don’t push it. And never insist the pc run any type of chain when he says there’s nothing there. When all reading drugs, medicines, alcohols on the list have been run to EP by R3RA Narrative Quad, go on to the next step. 7. Preassessment6 on each reading drug, medicine or alcohol taken in this lifetime. A) Choose the best reading drug, alcohol or medicine from the Original Assessment Sheet and do a preassessment on it. “Are (preassessment item) connected with taking (the drug, medicine or alco-hol)?“ is the preassessment question. B) Take the best reading preassessment item off the preassessment and ask the pc: “What (best reading preassessment item) are connected with taking (the drug, medicine, or alcohol)?” This is the running item list question for that particular drug. You write this ques-tion at the top of the page and write down exactly what the pc said, noting any read that occurred when he said it. C) Take up the best reading running item (make sure you noted reads as the pc gave you the items) and run it R3RA Quad. Do not check interest on drug items. D) Handle all reading running items found in Step B in order of read with R3RA Quad. E) Using that same original drug item repeat Step A. F) Repeat Steps B to E.

Fb) Take the next individual drug, medicine, or alcohol item that read on the original list and repeat Steps A to Fa on it until you have handled every item that read on the Original Assessment Sheet.   6 Editor’s Note: AESP can be done instead of Preassessment.

(Note: If during the rundown the pc thinks of other drugs he has taken in this life-time, add them to the original list with their reads noted, and handle them in turn according to size of read, ensuring you run them R3RA Quad Narrative first.) 8. The Prior Assessment. A) Using the drug list obtained on the Original Assessment, take up the largest read-ing drug, medicine or alcohol, ask the pc the following preassessment question: “Prior to taking (the best reading drug, medicine or alcohol), were there (preas-sessment item)?” B) Take the best reading preassessment item and ask: “What (preassessment item) did you have prior to taking (the drug, medicine or alcohol)?” C) Use full preassessment steps and run out all reading running items R3RA Quad. D) Reassess any remaining unrun items found in Step B to see if they now read. If they do, run them. Also check for any more items the pc has to add to the list, and mark down their reads as the pc gives them. E) Repeat above steps on any items that now read. F) When there are no more items to add and no more items reading, but there are some unrun items on the list, null with Suppress and Invalidate buttons. G) Run any now reading items R3RA Quad.

Follow remaining steps until all reading items are taken to EP and there are no further reads on reassessment of the Preassessment List.

And even on a person that’s not manifesting drugs and hasn’t taken any this lifetime, you can collide with these cultures and universes if you keep pushing it. You can always find more drugs on the track. What you’re interested in is this lifetime and this body. This doesn’t mean you don’t run track on the Drug RD, just don’t push it. Don’t ask for whole track drugs. When you list out the drugs a pc has taken, you only want the ones he has taken this lifetime. The steps of the Drug RD have been rearranged to prevent this endless running and al-low the rundown to be taken to a flat point of freedom from the harmful effects of this life-time drugs and an F/Ning drug list. Objectives are run on the pc. Each drug is run narrative followed by preassessment then prior assessment and then some more Objectives to put the pc back to PT after the en-gram running. The full and complete steps are listed in C/S Series 48RB, NED Series 9R and NED Series 2R. Also, there is now a Drug RD Repair List which will handle bypassed charge caused by endless Drug RDs.

This sets up a very rough problem. Drugs prevent any case gain. If the person is still on drugs, processing will have little effect. He will not cease to be a drug addict. The drugs trap him. When the world went druggie (about 1960), this problem of drying out became one of the first order. It was not just a problem to us. All pre-Scientology efforts failed – and had been failing for all Man’s history. But relatively small numbers had been involved. After 1960 the problem became planet-wide. Our first organization to handle this was Los Angeles. They made the person cease to take drugs for 6 weeks, then audited the drugs out. Most of these cases stayed stable and thereafter had case gain and were no longer condemned to an eternity of disability. However, some were unable to stop taking drugs. What is called Withdrawal Symptoms set in. These are the body and mental reac-tions to no longer taking drugs. They are ghastly. No torturer ever set up anything worse. The patient had this problem then: A. Stay on drugs and be trapped and suffering from here on out. B. Try to come off the drugs and be so agonizingly ill meanwhile that he couldn’t stand it. This was a dead if you do, dead if you don’t sort of problem. Medicine did not solve it adequately. Psychotherapy was impossible. Two approaches now exist to this withdrawal problem. 1. Light objective (look outward, take attention off body) processes ease the gradual withdrawal and make it possible. 2. Nutritionist experiments indicate that vitamins assist the withdrawal. Objective processes are covered elsewhere in this material."},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"DRUGS DRYING OUT 2 HCOB 25.1.71 HSDC    700    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE VITAMIN THERAPY According to world-renowned nutritionist Adelle Davis, vitamin therapy has had suc-cess in handling Withdrawal Symptoms. Instead of just telling the person to break off drugs with all that suffering and danger of failure, the patient is given heavy doses of vitamins. The data is repeated here for informa-tion. DRUG BOMB ONE DOSE • 1,000 mg of niacin amide (not nicotinic acid as it is severely toxic in such amounts). This for any mental disturbance. • 500 milligrams of magnesium carbonate (to make the Vitamin C effective). • 2,000 milligrams of Vitamin C. • 25 milligrams of B6. • 200 milligrams of B Complex. • 100 milligrams of pantothenic acid. ADMINISTRATION The bomb is given four times a day, roughly every six hours. It is given in a mild preparation that furnishes intestinal flora such as yoghurt. Great caution must be used to give the dose in such a way that the vitamins will not corrode the stomach. If this is neglected the patient can be given a false duodenal (upper in-testine) ulcer and will be unable to continue the treatment. Druggies are usually in terrible physical condition anyway. Thus all the above would have to be in ”enteric coated” capsules, meaning an intestinal shielding must be on the pills so they gradually dissolve and don’t hit the sensitive upper stomach hard enough to corrode it. Thus milk with powdered amino acids in it would have to be given to wash the pills down. In testing these recommendations stomach corrosion from the bomb was the main bar-rier noted."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"DRUGS DRYING OUT 3 HCOB 25.1.71 HSDC    701    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE If the bomb is given without any cushion the patient can (a) feel too full after eating (b) have a stomach ache (c) have a burning sensation (d) the exterior of the stomach can get sore. These are all stomach ulcer symptoms. If such symptoms turn on, end off the vitamins. Aluminum hydroxide tablets chewed up and swallowed in milk each time the symptoms start will ease the stomach. Amino acids, intestinal flora and milk must then be given until the stomach gets better. Shots, with a needle, especially of Vitamin C can be too painful. Not the needle, that’s nothing; but the vitamin itself. Such medication is in a crude state of research, mainly because of the violent hostility earlier exerted against vitamin people by the American Medical Association and other reac-tionaries to anything beneficial or new. It is hoped that the stomach corrosion factor can be lessened by new preparations which do the same thing but less violently. I am not particularly advocating the use of the Drug Bomb but as a pioneer in this area of research I feel that any data of value on the subject of drug withdrawal should be widely published. The difficulties and agonies of withdrawal are the primary failure point in trying to salvage a being from the insanity of drugs. SUMMARY People who have been on drugs do not make case gain until the drugs are handled in processing. Processing such as Dianetics is not effective when done on a person who is taking drugs. Withdrawal from drugs sometimes sets up a violent physical reaction too painful or depressing to be continued and the person goes back on drugs. Anyone on drugs or who has taken drugs is doomed as a being just like that. He or she will cave right on in and finish up in the ash can from here on out. Only processing by Dianetics and Scientology can handle the effects of drugs fully. No other technology, medical or biochemical, has ever helped – we have thousands of cases to prove this completely. The primary barrier to processing is getting the person off drugs and keeping him off until he can be fully audited. Then he will be very okay. Two means to do this are known – A. Light objective processes while ”drying out” and B. Nutritional therapy. A and B can be combined."},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"DRUGS DRYING OUT 4 HCOB 25.1.71 HSDC    702    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Neither A nor B will fully handle drugs. The person on vitamins if not processed will relapse. Vitamins are not drugs. They are nutrition. A person can be processed while on them. By close application of these principles the person can be salvaged. And having been salvaged can go on up to greater freedom and ability. He won’t make it otherwise by any other known technology. L.

It is possible to come off drugs without convulsions. Drugs essentially are poisons. The degree they are taken determines the effect. A small amount gives a stimulant. A greater amount acts as a sedative. A larger amount acts as a poi-son and can kill one dead. This is true of any drug. Each has a different amount. Caffeine is a drug. So Coffee is an example. 100 cups of coffee would probably kill a person. 10 cups would probably put him to sleep. 2 or 3 cups stimulates. This is a very common drug. It is not very harmful as it takes so much of it to have an effect so it is known as a stimulant. Arsenic is known as a poison. Yet a tiny amount of arsenic is a stimulant, a good sized dose puts one to sleep and a few grains kills one dead. But there are some drugs which have another factor. They directly affect the reactive bank. Marijuana (pot), peyote, morphine, heroin, etc. turn on the pictures one is stuck in. And they turn them on too hard to audit out. LSD-25 is a psychiatric drug designed to make schizophrenics out of normal people. It is evidently widely distributed by psychiatrists. It looks like cube sugar and is easily made. Drugs are considered valuable by addicts to the degree that they produce some “desir-able effect”. But they are dangerous to those around because a person on drugs (a) has blank periods (b) has unrealities and delusions that remove him from PT (c) is very hard to audit. Thus a drug taker can be holding a boat alongside, go into one of his blanks, think he is on Venus and let go. A drug taker left on watch may go blank and miss a menacing situation and not handle it because he is “somewhere else”."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":" HSDC    704    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Giving an order to a drug taker can be grim as he may simply stand and stare at one. He ARC breaks anyone with it. It takes about six weeks apparently for LSD to wear off. After that a person can be au-dited. But it ruins his case to a marked degree as it builds up ridges which don’t as-is well. A drug or alcohol burns up the Vitamin B1 in the system rapidly. This increased speed of burning up B1 adds to his “happy state”. But now his system is out of B1 so he goes de-pressed. To avoid convulsions take lots of B1 daily when coming off drugs. And wait for six weeks before one is audited. And then lay off. It’s a pretty poor trick on those who are dependent on one and get let down. L.

The use of sugar cubes as a medium was discontinued several years ago. Dosage is fantastically small, 50 to 1000 micrograms per dose, so capsules and tablets are used to reduce evaporation. Price varies from 3 to 7 dollars and it is only sold on the black market. Prior to 1964 the drug was administered by psychologists and psychiatrists. However, it is now illegal for them to do so. Despite its illegal status, LSD is very popular among teen-agers and college students. An entire sub-culture of psychedelic (mind-manifesting) posters, light shows, and electronic music has emerged on the West Coast. Most of the Pop music has hidden drug references. A recent survey indicated that over 50% of the students graduating from the Los Angeles City School System had tried either LSD or marijuana. Marijuana is the most popular of the psychedelic drugs. One ounce may be readily purchased for $10 and will furnish 30-50 cigarettes or “joints”. A smoker quickly progresses from the one ounce “lids” to purchasing a “brick” or “kilo”. This is a kilogram (2.2 lbs) and sells for $75 to $150. Marijuana may be easily identified. It has a strong characteristic odour which is similar to fresh hay or wet, freshly cut grass. Smoking some tea leaves, rolled up into a cigarette will give you a good stable datum for identifying marijuana odour. Marijuana may be physically identified as a green or greenish brown tobacco with varying amounts of brown stems and small round seeds. Hashish, like marijuana, comes from the female hemp plant, Cannabis sativa. When matured, the plant is hung upside down and resins collect which are dried into hashish. One gram of hashish sells for $10 and will supply 10 to 30 “hits” or periods of being “high”. Hash-ish is brown, tan, or black and is usually kept in tin foil. Users of both hashish and marijuana will have bloodshot eyes while under the influence. Someone under LSD may be identified by very dilated pupils. Peyote “buttons” are several inches in diameter and come from the peyote cactus of S.W. America. The pure form of the drug is a synthetic (white) or natural (brown) powder called mescaline. A beefed-up version of this drug was recently made available but was, as of June 1968, unnamed. Another new drug is STP. This drug is much more powerful than even LSD. As of June 1968, STP was waning in use as people found its results too unpredictable."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"DRUG DATA 2 HCOB 29.08.68 HSDC    706    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE One other drug worth mentioning is DMT. This drug is smoked or injected and has immediate effects which end in about an hour. It may be identified by an odour similar to moth balls and is either a white powder or soaked into a medium such as pot or tobacco. Marijuana is basically a very mild drug which creates euphoria. Also it has the un-pleasant consequence of distorting the senses of the user to the point that people on “trips” have been known to open the door of a car going 80 mph and step out “since they could walk faster”. The remaining psychedelic drugs are much more powerful and will strongly influence a pc. It was found in L.A. that over a period of several months (4-6) every single income slump was traced to the accidental acceptance of one or more drug (LSD, etc) users into the Academy and/or HGC and traced as well to the spreading waves of chaos in attempts to han-dle their “disagreements” with the tech, demands for special handling and no case gain. The “trips” that a drug user goes on tend to produce stuck points on the track with much fixation of attention on that area. Bad “trips” tend to act like Super Engrams collapsing the track at that point. Users of drugs cannot as-is, do not get TA, nor do they have cognitions. L.

WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS The most wretched part of coming off hard drugs is the reaction called „withdrawal symptoms“. People go into convulsions. These are so severe that the addict becomes very afraid of them and so remains on drugs. The reaction can also produce death. In the reference HCO Bulletin above, B1 is mentioned as a means of easing convul-sions. Actually, practice since 1968 has shown that „Objective TRs“, a Scientology process described in detail in HCOBs 11 June 1957, „Training and CCH Processes“, 15 July 1971, C/S Series 48R, „Drug Handling“ and BTB 25 Oct 1971R, Issue II, „The Special Drug Run-down“, handle withdrawal symptoms when properly used. Great success has been achieved with them. There is another supplementary way of handling withdrawal symptoms. This does not replace „Objective TRs“ and at this writing is theoretical, being in a research phase. But so terrible can be withdrawal symptoms and so lacking in success has the medical and psychiat-ric field been, that the data should be released. Muscular spasms are caused by lack of Calcium. Nervous reactions are diminished by Magnesium. Calcium does not go into solution in the body and is not utilized unless it is in an acid. Magnesium is alkaline. Working on this in 1973, for other uses than drug reactions, I found the means of get-ting Calcium into solution in the body, along with Magnesium so that the results of both could be achieved. This was the „Cal-Mag Formula“."},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"DRUGS, MORE ABOUT 2 HCOB 5.11.74 HSDC    708    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE CAL-MAG FORMULA 1. Put one level tablespoon of Calcium Gluconate in a normal sized glass. 2. Add ½ level teaspoon of Magnesium Carbonate. 3. Add 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar (at least 5% acidity). 4. Stir it well. 5. Add ½ glass of boiling water and stir until all the powder is dissolved and the liquid is clear. (If this doesn’t occur it could be from poor grade or old Mag-nesium Carbonate.) 6. Fill the remainder of glass with lukewarm or cold water and cover. They will stay good for 2 days. It can be made wrongly so that it does not dissolve. Variations from the above produce an unsuccessful mix that can taste pretty horrible. Anything from 1 to 3 glasses of this a day, with or after meals, replaces any tranquil-izer. It does not produce the drugged effects of tranquilizers (which are quite deadly). The application to handle muscular spasms and tics is now quite well established. Using this to combat withdrawal symptoms is experimental. The theory is that withdrawal symptoms are muscular spasms. The matter should be given tests where persons suffering from withdrawal symptoms are available. This does not supplant „Objective TRs“. These work. But it may be that „Cal-Mag“ would assist those suffering where no competent audit-ing is available. As Calcium and Magnesium are minerals, not drugs, they form no barrier to auditing. L.

It explains for instance why a pc, challenged by an “auditor” who is breaking the Auditor’s Code, gets such a solid reaction in the reactive bank. Threatened by an apparent effort to destroy him instead of letting him find the truth, the pc reacts by mocking up hard below his awareness level. This does not, of course, make him insane. It just sticks him a bit in the session. Drugs (LSD, marijuana, alcohol, whatever) produce a threat to the body like any other poison. The threat is to the body. The thetan reacts by mocking up. Of course what he mocks up is some engram, secondary or combination of fancy and fact. He can do this in some cases, so hard that it becomes more real (and safer) than present time. Thus, under threat, he goes out of present time. Now comes the next bit which is important as a new discovery: His time track is not then being made up wholly of present time events. It is a composite of past track, imagination and present events. Thus, right there before your eyes he, apparently in the same room as you are, doing the same things, is really only partially there and partially in some past events. He seems to be there. Really he isn’t “tracking” fully with present time. What is going on to a rational observation is not what is going on to him. Thus he does not duplicate statements made by another but tries to fit them into his composite reality. In order to fit them in, he has to alter them."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"DRUGS AND “INSANITY” 2 HCOB 8.01.69 NON-COMPLIANCE AND ALTER-IS HSDC    710    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE We therefore have the real basis of alter-is. He may be sure he is helping one repair the floor but in actual fact he is hindering the actual operation in progress which really consists of cleaning the floor. So when he “helps one” mop the floor he introduces chaos into the activity. Since he is repairing the floor a re-quest to “give me the mop” has to be reinterpreted as “hand me the hammer”. But the mop handle is larger than a hammer handle so the bucket gets upset. As a thetan can mock up an infinity of combinations, there would be an infinity of types of reactions to drugs. There would also be an infinity of types of insanity. What is constant is that he is not running in the same series of events as others. This can be slight, wherein the person is seen to make occasional mistakes. It can be as serious as total insanity where the events apparent to him are completely different than those apparent to anyone else. And it can be all grades in between. It isn’t that he doesn’t know what’s going on. It’s that he perceives something else go-ing on instead of the Present Time sequence of events. Thus others appear to him to be stupid or unreasonable or insane. As they don’t agree in their actions and orders with what he plainly sees is in progress “they” aren’t sensible. Ex-ample: A group is moving furniture. To all but one they are simply moving furniture. This one perceives himself to be “moving geometric shapes into a cloud”. Thus this one “makes mis-takes” “alter-ises” “non-complies”. As the group doesn’t see inside him and only sees another like themselves, they can’t figure out why he “balls things up so”. Such persons as drug takers and the insane are thus slightly or wholly on an apparently different time track of “present time” events. A drug may be taken to drive a person out of an unbearable PT or out of consciousness altogether. In some persons they do not afterwards return wholly to Present Time. A thetan can also escape an unbearable PT by dropping into the past, even without drugs. The penalty is running into obsessive mocking up to counter the threat of being un-mocked. The answer is to erase the engrams and reactive mechanisms. As all this out-of-PT is unknowing, it is aberrative. Things one is doing that one knows one is doing are not aberrative. The drug taker and the insane alike have not recovered present time, to a greater or lesser degree. Thus they think they are running on a different time track than they are, which, unknowingly and out of the past, they are, to a greater or lesser degree, mocking up. These are the underlying facts in odd human behaviour."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"DRUGS AND “INSANITY” 3 HCOB 8.01.69 NON-COMPLIANCE AND ALTER-IS HSDC    711    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ENTURBULATION Thus we get an explanation of enturbulation as well. As what is going on according to the perception and subjective reality of such a person is varied in greater or lesser degree from the objective reality of others, such a person entur-bulates the actual environment. What is really going on is not what is going on for them. Orders, then, are not complied with, other things happen and people around such a person have their own consecutive events disrupted. This causes enturbulation. The non-compliance, alter-is and upsets from a person who is out of present time and (what is new about this) who is running on a different series of events than those going on for the rest cause general enturbulation. This is why it takes two additional staff members to handle the routine goofs of such a person. They are forcing events to run more or less normally against the counter effort of a person with a delusory time track. We have all known such a person, many more than one, so it is not uncommon in the current civilization. The sudden non sequitur remark, out of context. The blank stare when given an order or a remark – behind these lies a whole imaginary time track which we jar into and accidentally disrupt. EXTERIORIZATION In OT sections we sometimes hear of a person who is “exterior” and so can’t be au-dited any more. The symptoms of the person have not changed. So he still has aberrations. The answer is to clear the word exteriorization with them. They often are exterior into a never-never non-extant universe. Or exterior in a past death. When the word is cleared with them, they often don’t really say what was going on. They experience a strange reaction and change. If one then runs a bit of objective havingness, they come into present time. This applies only to exteriorized cases who can’t be audited because they are “exte-rior”. And yet aren’t all right casewise. The usual course is to just handle the case by Standard Tech.

Standard practice for anyone who has ever taken drugs or even alcohol is to rehabili-tate the moments of releases in these. Drugs (or alcohol) give an enforced moment or period of release. It is surrounded in mass. LSD, marijuana (pot, hashish), peyote, opium, ether (in operations), nitrous oxide (laughing gas in dental operations), weird “biochemical” compounds used by “psychiatrists”, Benzedrine, solid alcohol (canned heat), alcohol, turpentine, gasoline, witch herbs of various kinds, and even certain rays, in this lifetime and on the back track, could have caused a mo-ment of release. Death does also but it’s a bit steep to rehab. In a rehab session, or before such a this lifetime one is audited on grades, the moments of release should be rehabbed. The C/S directs this to be done before a rehab of ARC Straight Wire. Such releases usually need rehabbing only once. Tough rehabbing and probably all “Black Vs” probably trace to these chemical “re-leases”. They are deadly because they give the sensation of release while actually pulling in mass. When “All black” reads on a GF one of these chemical release periods is probably in restim. These “Chemical releases” give us a lot of trouble unless (a) detected and (b) re-habbed.

And don’t be caught flatfooted when they do. You know, auditor, we have had a fight on our hands. And we have and WILL have a fight on our hands. The old Book One Black Panther mechanism is all right in its place, but it doesn’t do here. Nearly all the backlash in society against Dianetics and Scientology has a common source-the psychiatrist-psychologist-psychoanalyst clique. Their patter doesn’t vary. Behind the bulwark of authority these people, when asked about you, an auditor, or about the subject or about me, usually say that it is a hoax and that you or I are really just out of an institution for the insane. Wherever some auditor stupidly decides to co-operate with psychiatrists, he has been gobbled up very quickly. One cannot co-operate with them any more than he can “do business with Hitler.” You think maybe I’m just sawing out a tune when I say this. Very few people believe the actual true history of our science in the past five years, the amount of attack and antago-nism to which it has been subjected. But let it suffice that about two million have been spent to put Dianetics and Scientology out of the running. Because the people trying to do it are, by and large, pretty stupid, and low-toned, the campaign has not succeeded. But the amount of fast action necessary to combat that much money has been, to say the least, exhausting. I could tell you a lot more about this: I could tell you about the strange finances of the BDR,7 of DIANOTES, of other squirrel publications. I could tell you about three actual mur-ders.

I could tell you about the strange politics and ambitions of psychiatry, so well covered in the book Psychopolitics, and give you a proper riddle as to why we, a small group, the only Anglo-Saxon development in the field of the mind and spirit, have been subjected to so much attack and finance. But I am not telling you stories or being dramatic. I am inviting your co-operation in your own future security. Whether you believe this war exists, or believe the psychiatric rumor that it’s all a figment of my mind, it’s best to be safe in this battle. It’s best to be safe because it isn’t our battle and it isn’t our objective to ruin psychia-try or medicine. We don’t care about these. Our goals are to make more people more able, to make a rather inefficient society a lot more fun. In order to attain these goals we had better scan the river ahead for shoals and fit our craft so as to survive any, and having done that, lightheartedly continue on our way. Dianetics and Scientology are not political; they desire to overthrow no government. Each auditor anywhere is expected to continue his long-given alle-giance. Dianetics and Scientology exist to serve and assist any given officialdom in a proper way. We have in view no empire of madmen all screaming for some dictator or banner. We have our place in the world of things as they are, and we can do an awful lot right in that place, seeing that we know more about the mind, the spirit and religion and even science than any other group in the world. Granting this, then, we should act to best fit our niches, and so do our jobs. About the only thing which upsets our forward course is the fact that psychiatry and medicine sit close to the advisers of state, and these officials, on matters of the mind, turn to psychiatrists for their opinion, and the psychiatrist there can be counted upon by his cult headquarters to give the right amount of sneer to the official about Dianetics and Scientology. The public as a whole love Dianetics and Scientology. Our word-of-mouth praise is remarkable. But in the official strata, because the psychiatrist is the authority, we are likely to be mud. Similarly, the newspaper, in wanting an opinion of us, calls the local medical or psychiatric board and again gets this formulated sneer and defamation. That the public responds to us and likes us is re-markable in the face of this authoritative calumny. Reversely, the public utterly loathes psy-chiatry. You waste time if you try to defame psychiatry to the public. The public is already in a spitting frame of mind on that subject. Coals to Newcastle, strictly. Psychiatry stands in the public mind for ineffectiveness, lies and inhuman brutality. The public is better informed on this than you suspect. The public only avoids you, an auditor, when it believes you are a psy-chiatrist or a psychologist, so there is no team-up; there never will be. The Busy Business Bureaus, advised by psychiatry, will always give Dianetics and Scientology a bad report no matter how hard you work to get them to give a good report. The answer – ignore them. We are an organization for and of the people. But don’t fail to take the steps to secure yourself an immunity from attack, auditor. Make sure all your papers are in good order. Make sure, no matter where you are in the world (for the last attack upon us was in Central Africa) that your ordination is in good order.

Stay out of that slough of insanity and severe illness, for you don’t belong there and never will. Practically, I don’t know any auditor who ever came out unscathed en-tirely when he attempted to work with the severely ill or the insane. The amount of enturbu-lence caused by contact with such is fantastic. Now, not to scare you but to inform you, psychiatry has armed itself with several new drugs. One of these, LSD, has the total goal of driving persons insane for 15 to 25 hours – just long enough to convince people that your auditing spun the preclear. When you see a process solve a case, and then the case spins, don’t even bother to look for the needle mark on the pc. The APA spent their whole May convention in Atlantic City drooling over the effec-tiveness of this LSD, which has never made anyone well and is well known to have the total purpose of producing insanity. Grim? Fantastic? Ha! Ask the few auditors who’ve had this done to the pc. For the pc or his family often has a psychiatrist looking in, unknown to the auditor. And it HAS happened. Wild? It’s a lot wilder when it’s happening to you as an audi-tor. The answer? Don’t process people with psychotic histories. That’s simple enough. Now if it does happen to you, don’t just abandon the case. Give the case a few exer-cises and observe the recurrence of the weird spin. Observe this carefully. And then bluntly inform the family or the authorities, if you are questioned or called in, that you as pastor of the congregation to which this person belongs have a vested interest in the life and health of this person and that you believe that undue influence was used and that spe-cifically you gave exercises to and observed the person in question to determine whether or not that person had been given the insanity drug LSD so that you could report it to the proper authorities. And don’t testify otherwise. Sounds wild? Well, always do it if in-volved in such a thing. You’ll find the family physician or psychiatrist was called in midway in processing (which consists, remember, entirely of making able people more able). You’ll find there is a vested interest somewhere in the insanity of this person. And so testify that you suspect it. We will have to hand lots of literature on LSD, in fact we’ll have the APA conven-tion reports on it for you. If this happens to you, you, minister, are the only policeman who would suspect it. If, then, psychiatry “plants” one on you, look it over, report the sudden oc-currence of insanity promptly, testify your suspicion of LSD, produce the literature on it and get the sheriff looking around for that medico or psychiatrist as fast as possible. BUT, don’t look for trouble in the first place. Leave insane people alone. I know we can do things for them. We can also shed light on how to solve the national debt, too. Don’t ever promise people you will cure them. If they want to know if Scientology will help their arthritis, tell them it often has been known to do so, but that that isn’t an audi-tor’s goal. If a person becomes more able, he’ll usually feel well. But don’t advertise that you cure things. If you have to advertise, I’ll give you some tips that work. They don’t include curing ills and insanity. You, as the most educated people on earth on the subject of the human spirit and man, certainly deserve a high role in the field of religion.

It has never been known in chemistry or medicine exactly how or why these things worked. Such compositions are derived by accidental discoveries that “such and so depresses pain”. The effects of existing compounds are not uniform in result and often have very bad side effects. As the reason they worked was unknown very little advance has been made in bio-chemistry. If the reason they worked were known and accepted possibly chemists could de-velop some actual ones which had minimal side effects. We will leave the fact that this could be the medical biochemical discovery of the cen-tury and let the Nobel prizes continue to go to the inventors of nose-drops and new ways to kill and simply ourselves use it. Biochemical tech is not up to the point at this time that it can utilize it. Pain or discomfort of a psychosomatic nature comes from Mental Image Pictures. These are created by the thetan or living beings and impinge or press against the body. By actual clinical test, the actions of aspirin and other pain depressants are to A. Inhibit the ability of the thetan to create mental image pictures and also B. To impede the electrical conductivity of nerve channels. Both of these facts have a vital effect on processing. If you process someone who has lately been on drugs, including aspirin, you will not be able to run out the Dianetic engram chains properly because they are not being fully cre-ated. If you process someone immediately after taking aspirin for instance, you probably will not be able to find or assess the somatics that need to be run out to handle the condition. For the next day after taking the aspirin or drug the mental image pictures may not be fully available."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"DRUGS, ASPIRIN AND TRANQUILIZERS 2 HCOB 17.10.69 HSDC    720    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In the case of chronic drug taking, the drugs must be wholly worn off and out of the system and the engrams of drug taking must be run out in their entirety, triple flow. If this is not done, auditing will be trying to handle chains that aren’t being fully created by the thetan. In the case of auditing someone who has taken drugs – aspirin, etc – within the last few hours or two or three days, the chains of engrams definitely will be found not fully cre-ated and therefore not available. This would all be fine except for three things: 1. Auditing under these conditions is very difficult. The TA may be high and will not come down. One gets “erasures” at TA 4.0 with an “F/N”. Auditing errors become easy to make. The bank (chains) is jammed. 2. The thetan is rendered stupid, blank, forgetful, delusive, irresponsible. A thetan gets into a “wooden” sort of state, unfeeling, insensitive, unable and definitely not trust-worthy, a menace to his fellows actually. 3. When the drugs wear off or start to wear off the ability to create starts to return and turns on somatics much harder. One of the answers a person has for this is more drugs. To say nothing of heroin, there are, you know, aspirin addicts. The compulsion stems from a desire to get rid of the somatics and unwanted sensations again. There is also something of dramatization of the engrams already gotten from earlier drug tak-ing. The being gets more and more wooden, requiring more and more quantity and more frequent use. Sexually it is common for someone on drugs to be very stimulated at first. This is the “procreate before death” impulse as drugs are a poison. But after the original sexual “kicks” the stimulation of sexual sensation becomes harder and harder to achieve. The effort to achieve it becomes obsessive while it itself is less and less satisfying. The cycle of drug restimulation of pictures (or creation in general) can be at first to in-crease creation and then eventually to inhibit it totally. If one were working on this biochemically the least harmful pain depressant would be one that inhibited the creation of mental image pictures with minimal resulting “woodenness” or stupidity and which was body soluble so that it passed rapidly out of the nerves and sys-tem. There are no such biochemical preparations at this time. __________________ These tests and experiments tend to prove that the majority of pain and discomfort does come from mental image pictures and that these are immediately created. Erasure of a mental image picture by Standard Dianetic processing removes the com-pulsion to create it. Drugs chemically inhibit the creation but inhibit as well the erasure.

It can also be dropped to “dead thetan” (a false clear read). Auditing a person on drugs can obtain an “erasure” and “F/N” at TA 4.0. But the era-sure is only apparent and must be “rehabbed” (verified or redone) when the person is off drugs. Any habitual drug taker applying for auditing while still on drugs should be given a six weeks “drying out” period, off drugs this whole time, and then the drug taking (by somatic or sensation of drugs or prior assessment to drugs – preferably both) must be run out as an early auditing action. A person who has taken aspirin or other drugs within the past 24 hours or the past week, should be given a week to “dry out” before auditing of any kind is given. ________________ It is not fatal to audit over drugs. It is just difficult, the results may not be lasting and need to be verified afterwards. Chronic drug takers who have not had drugs specifically handled may go back to drugs after auditing as they were too drugged during auditing to get rid of what was bothering them and which drove them to drugs. With the enemies of various countries using widespread drug addiction as a defeatist mechanism, with painkillers so easily available and so ineffective, drugs is a serious auditing problem. It can be handled. But when aspirin, that innocent seeming painkiller, can produce havoc in auditing if not detected, the subject needs care and knowledge. The above data will keep the auditor clear of the pitfalls of this hazard. To paraphrase an old quote, we used to have iron men and wooden ships. We now have a drug society and wooden citizens. I’ve been studying this for over a year and a half and have made the breakthrough. Drug companies would be advised to do better research. And auditors are advised to ask any pc, “Have you been taking any drugs or aspirin?” The medical aspect is an understandable wish to handle pain. Doctors should press for better drugs to do this that do not have such lamentable side effects. The formula of least harmfulness is above. L.

They appear anaesthetized (unfeeling) and sometimes have “nothing troubling them” whereas they are on drugs, drink and are in reality in a suppressed physical condition and cannot cease to take drugs or drink. One can find, in such a case, a very high TA which doesn’t seem to reduce. The TA can be brought down by auditing the drug and alcohol engrams as a chain. However, there is another approach. Any such case took up drugs or alcohol because of unwanted pain or sensation or misemotion. You can use that as a stable datum which resolves the situation. All it requires is a special assessment called a Prior Assessment. For the person looked on drugs or alcohol as a cure for unwanted feelings. One has to assess what was wrong before or prior to the cure. You determine if the person is on drugs or alcohol habitually. If so you determine which was earlier. Now you ask for and list the pains, sensations, emotions or feelings he or she had be-fore taking drugs or alcohol. In doing this assessment, you must grab the read and mark it plainly as it occurs. If you just list and then go over the list the person may be back in present time and, as these are now cut off by the masses of drug or alcohol engrams on top of them, they won’t read again. So you must catch the read as the person first mentions it. You choose the longest read and find and run the chain by R-3R as in any other Stan-dard Dianetic auditing. The only difference is the assessment time period. You are listing for a time before they went on drugs or alcohol.

One of these cases was unchanged after “a drug rundown”. He had a pair of eyes that looked like blank discs. Check of folder showed all major drug items “not run due to no inter-est”. The solution was to recover the lists, run the items that had read R3R triple and complete the case. Another one blew. His folder was examined. Every evil purpose had been left unrun! Of the items from the “Wants Handled Rundown” the intentions were mislisted. The drug rundown failed due to “no interest”.

Tech must not be made to fail because of overt, covert or ignorant misapplication of tech. It is fully established that a chief cause of failure in cases is unhandled or only par-tially handled drugs including medical drugs, treatments and alcohol.

What makes a TA high? A TA, in Dianetics, is high only for one reason. One or more engram chains are in restimulation. A high TA equals mental energy mass. Engrams have mass in them even when they are pictures. The figures in the picture, the scenery, the picture, have mass. It is electrical mass. It registers as a TA above 3. To say that the TA is 3.3 and the picture was erased is silly. That .3 is indicating that part of the mass is still there. This is often also true above 2.0. When the meter needle is not floating the TA is registering mass. Mental mass. So when you see a TA going up, up, up you know the picture isn’t erasing but is get-ting more solid. The solidness is visible right on the TA dial. So to ask for a rerun when you’ve already ground and ground and the TA has been up up up is silly. The meter is already telling you there is an earlier incident as the one the pc is in is getting more solid and is not erasing. In Scientology a high TA means „overrun“. The Dianetic auditor however doing Dianetics does not „rehab“ the F/N. He is handling why the TA does go high. Mental mass consisting of pictures. A Scientology overrun goes by an F/N. In the F/N movement the mass moved away. It didn’t erase. If you keep on running the same action the mass moves in again.

The Dianetic auditor in doing Dianetics finds the incomplete chain, carries it to basic and gets it gone forever. If the C/S cannot find the incomplete chain by folder inspection he orders „Assess the pictures or masses pc has touched in life or auditing and have been left unflat, get its somatic, Run R3-R“. LOW TA A low TA (below 2) means the pc is overwhelmed and has retreated. If you chop up a pc with bad TRs you may see his TA go below 2. Also some incidents force a pc below 2. But when they are erased the TA comes back up to F/N. If you think you have had an erasure but the TA is below 2 at the time of F/N, then you haven’t erased any chain. EXCEPTION A discharged meter or one with its trim set incorrectly (2.0 = 2.0) or a faulty meter or electrodes will give the auditor or examiner wrong reads.

What has happened here is that he restimulated past lives with drugs, got into frighten-ing pictures that he didn’t understand and now backs off from any bank content except drugs. That is handled with a full Drug RD, including a full battery of Objectives and all reading items run including “no interest” items. The standard approach on any pc is to get full drug handling done first. (See: HCOB 27 JUNE 78, NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 9, DRUG HANDLING.) _____________________ Another reason could be the pc is in recent shock of having died. Such a case is over-burdened and is destimulated with general auditing and then gets a Past Life Remedy if he hasn’t gone backtrack. You could even do a Prior Assessment to this life. The subject of invalidation of past lives and people talking about them out of session or claiming to be famous people invalidates past lives for a pc and is actually related to sup-pression and PTS phenomena. If you suspect this you could ask “Has anyone been talking to you about past lives or famous people?” From this question possible suppression in the envi-ronment can be located and used in a PTS RD, HCOB 9 DEC 71R, REVISED 21 OCT 74. CHILDREN Children are usually very burdened cases and can be hard to C/S on Dianetics if it hits this life only which will leave the pc wide open to key-in and at the age of 20 be found all keyed-in “with all grades run.” I find they are jammed into fiction stories, education, books and movies and run these like engrams. These children speak of “remembering” all the time. They say they can’t go backtrack “because they don’t remember.” They don’t seem to take it from pictures. Contrary to psychology theories and popular belief I find children in very rough case shape, nervous, frightened, griefy, etc. They get stuck in the books and movies they see. I have handled this in various ways. The easiest way to unburden cases is by Objec-tives (contact processes) and Recall (ARC S/W, Self Analysis). That is the general approach. You can list for mental image pictures pc has seen in life, in movies or books, take the best reading one and do full preassessment procedure on it, handling the running item obtained with R3RA Quad. Then repeat the preassessment steps until you get no reads on the Preas-sessment List you have assessed for that original item. Return to the mental image pictures list, take the next largest reading item and do full preassessment, etc. Follow HCOB 18 JUNE 1978, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM (NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4) exactly. Preassessment can also be done on unwanted attitudes, emotions, pains, etc. (the Preassessment List) one had as a child. These would then be fully handled as above to un-burden the case. A direct approach is to ask “What book or movie were you particularly interested in?” You’ll usually find that the person had a stuck picture on it. Then ask “Did you ever have"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"PAST LIFE REMEDIES 4 HCOB 16.1.75R HSDC    736    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE anything to do with that sort of thing?” Then they go into it because you’re asking for an E/S. You could then run out the earlier incident Narrative R3RA Quad and you’d be away. Where the pc is stuck in upsetting incidents from movies or books you can list for “Bad incidents you’ve seen or read about,” take the best reading one with pc interest and run it out R3RA Narrative Quad. Then handle with preassessment procedure, per above. Be sure to accept stories, TV, movies or books as these are fully valid to run. REVIEW A Scientology review action that can be done is to assess • auditors • auditing • past lives • Dianetics • Scientology • time • preclears • erasure Then prepcheck in order of reads, reassess and prepcheck. This is a valuable action to do before ARC S/W Triple and often by itself will handle those unable to go past track. A further Scientology approach would be to assess the past, memory pictures, past lives and prepcheck in order of reads. Then L&N “Who or what would have no future?” then L&N “Who or what would it have been awful to have been?” These items can be checked and used in a PTS RD or can have their intentions listed and run as part of Ex Dn handling. SUMMARY The technology on past lives is important for a C/S to know, especially the Dianetics C/S. The subject usually resolves with a Drug RD and general auditing but when it doesn’t you have these remedies to use. Use them well. L.

They will also handle high TAs caused by chains left in restimulation by reason of not taking them to a full Dianetic EP. WORD CLEARING One of the beginning pc’s first steps in auditing is a thorough and complete CS-1. This is given as ACTION SEVEN on NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 2, FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE. It must be done until the pc well understands the commands of R3RA and knows what is ex-pected of him as a pc. (Ref: HCOB 9 Jul 78, DIANETIC CS-1.) Do not attempt to run R3RA on a pc who is not properly indoctrinated. Clear the commands. Clear the list words and clear the procedures with him. It is the auditor’s respon-sibility to ensure the pc understands the commands and the procedure he is being run on. So the first remedy given here is Word Clearing. A pc who does not understand R3RA commands, assessment procedures, etc. will only restimulate masses in Dianetic ses-sions, he will not be able to erase them. If there is any doubt that your pc understands the commands and procedures of R3RA, you clear these up immediately. There are uniformly two things that prevent pcs from running engrams. They are the failure to fully clear all the commands and procedures of R3RA as we have covered above, and unhandled drugs. Hence, the following remedies are to be done in their correct sequence on the pc’s Dianetic program, after a full and complete drug handling per New Era Dianetics Series 9, DRUG HANDLING. (Ref: New Era Dianetics Series 2, FULL PC PROGRAM OUTLINE.) PICTURES OR MASSES The following remedy is ordered by the C/S when the pc has no misunderstood words but still goes anaten in session, even when assessment and R3RA procedure are correctly done and the pc has had sufficient sleep, with no unflat chains evident by folder inspection but has a very high or low TA."},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 2 HCOB 24.7.78 HSDC    738    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The auditor asks: “What pictures or masses have you touched on in life or in auditing that have been left unhandled?” The most obvious remedy is simply to take the best reading picture that was left unflat in auditing and simply finish the chain. If the pc had only run it single flow at the time then finish it single flow for certain and check the other flows to see if they read and run them if they do. The question one checks is Step One narrative or Step One regular R3RA. One uses narrative when it is simply an incident and regular R3RA when he remembers what somatic he was running at the time. The essence of this is simply to complete something that was already started and wasn’t completed. If it was a picture which simply appeared in life, one can treat it as an original item per the Assessment HCOB and carry on from there. Caution should be observed in running a pc on Quad who hitherto had only been run on single or triple flows. One can get onto the subject of bypassed charge when he suddenly runs a new flow (like Flow 0) that has never been run before on a new item. What happens is the pc, audited on single or triple on other items in previous auditing, collides with some of the unrun charge of previously unhandled chains of that flow and can get quite upset. The best handling of this sort of thing is called “Quading up a pc” as contained IN HCOB 7 MARCH 71R, USE OF QUADRUPLE DIANETICS. Masses are handled simply by treating them as an original item as in the Assessment HCOB. In pictures or masses remedies, one is best off following New Era Dianetics Series 4. Just treat the picture or mass as an original item. Therefore, when the pc gives you a list of pictures or masses that have been touched on in life or auditing he is really giving you a list of original items so far as handling is concerned. The auditor takes the best reading item from that list and does a preassessment on it. “Are/is (preassessment item) connected with (item)?” is the preassessment question. The auditor then follows the procedure outlined IN HCOB 18 JUNE 1978 NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4, doing a full preassessment and runs out R3RA Quad all reading items with pc interest. When this action is correctly performed the TA of the pc will be back in range, and the pc will be bright. AUTOMATICITY OF PICTURES There are some pcs who keep talking about “this huge automaticity of pictures coming in, faster and faster.” They also dope off in session and they are somewhat hard to get an F/N on. The thing which is really wrong with the pc is instability. He can’t hold things still."},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 3 HCOB 24.7.78 HSDC    739    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE A C/S could order HCO TRAINING BULLETIN OF 6 FEB 1957 (Technical Volume III) – “Hold It Still.” Objectives are also indicated, particularly SCS, as the pc can’t control things. After flattening Objectives it will be found that the pc’s bank is more stable. As the multipictures may also have keyed something in a C/S, after Objectives are flat, could order the following: “Ask the pc ‘What pictures have you seen in life or auditing?’ and treat the best read-ing items in the resulting list as original items, handling them per NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4.” The phenomenon of automatic pictures is also called “an avalanche” and data on it is available in the Technical Bulletins Volume II, page 39, Volume VIII, page 106. The above section is the best handling. OVERTS When the pc goes anaten in session but there is no evidence of unflat chains, the C/S issues this C/S: “Assess for: • Overts on unconscious people • Overts on anaten people • Overts on asleep people • Overts on sick people. “Run each reading item with interest R3RA Narrative Quad, running F2 first.” The C/S could vary the assessment list, adding items if necessary in accordance with what the pc was motivating from. IMAGINARY INCIDENTS Sometimes a pc cannot confront the actual incidents that are keyed-in by life or audit-ing. Such a pc will not go backtrack. In this case the running of imaginary incidents is quite productive. Sometimes the preclear will run them, quite astonishingly, with somatics. But he is not being required to face any reality about them and the auditor is not insisting that any reality exists concerning them. In a surprisingly high percentage of times, however, he will be running actual incidents. So long as he does not have to admit that these incidents are actual he can do something about them. It should be understood that no amount of imaginary incidents can supplant the run-ning of real incidents. The first value that this technique has – the invitation to the preclear to"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"DIANETIC REMEDIES 4 HCOB 24.7.78 HSDC    740    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE run avowedly imaginary incidents in his past – is to build up, the preclear’s confidence in the auditor. The preclear begins to feel that he will not be censured for indulging in fantasy. When the preclear discovers that he has an auditor who not only will listen to imagina-tion but who encourages it, the affinity level rises and the preclear’s ability to differentiate in terms of reality will itself rise. The auditor must never, after the incident has been run, then insist that the incident was real. This would be a break of faith. He and the preclear have entered into a contract that what is being run is pure imagination, and the auditor must not break his contract. To run imaginary incidents, the auditor discusses with the pc how they will be running imaginary incidents and gets the pc’s agreement to do so. The auditor then asks, “What imaginary incidents or pictures have you touched on?” All the pc’s responses to this question, with their meter reads are noted by the auditor. He then takes up the best reading incident or picture and runs it out R3RA Narrative Quad, first checking interest. Lesser reading items are then taken up. This action is done until the pc is brighter and more able to confront actual incidents as they come up in auditing. In doing this remedy be certain the pc understands R3RA procedure and has no mis-understoods. L.

Now and then it is necessary to audit out the last session or an auditing session. One does this by using Narrative R3RA... wording when asking the pc to go earlier. One asks for an earlier similar incident. “Is there an earlier similar incident?” A session, when audited, does not always erase. Instead it has become part of a chain. Therefore one has to run Narrative R3RA on it and get an earlier similar incident. The chain may go back vast amounts of time. Whereas the pc may only have been in Scientology 3 days, before Scientology there were other types of “sessions” such as psychoanalysis. And before that, in Rome and Greece, dream therapy in which one was “visited by a god.” And before that – well, the chain can have a very far back basic. One does not of course suggest ever what the earlier incident may be. There is no telling what the pc may confuse with a session. If one asked the pc to “locate an earlier incident with a similar feeling” one would be on another chain entirely. Hence one asks, simply, “Is there an earlier similar incident?” when running a session out. Running a session out has the liability that one is running a narrative chain, a similar experience rather than a similar somatic. One of the major 1969 breakthroughs was that chains are held together mainly by somatics. The body condition or somatic is what keeps the chain in association. One does of course run “narrative incidents” by which one means similar experiences. (SEE HCOB 25 JUNE 78, NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 8, DIANETICS, BEGINNING A PC ON.) “Locate an earlier time your mother spanked you.” “Locate an earlier wreck.” These will run and erase but they must be done properly. This is by running the incident over and over to erasure, asking after each run through for earlier beginning, and only going earlier similar if it starts to grind badly. Running only narrative incidents is what made early Dianetics run up such fabulous numbers of hours in processing."},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"AUDITING OUT SESSIONS 2 HCOB 23.5.69R NARRATIVE VERSUS SOMATIC CHAINS HSDC    742    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The commands for running narrative incidents and further data on running narratives are to be found in HCOB 26 JUNE 1978 ISSUE II, NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 6, ROUTINE 3RA ENGRAM RUNNING BY CHAINS. Somatic chains go quickly to basic and are the important chains. Thus when we erase a chain of sessions we sometimes run into a very long session. Sometimes the TA goes up to 4 or 5 (particularly if the auditor grinds). Using a wrong go-earlier command is a primary reason for trouble. Usually if you ask simply for an earlier beginning or an earlier similar incident the pc goes back to something that will erase and it blows. But remember, asking for similar types of experience can... get very long and erasure may not occur for some time.

There are two reasons for this: 1. Not enough auditing on enough chains. Sooner or later the exact small piece of an engram “already run” shows up on another chain later. Example: Pain in an area of an operation occurs now and then again weeks, months or years after the operation has been run out as an engram. Sooner or later just on general audit-ing the missing bit of the operation shows up, blows. Voila! Pain gone forever. This is peculiar especially to abdominal operations like an appendectomy. The opera-tion was run out. The scar stays puffy. The pc is occasionally ill from it. Pc’s conclusion is that Dianetics hasn’t worked on it. More auditing on other somatics (just general Dianetics) is given. One day the remaining bit of the operation, hidden from view, apparently erased, shows up, blows. Pc now fine. A reason for this is “overburden” in that the incident was too charged in one place to be confronted. As the whole case is unburdened, confront comes up. The piece that was miss-ing (and giving the pain) blows. There is no way of forcing it. In fact it would be fatal to try. The other reason for it is that the missing bit causing the pain is a different somatic like “a Chest Compression”. This bit of the operation had another basic than the one run. The answer to a persistent or recurring somatic in an injured area is always more Dianetic Auditing of the standard type, just addressed to the bank not the special somatic. Just keep doing the usual and one day it all straightens out. 2. Sympathetic nervous system pains. There are two sides to the body. As you learn in touch assists, if the right hand is in-jured you include also the left hand."},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"UNRESOLVED PAINS 2 HCOB 15.07.70 HSDC    744    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Body nerves conduct pain. The two sides of the body interlock. Pain gets stopped in the nerves. If the right elbow is hurt the left elbow will have echoed the pain. Example, you find a pc with a pain in the left elbow. You try to audit a left elbow chain. It doesn’t fully resolve. If you ran injuries to the right elbow, suddenly there’s a somatic going through the left elbow! It gets well. This is the sympathetic nervous system. The right ear, injured, also gets echoes with a somatic in the left ear. You audit the right ear only. Pc comes up with a sore left ear! You can actually direct a pc’s attention to it (non-standard but a research technique) and he can find where the uninjured ear echoed the injured ear. Where you can’t fully repair a crippled left leg, don’t be surprised to find it was the right leg that was hurt. You audit the left leg somatic in vain. If you do, start auditing somatics in the opposite side of the body. TOOTHACHE The mystery of toothache is resolved in both 1 and 2 above, especially 2. The pain is concentrated on the left upper molar. You audit it in vain. Toothache per-sists. Look at the pc’s mouth. Has the right upper molar ever been pulled or injured? Yes. That’s how the left molar began to decay. The right upper molar was pulled. The pain (espe-cially under the painkiller on the right side only) backed up and stopped on the opposite side. Eventually the left upper molar, under that stress, a year or ten later, caves in and aches. Mysterious as it wasn’t injured. Mysterious as the opposite molar is long gone, doesn’t hurt anymore. When a toothache does not resolve in auditing, audit the opposite tooth on the other side. You can actually do it by count of teeth. It’s sort of auditing a no-somatic. Pc in misery with right upper molar. No pain on left side. Audit an injury he had on the left side (it will read on the meter also). Voila! The toothache that wouldn’t go away eases up! The fellow who has the exact opposite teeth pulled (upper right wisdom, upper left wisdom) is in for it as there is a constant cross-play. Makes the mouth odd and pressury.

For a pc with a toothache, on the right side, you can list for feelings on the left side of the mouth and get “numbness”, “no feeling”, etc. Audit that list and suddenly magically the toothache on the opposite side not being audited eases up.

This can even go back to a dream or a telepathic awareness or a premonition that the incident was going to occur. Narrative erasures often depend utterly on finding, after each run through, if there was any earlier beginning. If the incident starts to grind (no change of TA or content) despite having repeatedly searched for an earlier beginning only then do you go into an earlier narrative incident but do so with caution as most narratives expertly run will erase all by themselves and running a chain of deaths for instance can go back an awfully long way. When all such great changes in a person’s life have been found and erased the person should experience a considerable sense of relief about life. If he does not, then treat the narrative, even though handled as a narrative, as an origi-nal item and preassess it to find other running items connected with it and treat it with R3RA full handling. Also do this if the narrative grinds and there is trouble going earlier. Narrative chains properly run produce dramatic and miraculous case changes. L.

But some of them are beyond the pc’s reality and ability and some of them are too featherweight to get any case gain. This rundown is designed to locate items that can be run R3RA. It is called the Dianetic Prepared Assessment Rundown. EARLIER ASSESSMENT DONE The very earliest assessment (1948) used was “What the pc could see” when he closed his or her eyes. This was then run. This was followed by an arbitrary method of assigning necessary incidents to be run such as birth and prenatals. The next earliest assessment (1949) was to ask each time for “the incident necessary to resolve the case.” An automaticity known as the “File Clerk” was depended upon, impinged on by finger snapping. The next period (1951) concerned whole track exploration running whatever you could get to read on a meter. The next period (1952) concerned overt engrams located by what the pc seemed to be doing physically. This ended the Dianetic period when engrams were run to clear a case. Variations of these assessments were revived from time to time in Dianetic uses, cul-minating in the 5th ACC where overt engrams were run with confront and great stress was laid on getting the postulates out of them. The meter and shrewd guesses played their part in assessments. Significance and story content have no bearing on the rightness or wrongness of a chain selected. They are entirely incidental to judging the correctness of a chain."},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"THE DIANETIC PREPARED ASSESSMENT 2 HCOB 1.07.78 RUNDOWN ACTION FOURTEEN HSDC    754    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 1.

This result has occasionally been achieved by Standard Dianetics as one of many miracles produced, but previous to this there has been no Dianetic RD which specifically lends itself to handling valences. You can, of course, order them into valence in an incident but that isn’t in the realm of R3RA. PROCEDURE 1. Have the pc make a list of all the things he has never wanted to have. 2. Do preassessment on those that read in 1. Quad R3RA reading items, first checking in-terest. 3. Have the pc list all the things he has never wanted to do. 4. Do preassessment on those that read in 3.

There are many such lists – Green Form, L1B, L4, etc. They are available in HCO B form and are themselves corrected and re-issued from time to time. They can be found in HCO B 5 July AD13 and others. There are four ways to use these prepared lists. 1. The auditor starts at the top and takes up each read until he gets one to F/N. In this case the auditor does not do “Itsa earlier Itsa”. He just cleans each read. 2. The auditor starts from the top and on each read cleans it and does Itsa earlier Itsa to F/N or to a clean no-read and goes on. 3. The auditor assesses the list down until he gets a heavy read and cleans that, using Itsa earlier Itsa. Then he can go on to the next heavy read, cleans that. Etc. to F/N. In this case he can get several F/Ns on the same list. 4. The whole list is rapidly assessed over and over until one item stays in and that is given to the pc. UPSET PC When a pc is very upset and misemotional the action in 4 above is the only one to use as it is the safest. On a very upset or antagonistic pc don’t engage in any chatter, just grab a list and assess it, and indicate the By-Passed Charge. The results are usually magical.

It is more important to see the pc’s cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads. TR 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it. You are looking for an Instant Read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question. If it does not read, mark the list X. If the list is being done through an F/N and the F/N just continues, mark the Question F/N. If the question reads, do not say „That reads”. Mark the read at once (tick, SF, F, LF, LFBD, R/S), transfer the number of the Q to the W/S and look expectantly at the pc. You can repeat the Q by just saying it again if pc doesn’t begin to talk. He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc’s remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on the W/S. If the pc’s answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accom-pany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, „Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.” Do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do not chop what he is saying. Both are TR errors that are very bad. If there is no F/N, at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it, ask for an Earlier Similar _____ whatever the question concerned. Do not change the Q. Do not fail to repeat what the Question is. „Was there an Earlier Similar Restimulation of ‘rejected affin-ity’?” This is the „E/S” part of it. You do not leave such a Question merely „clean”. It does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not. But you can look at the pc when you say it. The pc will answer. If he comes to a „looks like he thinks he said it” and no F/N, you ask the same Q as above. You ask this Q „Was there an earlier similar ______” until you finally get an F/N and GIs. You indicate the F/N. That is the last of that particular question. You mark „F/N” on the list and call the next question on the list. You call this and other questions without looking at the pc. Those that do not read, you X as out. The next question that reads, you mark it on the list, transfer the question number to the W/S.

If you got no read on the list Question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unread-ing question, do not take it up. Just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list. Believe your meter. Do not take up things that don’t read. Don’t get „hunches”. Don’t let the pc run his own case by answering non-reading items and then the auditor taking them up. Also don’t let a pc „fiddle the cans” to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Very rare but these two actions have happened.) BIG WIN If half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/S action or ending the session. There are two reasons for this – one, the F/N will usually just persist and can’t be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. This is not true of any other list. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any ear-lier data contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change – we F/N everything that reads by E/S or a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an F/N) and we never tell the pc that it read or didn’t read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are not used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up.

Then the C/S sorts out the reads and C/Ses what to do as very well covered on the lists themselves and the C/S Series. Then the auditor does the C/S. A Green Form is always done this way. It will bog on any other method like 3. There are different methods of handling lists. L1C is always done Method 3, carrying each read as it is found Earlier Similar to F/N. A GF 40R is done Method 3 and then the engrams are run for each read where en-grams are indicated. It’s up to a C/S to use Correction Lists, to coach his auditors into proper list use and to get corrected any misuse. A C/S who can’t or doesn’t use Prepared Correction Lists isn’t a C/S at all but a „per-son puzzled about cases”.

There are many of these. Notable amongst them is C/S 53 and its corrections. It is customary for the auditor to be required to F/N such a list. This means on calling it that the whole list item by item is to F/N. To F/N a list, you do it Method 3. Somebody’s got the wrong idea that it is done Method 5 – going over and over and over something. A recent C/S of mine on the subject stated: “The reason you’re having trouble F/Ning a list is because you don’t do M3, handle each read to the end and then reassess M3 and han-dle each read to the end. It is obvious from your list markings that you were doing M5 over and over, which of course gets into protest. Usually M3 at some point will begin to F/N and that is the reason you do M3. Also, when you miss on a prepared list the F/N stops. So there were a few minor misses on these lists but mostly because you were doing it M5. Also, it takes an R-Factor that you’re going to clean up everything on the list.” You handle a list Method 3 by calling the line and handling the line. A prepared list should be used to get optimum results on a pc. If a prepared list reveals that more needs to be handled, i.e. engram in restimulation, then it would be handled. (Note: In this case the han-dling would be to assess the L3RF and handle the reads. Warning: You would not run Dianetics on a Clear, Dianetic Clear or OT. For C/ears and OTs you would assess the L3RF and then simply indicate the read.) If a more major action was found to be needed it would be programmed for handling, per list instructions. If something hot leaps into view on a prepared list then handle it. It is the wrong think that one has to quickie a prepared list and get it to F/N in a hurry rather than to use it to get optimum results on a pc. All the list must be called a final time."},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"NULLING AND F/NING PREPARED LISTS 2 C/S SERIES 87RB – HCOB 15.10.73RB HSDC    778    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE “NON-READING, NON-F/Ning” LISTS Now and then you get the extreme oddity of a list selected to exactly remedy the case not reading but not F/Ning. Of course this might happen if the list did not apply to the case (such as an OT pre-pared list being used on a Grade IV, heaven forbid). In the case of lists to correct listing and in particular the C/S 53 Series, it is nearly impossible for this situation to occur. A C/S will very often see that the auditor has assessed the list on the pc, has gotten no reads, and the list did not F/N. A “reasonable” C/S (heaven forbid) lets this go by. Yet he has before him first class evidence that the auditor 1. Has out-TRs in general, 2. Has no impingement whatever with TR 1, 3. Is placing his meter in the wrong position in the auditing session so that he cannot see it, the pc and his worksheet, 4. That the auditor’s eyesight is bad. One or more of these conditions certainly exist. To do nothing about it is to ask for catastrophe after catastrophe with pcs and to have one’s confidence in one’s own C/Sing deteriorate badly. An amazing number of auditors cannot make a prepared list read for one of the above reasons. Putting in Suppress, Invalidation or Misunderstood Words on the list will either get a read or the list will F/N. If a list does not F/N then the subject of the list is still charged or there is something wrong with the list. The moral of this is that prepared lists that do not read F/N. When prepared lists that do not read do not F/N or when the auditor cannot get a prepared list to F/N, serious auditing errors are present which will defeat a C/S. In the interest of obtaining results and being merciful on pcs, the wise C/S never lets this situation go by without finding what it is all about. READING THROUGH AN F/N There is a skill that any auditor who is handling lists should master and that is reading through an F/N. When taking a list to F/Ning assessment an auditor must know how to read through an f/n. When going down a list that is F/Ning you’ll sometimes see the F/N “check” briefly and then continue. The swinging weight of the F/Ning needle has momentum and it will tend"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"NULLING AND F/NING PREPARED LISTS 3 C/S SERIES 87RB – HCOB 15.10.73RB HSDC    779    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE to obscure a read. But a sharp auditor will see this “check” or slow in an F/N, know he has a hot item and take it up and handle it. An auditor who can’t read through an F/N will miss it and go right on by, and the F/N then kills within the next couple of items. Now he’s got a suppressed read and he’s going to have trouble F/Ning the list. When this happens, even if you can’t read through an F/N, you should go back up the list an item or two and find it. But one should be able to read through an F/N. It is the secret of being able to take a list accurately to an honestly F/Ning assessment, with no wasted time or effort. (Ref: HCOB 4 December 78, HOW TO READ THROUGH AN F/N.) THE “RABBIT BUTTONS” To “rabbit” means to run away from the bank. (The term derives from the fact that a rabbit is timid and runs away from just about everything.) Some auditors have been known to “rabbit” from auditing sessions or from certain session actions. This is wholly due to out-TRs or shaky metering and the auditor not knowing how to use his tools. Rabbiting shows up in various ways – not getting the pc through the engram and not taking a Dianetic chain to full EP, or calling an F/N when it’s an ARC break needle, or simply ending off when the going gets rough, etc. It’s running away from the action rather than completing it. One of the ways some auditors rabbit from F/Ning a list is by using what have come to be known as the “rabbit buttons.” Given a C/S 53 (or other list) to take to F/Ning assess-ment, the auditor begins assessing and handling the list items but on the slightest provoca-tion (such as a minor protest from the pc), introduces such questions as: “Is the C/S 53 being overrun?”, “Is this list unnecessary?”, “Do you feel over-repaired?” or something similar. These questions are valid enough when they occur, as they do, at the end of some prepared lists. But used out of sequence they serve to get the auditor out of taking the C/S 53 or other assigned list to F/Ning assessment. Auditor throws in the “rabbit buttons,” pc im-mediately agrees it’s “overrun” or “unnecessary,” and the auditor ends off, with the majority of the list items unchecked for charge. This is by no means true of all auditors but it has happened frequently enough for these questions, used out of sequence, to be dubbed the “rabbit buttons.” And each time an auditor has rabbited in this way from F/Ning a list, something has been found later that should have been handled. Thus: When the C/S calls for F/Ning a list it must be taken to completion and not quit before the entire list is F/Ning, item by item, on assessment. Any pc protest or upset or apprehension over extensive repair actions or a list having to be F/Ned stems mainly from auditor out-TRs and mismetering (missing reads and calling false reads) when doing repair lists. Any auditor back-off or protest on F/Ning a list stems from these same points plus having to handle pc upset or protest. The solution is for the auditor to polish his TRs and sharpen up his metering. And learn to read through an F/N."},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"NULLING AND F/NING PREPARED LISTS 4 C/S SERIES 87RB – HCOB 15.10.73RB HSDC    780    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Given good TRs and standard metering, the auditor who can then also read through an F/N will have no difficulty taking a list to F/Ning assessment.

As a Clear’s postulates read as a surge, usually fairly long (over 1”), “No” can read if the pc says it to himself as an answer to a question asked. A read, therefore, does not mean invariably “yes” or that the question is charged. All it means is that the Meter has read. The Auditor must now find out what the read was before determining he should do something about that portion of the Green Form or List. One doesn’t just assume the read was “yes”. One asks about the read as a general rule, not assuming at once the thing asked was charged. Example – Auditor: “Do you have a missed withhold?” Meter surges. Auditor: “What was that?” Pre OT: “I thought No I don’t.” Auditor: “OK. Do you have a missed withhold?” Pre OT: “No.” – Meter didn’t read. Auditor: “Anything suppressed-asserted-protested-invalidated. OK that’s clean.“ Ticks (1/8 inch) often mean something is there. A Pre OT’s postulates have greater length when they surge. It is not important how you handle this phenomena of postulate or to-oneself-comment by a high level case. It is important that the Auditor does not hang the case with a wrong ad-judication of what’s wrong by thinking every surge means “yes” or that the question is charged because it surges.

One school says all trouble comes from physical illness. Another says it all comes from mental illness. The psychiatrist mixes the two and says all mental illness is physical. It is time every auditor, particularly Class VIIIs, took a hard look at this area. The body is capable of having physical illness, acute (momentary) or chronic (contin-ual). Broken bones, pinched nerves, diseases can any of them occur to a body independent of any mental or spiritual action. The mind or spirit can predispose the illness or injury. By this is meant a person can be distraught and have an accident, or decide to die and get a disease. But the disease or injury when he’s got it is a body circumstance and responds best to skilled medical (ordinary usual, put on a tourniquet, set a bone, give a shot) treatment. On a sick or injured person, you can reduce the time of healing or recovery by remov-ing the spiritual or mental upset, providing the person can be audited, but usually after effec-tive physical treatment. The facts are real enough. Auditing a person with a broken leg after it is set and he is comfortable, to remove the engram of the accident or treatment and the earlier „reason“ he or she was distraught or had the accident, can improve the bone knitting time by as much as 2/3rds by actual test. This would be six weeks down to two weeks. But the bone has to be set! A body is a biological object. It has all manner of internal communication systems and organized interrelated functions."},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"PHYSICALLY ILL PCS AND PRE OTS 2 HCOB 12.3.69 II HSDC    786    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Now if you tried to audit a preclear when he was acutely ill, you would find him hard to audit, confused and distracted and unable to follow commands. He may become over-whelmed easily. He certainly is not likely to respond properly. Because the body is sending all sorts of pain or discomfort messages and confusions, it is very much in his way. Two things are going on at the same time – his case as a spiritual being, his body as a distracting pain or sensation object. The pc assigns the body to his case or his case to his body. You have to get the body out of the attention area to some degree before anything helpful usually occurs by way of auditing. Now let us take the pc with a long term illness. He has been sick with something since the age of 8. He really doesn’t know he’s sick physically. He blames it all on his own case. In a lot of cases we audit him and he has enough relief to then get physically well. For he was mentally or spiritually suppressing his body. These successes (and they are numerous) could cause us to do an all mental concentra-tion and lead some to insist all illness was from the mind. This makes some make the mistake of omitting physical examination and treatment in all cases. Certain schools of healing in the past got the entire field in disrepute by assuming and stating and acting on just that. When you find a pc who does not easily respond, whether he answers up to 7 cases „Physically ill“ or not, you sure better get him to the nearest clinic for a thorough physical examination including head and spine X-rays and get him examined pathologically. For you will usually find he is physically ill, in suppressed pain or discomfort. There are cures for a lot of these things now and not requiring „exploratory“ operations either. Don’t throw away all the grades of auditing on him. He’s sick. Physically. That’s why you do a White Form. A long history of accident and illness should pre-pare you to be alert and to send him to a clinic if his response to auditing is the least bit poor. Then when you have the physical side of it in hand, audit him at assist level. When he is well give him his grades. Don’t force auditing into physical healing. It works much of the time. Special types of auditing (running out injuries, etc.) assist healing markedly. That doesn’t mean you should avoid all medical treatment! „Failed cases“ are medically ill or injured cases. Without exception. So why fail. There are medical doctors and clinics. There are standard, usual treatments. You don’t have to buy „exploratories“ and questionable actions. These are done only when the medical doctor can’t find out either. When this impasse occurs, start doing assists or look for engrams.

These facts should be used but they do not contradict that medical treatment was needed in the first place. ____________________ The psychiatrist is an example of the other extreme to spiritual healing. Instead of „all mind“ he is saying „all physical“. Holding either extreme produces failures. The psychiatrist got into his „all physical“ by a sensing that insanity symptoms seemed to resemble persons in pain or delirium. In these cases the stress of physical suffering is pouring back into and overwhelming the mind. After considerable study on this, I realized that an error could have been made out of a statement „all insanity is physical“. This is probably the case in the large percentage of the insane. But from this one can-not then say „all mental trouble is physical“ because that can be demonstrated as not true. We see it as easily as in a case of a person falling ill on the receipt of bad news, who then gets good news and gets well. The great Voltaire, on his deathbed, received news that he had been awarded the Legion of Honor, after a lifetime of being scorned by Authority. He promptly got up, put on his clothes and went down to receive the award. In the case of insanity having physical causes, one could discover this, say it and be promptly misunderstood in this way. The sufferer is in a general agony from a nerve long ago crushed. This actual pain is distributed from its point of concentration to the whole of the nervous system. The person cannot think, looks dazed, cannot work or act. An operation re-moves the pressure causing the condition. The person is then „sane“ in that he can perform the actions of life. After a few successes of this nature, the psychiatrist leaps to the conclusion all mental trouble is physical. He teaches some student saying „all mental trouble is physical“. The stu-dent goes off, tries to figure it out, dreams up a special insanity virus or „genes“ or a special illness called „insanity“. He then resorts to all manner of odd and often brutal treatments. By cutting or shocking a nerve channel one can stop the pain messages but such actions lay in new complications which usually terminate in premature if not immediate death or injury. This tells one why tranquilizers (psychotropic drugs) make a patient rational or at least able to function for a short while. They too have their side effects. Usually all they do is, like aspirin, reduce the pain. Patients do not always know they hurt. They suppress the pain or sensation. It seems normal to them or „life“. When they receive a distressing experience or have an accident they cease to suppress and may go „insane“, which is to say, become continuously overwhelmed by pain or unwanted sensation. They cannot think or act rationally. They may even be insane"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"PHYSICALLY ILL PCS AND PRE OTS 4 HCOB 12.3.69 II HSDC    788    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE only during periods of the day or month that coincide with the time of the accident. But they are in physical distress. As they cannot eat or sleep, their condition worsens by exhaustion and they may go into various states including a deathlike motionlessness or actually die. The correct action on an insane patient is a full searching clinical examination by a competent medical doctor. He may find disease, fractures, concussion, tumours, or any common illness which has escaped treatment and has become chronic (perpetual). He should keep looking until he finds it. For it is there. Not some „insane germ“ but some ordinary recognizable illness or physical malfunction. The wrong thing is to cut nerves or subject the person to more pain. Electricity can force a nerve channel to flow or paralyze it. That is probably why it seems to work some-times. But it cures nothing and more often confirms the insane condition and certainly fills the patient with dread and terror, injures him and shortens life. ____________________ The problem in insanity is often how do you keep the patient from injuring himself or starving or dying before he can be examined by a competent medical doctor in a properly equipt clinic. This is done by rest, security, feeding, under drugs if necessary. A patient can be „built up“ by various biochemical compounds, diathermy and other mild means that add to his stamina. Treatment of what really troubles him such as continual sensation from a once broken leg which was never set, a broken spinal disc or such pathological ills as disease, can then be treated properly and corrected. Recovered from the treatment, the patient will be found not to be „insane“ any longer. Auditing can then occur, any and all engrams (traumas) erased and the person’s recov-ery will be greatly accelerated. Of course the real target of auditing is the improvement of the ability to handle life, greater intelligence, reaction time and other benefits. ____________________ Like the spiritual healer of another age who said all was mind and forbade physical healing, the practitioner who says all is body and scorns mental healing is an extremist."},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"PHYSICALLY ILL PCS AND PRE OTS 5 HCOB 12.3.69 II HSDC    789    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Each of these is at the opposite ends of „Aristotle’s Pendulum“. Each has seen with his own eyes a few remarkable cures. Thus each is confirmed in his belief and will hotly argue and even attack others who do not share his or her extreme view. The truth, as is usually found, lies in between. There is no „insanity virus“. Even heredity remains unproven since families perform similar actions, are prone to similar physical ills and they also mentally pattern or copy each other. Either physical or mental facts can similarly prove that „insanity runs in the family“ when it seems to do so. Thus „hereditary insanity“ is an apparency which gives rise to the folk tale. There is the spiritual identity of man, the mind, the thetan, call it what you will. There is the physical body of man and that, even if cellular, is still material or physical or whatever you call that. Proponents of both extreme illnesses are likely then to go off on an erratic course of search and research as the truth includes both and when you do include both you then begin to add up successes toward the desirable 100% of the physical sciences in result. One cannot call either extreme more than an art. And the proponent of the purely physical does not have a „science“ just because sciences are also physical. One has a science only when one can predict and attain uniform results by the applica-tion of its technology. It was very natural for the psychiatrist to think he had a foe in Scientology as all he had to hear was „spirit“ and he was off. Since that has been his opposite „foe“ for a long time. To heal Man one has to realize he is dealing with two things – the spirit and the body. When a preclear comes to us because he wishes to be physically cured of a real current illness or malfunction, we do not serve him well if when we see he does not respond to auditing we do not require a full physical clinical study of his body until a real illness is found and treated. If we already know he is ill we should call in the doctor. And we should limit auditing to assists. This is also a case of crossed purposes. We are trying to give him greater capability and freedom. He is only trying to stop hurting. Go ahead, sign them up. But at the first smallest clue (like the White Form) that he is being audited only to get well, we should have in good contact a medical doctor or clinic who is friendly and does not do unusual things to people and get the preclear diagnosed to really find what is wrong with him, get it cured if it is medically feasible and then, with a physically well pc, give him his auditing. If this is done routinely, another benefit will also occur.

The ability of the body to get well often asserts itself when a preclear is given auditing, since the source of perpetuation (continuance) is re-moved from the illness and it changes. Letting a pc, who has a badly set continually painful bone go on up the grades is doing him a disservice. He probably will not attain or retain his gains. ____________________ The stable datum on which I operate as a case supervisor is that if a pc does not get good gains quickly I want to know (and will find) what is physically injured or ill about him before I go on letting him be audited. The X-ray machine and other clinical actions become a must. For he is in suppressed pain and each time he gets a change, he puts on full stops as it started to hurt. He won’t get the same gain again and tomorrow the same process or type of process won’t work. He stops the pain if it starts to hurt and puts a new stop on his case. This is true of those cases who really have a physical illness. Slow gain, poor result is a physically ill pc. The exercise of these points requires judgement for a person can be given treatments which will not heal him. Where this is the case, and the treatment seems too damaging or un-certain, treat the pc on this routine: 1. Rest 2. No harassment 3. Food 4. Mild sedatives. When the person seems well, audit him. ____________________ The truth of the above definition of „insanity“ can be experienced easily with no great stress. To have a headache or toothache is sometimes quite distressing and distracting, making one gloomy or inactive. Taking an aspirin cheers one up and he can work. That is in fact the basic mechanism. It is why tranquilizers work. This is why old-timers thought they had to cut nerves to „cure“ the insane. But that’s like fixing the telephone exchange by throwing a hand grenade into the switchboard. You may get no more complaints but you sure don’t have a telephone any more. Which, I suppose, is the basic way to stop all complaints.

Those who then can’t be audited are in pain whether they consciously realize it or not. In their „un-conscious mind“ (below their self-suppression) they hurt. So those who can’t be audited well when taken off some drug like marijuana should be gotten to a good clinic and given „the works“.

To \"treat\" this agony with shock and \"brain operations\" is a Nuremberg type offense and is indictable as mayhem or manslaughter. The medical treatment of \"insanity\" requires sure awareness by the patient of his whereabouts and present time. These are usually quite unbearable so he has sunk into the past to escape the agony of the present. The Touch Assist given to such injured persons permits healing to occur by restoring the person to the present and his whereabouts to some degree. Healing after medical treatment might not occur rapidly if the \"insane\" or chronically ill person remains in the past, unable to confront the present. Thus the Touch Assist speeds and often permits healing after medical treatment and sometimes in minor injuries and illness permits the doctor to accomplish healing without fur-ther treatment. There is the Touch Assist, the Contact Assist and the Auditing Assist. The Touch Assist done as described elsewhere brings the patient's attention to injured or affected body areas. When attention is withdrawn from them, so is circulation, nerve flows and energy which for one thing limits nutrition to the area and for another prevents the drain of waste products. Some ancient healers attributed remarkable flows and qualities to the \"lay-ing on of hands.\" Probably the workable element in this was simply heightening awareness of the affected area and restoring the physical communication factors. The Contact Assist is remarkable when it can be done. The patient is taken to the area where the injury occurred and makes the injured member gently contact it several times. A sudden pain will fly off and the injury if minor lessens or vanishes. This is again a physical communication factor. The body member seems to have withdrawn from that exact spot in the physical universe."},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"DIANETIC ASSISTS 2 HCOB 2.04.69RA HSDC    794    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The restoration of awareness is often necessary before healing can occur. The prolongation of a chronic injury occurs in the absence of physical communication with the affected area or with the location of the spot of injury in the physical universe. The Auditing Assist is done by a trained auditor using an E-Meter. It consists of \"running out\" the physically painful experience the person has just un-dergone, accident, illness, operation or emotional shock. This erases the \"psychic trauma\" and speeds healing to a remarkable degree if done properly. In addition to assists there is Dianetic auditing of an acutely ill person which handles the current and past illnesses and injuries by erasing the \"physical trauma.\" The last is a skilled activity. Practitioners who have the idea such things do not have causes will of course fail to locate the causes. A sickness can be composed, let us say, of a headache, a nausea, apathy and weari-ness. Such a sickness may be bizarre, without medical reason. By first getting the patient to find and say what shock occurred when the sickness be-gan, getting when, and getting it recounted, the \"illness\" will lessen, the emotional state will alter – called a \"release of affect.\" By then, finding an earlier similar instance and getting that one dated and recounted a further release of affect may occur. If the good indicators, smiles, etc. do not occur in the patient, one again asks for an earlier incident, dates it and gets it recounted. Physically sick persons divide into two classes: \"acutely ill\" and \"chronically ill.\" A per-son who is acutely ill is temporarily or momentarily ill and a person who is chronically ill is simply ill all the time. You do not run heavy engram processes on an acutely ill pc. You do Touch Assists and get a Scientology auditor to deliver processes given in C/S Series 9, HCOB 21 June 1970, fourth section \"Sick Pcs,\" Tech Bulletin Volume VII, page 89. You try not to run heavy engram chains on acutely ill pus as they are physically not up to it, cannot stand sessions long enough to get anywhere with a chain and usually all that happens is, the pc feels spinny and left in a restimmed condition. You can run Touch Assists and light Objective Processes. On a chronically ill pc you can begin exactly as you would with an acutely ill pc, with the difference that when he improves you can run out the physically painful experience the person has just undergone with Narrative R3RA. After this you can proceed with regular New Era Dianetics. Needless to say all this requires a skilled auditor but the skill can be acquired in a Dianetic training course. The important thing is not to tell the patient what caused it, but to let him tell you. Otherwise the symptom suppresses."},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"DIANETIC ASSISTS 3 HCOB 2.04.69RA HSDC    795    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The approach in any of these assists is quiet, gentle, permissive, never forcing the pa-tient, speaking only the words required to do the process. The temporarily insane by reason of emotional shock, where no medical illness exists, should be permitted rest and should then be handled by an assist as above or normal Dianetic auditing. Most often, rest and no further harassment result in a return to sanity in a short time such as a few days, but not in a terror atmosphere such as a psychiatric asylum where the pa-tient is in the risk of being hurt or killed. Electric shock prolongs the condition and brain sur-gery is of course not treatment but murder as at best it deprives the person of his coordination and at worst shortens his life. The occasional and rare brain tumor is of course an exception but this is a medical not a psychiatric matter, no matter what manifestations the person exhib-its. Most medically ill people do exhibit symptoms of mental derangement at some stage of their illness. The acceleration of healing of medical illness or injury such as broken bones or the af-ter effects of delivery or operations can be accomplished by the Dianetic auditing of the re-sulting trauma soon after full medical treatment or attention. The improvement factor is about ⅓ the normal time of recovery by some thousands of test cases. Such auditing is done by a usual Dianetic procedure. In addition to the above assists there is regular Dianetic auditing which handles chronic discomforts and prevents future illness as well as improving the state of well-being of a person. The mechanisms of the mind revealed in Dianetics are of great use to the field of medicine. They are easy and quick to apply. About one month's training is all that is necessary to acquaint an otherwise educated and intelligent person with the fundamentals and skills necessary to assists. Considerably more time of course is necessary to train a skilled Scientology auditor, but this is not the subject of this paper. There is no conflict of interest between any healing profession and Dianetics. Dianetic materials and papers are fully available. There is a conflict between Dianetics and political practices such as psychiatry since electric shock, brain operations and general degradation of the person may prevent the pa-tient's recovery by Dianetics. As answers exist now for insanity there is no reason to continue medieval or Fascist solutions to the problem of the psychosomatically ill or the insane and we are doing every-thing in our power against fantastic opposition to end the torture and killing of the insane re-gardless of the politically \"desirable\" ends envisioned by some groups.

The auditor may feel that auditing did it. It didn’t. The auditing given would have to be non-standard for this to happen, but the auditing is not to blame. According to my friend Dr. Stanley Lief, over a century ago Hahnemann developed a healing technology known as homeopathy which administered minute doses of medicine. The original theory seems to have been that the disease or illness was still in the body and would be released. The person would be wildly ill again and then permanently recover. This is probably a poor statement of the whole subject of homeopathy and its basic techniques may have worked well but have been lost. In any event, the phenomenon has application here. We would say that the mental image picture of the incident was stopped at a “stuck point” and that it would “run out” of itself if it were unstabilized. A touch assist can do this. The person may become wildly ill after one and then re-cover. What apparently happens is that the chain of incidents becomes unsettled and the same incident on the chain in which the person has been stuck for a long while runs out physically. It completes itself, which is to say, it finishes its cycle of action. At a hospital where I studied, this was part of the things I observed. Medicine sometimes will not work on a patient. It works on others but not on a par-ticular one. If that particular one is given mental attention even as mild as brief Freudian analysis, it will be found that medicine will now work on the person. This formed one of the first application discoveries I made. From it I inferred that function monitors structure and proceeded to investigate mental actions and reactions in the field of illness. From this came Dianetics some years later. Mental therapy prior to 1945 was so ineffective, consisting only of 19th Century psy-choanalysis and Russian and East European psychiatry, that no one else seems to have ob-"},{"pageNumber":818,"pageContent":"SICKNESS    2    HCOB    14.5.69    HSDC    798    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE served, then or now, that “mental blocks” are able to obstruct medical treatment of a real physical nature. The proof is that when one even reduces the mental block slightly, medicines such as antibiotics or hormones will now be effective when they were previously ineffective on some patients. It is this factor which gives purely medical treatment a somewhat random appearance. The patient is “stuck” at some point in time. Even inadequate handling of him mentally (such as a touch assist or a poorly or partially done session or even a “bad” session) “unsticks” the person from the frozen or fixed “stuck” point. One of three things can now happen: 1. The person can be treated medically for his illness with greater effect. 2. The person in two or three days gets apparently sick or sicker but eventually recovers and is not subject to that exact sickness again – (it “ran out”). 3. No further result is noted. ____________________ These data are very useful to a Dianetic auditor or a medical doctor. A person can be ill and the illness not surrendering to the usual treatment. Brief mild Dianetic auditing can be done. The medicine may now work. An auditor who specializes in keying out locks at the first F/N will find occasionally that his preclear becomes ill in two or three days from some occasional but longstanding ill-ness which then “runs out” and doesn’t appear again. An auditor who gives a non-standard, very poor session may find a preclear occasion-ally becoming ill within the next three or four days. The auditor and others blame the audit-ing. Any auditing is better than no auditing. Standard Dianetics is much more powerful than old Dianetics and should only be done by auditors trained to do it exactly. Sessions which are non-standard should be corrected as soon as possible, certainly within two days or you may find the preclear beginning to go through an illness cycle. The cycle was waiting to complete itself for a long time. The auditing unsettled it. It “ran out” physically because the pc was moved in time in the incident in which he has been “stuck”. An understanding of this phenomena is necessary. It is useful data.

It is the use of locational Havingness to make a person sober. This process is not used to cure a person of alcoholism. The development of Prior As-sessment in Standard Dianetics (HCOB 19 May 1969) handles the conditions that caused a person to be alcoholic. The use of Locational Havingness will make a drunk person sober in a very few min-utes and the cause of his need for alcohol can be audited out later. As society currently has no technology for handling the drunk who is an embarrassment to the police, his family, and of-ten to himself, this process has social value and may serve as a line of co-operation and assis-tance to the police. The Locational Havingness process is simply the command „Look at that......(room object).“ Use very good TR 0. A drunk is usually considered somewhat unconfrontable and he himself certainly can-not confront. One thing he cannot confront is an empty glass. He always refills it if it is empty. Repeat the command, each time pointing out a room object, as often as required to bring the person to sobriety. Do not Q & A with the frequent comment „What object?“ Just get the command carried out, acknowledge, and give the next command. Do not ever get angry with or strike a drunk whatever the provocation. We are not particularly in the business of handling the drunk. But we are in the field of helping our fellow men. In a society where the only alternative is a night in the clink and a fine, which is not desired by either the police or the intoxicated person, we can assist both and handle the situation in a matter of minutes. The case can be fully handled later by Dianetic Auditing with excellent lasting results if the person wishes it on his own determinism. Brian Livingston CS-5 for L.

The idea that one can always get rid of an illness by auditing one chain to basic is false. Man dreams about “one-shot” cures to a point where he could be accused of being impotent! Here is an example: A preclear “has always wanted to get his bronchitis handled”. In Dianetics a list is made for chest or lung pains or sensations. One is chosen and erased. The “bronchitis” is now better or even absent for a few days. Then we have the preclear back again saying “It didn’t cure my bronchitis”. Enough cases are handled successfully by running one chain on a somatic that people get stuck in the win. Here is another example: The pc says he has migraine headaches. The auditor assesses a “head pain” quite correctly and then runs out one chain. The migraine does not occur for a week after. Then here’s the pc again saying “I’ve still got a headache”. All this is invalidative of the tech and the auditing. A Registrar or Public Division hear-ing this tends to lose faith in the powers of the tech. The fact is that the illness was not properly handled or C/Sed or audited. In the first place a pc trying to get cured of bronchitis or migraine – or any one of a dozen other illnesses – should be sent for a medical examination. How do you know the bron-chitis isn’t tuberculosis? Or the migraine headache isn’t a fractured skull? A “continual side pain” may be a gallstone. In short, something which continually hurts or disables may be structural or physical. So, when you omit the first action (medical) in handling an illness, you set up an auditor for a possible failure. Many of these things can be cured medically without too much heroic action. If it is medical and can be cured medically, then it should be."},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"DIANETICS AND ILLNESS 2 HCOB 19.7.69 HSDC    804    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Also it should be audited. This lets the medical treatment work. Many “incurable” ill-nesses become curable medically when they are also audited. The second thing that gets overlooked is that an illness is a composite (composed of many) somatic. The correct auditing action on “bronchitis” or “chest trouble” or “migraine headache” or any other continual worrisome illness is to continue to find somatics, sensations, feelings, emotions or even attitudes in the area affected and run their chains. It takes more than one chain of engrams to build up an ill area. Having found and run the “deflated feeling” of bronchitis, which was the first best read, the C/S should order and the auditor find and run the next somatic, sensation, feeling, emo-tion or attitude in that area. It is sometimes necessary to add to the list for that area of the body. Seeing a continual or recurring illness on the Health Form the C/S and auditor should dig out of that area every somatic, sensation, feeling, emotion and attitude that can be made to read and run those chains, each one to basic and erasure. That is the way you handle any illness, whether continual or temporary. The maxim is that it takes more than one chain of engrams to make a body ill. Continual reassessing and adding to general lists will get there eventually providing it is done long enough. But this general approach will find a certain number of pcs saying to Reg-istrars, Public Officers and friends, “I’ve still got my ________”. It is in fact a false report. They didn’t still have all of it. It is one chain less and therefore better. But auditing gives gains by deletion. A pc does not suffer from what has been erased. He suffers only from that which has not yet been handled. Some persons tried years ago to get their trouble handled, somebody or some practice failed and after that they don’t mention it at all. They don’t support the technology anymore either. So, in handling illness, give the handling of the structural disease side of it to the medi-cal doctor, and thoroughly handle all the mental side of it with auditing and everyone wins. Any Registrar or Public Division personnel colliding with “My lumbosis was not han-dled” should call this HCOB to the attention of the person, the Case Supervisor and the audi-tors.

Very often antibiotics do not function unless the illness or injury is also audited. The basic failures of antibiotics apparently stem from a traumatic condition which prevents the medical treatment from functioning. When a person is medically treated for an illness, it is best to back up the action with auditing. Sometimes the patient is too ill to be fully audited. It is difficult to audit someone who is running a temperature. In such a case, let the antibiotics bring the temperature down before auditing. But if the temperature does not come down, in the interest of the patient’s recovery, auditing should be done. It is usually too late when the patient is in a coma. But one can still reach a patient who is unconscious by touching the patient’s hand to parts of the bed with “Feel that (ob-ject)”. A patient will sometimes respond to commands even when “unconscious” if you tell them to squeeze your hand to acknowledge they have done the command. Years ago the auditing of unconscious persons was worked out and successfully done. Needless to say, auditing any sick person requires the most exact, careful auditing, strictly by the Auditor’s Code. POSTOPERATIVE AUDITING A person who has been operated on or medically or dentally treated or a mother who has just delivered a child should have the engram audited out as soon as possible by Dianetic R3R.

Heavy doses of vitamin B1, B complex and C should accompany all such auditing actions. __________________ SAVING LIVES All this comes under the heading of saving lives. At the very least it saves slow recovery and bad after-effects and resultant psychoso-matic illnesses. Dianetics is the first development since the days of Rome that changes and improves the rate of healing. Dianetics is also the first development that removes traumatic barriers from the path of healing. Medicines and endocrine compounds quite often are effective in the presence of Dianetic auditing which were once inexplicably ineffective in many cases. The barrier to healing was the engram. With that removed, healing can occur. OBJECTIONS TO USE Any barriers or objections to using Dianetics to assist the effectiveness of medicine or to increase the rate of or even secure effective recovery place the patient at risk as certainly as failing to use antiseptics. Such objections can be dismissed as stemming from barbaric or superstitious mentali-ties or from motives too base to be decent. It would not be possible to count the number of lives Dianetics saved in the 19 years even before the advent of Standard Dianetics. Few human betterment activities have been so widely successful and so uniformly helpful as Dianetics.  L.

Ron Hubbard. Edited and reissued for use on the HQS Co-Audit.) ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY Definition: An Assist: An action undertaken by a minister to assist the spirit to confront physical difficulties. An assist is not normally done in a formal session. The way the term has been used is a very simple activity to relieve an immediate troublesome difficulty. An assist is much more specifically and definitely anything which is done to alleviate a present-time discomfort. An assist could happen almost anywhere. At the beginning of a session, no matter how formally this session is constituted, you are running an assist. You have an auditing room. You have a preclear, and you are the auditor. You know all these things, but the preclear doesn’t. Don’t call it a formal session. Tell the preclear that it is an assist and that you are not intending anything very strenuous. In rendering an assist you should tell the preclear that „this is just an assist“ to try and ease the pain in his hand a little, after which you are going to stop. The handling of an assist as an auditor is different than the handling of a formal sessi-on since the factor of control is notably slackened, sometimes almost completely missing. One of the factors in assists is that an assist has as a large part of its anatomy, „trying to help“. Just remember that you are only trying to help and don’t get your heart broken by the fact that the fellow’s broken spine doesn’t heal instantly. Another factor is that an assist is differentiated and defined as addressing the game someone knows he is playing. What techniques would comprise an assist? Anything that would help. And what are these? One of the easiest ones to render is Locational Processing. You tell the person, „Look at that chair. Look at that ceiling. Look at that floor. Look at that hand“ (the auditor pointing to the objects), when he has an injured hand and the pain will diminish. This is a very easy assist. For example, a person has a bad shoulder. You touch his hand of the same arm and say, „Close your eyes and look at my fingers.’’ Make sure that he keeps his eyes closed. You then touch him on the elbow and say, „Look at my fingers.’’ Do this anywhere on his body."},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY 2 HCOB 21.10.71 HSDC    816    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Just touch him and say, „Look at my fingers.“ This is a communication process which eases his attention over from a concentration upon the injury to something else which is quite near the injury and thus doesn’t result in too much of a shock. It reduces havingness but it is posi-tive and gets positive results. It can be done by an untrained person. You can teach this assist to anybody. You say, „If somebody has a bruise, injury, a burn, a cut, the way to handle this is to tell the person to close his eyes, and then you touch the area near and distant from the vicinity of the injured area, asking them, with their eyes closed, to look at your fingers. You contact them this way many times. They will experience sudden pains in the area, and you will discover that the ‘psychic trauma’ has been dischar-ged.“ You will find that most people do not have any upset about physical contact. Most people think that this is the thing to do. Say you wanted to render an assist on somebody who had a very indefinite difficulty. That is the hardest one to render an assist on. The person has a pain but he cannot say where. He doesn’t know what has happened to him. He just feels bad. Use Locational Processing as such. You will find out that this process will work when other processes fail. An assist carries with it a certain responsibility. If you give an assist casually to some-body out in the public and do not shove a calling card in his pocket, you are making an error. The reason for this is that he will not know from whom and where help came. An auditor goes through life and he casts his shadow upon many people and they have really no cognizance of what has happened at all if he is rendering an assist. He says, „Do this, do that“ – maybe he wins, or maybe he loses because this is the type of session least calculated to procure orderly results. But in the main these people have been helped. They don’t know really by what, ex-cept some word that the auditor kept saying. They don’t even know that he is an auditor. They don’t know anything about it at all. Show a person where he can obtain further assistance, and by whom the assistance was given. Be yourself. Be positive. Be professional and definite. Have a calling card and make sure the card is easily enough understood. Don’t ask them for permission. Just do it. No rea-son to wander around and give them funny notions. If you are going to help some stranger out, help him out. Don’t explain to him or any bystander, otherwise you are likely to stand there explaining, waiting for somebody’s permission. Don’t bother with that. You act as though you are the one in charge and you will be in charge. And this is part and parcel of the knowledge of how to do an assist. You have got to be the person in charge. This has to be so good, as far as you are concerned, that you overcome the informality of the session to a very marked degree. If you do it extremely well, the assist will amount to auditing. Say, for example, there is a big accident and a crowd of people are pressing around. The police are trying to push the people back. Well, push the people back and then push the policeman back. Say, „Officer, keep these people at a distance.“ Then you lean over the vic-tim and snap him back to rights. If you are enough there, everybody else will realize that you are the one that is there. Therefore, such things as panic, worry, wonder, upset, looking dreamily into the far distance, wondering what is wrong or what should be done, are no part of your make-up if you are rendering an assist. Cool, calm and collected should be the keyno-"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY 3 HCOB 21.10.71 HSDC    817    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE te of your attitude. Realize that to take control of any given situation it is only necessary to be there more than anybody else. There is no necromancy (magic; conjuration of the spirits of the dead in order to predict the future) involved. Just BE there. The others aren’t. And if you are there enough, then somebody else will pull himself out of it and go on living. Understand that an auditor when rendering an assist must make up with presence what he lacks in surroundings and agreements. It all comes under the heading of willingness to be there and willingness to control people. One of the ways of convincing people of beingness and of being there is to exercise control – positive, undeniable Tone 40 exercise of control. Start to control the situation with high enough ARC, enough presence and factuality – there won’t be anybody present that won’t step back and let you control the situation. You are entitled to it in the first place be-cause of senior „know-how“. The control of body attention or thought comprises the majority of your knowledge. The majority in Scientology simply points in this direction. The obser-vable thing is control of attention, objects and thoughts. When you have good confidence of being able to handle these, and when you positively know how to do these, then you can make sure that everybody else knows you can do this, and you make them realize this by doing it. You have all of these things available in rendering an assist. You might never think of a riot as being a situation which necessitated an assist, or an assist as applicable to a riot, but a riot is simply a psychosomatic momentary injury or trauma-tic condition on the third dynamic. Could you settle a riot? Well, if you can settle a riot, you can certainly settle one person who is in a riot. The antithesis of any pain, disturbance or tumult is order. The thing which controls tumult is order; and, conversely, the thing which controls order is tumult. You need only bring order into a confu-sed situation and bring confusion into an orderly situation to control everything in the field of motion, action and objects. This is a fantastic simplicity and one which takes some grasping. Conceive as order, merely a fixed position, idea and attitude. A policeman knows what he is supposed to do. Maybe he will put on a tourniquet or maybe he won’t. Keep the people away and stop eve-rything is his idea of how it should be. Now you can aid or abet the order he is creating, or cancel the order by creating a confusion which he cannot handle. Of the two, the first is the best in that situation. You aid and abet and cap the order he is creating. If you were to accuse him of having a confused accident scene, which is by now not at all confused, and ask him to straighten it out, you would channel his attention in the direction it is already gone, and so you control his attention. Remember, those people are still moving a little bit; they are still breathing. There is still a tiny bit of motion going on. If you were to ask him something on the order of „Can’t we have it a little quieter and more orderly here?“, he would at once perceive that there was far too much confusion and motion, and he would simply come under your direction because you have simply channeled his attention in the direction it was already going. Therefore, you have taken control. If you ever want to overset a fixed order, create a confusion. If you want to overset a confusion, create a fixed order. Pick out of the scene those beings in the scene whose attenti-"},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY 4 HCOB 21.10.71 HSDC    818    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE on is channeled in the direction you want attention to go, and you aid and abet that attention which already exists. Or, where you have too many fixed positions and fixed ideas to over-come, you simply take those turbulent individuals in the scene who are creating the confusion against those fixed ideas and channels and you make their confusion much more confused, at the same time yourself imposing another order in another direction. The mechanics of taking over any confused scene are simply the mechanics of trying to get a preclear to see through the morass of cross purposes, commands, ideas, and environ-ments in which he has lived. And whether that applies to the third dynamic or otherwise, the laws are still there and it tells you then that the imposition of order on a preclear comes fore-most in an assist. In an assist you always count on the fact that the thetan himself would, if he could, do the right thing. If you work on that postulate you will never be wrong. Get the idea that it is something else trying to do the wrong thing. The keynote of a thetan is order. Where you are giving an assist to one person, you put things in the environment into an orderly state as the first step, unless you are trying to stop a pumping artery – but here you would use First Aid. You should understand that First Aid always precedes an assist. You should look the situation over from the standpoint of how much First Aid is required. Maybe you will find somebody with a temperature of 106 degrees. It may very well be that he needs to lie down and be covered up, and though antibiotics are much overrated, he might be better off with a shot of one of these than with an assist at that time. Auditing will not shut off a pumping artery, but a tourniquet will. If you are going into the zone of accidents, you are going to be in the vicinity of a great deal of destruction and chaos, and you are very foolish not to have your Red Cross First Aid Certificate. You may often have to find some method of controlling, handling and directing personnel who get in your way before you can render an assist. You might just as well realize that an assist requires that you control the entire environment and personnel associated with the assist if necessary. An assist is auditing on several dynamics. It is, therefore, much harder to do than audi-ting in a formal room as it requires presence. You must bring yourself to face the fact that you have to give enough presence and enough control to enough dynamics to bring the environ-ment into a compliance with your postulate. If you postulate that somebody is going to pick up his bed and walk, then you have to be willing to move and be ca-pable of moving around the people who are going to watch him pick up his bed and walk. A good example of an assist would be when somebody is washing dishes in the kit-chen. There is a horrendous crash and the person comes down all over the sink, hits the floor and as she is going down, she grabs the butcher knife as it falls. You go in and say, „Well, let me fix that up.“ One of the first things you would have to do is to wind some bandage around the hand to stop the bleeding. Part of the First Aid would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the sink, sweep the pieces together into a more orderly semblance. This is the first symptom of control. She becomes introverted into the cut to the point that she wouldn’t particularly notice what you were doing. But you relieve the anxiety that all her blood is pou-ring out; your first attention to the case is attention to the environment."},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY 5 HCOB 21.10.71 HSDC    819    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Next you would make her sit down. To remove her from the scene of the accident is not as desirable as auditing her there. That is directly contrary, perhaps, to what you believe, but it is true. That is why you bring a little order into the environment. You position her and then you are ready for techniques. It is quite remarkable for you have manifested order in a much wider sphere than a cut hand in order to bring about a healing of the cut hand. If you understand that your responsibility always extends much wider than the immediate zone of commotion, you never miss. If you bring order to the wider environment you also bring it to the narrower environment. If you bring it into the narrow environment, you also bring it to the wider environment. It is a gradient scale of how much order you can bring. In processing, you have to control or direct attention, objects, person, or thoughts of the injured person. If you are really good on the subject of assists, you will direct an additio-nal thing: his knowingness. You can control a man’s knowingness rather easily, but it is hard to see it. About the first thing that you can observe about somebody is his person. You are trying to straighten it out. Don’t think even though you have this person sitting down that you have straightened it out, because it is still messed up. But there is something that you can straighten out easily – and that is his attention. If you could heighten his attention and his knowingness at the same time, you would really be in wonderful circumstances. You always shift and direct his attention, hence Locational Processing. Because he is injured you are not going to move his person around. You have got his attention. Don’t try to shift his thoughts around at first because they are dispersed and chaotic. This leaves you his attention only. If someone is in terrible condition and he is really writhing around, and you want to render an assist, you don’t wait until he stops writhing. He is liable to stop writhing dead. What you do with him is to direct his attention. You tell him to „Shut your eyes and look at my fingers. „ You press your fingers hard enough so that he can’t help but put his attention on them. In this wise you can always have a successful assist, because assists all come under the heading of control. The beingness of the person and his presence makes the control possible. So part of control is always presence, identity, person, the one who takes charge and has things under control. When you are able to control his attention, his body and thoughts, then he will be in session and you are no longer doing an assist. Assists dominantly require that you direct the attention of the preclear and dispose his person one way or the other and eventually take over control of his thoughts on the subject. But by the time you have all these three in line, you are no longer doing an assist. So what you really do is do an assist up to the time the person can handle the incident or pain, put him in a more favorable environment and give him auditing. So the assist is what you do on the street, and auditing is what you do in the auditing room when he comes to you after your assist has been successful. L.

In a Contact Assist you take the person to the exact spot where the accident occurred. Then have him duplicate exactly what happened at the time of the incident. For instance, if he hit his head on a pipe, have him go through the action of putting his head against the exact spot on the pipe, having the pipe also touch the exact spot on his head. He should be duplicating the whole thing. That is, the rest of his body should be in the posi-tion it was at the time of the accident. If the object is hot, you let it cool first, if current was on you turn it off before doing the Assist. If he had a tool in his hand, or was using one, he should be going through the same motions with it. Have the person repeat this several times, until the somatic occurs again. It will occur and blow off when he exactly duplicates it. Ask him how it's going; has the somatic occurred. End when you get this phenomena of it turning on and blowing off. The full End Phenomena is Pain Gone and Cognition. If the spot is not available, you do a Touch Assist. This is run on both sides of the body. It is run until the somatic turns on and then blows. It is run around the injury and especially below the injury, i.e., further from the head than the injury. It is a good idea to have the person shut his eyes so that he is definitely looking \"through\" the area of the injury in order to tell that you are touching him. Just use a simple command like \"Feel my finger. Thank you.\" Before or after the Assist, depending on the seriousness of the injury, report the injury to the Medical Officer. Report also the Assist, length of time, somatics, nature of the injury, how it was run and on whom, in writing. Following the session the pc should be taken to the Examiner.

Many were written by others than myself. Accordingly, to correct certain outnesses and get real results every time, I gave a correct demonstration to the Medical Officers at Flag. They were also told by someone else it needed a Case Supervisor clearance and by another that it had to be known by a Class IV Au-ditor. Both of these data were false and were cancelled. Being alerted now that students learning it do it all over a doll with no idea of balance, I wish to make sure the correct data is known so this tech, very powerful when correctly done, is better understood as to exact use. I know no better way of giving the real scene than publishing these correct notes by one of the Medical Officers who took notes during the demonstration. Talk by LRH to Flag Medical Officers on Touch Assists, with Demonstration On assists when you are speaking with medicos you talk to them in terms of restoring comm in blood and nerve channels. I’ve recently observed nobody does a correct touch assist. Hence I want to show you how to get real results. Normal errors in a touch assist are: (1) Don’t go to extremities, (2) Don’t equal balan-ce to both sides, (3) Don’t carry through (they go to release point only), (4) Don’t repeat on following days if needed. A guy stubs a toe, the other toe is where it is locked up. There is a balance of the nerve energy of the body on 12 nerve channels going up and down the spine. The type of energy in the body travels at 10 ft a second. The energy from a shock will make a standing wave in the body. The brain is a shock cushion, that is all. It absorbs the shock from a large amount of energy. The neuron-synapse is a disconnection. A wave one way will have a wave reacting the other way. In the sympathetic system the wave locks up on both sides of the body. So do assist thoroughly on both sides. Get both"},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"TOUCH ASSISTS, CORRECT ONES 2 BTB 7.4.72R HSDC    824    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE sides and unlock standing wave. The purpose of a touch assist is to unlock the standing waves that are small electronic ridges of nervous energy that is not flowing as it should. You can unlock an impulse in the leg and it can get into spine and lock up. So this is where you get the Chiropractor fixing people. But the nerves are “telling the muscles” to hold the bone out of place. A shock puts, via the nerves, a permanent command into a set of muscles, all different “commands” going out from the shock. The system functions through stops to try to hold that shock back. It’s actually nerve to muscle to bone. Light massage along nerve channels will get muscles unlocked to permit bone to go in place. You unlock nerve channels. The trick is standing waves. The wave is slowed down as it goes through body, like at each joint. There are brain cells at each joint absorbing the shock. Inertia – when enough heavy charge goes through a nerve it stops passing the charge through and just builds it up. A touch assist will bring the flow back and the suspended pain, cold, electrical charges and muscle command will blow through. Shock impulse goes tearing down nerve in huge volume, all accumulating nodules of standing waves all over body, trying to stop the nerve impulse. The nerve goes into apathy with the huge volume of impulse. Like 100,000 volts of electricity over a small wire, so-mething goes. With auditing you are bringing back the nerve “from apathy” up through the tone sca-le. Like getting apathy of nerve up through the pain explosion. So the touch assist is short sessioned and always balanced. At first you might just get an awareness of the area, then maybe after the 3rd or 4th as-sist (third or fourth day or many more days with one done each day) there is a large jolt that will go through. The comm cycle is not as important in the touch assist as it is with thetan auditing. But it must be present. Here we are dealing with the body. You do give the command, get an ans-wer from the patient and acknowledge each time. THE ASSIST DEMO DONE ON ARTHUR HUBBARD (Arthur had a wound on his right foot right side at ball of foot location, wound not healing quickly.) You want to get the guy where he is available. (Arthur was sitting on chair with legs straight and feet on LRH’s knees [one foot on each knee], and Arthur’s hands palms down on his shins. Arthur was comfortable – LRH asked about his comfort.) The target of all this touch assist is the pain in the wound in the side of the foot. The extremity is the top end of the big toe. Both hands and especially finger tip are also extremi-ties. It’s a sympathetic system."},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"TOUCH ASSISTS, CORRECT ONES 3 BTB 7.4.72R HSDC    825    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE On the assist you must go to corresponding extremities. (R factor) I’m going to touch you like this (LRH touched Arthur’s foot). When you feel it well tell me, okay? Okay. Feel my finger. Yes (Arthur). Good (LRH). This was done rapidly alternating from one side of body to other, one command and answer and ack for each touch; assist done on each toe back and forth left to right, one for one touch on one side, touch on other side. Up foot, each toe, over to hands, left hand to right hand, one touch for one. This was done for several minutes. LRH then had Arthur bend over to get to the spine. Arthur said he had some numbness in the lower spine when LRH asked about this area. LRH then did the spine touching 3 inches from spine on one side then to three inches on the other side alternately, up the head and around the neck and head. LRH asked, “How’s that?” Arthur said, “Better,” gave cognition on pants being same ones he had on during accident, and LRH ended off. SPINE Arthur during assist had numbness in kidney back area. This is the midpoint between the extremities on the sympathetic system. In the future if the assist hadn’t been done he might have had kidney trouble. The impulse locks up in the spine, so you have to do the spine too to release that char-ge. EXTREMITY The extremity is beyond the point of the body injury. Really handling the extremity furthest from the injury, the legs, would strip the blocked energy out (if you get the extremi-ty). (During the assist LRH did not do the legs, or arms, only toes, feet, hands, fingers and back.) “The way you run the touch assist is give the command  then touch. “Do not touch and then give the command as it’s backwards. “This requires a drill ‘Feel my finger.’ Then touch a point” LRH "},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"TOUCH ASSISTS, CORRECT ONES 4 BTB 7.4.72R HSDC    826    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE SCHOOLS OF HEALING The thing that’s wrong with each school of healing is that it says it can do the job to-tally. It can’t. An example of this is a Swedish masseur saying he can cure a person. But in addition to massage, let us say, the person doesn’t eat. It’s not part of the cure, so doesn’t cu-re. The doctor’s bug is diagnosis. He is even setting up a computer system in the country to figure out what is with the person. But they don’t have logic or the Data Series to program from so they won’t make it. There is a big hole in Adele Davis’s book on dieting. She doesn’t talk enough about iodine on diets, but that is what activates thyroid which burns up the food. So her reducing diets don’t always reduce. If you block out the fields of knowledge you won’t get anywhere. To cure things a doctor should use a number of things (schools of healing) and do each one right. Regard body with a question mark in your mind. There is a “brain” at each joint. This is why acupuncture works. One can paralyze a whole body area with it by touching these minor “brains” with a needle. It can do other things as well if you know how. MESMERISM Mesmerism is no relation to hypnotism at all. Mesmerism is animal magnetism. It’s a physiological rapport. Not a concentration on mental but on mental-physiological. To have rapport with something you can be it. Hypnotism is the reduction and absorption of mental power of the person. In hypno-tism one takes over the person. The subject has no control. When doing physical healing, if you stroke sympathetically (both sides) alternately in-ducing a rhythmic motion which is monotonous, you can mesmerize a person. In Mesmerism there is an imposition on feeling. If you mesmerize a person and pinch your back, he will get red in the same place and feel the pain of the pinch. This is physiologi-cal rapport. No words are said during mesmerism. In assists you don’t want rapport; avoid a rhythm; on stroking in massages keep per-son talking; keep him saying Yes and you acking in an assist. Keep him in comm with you. That is why you use the comm cycle, or else all feeling can go out of the body. The comm cycle prevents a mesmeric trance occurring that would leave the patient in rapport. Rapport is mutual feelingness. In an assist (1) Keep talking, (2) Break rhythms, (3) End off.

The following method has been found to work successfully with no uncomfortable af-ter-effects. INTERVERTEBRAL DISK Between each two bones of the spinal column there is a soft cushion called the in-tervertebral disk. It serves as a ball bearing and shock absorber. SITUATION Sudden shock such as a fall, a jerk of the body or the lifting of a heavy object with the strain on the back may cause the intervertebral disk to be pinched or pushed out of place. Symptoms of this may be pain, dull or sharp, directly on the spinal column or along any of the connecting muscles of the back. A numbness or \"buzzing\" sensation may be ex-perienced on the backside below the small of the back. The slipped or pinched disk may not always be detected by running the fingers along the spinal column, but can be detected by lightly running the hand or fingers along either side of the spinal column. The reason for this is that the disk itself is very small and may not be felt, but the muscles and ligaments connected to the spine will have strain on them and may be cramped or knotted. This is the reason there may be pain along these muscles and not di-rectly on the spinal column. This can be easily felt with the lightest of touches along either side of the spine."},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"SPINAL ASSIST 2 BTB 22.07.70 HSDC    830    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE METHOD TO HANDLE Have the injured person recline on a flat surface. Give him a standard touch assist, with his agreement. Afterwards, also with his agreement, check to see if there is a pinched or slipped disk. It will more than likely be detected by the presence of a \"swollen\" muscle or knot on either side of a particular section of the spinal column. Relax the muscle. Use a light, circular motion alternated with a sliding motion to-wards the spinal column. This is the most important action. It is the muscle that is physically holding the disk out of place. It is usually during the action of relaxing the muscle that the disk slides back into place. As the muscle loosens up, you will be able to feel the disk which is out of place. If it has not slipped into place with the above action, you may gently slide it sideways into place. It will go easily, without a \"snap,\" and the person will feel instant relief. Note: When there is no improvement by gentle treatment properly done as above, have the spine x-rayed as it may be fractured and in need of medical setting.

C/ears, OTs and Dianetic Clears are no longer run on Dianetic auditing assists, sec-ondaries, engrams or narrative incidents. They may however receive Touch Assists and Contact Assists, etc. If further handling is required a New Era Dianetics Special Rundown for OTs has been developed which is available at AOs and Flag. (REF: BTB 17 SEP 78 BREAKTHROUGH AND HCOB 12 SEP 78 DIANETICS FORBIDDEN ON CLEARS AND OTS.) New Era Dianetics assists may be done, as usual, whenever needed by preclears. Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed, and where treat-ment is routinely successful, medical treatment should be obtained. As an assist can at times cover up an actual injury or broken bone, no chances should be taken, especially if the condi-tion does not easily respond. In other words where something is merely thought to be a slight sprain, to be on the safe side an X-ray should be obtained, particularly if it does not at once respond. An assist is not a substitute for medical treatment but is complementary to it. It is even doubtful if full healing can be accomplished by medical treatment alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds recovery. In short, one should realize that physical healing does not take into account the being and the repercussion on the spiritual beingness of the person. Injury and illness are predisposed by the spiritual state of the person. They are pre-cipitated by the being himself as a manifestation of his current spiritual condition. And they are prolonged by any failure to fully handle the spiritual factors associated with them. The causes of predisposition, precipitation and prolongation are basically the fol-lowing: 1. Postulates. 2. Engrams. 3. Secondaries. 4. ARC breaks with the environment, situations, others or the body part. 5. Problems. 6. Overt acts. 7. Withholds. 8. Out of communicationness. The purely physical facts of injuries, illnesses and stresses are themselves incapacitat-ing and do themselves often require physical analysis and treatment by a doctor or nutrition-ist. These could be briefly catalogued as: A. Physical damage to structure. B. Disease of a pathological nature. C. Inadequacies of structure. D. Excessive structure. E. Nutritional errors."},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":" HSDC    833    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE F. Nutritional inadequacies. G. Vitamin and bio-compound excesses. H. Vitamin and bio-compound deficiencies. I. Mineral excesses. J. Mineral deficiencies. K. Structural malfunction. L. Erroneous examination. M. Erroneous diagnosis. N. Erroneous structural treatment. O. Erroneous medication. There is another group which belongs to both the spiritual and physical divisions. These are: i. Allergies ii. Addictions iii. Habits iv. Neglect v. Decay. Any of these things in any of the three groups can be a cause of non-optimum personal existence. We are not discussing here the full handling of any of these groups or what optimum state can be attained or maintained. But it should be obvious that there is a level below which life is not very tolerable. How well a person can be or how efficient or how active is another subject entirely. Certainly life is not very tolerable to a person who has been injured or ill, to a woman who has just delivered a baby, to a person who has just suffered a heavy emotional shock. And there is no reason a person should remain in such a low state, particularly for weeks, months or years when he or she could be remarkably assisted to recover in hours, days or weeks. It is in fact a sort of practiced cruelty to insist by neglect that a person continue on in such a state when one can learn and practice and obtain relief for such a person. We are mainly concerned with the first group, 1-8. The group is not listed in the order that it is done but in the order that it has influence upon the being. The idea has grown that one handles injuries with Touch Assists only. This is true for someone who as an auditor has only a smattering of Scientology. It is true for someone in such pain or state of case (which would have to be pretty bad) that he cannot respond to actual auditing."},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":" HSDC    834    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE But a Scientologist really has no business \"having only a smattering\" of auditing skills that could save his or the lives of others. And the case is very rare who cannot experience proper auditing. The actual cause of not handling such conditions is, then, to be found as iv. neglect. And where there is neglect, v. decay is very likely to follow. One does not have to be a medical doctor to take someone to a medical doctor. And one does not have to be a medical doctor to observe that medical treatment may not be help-ing the patient. And one does not have to be a medical doctor to handle things caused spiritu-ally by the being himself. Just as there are two sides to healing – the spiritual and the structural or physical, there are also two states that can be spiritually attained. The first of these states might be classified as \"humanly tolerable.\" Assists come under this heading. The second is spiritually improved. Grade auditing comes under this second heading. Any minister (and this has been true as long as there has been a subject called religion) is bound to relieve his fellow being of anguish. There are many ways a minister can do this. An assist is not engaging in healing. It is certainly not engaging in treatment. What it is doing is assisting the individual to heal himself or be healed by another agency by re-moving his reasons for precipitating, and prolonging his condition and lessening his predisposition to further injure himself or remain in an intolerable condition. This is entirely outside the field of \"healing\" as envisioned by the medical doctor and by actual records of results is very, very far beyond the capability of psychology, psychiatry and \"mental treatment\" as practiced by them. In short, the assist is strictly and entirely in the field of the spirit and is the traditional province of religion. A minister should realize the power which lies in his hands and his potential skills when trained. He has this to give in the presence of suffering: he can make life tolerable. He can also shorten a term of recovery and may even make recovery possible when it might not be otherwise. When a minister confronts someone who has been injured or ill, operated upon or who has suffered a grave emotional shock, he should be equipped to do and should do the follow-ing: A Contact Assist where possible and where indicated until the person has reestab-lished his communication with the physical universe site. To F/N. A Touch Assist until the person has reestablished communication with the physical part or parts affected. To F/N. Handle any ARC Break that might have existed at the time a) with the environment, b) with another, c) with others, d) with himself, e) with the body part or the body, and f) with any failure to recover at once.

Preassess the Incident and take to full Dianetic EP all somatics connected with the incident in which the pc is interested. The full preassessment procedure is given in HCOB 18 JUNE 78R, NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 4R, ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO GET THE ITEM and the above issues. Postulate Two-Way Comm. This is two-way comm on the subject of \"any decision to be hurt\" or some such wording. This is done only if the person has not already discovered that he had decisions connected to the incident. It is carried to F/N. One must be careful not to invalidate the person. Where a person is injured, given a Contact or Touch Assist and then medical examina-tion and treatment, he is given the remainder as soon as he is able to be audited. The drug \"five days\" does not need to apply. But where the person has been given an assist over drugs, one must later come back to the case when he is off drugs and run the drug part out or at least make sure that nothing was submerged by the drugs. It is not uncommon for a person to be oblivious of certain parts of a treatment or operation at the time of initial auditing, only to have a missing piece of the incident pop up days, months or even years later. THIS is the rea-son injuries or operations occasionally seem to persist despite a full assist: a piece of it was left unhandled due to a drugged condition during the operation; such bits may come off unex-pectedly in routine auditing on some other apparently disrelated chain. (REF: HCOB 27 JUNE 78RA, NEW ERA DIANETICS SERIES 9R, DRUG HANDLING AND HCOB 19 MAY 69RA, DRUG AND ALCOHOL CASES, PRIOR ASSESSING.) It can happen that a person is in the midst of some grade auditing at the time of an in-jury or illness or receiving an emotional shock. The question arises as to whether or not to"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":" HSDC    836    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE disrupt the grade auditing to handle the situation. It is a difficult question. But certainly the person cannot go on with grade auditing while upset or ill. The usual answer is to give a full assist and repair the ease to bridge it back into the grade auditing. The question however may be complicated in that some error in the grade auditing is also sitting there, not to cause the illness or accident but to complicate the assist. This question is handled fully only by study of the case by a competent Case Supervisor. The point is not to let the person go on suffering while time is consumed making a decision. Prior Confusion: Fixed ideas follow a period of confusion. This is also true of en-grams that hang up as physical injury. Slow recovery after an engram has been run can be caused by the prior confusion mechanism. The engram of accident or injury can be a stable item in a confusion. By 2-way comm see if a confusion existed prior to the accident, injury or illness. If so, it may be 2WCed earlier similar to F/N. Mystery Point: Often there is some part of an incident which is mysterious to a pre-clear. The engram itself may hang up on a mystery. A thetan could be called a \"mystery sandwich\" in that he tends to stick in on mysteries. 2WC any mysterious aspect of the inci-dent. 2WC it earlier similar to F/N cog VGIs. Suppressive Presence: Mistakes or accidents or injuries occur in the presence of sup-pression. One wants to know if any such suppressive influence or factor existed just prior to the incident being handled. This could be the area it occurred in or persons the preclear had just spoken to. 2WC any suppressive or invalidative presence that may have caused a mistake to be made or the accident to occur. 2WC E/S to F/N cog VGIs. Agreement: Get any agreement the person may have had in or with the incident. There is usually a point where the person agrees with some part of the scene. If this point is found it will tend to unpin the pc from going on agreeing to be sick or injured. Protest: 2WC any protest in the incident. Prediction: The person is usually concerned about his recovery. Undue worry about it can extend the effects into the future. 2WC (a) how long he/she expects to take to recover. (b) Get the person to tell you any predictions others have made about it. 2WC it to an F/N cog VGIs. Note – avoid getting the person to predict it as a very long time by getting him to talk about that further. Losses: A person who has just experienced a loss may become ill. This is particularly true of colds. 2WC anything the pc may have lost to F/N. Present Time: An injured or sick person is out of present time. Thus running Hav-ingness in every assist session is vital. This not only remedies havingness but also brings the preclear to present time. High or Lo Ta: A C/S 53 RL should be used to get the TA under control during as-sists if it cannot be gotten down. It must be done by an auditor who knows how to meter and can get reads. Illness Following Auditing: It can occur that a pc gets ill after being audited where the \"auditing\" is out tech. When this occurs or is suspected, a Green Form should be assessed"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":" HSDC    837    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE only by an auditor who can meter and whose TR 1 gets reads. The GF reads are then handled. Out interiorization, bad lists, missed W/Hs, ARC breaks and incomplete or flubbed engrams are the commonest errors. Before-After: Where an injured or ill pc is so stuck that he has a fixed picture that does not move, one can jar it loose by asking him to recall a time before the incident and then asking him to recall a time after it. This will \"jar the engram loose\" and change the stuck point. Unconsciousness: A pc can be audited even if in a coma. The processes are objective, not significance processes. One process is to use his hand to reach and withdraw from an ob-ject such as a pillow or blanket. One makes the hand do it while giving the commands. One can even arrange a \"signal system\" where the pc is in a coma and cannot talk by holding his hand and telling him to squeeze one's hand once for yes, twice for no. It is astonishing that the pc will often respond and he can be questioned this way. Temperature Assists: There is an HCOB, HCOB 23 Jut 71R, ASSISTS, on how to do assists that bring down the temperature. Holding objects still repetitively is the basic process. Quite often an injury or illness will miraculously clear up before one has run all the steps possible. If this is the case one should end off any further assist. All auditing of injured or ill people must be kept fairly light. Errors in TRs (such as a bad TR 4), errors in tech rebound on them very heavily. An ill or injured person can easily be audited into a mess if the processes are too heavy for him to handle and if the auditor is goof-ing. Very exact in tech, good TRs, good metering sessions are all that should be tolerated in assists. SUMMARY Religion exists in no small part to handle the upsets and anguish of life. These include spiritual duress by reason of physical conditions. Ministers long before the Apostles had as a part of their duties the ministering to the spiritual anguish of their people. They have concentrated upon spiritual uplift and betterment. But where physical suffering impeded this course, they have acted. To devote themselves only to the alleviation of physical duress is of course to attest that the physical body is more important than the spiritual beingness of the person which, of course, it is not. But physical anguish can so distract a being that he deserts any aspirations of betterment and begins to seek some cessation of his suffering. The specialty of the medical doctor is the curing of physical disease or non-optimum physical conditions. In some instances he can do so. It is no invasion of his province to assist the patient to greater healing potential. And ills that are solely spiri-tual in nature are not medical. The \"psych-iatrist\" and \"psych-ologist\" on the other hand took their very names from religion since \"psyche\" means soul. They, by actual statistics, are not as successful as priests in relieving mental anguish. But they modernly seek to do so by using drugs or hypnotism or physical means. They damage more than they help."},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":" HSDC    838    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The minister has a responsibility to his people and those about him to relieve suffer-ing. He has many ways to do this. He is quite successful in doing so and he does not need or use drugs or hypnotism or shock or surgery or violence. Until his people are at a level where they have no need of physical things, he has as a duty preventing their spiritual or physical decay by relieving where he can their suffering. His primary method of doing so is the Assist. As the knowledge of how to do them exists and as the skill is easily acquired, he actu-ally has no right to neglect those for whose well-being he is responsible, as only then can he lead them to higher levels of spiritual attainment. An auditor has it in his power to make pcs recover spectacularly. That power is in di-rect proportion to his flawlessness as an auditor. Only the most exact and proper tech will produce the desired result. If you truly want to help your fellows, that exact skill and those results are very well worth having. L.

We have known for years in Dianetics and Scientology that the tech of assists is very powerful and can work miracles when correctly applied. The purpose of this bulletin is to lay out the available technology on assists for han-dling the ill or injured. The processes presented in this issue are in checklist form which will greatly aid the C/S and auditor in drawing up and executing a proper assist program. USING THE CHECKLISTS In 1974 I developed the system of using a preliminary assessment of the pc’s condition and checklists as aids to programming and C/Sing the case. Attached to this bulletin are separate checklists which list symptoms for both injuries and illnesses and one comprehensive handling sheet which lists out the many assist actions and their references one uses to handle either. To use the checklists: 1. Look up the symptom or symptoms the pc may have on the appropriate preliminary assessment sheet (injury or illness). Below each symptom are listed many possible handlings. 2. Look up the handlings on the handling sheet (which covers handlings for both injuries and illnesses). 3. Use these handlings and their references in C/Sing and programming the case. 4. Draw up the program and C/S. 5. The C/S can then circle the actions to be done on the handling sheet and number them in sequence. The handling sheet can be kept in the folder and signed off as each step is done. 6. Audit the pc regularly until the illness, injury or condition is handled. C/SING AND PROGRAMMING The Assist Summary bulletins were never intended to be used as a rote sequence of handling assists, which vary based on the circumstances of the pc. It could be a serious mistake to simply robotically copy down in order the handlings listed for the pc’s symptoms and then audit them on the pc. One reason for this is that the case levels of people differ. An OT with a sprained an-kle would be handled differently than a Dianetic pc with one. Also, injuries and illnesses are two separate subjects and are handled differently."},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"FULL ASSIST CHECKLIST FOR INJURIES 3 HCOB 29.7.81 ID ILLNESSESHECKLIST FOR INJURIES _______________________________________________________ AND ILLNESSES HSDC    841    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE Therefore, data has to be gotten where available, from medical reports, session reports, interviews and exam statements, and the C/S has to understand the case before him and pro-gram and C/S accordingly. Any assist action must be suited the that pc’s case and current condition. CAUTION The injured or ill person is overwhelmed easily. One must beware of keying the per-son in. The operating basis is to take it easy on the pc and try not to run anything too heavy on him. Going earlier similar on 2WCs should be avoided as due to his condition E/S tends to make the ill or injured pc dive back to the year zero. This is more than a sick person can stand up to. Along with this, never miss an F/N on a sick person. NOTE ON HIGH CRIMING REFERENCES It well behooves any auditor or C/S to get his high crime checkouts in PT for the assist actions listed in this bulletin. The circumstances requiring assists often crop up unexpectedly and a well prepared auditor will be more successful than an unprepared one. One would always do whatever one could to help a person in difficulty regardless. Still, it is a matter of technical integrity and professional pride that one would get his high crime checkouts in PT for assist actions to his class. ____________________ Factually, there is no group but ourselves which possesses a body of technology to ef-fectively assist the spiritual condition of the ill or injured person. Our knowledge in this area is considerable. So don’t skimp on your study and drilling of these procedures and the theory behind them. You can do much to relieve the misery suffered by the ill or injured. With full understanding and application of assists you may appear to others to be a miracle worker. L.

MEDICAL TREATMENT An assist is not a substitute for medical attention and does not attempt to cure injuries requiring medical aid. First, call the doctor. Then assist the person as you can. (Ref. ABILITY 73 ASSIST’S IN SCIENTOLOGY) Medical examination and diagnosis should be sought where needed, and where treat-ment is routinely successful, medical treatment should be obtained. As an assist can at times cover up an actual injury or broken bone, no chances should be taken, especially if the condition does not easily respond. In other words where something is merely thought to be a slight sprain, to be on the safe side an X-ray should be obtained, particu-larly if it does not at once respond. An assist is not a substitute for medical treatment but is complementary to it. It is even doubtful if full healing can be accomplished by medi-cal treatment alone and it is certain that an assist greatly speeds recovery. In short, one should realize that physical healing does not take into account the being and the reper-cussion on the spiritual beingness of the person. (Ref. HCOB 11 Jul 73RB Re-rev. 21.9.78 ASSIST SUMMARY) 2. FIRST AID AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL Where you are giving an assist to one person, you put things in the environment into an orderly state as the first step, unless you are trying to stop a pumping artery – but here you would use First Aid. You should understand that First Aid always precedes an as-sist. You should look the situation over from the standpoint of how much First Aid is required.... You may often have to find some method of controlling handling and directing person-nel who get in your way before you can render an assist. You might just as well realize that an assist requires that you control the entire environment and personnel associated with the assist if necessary.... A good example of an assist would be when somebody is washing dishes in the kitchen. There is a horrendous crash and the person comes down all over the sink, hits the floor as she is going down, she grabs the butcher knife as it falls. You go in and say, “Well, let me fix that up.” One of the first things you would have to do is to wind some ban-dage around the hand to stop the bleeding. Part of the First Aid would be to pick up the dishes and put them back on the sink, sweep the pieces together into a more orderly semblance. This is the first symptom of control. (Ref. HCOB 21 Oct 71 Reiss. 21.9.74 ASSISTS IN SCIENTOLOGY) (This could include getting some assistance to ease discomfort such as Epsom salt baths, liniment, changing bandages, etc.) "},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"FULL ASSIST CHECKLIST FOR INJURIES 12 HCOB 29.7.81 ID ILLNESSESHECKLIST FOR INJURIES _______________________________________________________ AND ILLNESSES HSDC    850    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 3. IF A PERSON HAS DONE A BUNK The preclear may do a compulsive exteriorization, “do a bunk,” and drop his body limp in the chair and give from that body no sign that he is hearing any of the auditing com-mands given by the auditor. One such case was pleaded with for half an hour by an auditor along the lines that the preclear should remember her husband, should think of her children, should come back and live for the sake of her friends, and found no re-sponse from the preclear. Finally the auditor said, “Think of your poor auditor,” at which moment the preclear promptly returned. (Ref. DIANETICS 55! Chapter XVI EXTERIORIZATION) 4. ASSISTS FOR SOMEONE UNCONSCIOUS OR IN A COMA 4A. “YOU MAKE THAT BODY SIT ON THAT CHAIR.” (OR “LIE ON THAT BED.”) (Ref. HCOB 21 May 59 HGC ALLOWED PROCESSES AND ACC PROCESSES AS OF SAY 21, 1959) 4B. Touch patient’s hand to parts of the bed with “FEEL THAT (OBJECT).” (Ref. HCOB 27 Jul 69 ANTIBIOTICS) 4C. An unconscious pc can be audited off a meter by taking his hand and having him touch nearby things like pillow, floor, etc. or body without hurting an injured part. A person in a coma for months can be brought around by doing this daily. (Ref. HCOB 5 July 71RB Re-rev. 20.9.78, C/S Series 49RB, ASSISTS) 5. SHOCK OR CATATONIA “HERE. WHAT WORD DID I SAY TO YOU?” “HERE. WHAT WORD DID I SAY TO YOU?” The auditor keeps this up until all of a sudden the pc says, “You said ‘Here.’” Then, “REACH DOWN NOW AND FIND THE FLOOR WITH YOUR HAND. PRESS IT.” (Ref. 5406C17 6ACC-50A & 50B ASSISTS) "},{"pageNumber":871,"pageContent":"FULL ASSIST CHECKLIST FOR INJURIES 13 HCOB 29.7.81 ID ILLNESSESHECKLIST FOR INJURIES _______________________________________________________ AND ILLNESSES HSDC    851    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE 6.

ILLNESS He is explaining his illness by saying he needs attention and he is using it as a service fac of some sort or another, and you will find out this very often gives up if you give him attention. Well, there are various ways to give him attention. Get him a nurse, get him a doctor, put him in a special room, put him on arduously, awfully hard to maintain schedules. You take a pink pill at 20 minutes after the hour, three and one-half blue pills 45 minutes past the hour, and then every hour on the hour take 7 green ones, but skip every odd-numbered hour. Attention then is given to it and he gets the idea it is being as-ised. This makes him feel stronger and he will start to as-is it himself and very often gets well simply by giving him attention. There are various mechanisms to do so. (Ref. 5905C21 6-LACC-6 CLEARING: PROCESS – SPECIAL CASES) 6E. ILLNESS OR INJURY Run Reach and Withdraw from the affected area. (Ref.

UNRESOLVING CONDITION 9A. WAS AUDITED WHILE ON DRUGS Where a person is injured, given a contact or touch assist and then medical ex-amination and treatment, he is given the remainder as soon as he is able to be audited. The drug “five days” does not need to apply. But where the person has been given an assist over drugs, one must later come back to the case when he is off drugs and run the drug part out or at least make sure that nothing was sub-merged by the drugs. It is not uncommon for a person to be oblivious to certain parts of a treatment or operation at the time of initial auditing, only to have a missing piece of the incident pop up days, months or even years later. THIS is the reason injuries or operations occasionally seem to persist despite a full assist: a piece of it was left unhandled due to a drugged condition during the operation; such bits may come off unexpectedly in routine auditing on some other appar-ently disrelated chain.

UNRESOLVED PAINS Where you can’t fully repair a crippled left leg, don’t be surprised to find it was the right leg that was hurt. You audit the left leg somatic in vain. If you do, start auditing somatics in the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BODY.... This is also true for toothaches. Look at the pc’s mouth. Has the RIGHT upper molar ever been pulled or injured? Yes. That’s how the left molar began to decay. The right up-per molar was pulled. The pain (especially under the painkiller on the right side only) backed up and stopped on the opposite side. Eventually the left upper mo-lar, under that stress, a year or ten later, caves in and aches. (Ref. HCOB 15 Jul 70R Rev. 17.7.78 UNRESOLVED PAINS) 9C. ILLNESS OR INJURY Check if any L&N done in connection with the area, verify or correct the lists. NOTHING PRODUCES AS MUCH CASE UPSET AS A WRONG LIST ITEM OR A WRONG LIST.

These persons can be grouped under „sources of trouble”. They include: (a) Persons intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial ties) of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even when they approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong. They, by experience, produce a great deal of trouble in the long run as their own con-dition does not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism. Their present time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous, and so long as it remains so, they should not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor. (b) Criminals with proven criminal records often continue to commit so many undetected harmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should not be accepted for processing by organizations or auditors. (c) Persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publicly attacked Scientology or been a party to an attack and all their immediate families should never be accepted for processing by a Central Organization or auditor. They have a history of only serving other ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or audi-tor. They have already barred themselves out by their own overts against Scientology and are thereafter too difficult to help, since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure.

By responsible-for-condition cases is meant the person who insists a book or some auditor is „wholly responsible for the terrible condition I am in”. Such cases demand unusual favours, free auditing, tremendous effort on the part of auditors. Re-view of these cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing, that they are losing a planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing, that they are not as bad off as they claim, and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them, even their own families. Establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly. (e) Persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are a liability as they are forced into being processed by some other person and have no personal desire to become bet-ter. Quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrong and so do not get better. Until a personally determined goal to be processed occurs, the person will not benefit. (f) Persons who „want to be processed to see if Scientology works” as their only reason for being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate. News re-porters fall into this category. They should not be audited. (g) Persons who claim that „if you help such and such a case” (at great and your expense) because somebody is rich and influential or the neighbors would be electrified should be ig-nored. Processing is designed for bettering individuals, not progressing by stunts or giving cases undue importance. Process only at convenience and usual arrangements. Make no ex-traordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons. Not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal of notoriety, not betterment. (h) Persons who „have an open mind” but no personal hopes or desires for auditing of knowingness should be ignored, as they really don’t have all open mind at all, but a lack of ability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyone’s efforts „to convince them”. (i) Persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better. They have a purpose far being audited entirely contrary to the auditor’s and so in this conflict, do not benefit. When such persons are trained they use their training to degrade others. Thus they should not be accepted for training or auditing. (j) Persons attempting to sit in judgment on Scientology in hearings or attempting to in-vestigate Scientology should be given no undue importance. One should not seek to instruct or assist them in any way. This includes judges, boards, newspaper reporters, magazine writ-"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"POLICIES ON „SOURCES OF TROUBLE“ 3 HCO PL 7.5.69 HSDC    859    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE ers, etc. All efforts to be helpful or instructive have done nothing beneficial as their first idea is a firm „I don’t know” and this usually ends with an equally firm „I don’t know”. If a person can’t see for himself or judge from the obvious, then he does not have sufficient powers of observation even to sort out actual evidence. In legal matters, only take the obvious effective steps – carry on no crusades in court. In the matter of reporters, etc., it is not worth while to give them any time contrary to popular belief. They are given their story before they leave their editorial rooms and you only strengthen what they have to say by saying anything. They are no public communication line that says much. Policy is very definite. Ignore. ____________________ To summarize troublesome persons, the policy in general is to cut communication as the longer it is extended the more trouble they are. I know of no instance where the types of persons listed above were handled by auditing or instruction. I know of many instances where they were handled by just ignoring them until they change their minds or just turning one’s back. In applying a policy of cut-communication one must also use judgement as there are exceptions in all things and to fail to handle a person’s momentary upset in life or with us can be quite fatal. So these policies refer to non-Scientology persons in the main or persons who appear on the outer fringes and push toward us. When such a person bears any of the above designations we and the many are better off to ignore them. Scientology works. You don’t have to prove it to everyone. People don’t deserve to have Scientology as a divine right, you know. They have to earn it. This has been true in every philosophy that sought to better man. All the above „sources of trouble” are also forbidden training and when a person being trained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings (a) to (j) he or she should be advised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanation should be given them at that time. Thus the few may not, in their own turmoil, impede service to and the advance of the many. And the less enturbulence you put on your lines, the better and the more people you will eventually help. L.

Here more than any other points, alteration can enter. Altering, doing something else, is a sufficiently serious problem to destroy a course and all the benefits of Dianetics in a whole area. Early on, during the development of the Standard Dianetics Course, we were suddenly getting case failures. These were traced by Case Supervision to wild variations from Standard Dianetic procedure. These variations were traced to an examiner who during student check-outs was giving „advice“. As soon as this was handled, case gains immediately resumed. Over the many years of Dianetic use, I think we must have seen all possible variations of auditing. „New“ phenomena were often discovered and used and eventually the whole sub-ject wandered off into never-never land and ceased to produce uniform results. What has happened here in Standard Dianetics is that the exact actions that produce results on all cases have been isolated and used as the procedure. The procedure is a thin narrow walkway through a huge field of potential alterations. There are no different cases. Built in to the Standard Dianetic procedure are the remedies. For instance early Dianetics was plagued by several problems: 1. Lack of visio – an inability to see pictures. This was solved by getting date and dura-tion. 2. Perception shut-off. Not required in total now to produce results. Sonic, ability to hear the sound in pictures, is not needed at all. Impression is sufficient. 3. Somatic shut-off. Not now required to be solved but its source (drugs and alcohol) has been discovered. 4. Rough sessions. Solved by TRs. 5. Lack of auditor judgement in diagnosis. Solved by the E-Meter."},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"KEEPING DIANETICS WORKING IN AN AREA 2 HCOB 20.5.69 HSDC    862    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE In these years of research I have been able to wrap up these and other things. There have been more cases run on Dianetics than could easily be counted. So the re-search data is very broad. This is no new subject. It has been close to 39 years under research. Thus what you are told on the Standard Dianetics Course is the essence of all this work and experience. There are no unsolved problems, there is only varied application where there should not be. The whole object of the course is to train people to get good results, and train people to give a course that results in good auditors. That’s the whole thing. We could also teach over 50,000,000 words about things that don’t get results or train auditors. The essence of a brilliant subject is a simple subject. Therefore anything that varies the data of a Standard Dianetics Course can send it out into unworkability. I’ve seen auditors also use „peyote“ (a drug), CO2 and drugs „to help auditing“. I’ve seen many different meter types used. I’ve looked over a thousand different ways to run a session. And I’ve seen all these things fail. The four points of greatest potential failure are 1. A Course Supervisor who interprets data and alters it in order to satisfy some student’s offbeat quest. 2. An Examiner who throws curves into data by means of invalidating the right data. 3. A Case Supervisor who does not simply and only put the auditor back onto the main line and who seeks to „solve“ cases by altering data. 4. An Auditor who, not knowing his data in the first place, alters the data and, because in an altered form he fails, starts off on a wilder alteration of data and fails harder. Under Supervisor come the Course and Cramming Supervisor both. So you see, that to get real Standard Dianetic results going in an area you have to be very alert to hold the exact data line as contained in the HCO Bs. Where you begin to find case failures, look to 1 to 4 above and to student failure to just simply study and drill. ____________________ For the first time you have an exact subject in the field of the „humanities“.

Let us list the basic essential “hats” he would have to wear. • Reception • Registrar • Cashier • Ethics Officer • Examiner • Case Supervisor • Auditor • Review Auditor • Public Relations Officer If successful he would spend about 5 hours a day auditing, 2 hours eating and 8 hours sleeping. This leaves 9 hours in which to do the remaining “hats”. Of necessity one or more would be neglected. On that point he would tend to cave in as a “one-man band”. It takes about 2 Admin personnel to keep a tech personnel going. Even a group of auditors, trying to make lots of money, usually try to do nothing but audit. It is not that they have case failures. It is that they fail to wear the essential hats. The best auditing results are obtained from teamwork. A Review Auditor has to be a trained Scientologist. Lack of one means a roughed-up pc has to be sent to the nearest org. But there is no reason one cannot work as part of a group, even if the others are only part-timers."},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"DIANETICS AND RESULTS DIANETIC 2 HCOB 28.05.69 II COUNSELING GROUPS HSDC    868    HUBBARD    STANDARD DIANETICS COURSE The best solution to all this is to form a Dianetic Counseling Group and get the es-sential posts on the org board held. Then the advances and gains the group makes will be ad-vances that are stable. This group would of course have to have liaison with a competent Medical Doctor or Clinic. In the United States especially, the Counselors would have to be ministers. A Dianetic auditor would be able to audit all day even if the whole group only worked evenings. Let’s face it. The auditor auditing alone will have case failures. He won’t have time to pick them up. He won’t be able to get them to Qual. After a while he will have losses and some failed cases that muddy up his neighborhood just as other professions get. Psychiatry and psychology failed as single practitioners not only because they had no real tech but because they tried to work alone. This turned them toward governments which then used them only to control populations and there went whatever tech they might have developed. The single practitioner theory in Dianetics failed badly as an early Dianetics practice. Auditors that made it only attached themselves to the rich. Others became drifters. The answer, we have found out long since, is the group. The full hats, organization and activities and how they interrelate are available to Dianetic Counseling Groups. It is a wide area of interesting development all by itself. We had to know org basics to make orgs. A Dianetic Counseling Group can be enfranchised and made regular and helped. It will tend to stabilize any practice area. And it will minimize case failures. The official position of orgs is that they cannot take responsibility for the results ob-tained by single practitioners. Auditing is a team activity. Even if one were a medical doctor or a psychiatrist or psychologist, it would be best to have on hand or on call the rest of the team or at least a Dianetic Counseling Group even if one were not an integral part of it. The purpose of auditing is healthy sane people. The largest percentage are very grateful and very happy. And then there are the few who, through misconducted lives, are quite a handful to say the least. Realism requires that auditing be a group action.

In either case forming a Dianetic Counseling Group, getting them checked out on their “hats” and doing their duties even part-time would have solved all. One stick won’t burn.

It is not Scientology. In the hands of a medical practitioner who is also a trained Dianeticist, Dianetics ‘may achieve remarkable results in the handling of many of the problems and ailments which make up’ a large part of ordinary practice. It does not infringe upon orthodox curative medicine for known physical ailments. In this context Dianetics may be called ‘treatment’ and be said to ‘cure’. In the hands of a priest or minister who is also a trained Dianeticist, the same tool has a different use and function. It is used as a technology of pastoral counselling. It is then not used to treat and to cure in the medical sense, but to handle the effect of the spirit on the body. Dianetics, after examination, treatment, cure and a clean bill of health, as necessary, by a medical doctor, is used as a tool by the minister to free a person’s attentions from his body so that he is ready for Scientology. It is thus true pastoral counselling and has a religious func-tion. Dianetics as a subject taught on the Hubbard Standard Dianetics Course can be pro-moted in any authorized way. The teaching of Dianetics cannot be excepted to. But promotion of the practice of Dianetics as a treatment for the sick or afflicted or as a treatment for blem-ishes, deformities, diseases, disfigurements, disorders, injuries or other mental or physical conditions, by other than medical doctors, will violate the medical practice laws where they exist and lead to trouble. Hence the importance of controlled promotion, of sending sick pcs to a medical clinic for examination, for emphasizing that pastoral counselling is a use of Dianetics and is a reli-gious use with the purpose of handling the effect of the spirit on the body and not a use which conflicts with the proper sphere of the medical doctor as’ laid down in medical practice laws. That is not to say that Dianetics is a religion. It is not. It is a science, but it has a reli-gious use-to free the spirit from bodily considerations. Such problems of the spirit are not the function of the medical doctor, nor the concern of the medical practice laws. A proper adherence to the distinction between promoting Dianetics the science taught on the Dianetics Course, and Dianetics the pastoral counselling technology practised by Min-isters of religion, will resolve any problems posed by medical practice laws.
