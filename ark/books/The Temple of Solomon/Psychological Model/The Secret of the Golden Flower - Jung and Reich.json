On March 1st, 1980,Richard Wilhelm died. In May, 1930, memorial services in hishonour were held in Munich, and Jung was asked to deliver theprincipal address. The latter finds an appropriate place in theEnglish version,1 which is published a year or more after theco-author's death. The address will be welcomed, not onlv forwhat it tells the reader of Wilhelm, but for the further light itthrows on the standpoint of the East.The relation of the West to Eastern thought is a highlyparadoxical and confusing one. On the one side, as Jung pointsout, the East creeps in among us by the back door of theunconscious, and strongly influences us in perverted forms, andon the other we repel it with violent prejudice as concerned witha fine-spun metaphysics that is poisonous to the scientific mind.If anyone is in doubt as to how far the East influences us insecret ways, let him but briefly investigate the fields coveredto-day by what is called 44 occult thought Millions of peopleare included in these movements and Eastern ideas dominateall of them. Since there is nowhere any sign of a psychologicalunderstanding of the phenomena on which the ideas are based,they undergo a complete twisting and are a real menace in ourworld.A partial realization of what is going on in this direction,together with the Westerner's native ignorance and mistrust ofthe world of inner experience, build up the prejudice against thereality of Eastern wisdom. When the wisdom of the Chinese islaid before a Westerner, he is very likely to ask with a scepticallift of the brows why such profound wisdom did not save Chinafrom its present horrors. Of course, he does not stop to think thatthe Chinese asks with an equal scepticism why the much boastedscientific knowledge of the West, not to mention its equally boastedChristian ethics, did not save it from a World War. But as amatter of fact, present conditions in China do not invalidateChinese wisdom, nor does the Great War prove the futility ofscience. In both cases we are dealing with the negative sides ofthe principles under which East and West live, and it has not yetbeen given, either to individuals or to nations, to manage the1 See Appendix, p. 139.A*A vu"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"vivs of their virtues. Mastery of the inner world, with a relativecontempt for the outer, must inevitably lead to great catastrophes.Mastery of the outer world, to the exclusion of the inner, deliversus over to the dfernonie forces of the latter and keeps us barbaricfi? spite all outward forms of culture. The solution cannot befmind either in deriding Eastern spirituality as impotent, or bymistrusting science as a destroyer of humanity. We have to seethat the spirit must lean on science as its guide in the world ofreality, and that science must turn to the spirit for the meaningof life.This is the point of view established in The Secret of the GoldenFlozver. Through the combined efforts of Wilhelm and Jung wehave for the first time a way of understanding and appreciatingEastern wisdom which satisfies all sides of our minds. It hasbeen taken out of metaphysics and placed in psychologicalexperience. We approach it with an entirely new tool, and areprotected from the perversions the East undergoes at the handsof the cult-mongers of the West. At the same time, its meaningfor us is greatly deepened when we know that, despite the gulfseparating us from the East, we follow exactly similar paths whenonce we give heed to the inner world.But this book not only gives us a new approach to the East,it also strengthens the point of view evolving in the West withrespect to the psyche. The reshaping of values in progress to-dayforces the modern man out of a nursery-world of collectivetraditions into an adult's world of individual choice. He knowsthat his choice and his fate now turn upon his understanding ofhimself. Much has been taught him in recent years about thehitherto unsuspected elements in his psyche, but the emphasisis ail too often on the static side alone, so that he finds himselfpossessed of little more than an inventory of contents, the natureof which serves to burden him with a sense of weariness rather thanto spur him on to master the problems that confront him. Yetit is precisely the need of understanding himself in terms of changeand renewal which most grips the imagination of modern man.Having seen the world of matter disappear before his scientificeye and reappear as a world of energy, he comes to ask himselfa bold question; does he not contain within his psyche a storeof unexplored forces, which, if rightly understood, would givehim a new vision of himself and help safeguard the future forhim ? In this book his question is answered from two widelydifferent sources, an ancient Chinese yoga system and analyticalpsychology. Stripped of its archaic setting, The Secret of theGolden Flower is the secret of the powers of growth latent in thepsyche, and these same powers as they reveal themselves in theminds of Western men also form the theme of Jung's commentary.viii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"In the commentary he has shown the profound psychologicaldevelopment resulting from the right relationship to the forceswithin the psyche.* * * *In the German edition Jung's commentary comes first,followed by Wilhelm's exposition of the text, and then by thetext itself.

Origins the BookThe book comes from an esoteric circle in China.For a long time it was transmitted orally, and then inwriting; the first printing is from the ChHen-Lung period(eighteenth century). Finally, a thousand copies of itwere reprinted in Peking in 1920, together with the HuiMing Ching, and were divided among a small group ofpeople who, in the opinion of the editor, understood thequestions discussed. In this way I was able to get acopy. The new printing and circulation of the littlebook was due to a new religious movement growing outof the exigencies of the political and economic conditionsin China. There have been formed a series of secret sectswhose effort it is to achieve by the practice of secrettraditions from ancient times a state of soul lifting them<above all the misery of life. The methods used are magicalwriting, prayer, sacrifice, etc., and, in addition to these,widely prevalent medium istic seances, by means of whichdirect connection with the gods and the dead is sought.Experiments are also made with the planchette,1 theflying spirit pencil as the Chinese call it.But side by side with these practices, there existsan esoteric movement which has devoted itself withenergy to the psychological method, that is meditation,1 It is a curious fact that the man who circulated this text had written forhim by the planchette a preface by Lu Tzu, an adept of the T'ang dynasty, towhom these teachings are accredited. This preface certainly deviates very widelyfrom the thoughts given in the book; it is flat and colourless, like the majorityof such productions.3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"voi practice. The followers of this method, in contra-distinction to the European \" yogis\" to whom theseEastern practices are only a form of sport, achieve almostwithout exception the central experience. Thus it canbe said that, as far as the Chinese mentality is concerned,a completely assured method of attaining definite psychicexperiences is commanded. (It must be noted that, asC. G. Jung very correctly points out, Chinese mentality,at least up to very recent times, has been essentiallydifferent in some fundamental respects from that ofEuropeans.) Besides the release from the fetters of anillusory outer world, there are many other goals strivenfor by the different sects. Those on the highest leveluse this release by meditation, for the purpose of seekingthe Buddhist Nirvana, or, as for example in the presentbook, they teach that by the union of the spiritual principlein men to the correlated psychogenetic forces one canprepare for the possibility of life after death, not onlyas a shadow-being doomed to decay, but as a consciousspirit. In addition, and often in connection with thisidea, there are schools of thought which try by meansof this meditation to exert a psychic influence on certainvegetative animal processes. (As Europeans we wouldspeak here of the endocrine gland-system.) This influenceis intended to strengthen, rejuvenate, and normalize thelife-processes, so that even death will be overcome insuch a way that it fits in as a harmonious ending of life.The spiritual principle, now fitted for an independentcontinuation of life in the spirit-body, created out of itsown forces, deserts the earthly body, which remainsbehind as a drying shell like that abandoned by a cicada.The lower strata of these sects sought in this way toacquire magic powers, the ability to banish evil spiritsand disease, and here talismans, word and written charms4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"play their part. Sometimes this sort of thing results inmass-psychoses which then find expression in religiousor political unrest, as, for example, the Boxer movement,Recently, the unmistakable syncretist tendency ofTaoism is shown in the fact that within its institutionsmembers of all of the five world-religions (Confucianism,Taoism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity-even Judaism comes in occasionally for special mention)are included without having to break away from theirrespective religious communities.Having thus briefly described the background outof which such movements have grown up in our time,a word must be said as to the sources from which theteachings of the book- in question arise. Very remarkablediscoveries come to light, and we find that these preceptsare much older than their written form. The T'ai I ChinHaa Tsung Chih 1 can be traced back to the seventeenthcentury as having been printed on wooden tablets. Theauthor describes having found an incomplete copy datingfrom that time in the Liu Li ChÂ£ang, the old street ofdealers in books and antiquities in Peking, and tells howhe filled it out later from a friend's book. But the oraltradition goes back even further than that, to the religionof the Golden Elixir of Life (Chin Tan Chiao), whichdeveloped in the T'ang period in the eighth century.The founder is said to have been the well-known Taoistadept, Lii Yen (Lii Tung-pin), counted later by folk-loreas one of the eight immortals, about whom in the courseof time a rich store of myths has gathered. This sect,like all religions, native and foreign, met with toleranceand encouragement in the Tcang period and greatly1 The Secret of the Golden Flower {Tax 1 Chin Hua Tsung Chih), whose titlewas changed to Chiang Shing Shu (The Art of Prolonging Human Life), by theChinese publisher of this edition.5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"increased in numbers, hut, as it was always an esotericand secret religion, in the course of time it began to sufferpersecution because of members being suspected ofpolitical intrigues. Again and again, its adherents werepersecuted by a hostile government, lastly in an extremelycruel way by the Manchus. just before their own fall.1Many members have turned to the Christian religion, andall, even if they have not actually entered the church,are friendly toward it.Our book gives the best available account of thereligion of the Golden Elixir of Life (Chin Tan Chiao).The sayings are attributed to Lu Yen, whose other namewas Lii Tung-pin, or Lii, the Guest of the Cavern. Helived at the end of the eighth, and at the beginning ofthe ninth centurv, and was born in the vear a.d. 755.To his sayings a later commentary has been added, butit springs from the same tradition.Whence did Lii get his esoteric, secret lore ? Hehimself attributes its origin to Kuan Yin-hsi, the MasterYin-hsi of the Pass (Kuan, i.e. Han Ku Pass), for whom,according to tradition, Lao Tzu wrote dowrn his TaoTe Ching. As a matter of fact, there are to be found inthe system a great many thoughts taken from the esoteric,veiled, mystical teaching in the Tao Ti Ching. If wrecompare, for example, the \" gods in the valley 55 withthe \"valley-spirit\" of Lao Tzu, the two are found to beidentical. But while Taoism degenerated more andmore in the Han period in an external wizardry, due tothe fact that the Taoist court magicians were seeking tofind by alchemy the philosopher's stone which wTouldcreate gold out of the baser metals and lend men physicalimmortality, Lii Yen's movement represented a reform.The alchemistic signs became symbols of psychological1 In the year 1891, 15,000 members were killed by Manehu hirelings.6"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"processes. In this respect, there was a close approachto the original ideas of Lao Tzu. The latter, however,was altogether a free-thinker, and his follower, ChuangTzu, scorned all the hocus-pocus of yoga practice, nature-healers, and seekers after the elixir of life, although hehimself, of course, practised meditation and attained bymeans of it that view of unity upon which he foundedhis later, intellectually developed system. In Lu Yen,however, there was a certain faith, a religious trend,which, stimulated by Buddhism, convinced him of theillusory quality of all external things, but in a way clearlydifferent from Buddhism. He seeks, with all his might,the fixed pole in the whirl of phenomena, where theadept can attain eternal life, a thought absolutely foreignto Buddhism, which denies every substantial ego.Nevertheless, the influence of Mahay ana Buddhism,which at that time dominated thought in China, is notto be underrated. Buddhist sutras are cited time andagain. In our text, indeed, this influence is even greaterthan can be assumed to have been the case in the ChinTan Chiao in general. In the second half of the thirdsection, explicit reference is made to the method knownas \" fixating contemplation \" {Chih Kuan), and the latteris a purely Buddhist method which was practised in theT'ien T'ai School of Chih K'ai.From this point on, there is to be observed a certainbreak in the sequence of thought in our essay. On theone hand, the cultivation of the \" Golden Flower \" isfurther described, but, on the -other hand, there appearpurely Buddhist ideas which repudiate the world andemphatically push the goal towards Nirvana. Thenfollow several sections 1 which have scarcely more value1 These sections are omitted from the present translation.-(R. W.)7"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"than gleanings, that is, if one considers the spirituallyhigh level and strict sequence of the work as a whole.Moreover, the work towards an inner rebirth by meansof contact with the circulation of the Light, and thecreation of the divine seed-kernel, is only described inits first stages, although the later stages are named asthe goal. (Compare the Hsii Ming Fang of Liu Hua Hangwhere these later stages are more carefully explained.)Therefore, we cannot escape the suspicion that a portionof the manuscript has actually been lost, and substitutionsmade from other sources. If that is so, it would explainthe afore-mentioned break in continuity and the fall inlevel of the parts not translated.An unprejudiced reading will bring to notice the factthat these two sources, Taoism and Buddhism, do notsuffice to cover the whole range of thought: the formof Confucianism which is based on the / Cking is alsointroduced. The eight fundamental signs (Fa Kna) ofthe / Ching are brought into various passages of ourtext as symbols for certain inner processes, and furtheron wre will try to explain the influence exerted by theapplication of the symbols. For the rest, since Con-fucianism has a broad common base with Taoism, theunion of these two sets of ideas does not cause a lossin coherence.Perhaps it will strike many a European reader asremarkable that there appear in the text sayings familiarto him from Christian teaching, while, on the other hand,these same well-known things which in Europe are veryoften taken only as ecclesiastical metaphors, are heregiven quite a different perspective because of the psycho-logical connections in which they are placed. We findintuitions and concepts like the following, to select onlya few that are especially striking: Light is the life of8"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"man. The eye is the light of the body, Man is spirituallyreborn out of water and fire, to which must be added\" thought-earth \" (spirit), as womb, or tilled field. Letus compare the sayings of John : I baptize you wTithwater: after me shall come one who will baptize withthe Holy Ghost and with fire; or : Except a man beborn of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into thekingdom of God. How plastic becomes the thought of\" water 55 as the seed-substance in our text, and how clearthe difference between the outward streaming activitywhich exhausts itself in creation (what is born of fleshremains flesh), and the 46 backward flowing 55 movement(meianoia)!The bath, too, plays its part in this rebirth just as itdoes in the baptism preached by John and in the Christianbaptism as well. Even the mystical marriage, which playssuch an important role in Christian parables, appears severaltimes; there is also mentioned the child, the boy withinourselves, as well as the bride. (The boy is the pueraeternus, the Christ who must be born in us and who,taken another wTay, is the bridegroom of the soul.) Andwhat is most striking of all, perhaps, even an apparentlyminor detail, the need of having oil in the lamps so thatthey can burn brightly, takes on a new and weightypsychological meaning, thanks to our text. It is worthmentioning that the expression Golden Flower (ChinHua), in an esoteric connection, includes the wTord \"light \"If one mites the two characters one above the other, sothat they touch, the lower part of the upper character andthe upper part of the lower character, make the characterfor \" light\" (kunng).

That was also the reason the teaching always9"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"remained limited to secret circles. Even to-day itsmembership is greater than appears from the outside,If we ask whither this light-religion points, we canlirst of all consider Persia, for even in the T'ang periodthere were Persian temples in many places in China.But if certain points correspond with the religion ofZarathustra. and especially with Persian mysticism, thereare, on the other hand, very strong divergences. Anotherview to be considered is that of a direct Christian influence.In the T'ang period, the religion of the Uigurs, who wereconnected with the Emperor, was the Nestorian branchof Christianity and stood in high favour, as is witnessedbv the well-known Xestorian monument in Sianfu. Itwas erected in 781, and has both a Chinese and a Syrianinscription. Thus connections between the Nestoriansand the Chin Tan Chiao are quite possible, Th. Richardwent so far as to consider the Chin Tan Chiao simply asurvival of the old Nestorians. He was led to this viewby certain agreements in ritual and certain traditionsof the Chin Tan Chiao membership which approachclosely to the Christian practice. Lately P. Y. Saeki1has taken up the theory again, and, supported by theNestorian liturgy found in Tun-huang by Pelliot, hasestablished a series of further parallels. He even goesso far as to identifv Lti Yen, the founder of the ChiliTan Chiao, with Adam, the Chronicler of the text of theNestorian monument, who signs himself with the Chinesename Lii Hsiu-yen. According to this hypothesis, LuYen, the founder of the Chin Tan Chiao, would have beena Christian of the Nestorian confession! Saeki goesdecidedly too far in his delight in identifications : hisproofs are all of them almost convincing, but there isalways lacking the crucial point which wTould clinch1 The Xestorian Monument in China. London, 2nd edition, 1928.10"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the matter. Many partial proofs do not make a wholeone, but we must agree with him at least to the extentof admitting that in the Chin Tan Chiao there has beena strong admixture of Nestorian ideas which are alsoevident in the present manuscript. These ideas seem,on the one hand, very odd in their strange dress, wThiIeon the other hand they take on a remarkable Ctfnewr\" sortof life. Here we reach one of those points which proveover and over again :\" East and West are no longer to remain apart.\"2, The Psychological and Cosmological Premises ofthe TextIn the interpretation of the following translation,it is of value to say a few more wTords about the founda-tions of the Weltanschauung on which the method depends.This philosophy is, to a certain extent, the commonproperty of all Chinese trends of thought. It is builton the premise that cosmos and man in the last analysisobey common laws; that man is a cosmos in miniatureand is not divided from the great cosmos by any fixedlimits. The same laws rule for the one as for the other,and from the one a way leads into the other. The psycheand the cosmos are related to each other like the innerand outer worlds. Therefore man participates by naturein all cosmic events, and is inwardly as well as outwardlyinterwoven with them.Tao, then, the meaning of the world, the way,dominates man just as it does invisible and visible nature(Heaven and Earth). The character for Tao in its original11"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"form,1 consists of a head, which must be interpreted asfcw beginning\"; and, under that, the character for\" standing stillwhich, in the later way of writing, hasbeen omitted. The original meaning, then, is that of aifc track which, though fixed itself, leads from the beginningdirectly to the goalThe fundamenal idea is theidea that Tao, though itself motionless, is the means ofall movement and gives it law. Heavenly paths arethose along which the stars move; the path of man isthe wav along which he must travel. Lao Tzu has usedthis word in the metaphysical sense, as the final worldprinciple, the \" Meaning existing before there is anyrealization and not yet divided by the pulling asunder ofpolar opposites on which all realization depends. Thisterminology is presupposed in the present book.In Confucianism there is a certain difference in theterminology. The word Tao has here an inner-worldsignificance and means the 44 right way \" ; on the onehand, the way of Heaven, on the other, the way of man.To Confucianism, the final principle of an undividedOne is the T'ai Chi (the great ridge-beam, the great pole).The term \" pole 55 occasionally comes in our text also,and is there identical with Tao.Out of Tao, that is to say, out of the T'ai Chi, theredevelop the principles of reality ; the one pole being light(yang) and the other darkness (yin). Among Europeaninvestigators, some have turned first to sexual referencesfor an explanation, but the characters refer to phenomenain nature. Yin is shadow, therefore the north side of amountain and the south side of a river (because duringthe day the position of the sun makes the river appeardark from the south). Yang, in its original form shows1 Compare JCu Chou Pi en, vol. 66, p. 25 ff., which was also consulted as to theanalysis\" of the other characters.12"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"flying pennants, and, corresponding to the character yin,is the south side of a mountain and the north side of ariver. Starting with the meaning of 44 light55 and \" darkthe principle was then expanded to all polar opposites,including the sexual. However, both yin and yang are onlyactive in the realm of phenomena, and have their commonorigin in an undivided unity, yang as the active principleappearing to condition, and yin as the passive principleseeming to be derived or conditioned. It is thereforequite clear that a metaphysical dualism is not at thebottom of these ideas. Less abstract than yin and yangare the concepts of the creative and the receptive (ChHenand K'un) that originate in the Book of Changes [/ Chi?ig],and are symbolized by Heaven and Earth. Through theunion of Heaven and Earth, and through the activity ofthe two primordial forces within this scene (an activitygoverned by the one primal law Tao), there develop the\" ten thousand things that is, the outer wTorld.Viewed objectively as a physical organism, whichin all its parts is also a small universe (Hsiao THen Ti)fman is one of the 44 ten thousand things So, accordingto the Confucians, the inner nature of man comes fromHeaven, or, as the Taoists express it, it is a phenomenalform of Tao. In his phenomenal form man developsinto a multiplicity of individuals in each of whom thecentral monad is enclosed as the life-principle; butimmediately, before birth even, at the moment of con-ception, it separates into the bi-polar phenomena ofessence and life (hsing and ming). The character foressence (hsing) is made up of those for heart (hsin), andorigin, being born (sh&ng). The heart (hsin), accordingto the Chinese idea, is the seat of emotional consciousness,which is awakened through feeling reactions to impressionsreceived from the external world by the five senses.13"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Thai wnivh remains as a substratum when no feelings arehtini? expressed, but which lingers, so to speak, in atraTiNeerideiifaL supereonseious. condition, is essence:ksir;*). Varying according to the more exact definitionof this concept, essence is either originally good, if lookedat from the standpoint of the eternal idea,1 or it isoriginally evih or at least neutral (if taken from the stand-point of empirical evolution),2 and has to be made intosomething good by a long development of custom.Essence (hsing), undoubtedly related to logos, appearsclosely knit with life (ming) when entering phenomena.The character ming really signifies a royal command then,destiny, fate, the fate allotted to a man, so too, theduration of life, the measure of vitality at one's disposal, andthus it comes about that ming (life) is closely related to eros.Both principles are, so to speak, super-individual. Manas a spiritual being is made human by essence (hsing).The individual man possesses it. but it extends far beyondthe limits of the individual. Life (ming) is also super-individual in that man must simply accept a destiny whichdoes not come from his conscious will. Confucianismsees in it a Heaven-made law to which man must adapt;Taoism takes it as the multi-coloured play of naturewhich cannot evade the laws of Tao, but which, as such,is pure chance; Chinese Buddhism sees it as the workingout of karma within the world of illusion.To these dualities there correspond in the corporeal-personal man the following bi-polar tensions. The bodyis activated by the interplay of two psychic structures :first, hun, which I have translated as animus* the1 See Meneius.* See Hsiin K'uang.3 Wilhelm's use of the term animus lends the latter a meaning quite differentfrom that given it by Jung's concept, where the animus is an element in a woman'smind. Jung finds hun close to the meaning of logos but the latter term could notbe used for hun first, because of there being another Chinese concept still closer14"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"masculine soul, because it belongs to the yang principle,and secondly, jro, which belongs to the yin principle, andis rendered by me as cmima.1 Both are ideas coming froman observation of the events connected with death, andtherefore both contain in their written form the signfor daemon, that is, the departed one (kuei). The annuawas thought of as especially linked with the bodilyprocesses ; at death it sinks to the earth and decays.The animus, on the other hand, is the higher soul; afterdeath it rises in the air, where at first it is active for atime and then evaporates in ethereal space, or flowsback into the reservoir of life. In living men, the twocorrespond in a certain degree to the cerebral andsympathetic nervous system. The animus dwells in theeyes, the anima in the abdomen. The animus is brightand active, the anima is dark and earth-bound. Thesign for hun (animus) is made up of the character for\"daemon\" and \"cloud\", while that for p'o (anima) iscomposed of the characters for \" daemon \" and \" whiteThis would indicate ideas similar to what we find appearingelsewhere as shadow-soul and body-soul, and without adoubt the Chinese concept is meant to include somethinglike this. None the less we must be cautious in the matterof derivations, because the most ancient script known in China had no sign for daemon, and so we may perhapsbe dealing with primordial symbols whose derivationsto logos, i.e. ksing (essence), and also because hun is described as being a personalfactor, while logos is strictly impersonal. The expression \" spirit soul \" as opposedto *' earthly soul \" would seem to cover the meaning of hun as explained by Wilhelm,and in order to avoid a possible confusion in terminology it was planned to makethis alteration in the English version, the authors having agreed that a change wasadvisable. But though the proposed substitution would undoubtedly simplify thingsfor the reader and would involve no change in meaning, still it would require therearrangement of several paragraphs and thus cause too great a divergence betweenthe two editions. For that reason, the change has not been carried out.-(C. F. B.)1 It is to be noted that p'o corresponds to only one part of the anima as con-ceived by Jung. In the latter's concept, the spiritual side of the anima is quiteas important as the animal side,-(C. F. B.)15"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"are lost.

As arule, it will be the anima, the blind will, which, goaded bypassions, forces the animus or intellect into its service.At least the anima will do this to the extent that theintellect directs itself outward, whereby the powers bothof animus and anima leak away and life consumes itself.A positive result is the creation of new beings in whichlife continues, while the original being 44 externalizesitselfand \" ultimately is made by things into a thing \".The end result is death.

The HeavenlyHeart lies between sun and moon (i.e. the two eyes).The Book of the Yellow Castle says : In the fieldof the square inch of the house of the square foot, lifecan be regulated. The house of the square foot is theface. The field of the square inch in the face: whatcould that be other than the Heavenly Heart ? In themiddle of the square inch dwells the splendour. In thepurple hall of the city of jade dwells the god of utmostemptiness and life. The Confucians call it the centreof emptiness; the Buddhists, the terrace of life; theTaoists, the ancestral land, or the yellow castle, or thedark pass, or the space of former Heaven. The HeavenlyHeart is like the dwelling place, the Light is the master.Therefore when the Light circulates, the powers ofthe whole body arrange themselves before its throne, justas when a holy king has taken possession of the capitaland has laid down the fundamental rules of order, allthe states approach with tribute; or, just as when themaster is quiet and calm, men-servants and maids obeyhis orders of their own accord, and each does his work.Therefore you only have to make the Light circulate :that is the deepest and most wonderful secret. The Lightis easy to move, but difficult to fix. If it is allowed togo long enough in a circle, then it crystallizes itself: thatis the natural spirit-body.

Heaven is not the wide blue sky, but theplace where the body is made in the house of the creative.If one keeps this up for a long time, there develops quitenaturally in addition to the body, yet another spirit-body.The Golden Flower is the Elixir of Life {Chin Tan,literally, golden ball, golden pill). All changes of spiritualconsciousness depend upon the Heart. Here is a secretcharm, which, although it works very accurately, is yetso fluent that it needs extreme intelligence and clarity,and complete absorption and calm. People withoutthis highest degree of intelligence and understanding donot find the way to apply the charm ; people without thisutmost capacity for concentration and calm cannot keepfast hold of it.This section explains the origin of the Great Meaning of the world(Tm)Â» The Heavenly Heart is the germinal root of the GreatMeaning.

This creature abides between conception and birth intrue space. When the One note of individuation enters intobirth, essence and life are divided in two. From this time on, if theutmost peace is not achieved, essence and life never see eachother again.Therefore it is said in the plan of the Great Pole: The GreatOne includes within itself true power (prana), seed, spirit, animus,and anima. If the thoughts are absolutely quiet so that theHeavenly Heart can be seen, the spiritual intelligence reaches thesource unaided. This essence lives indeed in true space, but the25"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"splendour of the Light dwells In the two eyes. Therefore the Masterteaches the circulation of the Light so that the true essencemay be reached. The true essence is the primordial spirit. Theprimordial spirit is precisely essence and life, and if one acceptswhat is real in it, it is the primordial power. And the GreatMeaning is just this thing.The Master is further concerned that the people should notmiss the way that leads from conscious action to unconsciousnon-action. Therefore he says: The magic of the Elixir of Lifemakes use of conscious action in order that non-action may beattained. Conscious action consists in setting the Light in circula-tion by reflection in order to make manifest the setting free ofHeaven. If then the true seed is bom, and the right methodapplied in order to melt and mix it, and in that way to createthe Elixir of Life, then one goes through the pass. The embryo,which must be developed by the work of warming, nourishing,bathing, and washing, is formed. That crosses over into the realmof unconscious non-action. A whole year of this fire-period isneeded before the embryo is bom, sheds the membranes, andpasses out of the ordinary world into the holy world.This method is quite simple and easy. But there are so manytransforming and changing conditions connected with it that it issaid: Not with one leap can a man suddenly get there. Who-ever is seeking eternal life must search for the place whence essenceand life originally spring.2. The Primordial Spirit and the Conscious SpiritMaster Lu Tzii said: In comparison with Heavenand Earth, man is like a mayfly.

This lowerfleshly heart has the shape of a large peach: it is coveredby the wings of the lungs, supported by the liver, andserved by the bowels. This heart is dependent on theoutside world. If a man does not eat for one day even,it feels extremely uncomfortable. If it hears somethingterrifying it throbs; if it hears something enraging itstops; if it is faced with death it becomes sad; if it seessomething beautiful it is dazzled. But the HeavenlyHeart in the head, when would it have been in the leastmoved ? Dost thou ask: Can the Heavenly Heart not bemoved ? Then I answer: How could the true thoughtin the squarg inch be moved ? If it really moves, it isnot well. For when ordinary men die, then it moves,but that is not good. It is best indeed if the Light has .already fortified itself in a spirit-body and its life-forcegradually penetrated the instincts and movements. Butthat is a secret which has not been revealed for thousandsof years.The lower heart moves like a strong, powerful com-mander who despises the Heavenly ruler because of hisweakness, and has seized for himself the leadership of theaffairs of state. But when the primordial castle can befortified and defended, then it is as if a strong and wiseruler sat upon the throne.

When theruler in the centre is thus in order, all those rebelliousheroes will present themselves with lances reversed readyto take orders.The way to the Elixir of Life recognizes as suprememagic, seed-water, spirit-fire, and thought-earth : thesethree. What is seed-water ? It is the true, one power(eros) of former Heaven. Spirit-fire is the Light (logos).Thought-earth is the Heavenly Heart of the middle house(intuition). Spirit-fire is used for effecting, thought-earthfor substance, and seed-water for the foundation. Ordinarymen make their bodies through thoughts. The body isnot only the 7 ft. tall outer body. In the body isthe anima. The anima, having produced consciousness,adheres to it. Consciousness depends for its origin on theanima. The anima is feminine (yiri), the substance ofconsciousness. As long as this consciousness is notinterrupted, it continues to beget from generation togeneration, and the changes of form of the anima and thetransformations of substance are unceasing.But, besides this, there is the animus in which thespirit shelters. The animus lives in the daytime in theeyes; at night it houses in the liver. When living in theeyes, it sees; when housing itself in the liver, it dreams.Dreams are the wanderings of the spirit through all nineHeavens and all the nine Earths. But whoever is dulland moody on waking, and chained to his bodily form, isfettered by the anima. Therefore the concentration ofthe animus is effected by the circulation of the Light,and in this way the spirit is protected, the anima subjected,and consciousness annulled. The method used by theancients for escaping from the world consisted in burningout completely the slag of darkness in order to return to28"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the purely creative. This is nothing more than a reductionof the anima and a bringing to perfection of the animus.And the circulation of the Light is the magical means oflimiting the dark powers and gaining mastery of theanima. Even if the work is not directed toward bringingback the creative, but confines itself to the magicalmeans of the circulation of the Light, it is just the Lightthat is creative. By means of its circulation, one returnsto the creative. If this method is followed, plenty ofseed-water will be present of itself; the spirit-fire will beignited, and the thought-earth will solidify and crystallize.And thus can the holy fruit mature. The scarabseus rollshis ball and in the ball there develops life as the effect ofthe undivided effort of his spiritual concentration. Ifnow an embryo can grow in manure, and shed its skin,why should not the dwelling place of our Heavenly Heartalso be able to create a body if we concentrate the spiritupon it?The one effective, true essence (logos united with life),when it descends into the house of the creative, dividesinto animus and anima. The animus is in the HeavenlyHeart. It is of the nature of light; it is the power oflightness and purity. It is that which we have receivedfrom the great emptiness, that which has form from the. very beginning. The anima partakes of the nature of# darkness. It is the power of the heavy and the turbid;it is bound to the bodily, fleshly heart. The animus loveslife. The anima seeks death. All sensuous pleasures andimpulses to anger are effects of the anima; it is theconscious spirit which after death is nourished on blood,but which, during life, is in direst need. Darkness returnsto darkness and like things attract each other. But thepupil understands how to distil the dark anima so that ittransforms itself into Light (ycmg) (4).31"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"In this part there is described the role played by the primordialspirit and the conscious spirit in the making of the human body.The Master says : The life of man is like that of a mayfly : onlythe true essence of the primordial spirit can escape the cycle ofHeaven and Earth and the fate of the aeons. The true essenceproceeds from that which has no polarity and receives the prim-ordial force of polarity whereby it takes the true essence ofHeaven and Earth into itself and becomes the conscious spirit.As primordial spirit it receives the essence from father and mother.This primordial spirit is without consciousness and knowledge,but is able to regulate the formative processes of the body. Theconscious spirit is very apparent and very effective, and can adaptitself unceasingly. It is the ruler of the human heart. As long asit stays in the body it is the animus. After its departure from thebody it becomes spirit. While the body is entering into existence,the primordial spirit has not yet made an embryo in which itcould incorporate itself. Thus it crystallizes itself in free onenesswithout poles.At the time of birth the conscious spirit draws in the power ofthe air and thus becomes the dwelling of the new-born. It livesin the heart. From that time on the heart is master, and theprimordial spirit loses its place while the conscious spirit haspower.The primordial spirit loves peace, and the conscious spiritloves movement. In its movement it remains bound to the feehngsand desires. Day and night it wastes the primal seed till theforce of the primordial spirit is entirely used up. Then the con-scious spirit leaves the shell and goes away.Whoever has done good in the main, has a power of spirit thatis pure and clear when death comes. It passes out by the upper\"openings of mouth and nose. The pure and light air-power risesupward and floats up to Heaven and becomes the five-fold,present shadow-genius, or shadow-spirit. But if, during life,the primordial spirit was used by the conscious spirit for avarice,folly, desire, and lust, and has committed all sorts of sins, then inthe moment of death, the power of the spirit is troubled andconfused, and the conscious spirit passes, together with the air,through the lower openings to the door of the belly. For if thepower of the spirit is turbid and unclean, it crystallizes downward/sinks down to Hell and becomes a demon. Then not only the82"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"primordial spirit loses its nature, but the power and wisdomof the true essence is thereby lessened. Therefore the Mastersays : If it moves itself, that is not good. If one wants to protectthe primordial spirit, one must first not fail \"to subjugate the know-ing spirit. The way to subjugate it leads through the circulationof the Light. If one puts the circulation of the Light into practice,one must forget both body and heart. The heart must die, thespirit live. When the spirit lives, the breath will begin to circu-late in a wonderful way. This is what the Master called the best (5).Then the spirit must be allowed to dive down into the abdomen(solar-plexus). The power then mixes with the spirit, and thespirit unites with the power and becomes crystallized. This isthe method of putting the hand to it.In time, the primordial spirit transforms itself in the dwellingof life into the true power. At that time, the method of the turningof the millwheel must be applied, in order to distil it so that itbecomes the Elixir of Life. That is the method of concentratedwork.WheA the Life-Elixir pearl is finished, the holy embryo can beformed ; then the work must be directed to the warming andnourishing of the spiritual embryo. That is the method of thefinishing.When the power-body of the child is fully formed, the workmust be so directed that the embryo is born and returns again toemptiness. That is the method of the releasing of the hand.From the most ancient times till to-day, this is not empty talk,but the sequence of the Great Meaning in the real method of pro-ducing an eternally living and immortal spirit and holy man.But if the work is so far successful, then all belonging to theJ dark principle is entirely destroyed, and the body born into purelight. When the conscious spirit has been transformed into theprimordial spirit, then only can one say that it has attained anunending capacity for transformation, and departing from thecycle of births, has been brought to the six-fold (6) present,golden spirit. If this method of ennobling is not applied, how willthe way of being born and dying be escaped ?83"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"3. Circulation of the Light and Protection of theCentreMaster Lii Tzii said : Since when has the expression44 circulation of the Light\" been revealed ? It wasrevealed by the 64 True Men of the Beginning of Form \"(Kuan Yin Hsi) (7). When the Light is allowed to movein a circle, all the powers of Heaven and Earth, of theLight and the Dark, are crystallized. That is what isdescribed as seedlike, or purification of the power, orpurification of the concept. When one begins to applythis magic, it is as if, in the middle of one's being, therewere a non-being. When in the course of time the workis finished, and beyond the body there is another body,it is as if, in the middle of the non-being, there were abeing. Only after a completed work of a hundred days willthe Light be real, then only will it become spirit-fire.After a hundred days, there develops by itself in themiddle of the Light, a point of the true Light-pole (yang).Suddenly there develops the seed pearl. It is as if manand woman embraced and a conception took place.Then one must be quite still in order to await it. Thecirculation of the Light is the epoch of fire.In the midst of primal becoming, the radiance of theLight (Yang Kuang) is the determining thing. In thephysical world it is the sun; in man the eye. Theemanation and dissemination of spiritual consciousnessis chiefly brought about by this power when it is directedoutward (flows downward). Therefore the meaning of theGolden Flower depends wholly on the backward-flowingmethod.34"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"1Man's heart stands under the fire sign (8). The flames of thelire press upward. When both eyes are looking at things of theworld it is with vision directed outward. Now if one closes theeyes and, reversing the glance, directs it inward and looks at theroom of the ancestors, that is the backward-flowing method. Thepower of the kidneys is under the water sign. When the instinctsare stirred, it runs downward, is directed outward, and createschildren. If, in the moment of release, it is not allowed to flowoutward but is led back by the force of thought so that it pene-trates th& crucible of the creative and refreshes heart and bodyand nourishes them, that also is the backward-flowing method.Therefore it is said: The meaning of the Elixir of Life dependsentirely on the backward-flowing method.Circulation of the Light is not only a circulation of theseed-blossom of the one body, but it is, in the first place, acirculation of the' true, creative, formative powers. Ithas to do, not with a momentary fantasy, but with theexhaustion of the circular course (soul-wanderings) ofall the aeons.

Immortality iscontained in this sentence and also the overcoming ofthe world is contained in it. That is the common goalof all religions.The Light is not in the body alone, neither is it onlyoutside the body. Mountains and rivers and the greatEarth are lit by sun and moon; all that is this Light.Therefore it is not only within the body. Understandingand clarity, knowing and enlightenment, and all motion(of the spirit), are likewise this Light; therefore it is notjust something outside the body. The Light-flower ofHeaven and Earth fills all thousand spaces. But also theLight-flower of one body passes through Heaven and coversthe Earth. Therefore, just as the Light is circulating,so Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, are allrotating with it at the same time.

Thebeginning and the end of the work must be one. Inbetween there are cooler and warmer moments, that goeswithout saying. But the goal must be to reach the breadth36"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of Heaven and the depths of the sea, so that all methodsseem quite easy and taken for granted. Only then do wehave it in hand.All holy men have bequeathed this to one another :nothing is possible without contemplation (fan ckao,reflection). When Confucius says : Knowing brings oneto the goal; or when Buddha calls it: The view of theHeart; or Lao Tzii says : Inward vision, it is all thesame.Anyone can talk about reflection, but he cannot masterit if he does not know what the word means. What hasto be changed by reflection is the self-conscious heart,which has to direct itself toward that point where theformative spirit is not yet manifest. Within our 6 ft.body, we must strive for the form which existed beforethe laying down of Heaven and Earth. If to-day peoplesit and meditate only one or two hours, looking only at theirown egos, and call it contemplation, how can any-thing come of it ?The two founders of Buddhism and Taoism havetaught that one should look at the end of one's nose.But they did not mean that one should fasten one'sthoughts to the end of the nose. Neither did they meanthat, while the eyes were looking at the end of the nose,the thoughts should be concentrated on the yellow middle./ Wherever the eye looks, the heart is directed also. Howcan the glance be directed at the same time upward(yellow middle), and downward (end of the nose), oralternating, so that it is now up, now down ? All thatmeans confusing the finger with which one points to themoon with the moon itself.What is really meant by this? The expression,\"end of the nose,\" is very cleverly chosen. The nosemust serve the eyes as a guiding line. If one is not37"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"guided by the nose, either one opens wide the eyes andlooks into the distance, so that the nose is not seen,or the lids shut too much, so that the eyes close, andagain the nose is not seen. But when the eyes are openedtoo wide, one makes the mistake of directing them out-ward, whereby one is easily distracted. If they are closedtoo much, then one makes the mistake of letting themturn inward, whereby one easily sinks into a dreamyreverie. Only when the eyelids are sunk properly half-way, is the end of the nose seen in just the right way.Therefore it is taken as a guiding line. The main thing isto lower the eye-lids in the right way, and then to allowthe Light to stream in of itself, without trying to forcethe Light to stream in by a concentrated effort. Lookingat the nose serves only as the beginning of the innerconcentration, so that the eyes are brought into the rightdirection for looking, and then are held to the guidingline : after that, one can let it be. That is the way a masonhangs up a plumb-line. As soon as he has hung it up,he guides his work by it without continually botheringhimself to look at the plumb-line.Fixating contemplation (13) is a Buddhist methodwhich by no means has been handed down as a secret.One looks with both eyes at the-end of the nose,sits upright and in a comfortable position, and holds theheart to the centre in the midst of conditions (on the fixe3pole in the flight of phenomena). In Taoism it is calledthe yellow middle, in Buddhism the centre in the midst ofconditions. The two are the same. It does not* necessarilymean the middle of the head. It is only a matter of fixingone's thinking on the point which lies exactly between thetwo eyes. Then all is well. The Light is something ex-tremely mobile. When one fixes the thought on the mid-point between the two eyes, the Light streams in of its88"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"own accord. It is not necessary to direct the attentionespecially to the central castle. In these few words themost important thing is contained.44 The centre in the midst of conditions,\" is a veryfine expression. The centre is omnipresent; everythingis contained in it; it is connected with the release of thewhole process of creation. The condition is the portal.The condition, that is the fulfilment of this condition,makes the beginning, but it does not bring about the restwith inevitable necessity. The meaning of these twowords is very fluid and subtle.Fixating contemplation is indispensable, it ensures thestrengthening of illumination. Only one must not stay sittingrigidly if worldly thoughts come up, but one must examinewhere the thought is, where it began, and where it fadesout. Nothing is gained by pushing reflection farther. Onemust be content to see where the thought arose, and notseek beyond the point of origin; for to find the heart(consciousness), to get behind consciousness with con-sciousness-that cannot be done. We want to bring thestates of the heart together in rest, that is true contempla-tion. What contradicts it is false contemplation. Thisleads to no goal. When the flight of thoughts keeps extend-ing farther, one should stop and begin contemplating. Letone contemplate and then start concentrating again. Thatis the double method of strengthening the illumination.It means the circular course of the light. The circularcourse is fixation. The Light is contemplation. Fixationwithout contemplation is circulation without Light. Con-templation without fixation is Light without circulation!Take note of that!The general meaning of this section is that the protection ofthe centre is important for the circular course of the light. Thelast section dealt with the theme that the human body is a very39"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"valuable possession when the primordial spirit is master. Butwhen it is used by the conscious spirit, the latter brings it aboutthat, day and night, the primordial spirit is scattered and wasted.When it is completely worn out, the body dies. The method isdescribed whereby the conscious spirit can be subjected and theprimordial spirit guarded ; that is impossible if one does not beginby making the Light circulate. It is like this : if a splendid house isto be built, a fine foundation must first be found. When the founda-tion is strong, then only can the work proceed and the base of thewalls be deeply and solidly grounded, and the posts and wallsbuilt up. If a foundation is not laid in this way, how can the housebe completed ? The way of cultivating life is exactly like that.The circulation of the Light is to be compared with the foundationof the building. When the foundation stands firm, how quicklyit can be built upon ! To protect the yellow middle with the fire ofthe spirit, that is the work of building. Therefore the Mastermakes especially clear the method by which one enters in the cul-tivation of life, and bids people look with both eyes at the end ofthe nose, to lower the lids, to look within, sit quietly with uprightbody, and fix the heart on the centre in the midst of the conditions.Keeping the thoughts on the space between the two eyesallows the Light to penetrate. Thereupon, the spirit crystallizesand enters the centre in the midst of the conditions. The centrein the midst of the conditions is the lower Elixir-field, the placeof power (solar plexus).The Master hinted at this secretly when he said : At thebeginning of the work one must sit in a quiet room, the body likedry wood, the heart like cooled ashes. Let the lids of both eyesbe lowered ; then look within and purify the heart, cleanse thethoughts, stop pleasures and conserve the seed. One should sitdown daily to meditate with legs crossed. Let the light in the eyesbe stopped; let the hearing power of the ear be crystallizedand the tasting power of the tongue diminished; that is, thetongue should be laid to the roof of the mouth ; let the breathingthrough the nose be made rhythmical and the thoughts fixed onthe dark door. If the breathing is not first made rhythmical it isto be feared that there will be difficulty in breathing, because ofstoppage. When one closes the eyes, then one should take as ameasure a point on the back of the nose which lies not half an inchbelow the intersection point of the line of sight, where there is a40"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"little bump on the nose. Then one begins to collect one's thoughts ;the ears make the breathing rhythmical; body and heart arecomfortable and harmonious. The Light of the eyes must shinequietly, and, for a long time, neither sleepiness nor distractionmust set in. The eyes do not look outward, they drop their lidsand light up what is within. There is Light in this place. Themouth does not speak nor laugh. One closes the lips and breathesinwardly. Breathing is at this place. The nose smells no odours.Smelling is at this place. The ear does not hear things outside.Hearing is at this place. The whole heart watches over what iswithin. Its watching is at this place. The thoughts do notstray outward; true thoughts have continuity in themselves. Ifthe thoughts are lasting, the seed is lasting ; if the seed lasts, thepower lasts; if the power lasts, then will the spirit last also.The spirit is thought; thought is the heart; the heart is the fire ;the fire is the Elixir. When one looks at what is within in this way,the wonders of the opening and shutting of the gates of Heavenwill be inexhaustible. But the deeper secrets cannot be effectedwithout making the breathing rhythmical.If the pupil begins and cannot hold his thoughts to the placebetween the two eyes; if he closes the eyes, but the power of theheart does not enable him to look at the place of power, the causeis most probably the fact that the breathing is too loud and hasty.Other evils arise from this because body and heart are kept busytrying to suppress forcibly the uprush of power and quick breath.If the thoughts are only held to the two eyes, but the spirit isnot crystallized in the solar plexus (the centre in the midst of theconditions), it is as if one had mounted to the hall but had not yetentered the inner chamber. Then the spirit-fire will not develop, thepower remains cold, and the true fruit will hardly manifest itself.Therefore the Master harbours the fear lest, in their efforts, menonly fix their thoughts on the place on the nose, but fail to think offixing their ideas on the place of power; that is why he used thecomparison of the mason with the plumb-line. The mason onlyuses the plumb-line in order to see if his wall is perpendicular orslanting, and for this the string serves as a guiding line. Whenhe has determined the direction, he can begin the work. Butthen he works on the wall, not on the plumb-line. That is clear.From this it is seen that fixing the thoughts between the eyesmeans only what the plumb-line does to the mason. The Master43"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"refers again and again to this because he fears his meaning mightnot be understood. And even if the pupils have grasped the way ofdoing the thing, he fears they might interrupt their work, andso he says several times : \" Only after a hundred days of con-sistent work, only then is the Light real; only then can one beginwork with the spirit-fire,\" If one proceeds in a collected fashion,after a hundred days there develops spontaneously in the Light,a point of the real creative Light (yang). The pupils must examinethat with sincere hearts.4. Circulation of the Light and Making theBreathing Rhythmical.Master Lu Tzii said : The decision must be carriedout with a whole heart, and, the result not sought for;the result will come of itself. In the first period of releasethere are chiefly two mistakes :-laziness, and distraction.But that can be remedied; the heart must not enter intothe breathing too completely. Breathing comes from theheart (14), What comes out of the heart is breath. Whenthe heart stirs, there develops breath-power. Breath-power is originally transformed activity of the heart.When our hearts go very fast they imperceptibly pass intofantasies which are always accompanied by the drawingof a breath, because this inner and outer breathing hangstogether like tone and echo. Daily we draw innumerablebreaths and have an equal number of fantasy-representa-tions. And thus the clarity of the spirit is depleted justas wood dries out and ashes die.Should a man have no images in his mind ? Onecannot be without images. Should one not breathe ?One cannot do without breathing. The best way is tomake a cure out of the illness. Since heart and breath44"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"are mutually dependent, the circulation of the Light mustbe united with the rhythm of breathing. For this, Lightof the ear is above all necessary. There is a Light of theeye and a Light of the ear. The Light of the eye is theunited Light of the sun and moon outside. The light ofthe ear is the united seed of sun and moon within. Theseed is also the Light in crystallized form. Both have thesame origin and are different only in name. Therefore,understanding (ear) and clarity (eye) are one and the sameeffective Light.In sitting down, after dropping the lids, one establishesa plumb-line with the eyes and shifts the Light downward.But if the transposition downward is not successful,then the heart is directed toward listening to the breathing.One should not be able to hear with the ear the out-going and intaking of the breath. What one hears is thatit has no tone. As soon as it has tone, the breathing isrough and superficial, and does not penetrate into whatis fine. Then the heart must be made quite light andinsignificant. The more it is released, the less importantit becomes; the less important, the quieter. All at onceit becomes so quiet that it stops. Then the true breathingis manifested and the form of the heart can be madeconscious. When the heart is light, the breathing islight, for every movement of the heart brings aboutbreathing power. If the breathing is light, the heart islight, for every movement of the breath affects the heart.In order to steady the heart, one begins by cultivatingthe breathing power. The heart cannot be influenceddirectly. Therefore the breathing power is used as ahandle, and this is what is called protecting the collectedbreathing power.Children, do you not understand the nature ofmotion ? Motion can be produced by outside means.45"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"It is onlv another name for mastery. One can makethe heart move merely by running. Should one not beable to bring it to rest then by concentrated quietness ?The great Holy Ones who knew how the heart and breath-ing power mutually influence one another, have thoughtout an easier procedure as a way of helping posterity.In the Book of the Elixir (15) it is said : The hencan hatch her eggs because her heart is always listening.That is an important magic spell. The reason the hencan hatch the eggs is because of the power to heat. Butthe power of the heat can only warm the shells ; it cannotpenetrate into the interior. Therefore with her heart sheconducts this power inward. This she does with herhearing. In this way she concentrates her whole heart.When the heart penetrates, the power penetrates, and thechick receives the power of the heat and begins to live.Therefore a hen, even when she has left her eggs, alwayshas the attitude of listening with bent ear. Thus the con-centration of the spirit is not interrupted. Because theconcentration of the spirit suffers no interruption, neitherdoes the power of heat suffer interruption day or night,and the spirit awakes to life. The awakening of the spiritis accomplished because the heart has first died. When aman can let his heart die, then the primordial spirit wakesto life. To kill the heart does not mean to let it dryand wither away, but it means that it is undivided andgathered into one.Buddha said: When you fix your heart on one point,then nothing is impossible for you. The heart easily runsaway, so it is necessary to gather it together by means ofbreathing power. Breathing power easily becomes coarse,therefore it has to be refined by the heart. When that isdone, can it then happen that it is not fixed ?The two mistakes of laziness and distraction must46"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"be combated by quiet work that is carried on daily withoutinterruption; then results will certainly be achieved.If one is not seated during meditation, one will often bedistracted without noticing it. To become conscious ofthe inattention is the mechanism by which to do away withinattention. Laziness of which a man is conscious; andlaziness of which he is imconscious, are a thousand milesapart. Unconscious laziness is real laziness; consciouslaziness is not complete laziness, because there is still someclarity in it. Distraction comes from letting the spiritwander about; laziness comes from the spirit not yetbeing pure. Distraction is much easier to correct than lazi-ness. It is as in sickness : if one feels pains and itchings,one can help them with remedies, but laziness is likea disease that is attended by loss of feeling. Distractioncan be overcome, confusion can be straightened out,but laziness and absent-mindedness are heavy and dark.Distraction and confusion at least have a place, but inlaziness and absent-mindedness the anima alone is active.In inattention the animus is still present, but in lazinesspure darkness rules. If one becomes sleepy during medita-tion, that is an effect of laziness. Breathing alone servesto remove laziness. Although the breath that flows inand out through the nose is not the true breath, theflowing in and out of the true breath is connectedwith it.While sitting, one must, therefore, always keep theheart quiet and the power concentrated. How can theheart be made quiet? By breathing. The heart alonemust be conscious of the flowing in and out of the breath ;it must not be heard with the ears. If it is not heard,then the breathing is light; if light, it is pure. If it canbe -heard, then the breathing power is heavy; if heavy,then it is troubled; if it is troubled, then laziness and47"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"1absent-mindedness develop and one wants to sleep. Thatis self-evident.How to use the heart correctly during breathingmust be understood. It is use without use. One need onlylet the Light fall quite gently on the hearing. Thissentence contains a secret meaning. What does it meanto let the Light fall ? It is the radiance of the Light ofone's own eyes. The eye looks inward only and notoutward. To sense brightness without looking outwardmeans to look inward ; it has nothing to do with an actuallooking within. What does hearing mean ? It is hearingthe Light of one's own ear. The ear listens only within anddoes not listen to what is outside. To sense brightnesswithout listening to what is outside, is to listen to what iswithin; it has nothing to do with actually listening towhat is within. In this sort of hearing, one only hears thatthere is no sound; in this kind of seeing, one only seesthat no shape is there. If the eye is not looking outwardand the ear is not harkening outward, they close themselvesand are inclined to sink inward. Only when one looksand barkens inward does the organ not go outward norsink inward. In this way laziness and absent-mindednessare done away with. That is the union of the seed and theLight of the sun and moon.If, as a result of laziness, one becomes sleepy, oneshould stand up and walk about. When the spirit hasbecome clear one can sit down again. If there is time inthe morning, one may sit during the burning of an incensecandle, that is the best. In the afternoon, human affairsinterfere and one can therefore easily fall into laziness.It is not necessary to have an incense candle. But onemust lay aside all complications and sit quite still for atime. In the course of time there will be success withoutone's getting lazy and falling asleep.48"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The chief thought of this part is that the most important thingabout the circulation of the Light is making the breathing rhyth-mical. The further the work advances, the deeper becomes theteaching. The pupil must bring heart and breathing into relation-ship during the circulation of the Light in order to avoid the burdenof laziness and distraction. The Master fears lest, during theseance, when the beginners have lowered their lids, confusedfantasies may arise, because of which, the heart will begin to beatso that it is difficult to guide. Therefore he teaches the work ofcounting the breath and fixing the thoughts of the heart in order toprevent the power of the spirit from flowing outward.Because breath comes out of the heart, unrhythmical breath-ing comes from the heart's unrest. Therefore one must breathein and out quite softly so that it remains inaudible to the ear,and only the heart quietly counts the breaths. When the heartforgets the number of breaths, that is a sign that the heart hasgone off into the outer world. Then one must hold the heartsteadfast. If the ear does not listen attentively, or the eyes donot look at the back of the nose, it often happens that the heartruns off outside, or that sleep comes. That is a sign that the con-dition is going over into confusion and absent-mindedness, andthe seed-spirit must be brought into order again. If, in loweringthe lids and taking direction from the nose, the mouth is nottightly closed and the teeth are not clenched firmly together,it can easily happen that the heart hastens outward; then onemust close the mouth quickly and clench the teeth together. Thefive senses order themselves according to the heart, and the spiritmust call the breathing-power to aid, in order that heart and breathare harmonized. In this way there is need at most of daily workof a few quarter-hours for heart and breathing to come of them-selves into the right sort of collaboration and harmony. Thenone need no longer count and breathing becomes rhythmical ofits own accord. When the breathing is rhythmical the mistakesof laziness and distraction disappear of their own accord.49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"5. Mistakes During the Circulation of the LightMaster Lii Tzu said: Your work will gradually drawitself together and mature, but before you reach the con-dition in which you sit like a withered tree before a cliff,there are many other possibilities of error which I wouldlike to bring to your special attention. These conditionsare only recognized when they have been personallyexperienced. I will enumerate them here. My schooldiffers from the Buddhist yoga school (Chao Tsung) (16),in that it has confirmatory signs for each step of the way.First I would like to speak of the mistakes and then of theconfirmatory signs.When one sets out to carry out one's decision, caremust be taken to see that everything can proceed in acomfortable, easy manner. Too much must not be de-manded of the heart. One must be careful that, quiteautomatically, heart and power correspond to one another.Only then can a state of quietness be attained. Duringthis quiet state the right conditions and the right placemust be provided. One must not sit down (to meditate)in the midst of frivolous affairs. That is to say, one mustnot have any vacuities in the mind. All entanglementsmust be put aside and one must be supreme and in-dependent. Nor must the thoughts be directed toward theright procedure. If too much trouble is taken there* isdanger of doing this. I do not mean that no troubleis to be taken, but the right behaviour lies in the middleway between being and non-being. If one can attainpurposelessness through purpose, then the thing has beengrasped. Supreme and without confusion, one goes alongin an, independent way. Furthermore, one must not fallvictim to the ensnaring world. The ensnaring world iswhce the tive kinds of dark demons disport themselves.50"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"This is the ease, for example, when, after fixation,one has chiefly thoughts of dry wood and dead ashes,and few thoughts of the resplendent spring on the greatearth. In this way one sinks into the world of darkness.The power is cold there, breathing is heavy, and manyimages of coldness and decay display themselves. Ifone tarries there long one enters the world of plantsand stones.Nor must a man be led astray by the ten thousandensnarements. This happens if, after the quiet statehas begun, one after another all sorts of ties suddenlyappear. One wants to break through them and cannot;one follows them, and feels relieved by this. This meansthe master has become a servant. If a man tarries in thisstate long he enters the world of illusory desires.At best, one goes to Heaven; at the worst, one goesamong the fox-spirits (17). Such a fox-spirit might alsooccupy himself in the famous mountains enjoying the windand the moon, the flowers and fruits, and taking hispleasure in coral trees and jewelled grass. But afterhe has been occupied thus for three to five hundred years,or at the most, for a couple of thousand years, his rewardis over and he is bom again into the world of turmoil.All of these are wrong paths. When a man knowsthe wrong paths, he can then inquire into the confirma-tory signs.The meaning of this section (18) is to call attention to thewrong paths of meditation so that one can enter the place of powerinstead of the cave of fantasy. This is the world of demons.This, for example, is the case if one sits down to meditate, and seeslight flames or bright colours appear, or if one sees Bodhisatvasand gods approach, or any other similar fantasies. Or, if one is not *successful in uniting power and breathing, if the water of thekidneys cannot rise, but presses downward, the primordial powerbecomes cpld and the breathing heavy. Then the gentle light53"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"powers of the great Earth are too few, and the empty fantasy-world is entered. Or, when one has sat a long time, ideas rise upin crowds and one tries to stop them, but it cannot be done ; onesubmits to being driven by them and feels easier. When thishappens, one must under no circumstances go on with medita-tion but must get up and walk around a little while until heartand power are again in unison ; only then can one return to medita-tion. In meditating, a man must have a sort of conscious intuition,so that he feels power and breathing unite in the field of theElixir; he must feel that a warm release belonging to the trueLight begins to stir dimly. Then he has found the right place.When this right place has been found, one is released from thedanger of getting into the world of illusory desire or dark demons.6. Confirmatory Experiences during the Circula-tion of the LightMaster Lu Tzu said : There are many kinds of con-firmatory experiences. One must not content oneself withsmall demands but must rise to the thought that allliving creatures have to be freed. It is not permissible tobe trivial and irresponsible in heart. One must strive to. make deeds prove one's words.If, when there is quiet, the spirit has continuouslyand uninterruptedly a sense of great gaiety as if intoxicatedor freshly bathed, it is a sign that the Light principle in\"the whole bodv is harmonious ; then the Golden Flowerbegins to bud. When, furthermore, all openings are quiet,and the silver moon stands in the middle of Heaven, andone has the feeling that the great Earth is a world of light>and brilliancy, that is a sign that the body of the heartopens itself to clarity. It is a sign that the Golden Floweris opening.Furthermore, the whole body feels strong and firmso that it fears neither storm nor frost. Things by which"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"other men are displeased, when I meet them, cannotcloud the brightness of the seed of the spirit. Yellowgold fills the house; the steps are white jade. Rottenand stinking things on Earth that come in contact withone breath of the true power will immediately live again.Red blood becomes milk. The fragile body of the flesh issheer gold and diamonds. That is a sign that the GoldenFlower is crystallized.The Book of Successful Contemplation (Ying KuanChing) says : The sun sinks in the Great Water andmagic pictures of trees in rows arise. The setting ofthe sun means that in Chaos (in the world beforephenomena, that is, the intelligible world), a foundationis laid : that is the condition free of opposites {wu chi).Highest good is like water, pure and spotless. It is theruler of the Great Polarity, the god who is revealed in thesign for that which greatly disturbs, Chin (19). Chenis also symbolized by wood, wherefore the image of treesin rows appears. A sevenfold row of trees means thelight of the seven body-openings (or heart-openings).In the norlii-west is the direction of the creative. Whenit moves on one place farther, the abysmal is there.The sim which sinks into the Great Water is the imagefor the creative and abysmal. The abysmal is the directionof midnight (mouse, Tzu% north). At the winter solsticethe thunder (Chin) is in the middle of the Earth quitehidden and covered up. Only when the sign Chin isreached, does the Light-pole come over the earth again.That is the picture representing the row of trees. Therest can be correspondingly inferred.The second part refers to the building of the founda-tion ojn this. The great world is like ice, a glassy worldof jewels. The brilliancy of the Light is graduallycrystallized. That is why a great terrace arises and upon55"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"it, in the course of time, Buddha appears. When theGolden Being appears who should it be but Buddha ?For Buddha is the Golden Saint of the Great Enlighten-ment. This is a great confirmatory experience.Now there are three confirmatory experiences whichcan be tested. The first is that, when one has enteredthe state of meditation, the gods (20) are in the valley.Men are heard talking as though at a distance of severalhundred paces, each one quite clear. But the soundsare all like an echo in a valley. One can always hear them,but never oneself. This is called the presence of thegods in the valley.At times the following can be experienced : as soonas one is quiet, the Light of the eyes begins to blaze up,so that everything before one becomes quite bright asif one were in a cloud. If one opens one's eyes andseeks the body, it is not to be found any more. This iscalled : In the empty chamber it grows light. Inside andoutside, everything is equally light. \"That is a veryfavourable sign. Or, when one sits in meditation, thefleshly body becomes quite shining like silk or jade. Itseems difficult to remain sitting ; one feels as if drawnupward. This is called: The spirit returns and pushesagainst Heaven. In time, one can experience it in sucha way that one really floats upward.And now it is possible to leave all three of theseexperiences. But not everything can be expressed.Different things appear to each person according to hisgifts. If one experiences these things, it is a sign of agood aptitude. With these things it is just as it is whenone drinks water. One can tell for oneself whether thewater is warm or cold. In the same way a man mustconvince himself about these experiences, then only arethey real.56"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"7. The Living Manner of the Circulation of theLightMaster Lii Tzii said : When there is gradual successin producing the circulation of the Light, a man mustnot give up his ordinary occupation in doing it. Theancients said : When occupations come to us, we mustaccept them ; when things come to us, we must understandthem from the ground up* If the occupations are regulatedby correct thoughts, the Light is not scattered by outsidethings, but circulates according to its own law. Eventhe still-invisible circulation of the Light gets started thisway, how much more then is it the case with the truecirculation of the Light which has already manifesteditself clearly. When in ordinary life one has the abilityalways to react to things by reflexes only, without anyadmixture of a thought of others or of oneself, that isa circulation of the Light arising out of circumstances.It is the first secret.If, early in the morning, a man can rid himself of allentanglements and meditate from one to two doublehours, and then can orientate himself toward all activitiesand outside things in a purely objective, reflex way, andif this can be continued without any interruption, thenafter two or three months, all the perfected Ones comefrom Heaven and sanctify such behaviour.The preceding section deals with the blissful fields that areentered when one succeeds in the work. The aim of this part is toshow the pupils how they must shape their work more finely dayby day so that they can hope for an early attainment of the Elixirof Life. How does it happen that the Master just here speaksof the fact that a man ought not to give up his calling in life as acitizen ? It might be thought from this that the Master wantedto prevent the pupil from attaining the Elixir of Life quickly.He who knows replies to this : Not at all! The Master is concerned57"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"lest the pupil may not have fulfilled his karma, therefore he speaksin this way. Now if the work has led into the blissful fields, theheart is like the reflecting surface of water. When things come, itmirrors- things; when they go, spirit and power spontaneouslyunite and do not allow themselves to be carried away by outsidethings. That is what the Master means when he says: Everyinterference of the thought with other people and with oneselfmust be completely given up. When the pupil succeeds in con-centrating with true thoughts on the place of power, he does nothave to start the Light circulating, and the Light circulates byitself. But when the Light circulates, the Elixir is made spon-taneously, and the performance of worldly tasks at the same timeis not a hindrance. It is different at the beginning of the work ofmeditation when spirit and power are still scattered and confused.If worldly affairs cannot then be kept at a distance, and a quietplace found where one can concentrate with all one's power, andthus avoid all disturbances from ordinary occupations, then one isperhaps industrious in the morning and certainly lazy in theevening. How long would it take in this way till a man attained tothe real secrets ? Therefore it is said : When one begins to applythe work, one should put aside household affairs. And, if that isnot wholly possible, someone ought to be engaged to look afterthem, so that one can take pains with complete attention. Butwhen the work is so far advanced that secret confirmations areexperienced, it docs not matter if, at the same time, the ordinaryaffairs are put in order, so that one can fulfil one's karma. Thismeans the living manner of the circulation of the Light. Longdgo, the true man of the purple Polar-Light (Tzu-yang ChÂ£n Jen),made a saying: When a man lives in contact with the world,and yet still in harmony with the Light, then the round is roundand the angular has angles ; then he lies among men concealed,yet visible, different, and yet the same, and none can compass it;then no one takes note of our secret life and being. The livingmanner of the circulation of the Light has just this meaning: Tolive in contact with the world and yet in harmony with the Light.58"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"8. A Magic Spell for the Far JourneyMaster Lii Tzii said : Yu Ch'ing has left behind hima magic spell for the Far Journey :Four words crystallize the spirit in the place of power.In the sixth month the white snow is suddenly seen to fly.At the third watch the disk of the sun sends out shining rays.On the water blows the wind of gentleness.Wandering in Heaven, one eats the spirit-power of the receptive.And the deeper secret within the secret :The land that is nowhere, that is the true home ....55These verses are full of mystery. The meaning is :The most important thing in the Great Meaning is thefour words: non-action in action. Non-action preventsa man from becoming entangled in form and image (sub-stantiality). Action in non-action prevents a man fromsinking into numbing emptiness and a dead nothingness.The effect depends entirely on the central One ; the freeingof the effect is in the two eyes. The two eyes are likethe pole of the Great Wain which turns the whole ofcreation; they cause the poles of Light and Darkness torotate. The Elixir depends from beginning to end onthe One; the metal in the middle of the water, that is,the lead in the water-region. Heretofore we have spokenof the circulation of the Light, indicating thereby theinitial release which works from without upon what lieswithin. This is to aid one in obtaining the Master. It isfor the pupils in the beginning stages. They go throughthe two lower transitions in order to gain the upper one.After the sequence of events is clear and the nature ofthe release is known, Heaven no longer withholds theMeaning, but reveals the ultimate truth.

But there is a still more marvellouskind of circulation. Till now we have worked from theoutside on what is within; now we tarry in the centre andrule what is external. Hitherto, it was a service in aidof the Master; now it is a dissemination of the commandsof this Master. The whole relationship is now reversed.If one wants to penetrate the more delicate regions bythis method, one must first see to it that body and heartare completely controlled, that one is quite free and atpeace, letting go of all entanglements, untroubled by theslightest excitement, with the Heavenly Heart exactlyin the middle. Then let one lower the lids of the twoeyes as if one received a holy edict, a summons to theminister. Who would dare disobey ? Then one illuminesthe house of the abysmal (water, K'an) with both eyes.Wherever the Golden Flower appears, the true Light ofpolarity goes out to meet it. The principle of that whichadheres to (lightness, Li), is light outside and darkwithin; it is the body of the creative. Darkness entersand becomes master. The result is that the heart(consciousness), becomes dependent on things, is directedoutward, and is tossed about on the stream. When therotating light shines within the heart, it does not becomedependent on things, the power of the Dark is limited,and the Golden Flower shines with concentration. It isthen the collected Light of polarity. Things which arerelated attract each other. Thus the polarity Light-line of the abysmal presses upward. It is not only theLight in the abyss, but it is creative Light meetingcreative Light.

This is the state of which it is said : Cloudsfill the thousand mountains. Gradually it [life] goes hereand there quite quietly; it rises and falls imperceptibly.The pulse stands still and breathing stops. This is themoment of true creative unity, the state of which it issaid : The moon gathers up the ten thousand waters.In the midst of this darkness, the Heavenly Heart suddenlybegins a movement. This is the return of the one Light,the time when the child comes to life.But the details of this must be carefully explained.When a person looks at something, listens to something,eyes and ears move and follow the things until they havepassed. These movements are all underlings, and whenthe Heavenly ruler follows them in their tasks, it means :To live together with demons.If now, during every movement and every momentof rest, a person lives together with people and not withdemons, then the Heavenly ruler is the true man.When he moves and we move with him, the movement isthe root of Heaven. When he is quiet and we are quietwith him, this quietness is the cave of the moon. Whenhe continues to alternate movement and quietness, oneought to go on with him unceasingly in movement andquietness. If he rises and falls with inhaling and exhaling,we must rise and fall with him. That is what is calledgoing to and fro between the root of Heaven and the caveof the moon.When the Heavenly Heart still preserves calm, move-ment before the right time is a fault of softness.

Thus the Light of the spirit seesthe summit that is the leader. This movement is inaccord with the time. The Heavenly Heart rises to thesummit of the creative, where it expands in completefreedom. Then suddenly it wants the deepest silence,and one must lead it speedily and with one's whole beinginto the yellow castle. Thus the eyes behold the centralyellow dwelling place of the spirit.When the desire for silence comes, not a single thoughtarises; he who is looking inward suddenly forgets thathe looks. At this time, body and heart must be leftcompletely free. All entanglements disappear withouttrace. Then I no longer know at what place the houseof my spirit and my crucible are. If a man wants to makecertain of his body, he cannot get at it. This conditionis the penetration of Heaven into Earth, the time when allwonders return to their roots.The One is the circulation of the Light. If one begins,it is at first scattered and one tries to collect it; the sixsenses are not active. This is the care and nourishmentof one's own origin, the filling up of the oil when onegoes to receive life. When, one is far enough to havegathered it, one feels light and free and need take nofurther trouble. This is the quieting of the spirit in thespace of the ancestors, the taking possession of formerHeaven.When one is so far advanced that every shadow andevery echo has disappeared, so that one is quite quiet andfirm, it is safe within the cave of power, where all thatis miraculous returns to its roots.

If,when not stimulated by external things, one is moved,it is the movement of Heaven. The being that is placedover against Heaven, can fall and come under the domina-tion of the instincts. The instincts are based upon thefact that there are external things. They are thoughtsthat go on beyond their own position. Then movementleads to movement. But, when no idea arises, the rightideas come. That is the true idea. If things are quietand one is quite firm, the release of Heaven suddenlymoves. Is this not a movement without purpose ?

Thetwo next lines are concerned with the mutual inter-penetration of sun and moon. The sixth month is theadhering (Li) fire. The white snow that flies, is the truedarkness of polarity in the middle of the fire sign, that isabout to turn into the receptive. The third watch isthe abysmal (K'ari) water.

The following two lines haveto do with the activity of the pole of the Great Wain, therise and fall of the whole release of polarity.

It is the washing of the heart and the purificationof the thoughts; it is the bath. The holy science takesas a beginning the knowledge of where to stop, and asan end, stopping at the highest good. Its beginning isbeyond polarity and it empties again beyond polarity.Buddha speaks of the transient, the creator ofconsciousness, as being the fundamental truth of religion.And, in our Taoism, the expression \" to produceemptiness \" contains the whole work of completing lifeand essence. All three religions agree in the one proposi-tion, the finding of the spiritual Elixir in order to passfrom death to life. In what does this spiritual Elixirconsist ? It means forever tarrying in purposelessness.The deepest secret in our teaching, the secret of the bath,is confined to the work of making the heart empty. There-with the heart is set at rest. What I have revealed herein a word is the fruit of decades of effort.If you are not yet clear as to how far all three partscan be present in one part, I will make it clear to youthrough the threefold Buddhist contemplation aboutemptiness, delusion, and the centre.Emptiness comes as the first of the three contempla-tions. All things are looked upon as empty. Then followsdelusion. Although it is known that they are empty,thiiigs are not destroyed, but a man attends to his affairsin the midst of the emptiness. But though one does notdestroy things, neither does one pay attention to them;this is contemplation of the centre. While practising66 ,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"contemplation of the empty, one also knows that onecannot destroy the ten thousand things, and still onedoes not notice them. In this way the three contempla-tions fall together. But, after all, strength is in visioningthe empty. Therefore, when one practises contemplationof emptiness, emptiness is certainly empty, but delusionis empty also, and the centre is empty. It needs a greatstrength to practise contemplation of delusion; thendelusion is really delusion, but emptiness is also delusion,and the centre is also delusion. Being on the way of thecentre, one also creates images of the emptiness, but theyare not called empty, but are called central. One practisesalso contemplation of delusion, but one does not call itdelusion, one calls it central. As to what has to do withthe centre, more need not be said.This section mentions first Yu Ch'ing's magical charm for theFar Journey. The magical charm states that the secret wonder ofthe Meaning is the developing of something out of nothing. Inthat spirit and power unite in crystallized form, there appears,in the course of time, in the middle of the emptiness of nothing,a point of the true fire. During this time, the more quiet the spiritbecomes, the brighter is the fire. The brilliance of the fire iscompared with the sun's heat in the sixth month. Because theblazing fire causes the water of the abysmal to vaporize, the steairis heated, and when it has passed the boiling point, it mountsupward like flying snow. It is meant by this that snow is seen tofly in the sixth month. But because the water is vaporized by thefire, the true power is awakened; yet, when Darkness is at rest,light begins to move; it is like midnight. Therefore adeptscall this time the time of the living midnight. At this time, oneworks at the power with the purpose of making it rise and flowbackward, and fall, flowing downward, like the turning of the wheelof the rising sun. Therefore it is said: At the third watch, thedisk of the sun sends out shining rays. The rotation methodmakes use of breathing to blow on the fire of the gates of life: in thisway the true power is successfully brought to its original place.Therefore it is said that the wind blows on the water. Out of the67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"single power of former Heaven, there develops the out- and thein-going breath of later Heaven and its power to set aflame.The way leads from the sacrum upward in a backward-flowing manner to the summit of the creative, and on throughthe house of the creative ; then it sinks through two stories in adownward-flowing way into the solar plexus, and warms it. There-fore it is said: Wandering in Heaven, one eats the spirit-powerof the receptive. Because the true power goes back into theempty place, in time, power and form become rich and full; bodyand heart become glad and cheerful. If, by the work of the turningof the Wheel of the Doctrine, this cannot be achieved, how other-wise should one be able to enter upon this Far Journey ? What itamounts to is this : The crystallized spirit flows back to the spirit-fire, and by means of the greatest quiet, one fans the \" fire in themiddle of the water which is in the middle of the cave. There-fore it is said : And the deeper secret within the secret: theLand that is nowhere, that is the true home.The pupil has penetrated in his work into mysterious territory;but, if he does not know the method of melting, it is to be fearedthat the Elixir of Life will not be produced. Therefore the Masterhas revealed the secret strictly guarded by the former holy men.When the pupil keeps the crystallized spirit fixed within the caveof power, and, at the same time, lets greatest quietness hold sway,then out of the obscure darkness, a something develops out of thenothingness, that is, the Golden Flower of the Great One appears.At this time the conscious Light is differentiated from the Lightof the essence. Therefore it is said : To move when stimulatedby external things, leads to its going downward and outward andcreating a man. That is conscious Light. If, at the time the truepower has been copiously gathered together, the pupil does notlet it flow downward and outward, but allows it to flow backward,that is the Light of Life ; the method of the turning of the water-wheel must be used. If one continues to turn, the true powerreturns to the roots, drop by drop. Then the water-wheel stops,the body is clean, the power is fresh. One single turning meansone Heavenly cycle, that which Master Chiu has called a smallHeavenly cycle. If one does not wait to use the power until ithas been collected suflBciently, it is then too tender and weak, andthe Elixir is not formed. If the power is there and not used, then itbecomes too old and rigid, and also the Elixir of Life will hardly be68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"produced. When it is neither too old nor too tender, then is theright time to use it with intention. This is what Buddha meanswhen he says: The phenomenon flows into emptinesSo Thisis the subUmation of the seed into power. If the pupil does notunderstand this principle, and lets the power stream away down-ward, then the power forms into seed ; this is what is meant whenit is said: Emptiness finally flows into the phenomenon. Butevery man who unites bodily with a woman feels pleasure firstand then bitterness; when the seed has flowed out, the body istired and the spirit languid. It is quite different when the adeptlets spirit and power unite. That brings first purity and thenfreshness ; when the seed is transformed, the body is healthy andfree. There is a tradition that the old Master P'eng grew to be 880years old because he made use of serving maids to nourish his life,but that is a misunderstanding. In reality, he used the method ofsublimation of spirit and power. In the Elixirs of Life symbols aregenerally used, and in them the adhering fire (Li) is frequentlycompared to a bride, and the water of the abyss to the boy (pueraeternus). From this arose the misunderstanding about MasterP'eng having restored his virility through femininity. These aremistakes that have forced their way in later.But adepts can only use the means of overthrowing theabysmal and the adhering (Li) when their purposes are sincerelyin the work, otherwise a pure mixture is not produced. The truepurpose is subject to the Earth. The colour of the Earth is yellow ;therefore in books on the Life Elixir, it is symbolized by theyellow germ. When the abysmal and the adhering (Li) unite,the Golden Flower appears ; the golden colour is white, and there-fore white snow is used as a symbol. But worldly people who donot understand the secret words of the books of the Life Elixir,have misunderstood yellow and white in that they have taken itas a means of making gold out of stones. Is not that foolish ?An ancient adept said: Formerly, every school knew thisjewel, only fools did not know it wholly. If we reflect on this wesee that the ancients really attained long life by the help of theseed-power present in their own bodies, and did not lengthen theiryears by swallowing this or that sort of elixir. But worldly peoplelose the roots and cling to the tree-tops. The Book of theElixir also says: When the right man (white magician) makesuse of wrong means, the wrong means work in the right way.69"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"By this is meant the transformation of seed into power. \" But ifthe wrong man uses the right means, the right means work in thewrong way.\" By this is meant the bodily union of man andwoman from which spring sons and daughters. The fool wastes themost precious jewel of his body in uncontrolled pleasure,, and doesnot know how to conserve the power of his seed. When it is finished,the body perishes. The Holy and Wise men have no other way oftaking care of their lives except by destroying lusts and safe-guarding the seed. The seed that is conserved is transformed intopower, and the power, when there is enough of it, makes thecreatively strong body. The difference shown by ordinary peopledepends only upon how they apply the downward-flowing way orthe backward-flowing way.The whole meaning of this section is directed toward makingclear to the pupil the method of the filling up the oil in meeting life.Here the eyes are the chief thing. The two eyes are the handle of thepolar constellation. Just as Heaven turns about the polar star as acentre point, so among.men the right intention must be the master.Therefore the completion of the Life Elixir depends entirely on theharmonizing of the right intention. Then, if it is said that thefoundation can be laid in a hundred days, first of all the degreeof industry in work must be taken into account, and the degreeof strength in the physical constitution. Whoever is eager in thework, and has a strong constitution, succeeds more quickly inturning back the water wheel of the river. When a person hasfound the method of making thoughts and power harmonize withone another, he can complete the Elixir within a hundred days.But whoever is weak and lazy will not produce it \"even after thehundred days. When the Elixir is completed, spirit and power arepure and clear; the heart is empty,' the essence manifest,and the light of consciousness transforms itself into theLight of the essence. If the Light of the essence is held per-manently, the abysmal and the adhering (fire Li) have intercoursespontaneously. When the abysmal and the fire mix, the holyfruit is borne. The ripening of the holy fruit is the effect of a greatHeavenly cycle. Further elucidation stops with the method ofthe Heavenly cycle.This book is concerned with the cultivation of life and showsat first how one takes hold of it by looking at the bridge of one'snose. The method of making firm and letting go is in anotherbook, the Hsu Ming Fang (Methods of Prolonging Life).70 -"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Remarks1.

Later,the sexual polarities and others as well, are derived from them.From yin comes Kun, the receptive feminine principle; fromyang comes ChHen, the creative masculine principle ; from yincomes wiing, life; from yang, hsing or essence.Each individual contains a central monad which, at themoment of conception, splits into life and essence, ming and hsing.These two are super-individual principles, and so can be relatedto eros and logos.In the personal bodily existence of the individual they arerepresented by two other polarities, a p'o soul (or anima) and ahun soul (or animus). All during the life of the individual thesetwo are in conflict, each striving for mastery. At death theyseparate and go different ways. The anima sinks to earth as kuei,a ghost-being.

Difficulties encountered by a European inTRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE EASTA thorough Westerner in feeling, I am necessarilydeeply impressed by the strangeness of this Chinese text.It is true that a certain knowledge of Eastern religionsand philosophies aids my intellect and intuition in under-standing these ideas, partly at least, just as I can fathomthe paradoxes of primitive religious ideas 4 4 ethnologic-ally or as a matter of the \" comparative history ofreligions This, in fact, is the Western way of hidingone's own heart under the cloak of so-called scientificunderstanding. We do it partly because of the miserablevanite des savants which fears and rejects with horrorany sign of living sympathy, and partly because an under-standing that reaches the feelings might allow contactwith the foreign spirit to become a serious experience.So-called scientific objectivity would therefore haveinsisted on reserving this text for the philological acuityof sinologues, and would have guarded it jealously fromany other interpretation. But Richard Wilhelm haspenetrated too deeply into the secret and mysterious lifeof Chinese wisdom for him to have allowed such a pearlof great insight to be shelved by any one of the specialsciences. It is an especial honour and pleasure that hischoice of a psychological commentator has fallen upon me.However, in this way, this rare piece of generalknowledge runs the risk of being stowed away upon theshelf of yet another of the special sciences. Yet whoever77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"seeks to minimize the merits of Western science is under-mining the main support of the European mind. Scienceis not, indeed, a perfect instrument, but none the less it isan invaluable, superior one which only works harm whentaken as an end in itself. Scientific method must serve;it errs when it usurps a throne. It must be ready toserve all branches of science, because each, by reason of.its insufficiency, has need of support from the others.Science is the best tool of the Western mind and with itmore doors can be opened than with bare hands. Thus itis part and parcel of our understanding and only cloudsour insight when it lays claim to being the one and onlyway of comprehending. But it is the East that has taughtus another, wider, more profound, and a higher under-standing, that is, understanding through life. We knowthis way only vaguely, as a mere shadowy sentimentculled from religious terminology, and therefore we gladlydispose of Eastern \" wisdom \" in quotation marks, andpush it away into the obscure territory of faith andsuperstition. But in this way Eastern \" realism\" iscompletely misunderstood. It does not consist of senti-mental, exaggeratedly mystical, intuitions bordering onthe pathological and emanating from ascetic recluses andcranks; the wisdom of the East is based on practicalknowledge coming from the flower of Chinese intelligence,which we have not the slightest justification for under-valuing.This assertion may, perhaps, seem extremely bold,and therefore will incite a certain amount of doubt, but,considering the extraordinary dearth of knowledge aboutthe material, doubt is pardonable. Moreover, the strange-ness of the material is so arresting that our embarrass-ment as to how and when the Chinese world of thoughtmight be joined to ours, is quite understandable. When78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"faced with this problem of grasping the ideas of the East,the usual mistake of the Western man is like that of thestudent in Faust. Ill-advised by the devil, he con-temptuously turns his back on science, and, getting a whiffof eastern ecstatics, takes over their yoga practices quiteliterally, only to become a pitiable imitator. (Theosophyis our best example of this mistake.) And so he abandonsthe one safe foundation of the Western mind, and loseshimself in a mist of words and ideas which never wouldhave originated in European brains, and which can neverbe profitably grafted upon them.An ancient adept has said : But if the wrong manuses the right means, the right means work in the wrongway. This Chinese saying, unfortunately all too true,stands in sharp contrast to our belief in the \" right\"method irrespective of the man who applies it. In reality,when it comes to things like these, everything dependson the man and little or nothing on the method. Thelatter is only the way and direction laid down by a manin order that his action may be the true expression of hisnature. If it fails to be this, then the method is nothingmore than an affectation, something artificially pieced on,rootless and sapless, serving only the illegitimate goal ofself-deception. It becomes a means of fooling oneselfand of evading what is perhaps the implacable law ofone's being.This has nothing whatever to do with the earth-bomquality and sincerity of Chinese thought. On the contrary,it is the denial of one's own being, a self-betrayal tostrange and unclean gods, a cowardly trick for the purposeof usurping psychic superiority, everything in fact, whichis profoundly contrary to the meaning of Chinese\" method Their views result from a way of life thatis complete, genuine, and true in the fullest sense; they79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"are views that come from that ancient, cultural life ofChina which has grown both logically and coherently fromdeep instincts, and which, for us, is forever remote andinimitable,Western imitation of the East is doubly tragic in thatit comes from a psychological misunderstanding as sterileas are the modern escapades in New Mexico, theblissful South Sea Islands, and Central Africa, where\" primitivity\" is being staged in all seriousness, in orderthat western civilized man may covertly slip out of hismenacing duties, his Hie Rhodus hie satta. It is not forus to imitate what is organically foreign, or worse still,to send out missionaries to foreign peoples ; it is our taskto build up our own Western culture, which sickens witha thousand ills. This has to be done on the spot, and intothe work must be drawn the real European as he is in hiswestern commonplaceness, with his marriage problems,his neuroses, his social and political illusions, and hiswhole philosophical disorientation*We should do well to confess at once, that, funda-mentally speaking, we do not understand the utterunworldliness of a text like this, indeed, that we do notwant to understand it. Have we, perhaps, an inkling thata mental attitude which can direct the glance inward tothat extent owes its detachment from the world to thefact that those men have so completely fulfilled theinstinctive demands of their natures that little or nothingprevents them from perceiving the invisible essence of theworld ? Can it be, perhaps, that the condition of suchknowledge is freedom from those desires, ambitions, andpassions, which bind us to the visible world, and mustnot this freedom result from the intelligent fulfilment ofinstinctive demands, rather than from a prematurerepression, or one growing out of fear ? Do we only80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"become free to know the world of the mind when thelaws of earth have been obeyed ? The man who knowsthe history of Chinese culture, and who besides hascarefully studied the / Ching, that book of wisdompermeating all Chinese thought for thousands of years,will not lightly wave aside these doubts. He will know,moreover, that in the Chinese sense, the views set forthin our text are nothing extraordinary, but are quite/Unescapable, psychological conclusions.. r For a long time, spirit, and the passion of the spirit,were the greatest values and the things most worthstriving for in our peculiar Christian culture of the mind.Only after the decline of the Middle Ages, that is, in thecourse of the nineteenth century, when spirit began todegenerate into intellect, there set in a reaction againstthe unbearable domination of intellectualism which ledto the pardonable mistake of confusing intellect withspirit, and blaming the latter for the misdeeds of theformer. Intellect does, in fact, violate the soul when ittries to possess itself of the heritage of the spirit. It isin no way fitted to do this, because spirit is somethinghigher than intellect in that it includes not only the latter,but the feelings as well. It is a line or principle of lifethat strives after superhuman, shining heights; but, inopposition to it, stands the dark, earth-born, feminineprinciple with its emotionality and instinctiveness reachingfar back into the depths of time, and into the roots ofphysiological continuity. Without a doubt, these conceptsare purely intuitive visions, but one cannot dispense withthem if one tries to understand the nature of the humansoul. China could not dispense with them because, as thehistory of Chinese philosophy shows, it has never goneso far from central psychic facts as to lose itself in a one-sided over-development and over-valuation of a single81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"psychic function., Therefore, the Chinese have neverfailed to recognize the paradoxes and the polarity inherentin all life. The opposites always balance on the scales-a sign of high culture. Onesidedness, though it lendsmomentum, is a mark of barbarism. Therefore, I canonly take the reaction which begins in the West againstthe intellect in favour of eros, and in favour of intuition,as a mark of cultural advance, a widening of consciousnessbeyond the too narrow limits set by a tyrannical intellect. ,But it is far from my wish to undervalue thetremendous differentiation of western intellect, because,measured by it, eastern intellect can be described aschildish. (Obviously this has nothing to do with intelli-gence.) If we should succeed in bringing another, or stilla third function to the dignity accorded intellect, then theWest could expect to surpass the East by a very greatdeal. It is therefore lamentable indeed when the Europeanis false to himself and imitates the East or \" affects \" itin any way. He would have so much greater possibilitiesif he would remain true to himself and develop out of Hisown nature all that the East has brought forth from itsinner being in the course of the centimes.In general, and looked at from the incurably externalpoint of view of the intellect, it will seem as if the thingsso highly valued by the East were not desirable for us.Above all, mere intellect cannot fathom the practicalimportance eastern ideas miglvt have for us, and that iswhy it can classify these ideas as philosophical, andethnological curiosities and nothing more. The lack ofcomprehension goes, so fijr, that even learned sinologueshave not understood the practical application of the/ Ching, and have therefore looked on the book as acollection of abstruse magic Alarms."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"2. Modern Psychology offers a Possibility ofUnderstandingMy experience in my practice has been such as toreveal to me a quite new and unexpected approach toeastern wisdom. But it must be well understood thatI did not have as a starting point a more or less adequateknowledge of Chinese philosophy. On the contrary, when I began my life-work in the practice of psychiatryand psychotherapy, I was completely ignorant of Chinesephilosophy, and it is only later that my professionalexperiences have shown me that in my technique I hadbeen unconsciously led along that secret way which forcenturies has been the preoccupation of the best mindsof the East. This might have been taken for subjectiveimagination-one reason for my previous hesitancy inpublishing anything on the subject-but Wilhelm, thatexpert authority on the soul of China, has openly confirmedthe coincidence for me. In so doing, he has given me thecourage to write about a Chinese text which, thoughbelonging in essence to the mysterious shadows of theeastern mind, yet at the same time, and this is important,shows striking parallels to the course of psychic develop-ment in my patients, none of whom is Chinese.In order to make this strange fact more intelligibleto the reader, it must be mentioned that just as thehuman body shows a common anatomy over.and above allracial differences, so too, does the psyche possess a commonsubstratum.

As a common huijian heritage it transcendsall differences of culture and consciousness and-does notconsist merely of contentsr capable of becoming conscious,but of latent disposiffeps toward identical reactions.Thus the fact of tbe coHctive unconscious is simply88 ' ."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the psychic expression of identity of brain-structureirrespective of all racial differences. By its means canbe explained the analogy, going even as far as identity,between various myth-themes and symbols, and thepossibility of human understanding in general. Thevarious lines of psychic development start from onecommon stock whose roots reach b&ck ho the past. Heretoo lies the psychological paraUelisnpt with apwaafeTaken purely psychologically, it means that wecommon instincts of ideation (imagination), and of action.All conscious imagination and action have grown out ofthese unconscious prototypes, and remain bound up withthem. Especially is this the case when consciousnesshas not attained any high degree of clarity, that is, when,in all its functions, it is more dependent on the instinctsthan on the conscious will, more governed by affect thanby rational judgment. This condition ensures a primitivehealth of the psyche, which, however, immediately becomes4ack of adaptiveness as soon as there arise circumstancesthat call for a higher moral effort. Instincts suffice onlyfor a nature which, on the whole, remains on one level.An individual who is more guided by unconscious choicethan by the conscious one, tends therefore toward out-spoken psychic conservatism. This is the reason theprimitive does not change in the course of thousands ofyears, and it is also the cause of his fearing everythingstrange and unusual. Were he less conservative, it mightlead to maladaptation, and thus to the greatest of psychicdangers, namely a kind of neurosis. A higher and widerconsciousness which only comes by means of assimilatingthe unfamiliar, tends toward autonomy, toward revolu-tion against the old gods who are nothing other than thosepowerful, unconscious, primordial images which, up tothis time, have held consciousness in thrall.84"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The more powerful and independent consciousnessbecomes, and with it the conscious will, the more is theunconscious forced into the background. When thishappens, it becomes easily possible for the consciousstructures to be detached from the unconscious images.Gaining thus in freedom, they break the chains of mereinstinctiveness, and finally arrive at a state that is deprivedof, or contrary to instinct. Consciousness thus torn fromits roots and no longer able to appeal to the authority ofthe primordial images, possesses a Promethean freedom,it is true, but it also partakes of the nature of a godlesshybris. It soars above the earth, even above mankind,but the danger of capsizing is there, not for everyindividual, to be sure, but collectively for the weakmembers of such a society, who again Promethean-like,are bound by the unconscious to the Caucasus. The wiseChinese would say in the words of the / Ching: Whenyang has reached its greatest strength, the dark powerof yin is bom within its depths ; night begins at middaywhen yang breaks up and begins to change into yin.A physician is in a position to see this cycle ofchanges translated literally into life. He sees, for instance,a successful business man attaining all his desires regardlessof death and the devil, and then withdrawing fromactivity at the crowning point of his- success. In a shorttime the man falls into a neurosis, which changes himinto a querulous old woman, fastens him to his bed, andthus finally destroys him. The picture is complete evento the change from the masculine to the feminine attitude.An exact parallel to this is the legend of Nebuchadnezzarin the book of Daniel, and the type of lunacy of Caesarsin general. Similar cases of a one-sided exaggeration inthe conscious standpoint, and of a corresponding yinreaction of the unconscious, form no small part of the85"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"practice of nerve specialists of our time, a time which soover-values the conscious will as to believe that \" wherethere is a will there is a way Not that I wish to detractin the least from the high moral value of conscious willing;consciousness and will should not be depreciated butshould be considered as the greatest cultural achieve-ments of humanity. But of what use is a morality thatdestroys humanity ? The bringing of will and capacityinto harmony seems to me to be something more thanmorality. Morality a tout price-a sign of barbarism-oftentimes wisdom is better; but perhaps I look at thisthrough the professional glasses of the physician whohas to mend the ills following in the wake of an exaggeratedcultural achievement.Be that as it may. In any case, it is a fact that conscious-ness, increased by a necessary one-sidedness, gets so farout of touch with the primordial images as to make acollapse inevitable- Long before the actual catastrophe,the signs of the mistake announce themselves as absenceof instinct, nervousness, disorientation, and entanglementin impossible situations and problems, etc. When thephysician comes to investigate, he finds an unconsciouswhich is in complete rebellion against the values of theconscious, and which, therefore, cannot possibly beassimilated to the conscious, while the reverse is altogetherout of the question. One is then confronted with anapparently irreconcilable conflict with which human reasoncannot deal except by sham solutions or dubious com-promises. If both these evasions are rejected, one is facedwith the question as to what has become of the muchneeded unity of personality, and with the necessity ofseeking it. At this point begins the path travelled bythe East since the beginning of things. Quite obviously,the Chinese owes the finding of this path, to the fact that86"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"he has never been led to force the pairs of opposites ofhuman nature so far apart that all conscious connectionbetween them was lost. The Chinese has this inclusiveorientation because, as in the case of primitive mentality,the yea and the nay have remained in their originalproximity. None the less, he could not escape feelingthe collision of the opposites, and therefore he soughtout the way of life in which he would be what the Hinduterms nirdvandva, free of the opposites.Our text is concerned with this \" Way and it isthe question of this same \" Way 55 that comes up withmy patients also. There could be no greater mistake thanfor a Westerner to take up the direct practice of Chineseyoga, for then it would still be a matter of his will andconsciousness, and would only strengthen the latter againstthe unconscious, bringing about the very effect whichshould have been avoided. The neurosis would then beincreased. It cannot be sufficiently strongly emphasizedthat we are not orientals, and therefore have an entirelydifferent point of departure in these things. It would alsobe a great mistake to assume that this is the path everyneurotic must travel, or that it is the solution to be soughtat every stage of the neurotic problem. It is appropriateonly in those cases where the conscious has reached anabnormal degree of development, and has thereforediverged too far from the unconscious. This high degreeof consciousness is the conditio sine qua non. Nothingwould be more wrong than to wish to open this way toneurotics who are ill on account of the undue predominanceof the unconscious. For the same reason, this way ofdevelopment has scarcely any meaning before the middleof life (normally between the ages of thirty-five and forty),in fact, if entered upon too soon, it can be very injurious.As has been indicated, the essential ilrge to find a87"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"new way lay in the fact that the fundamental problem ofthe patient seemed insoluble to me unless violence wasdone to the one or the other side of his nature. I alwaysworked with the temperamental conviction that in thelast analysis there are no insoluble problems, and experiencehas so far justified me in that I have often seen individualswho simply outgrew a problem which had destroyed others.This \" outgrowing as I called it previously, revealeditself on further experience to be the raising of the levelof consciousness. Some higher or wider interest aroseon the person's horizon, and through this widening of hisview, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was notsolved logically in its own terms, but faded out in contrastto a new and stronger life-tendency. It was not repressedand made unconscious, but merely appeared in a differentlight, and so became different itself. What, on alower level, had led to the wildest conflicts and toemotions full of panic, viewed from the higher level of thepersonality, now seemed like a storm in the valley seenfrom a high mountain top. This does not mean that thethunderstorm is robbed of its reality; it means that,instead of being in it, one is now above it. But since, withrespect to the psyche, we are both valley and mountain,it seems a vain illusion if one feels oneself to be above whatis human. The individual certainly does feel the affectand is convulsed and tormented by it, yet at the sametime he is aware of a higher consciousness which preventshim from being identical with the affect, a consciousnesswhich takes the affect objectively, and can say, \" I knowthat I suffer/' Our text says of laziness : Laziness ofwhich a man is conscious and laziness of which he isunconscious, are thousands of miles apart. In the highestdegree this is true of affect also.Here and there it happened in my practice that apatient grew beyond the dark possibilities within himself,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and the observation of the fact was an experience of fore-most importance to me. In the meantime, I had learnedto see that the greatest and most important problems oflife are all fundamentally insoluble. They must be so,because they express the necessary polarity inherent inevery self-regulating system. They can never be solved,but only outgrown. I therefore asked myself whetherthis possibility of outgrowing, or further psychic develop-ment, was not normal, while to remain caught in a conflict was something pathological. Everyone mustpossess that higher level, at least in embryonic form,and in favourable circumstances, must be able to developthe possibility. When I examined the way of develop-ment of those persons who, quietly, and as if unconsciously,grew beyond themselves, I saw that their fates had some-thing in common. Whether arising from without orwithin, the new thing came to all those persons from adark field of possibilities; they accepted it and developedfurther by means of it. It seemed to me typical that, insome cases, the new thing was found outside themselves,. and in others within; or rather, that it grew into somepersons from without, and into others from within. Butit was never something that came exclusively either fromwithin or from without. If it came from outside theindividual, it became an inner experience; if it camefrom within, it was changed into an outer event. But inno case was it conjured into existence through purposeand conscious willing, but rather seemed to flow outof the stream of time.We are so greatly tempted to turn everything intopurpose and method that I deliberately express myselfin very abstract terms in order to avoid causing a prejudicein one direction or another.

It is a still moreremarkable fact that, though the new thing contradictsdeeply rooted instincts as we know them, yet it is asingularly appropriate expression of the total personality,an expression which one could not imagine in a morecomplete form.What then did these people do in order to achievethe progress that freed them ? As far as I could see theydid nothing (wu wei),1 but let things happen, for, asMaster Lii Tzu teaches in our text, the Light circulatesaccording to its own law, if one does not give up one'saccustomed calling. The art of letting things happen,action in non-action, letting go of oneself, as taught byMaster Eckehart, became a key to me with which I wasable to open the door to the \" Way *'5. The key is this :we must be able to let things happen in the psyche. Forus, this becomes a real art of which few people knowanything. Consciousness is forever interfering, helping,correcting, and negating, and never leaving the simplegrowth of the psychic processes in peace. It would be asimple enough thing to do, if only simplicity were notthe most difficult of all things. It consists solely inwatching objectively the development of any fragmentof fantasy. Nothing could be simpler than this, and yetright here the difficulties begin. Apparently no fantasy-fragment is at hand-yes there is one, but it is too stupid !Thousands of good excuses are brought against it: onecannot concentrate on it; it is too boring; what couldcome out of it ? It is \" nothing but, etc.55.

In many cases there exists a veritablespasm of the conscious.If one is successful in overcoming the initial difficulties,criticism is likely to start afterwards and attempt tointerpret the fantasy, to classify, to sestheticize, or todepreciate it. The temptation to do this is almostirresistible. After a complete and faithful observation,free rein can be given to the impatience of the conscious ;in fact it must be given, else obstructing resistancesdevelop. But each time the fantasy-material is to beproduced, the activity of the conscious must again beput aside.In most cases the results of these efforts are notvery encouraging at first. It is chiefly a matter of typicalfantasy-material which admits of no clear statement as towhence it comes or whither it is going. Moreover, the wayof getting at the fantasies is individually different. Formany people, it is easiest to write them ; others visualizethem, and others again draw and paint them with orwithout visualization. In cases of a high degree ofinflexibility in the conscious, oftentimes the hands alonecan fantasy; they model or draw figures that are quiteforeign to the conscious.These exercises must be continued until the crampin the conscious is released, or, in other words, until onecan let things happen; which was the immediate goalof the exercise. In this way, a new attitude is created,an attitude which . accepts the irrational and theunbelievable, simply because it is what is happening.This attitude would be poison for a person who has already91"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"been overwhelmed by things that just happen, but it isof the highest value for one who, with an exclusivelyconscious critique, chooses from the things that happenonly those appropriate to his consciousness, and thus getsgradually drawn away from the stream of life into astagnant backwater.At this point, the way travelled by the two above*mentioned types seems to separate. Both have learned toaccept what comes to them. (As Master Lii Tzii teaches :\" When occupations come to us we must accept them;when things come to us we must understand them fromthe ground up.55) One man will chiefly take what comesto him from without, and the other what comes fromwithin, and, as determined by the law of life, the one willhave to take from without something he never couldaccept from without, and the other will accept fromwithin, things that always would have been excludedbefore.This reversal of one5s being means an enlargement,heightening, and enrichment of the personality whenthe previous values are adhered to along with the change,provided, of course, they are not mere illusions. If thevalues are not retained, the man goes over to the otherside, and passes from fitness to unfitness, from adaptednessto the lack of it, from sense to nonsense, and from reasoneven to mental disease. The way is not without danger.Everything good is costly, and the development of thepersonality is one of the most costly of all things. It isa question of yea-saying to oneself, of taking the selfas the most serious of tasks, keeping conscious of every-thing done, and keeping it constantly before one's eyesin all its dubious aspects-truly a task that touches usto the core.The Chinese can fall back upon the authority of his92"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"entire culture. If he starts on the long way, he does whatis recognized as being the best of all the things he coulddo. But the Westerner who seriously wishes to startupon this way has all authority against him in intellectual,moral, and religious fields. Therefore it is infinitely easierfor a man to imitate the Chinese method, and leavebehind him the dubious European in himself. Or, choosingsomething less easy, he can seek again the way back tothe mediaevalism of the Christian Church, and build oncemore the European wall which is intended to shield trueChristian men from the poor heathen and the ethnographiccuriosities of the world. The aesthetic, or intellectualflirtation with life and fate comes to an abrupt end here.The step to higher consciousness leads away from allshelter and safety. The person must give himself to thenew way completely, for it is only by means of his integritythat he can go farther, and only his iritegrity can guaranteethat his way does not turn out to be an absurd adventure.Whether a person receives his fate from without orfrom within, the experiences and events of the way remainthe same. Therefore I need say nothing about themanifold outer and inner events, the endless variety ofwhich I could never exhaust. Moreover, to do so wouldbe meaningless in relation to the text under discussion.On the other hand, there is much to be said of the psychicconditions that accompany the further development.These psychic conditions are expressed symbolically inour text, and in the very symbols which, for many years,have been well-known to me in my practice.Â»* 93"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS1. TaoThe great difficulty in interpreting this and similartexts 1 for the European mind is due to the fact that theChinese author always starts from the centre of things,from the point we would call his objective or goal; ina word, he begins with the ultimate insight he has set outto attain. Thus the Chinese author begins his work withideas that demand a most comprehensive understandingon our part. So much so, that a man with a criticalintellect feels he speaks with laughable pretension, oreven that he is guilty of utter nonsense, if he dares launcha purely intellectual discourse on the subtle psychicexperiences of the great minds of the East. For example,our text begins : \" That which exists through itself, iscalled Too\" The Hui Ming Ching begins with the words :46 The most subtle secret of Tao is essence and life.\"It is characteristic of the Western mind that it hasno concept for Tao. The Chinese sign is made up of thesign for \" headand that for \"going\". Wilhelmtranslates Tao by Sinn (Meaning). Others translateit as \" Way \" Providence or even as \" God asthe Jesuits do. This shows the difficulty. \"Head\"could be taken as consciousness,2 and 64 to goastravelling a way, and then the idea would be: to goconsciously, or the conscious way. This agrees with thefact that44 the Light of Heaven \" which 44 dwells between1 Compare Liu Hua-yang: Hui Ming Ching, Das Buck von Bewusstsein undLeben, {The Book of Consciousness and Life), translated into German by L.

TheHui Ming Ching is introduced with the verse:-\" If thou wouldst complete the diamond body withoutemanations,Diligently heat the roots of consciousness1 and life.Kindle Light in the blessed country ever close at hand,And, there hidden, let thy true self eternally dwell.\"These verses contain a sort of alchemistic instructionas to a method or way of creating the \" diamond body 95which also appears in our text, \" Heating \" is necessary ;that is, there must be a heightening of consciousness inorder that the dweUing place of the spirit can be\" illumined 55.

The union of these two produces\" conscious life According to the Hui Ming Ching,the ancient sages knew how to bridge the gap betweenconsciousness and life because they cultivated both. Inthis way the immortal body is \" melted out and in thisway \" the great Tao is completed \".2If we take Tao as the method or conscious way bywhich to unite what is separated, we have probably comequite close to the psychological content of the concept.In any case, the separation of consciousness from life couldnot very well be understood as anything other than what Ihave described above as the deflection, or deracination ofconsciousness.

The spontaneous fantasies of which we treatedabove, become more profound and concentrate themselvesgradually around abstract structures which apparentlyrepresent \" principles true gnostic archai.

The specificallyChristian ones come from the earlier Middle Ages.

Very ancient magicaleffects are associated with this symbol because it comesoriginally from the \" enclosing circlethe \" charmedcircle 999 the magic of which has been preserved in countlessfolk-customs.1 The picture has the obvious purpose ofdrawing a sulcus primigenim, a magical furrow aroundthe centre, the templum, or temenos (sacred precincts),of the innermost personality, in order to prevent\" emanationor to guard by apotropaeic means,deflections through external influences. Magical practicesare nothing but the projections of psychic events, which,in cases like these, exert a counter influence on the soul, andact like a kind of enchantment of one's own personality.That is to say, by means of these concrete performances,the attention, or better said, the interest, is brought backto an inner, sacred domain, which is the source and goalof the soul. This inner domain contains the unity oflife and consciousness, which, though once possessed, hasbeen lost, and must now be found again.The union of these two, life and consciousness, isTao, whose symbol would be the central white light(compare the Bardo Todol)* and the dwelling place ofthe light is the \"quadrant\", or the \"face\", that is, thespace between the eyes. By means of these symbols it isintended to make visible the \" creative pointor thatwhich has intensity without extension.

In doing this, heneed not bother himself as to whether the shape in questionis a transcendental illusion or not, since faith, not science,has to decide this point. We are working here in a fieldwhich for a long time has seemed to be outside the domainof science, and which has therefore been looked upon asaltogether illusory. But there is no scientific justificationfor such an assumption, because the substantiality of thesethings is not a scientific problem since, in any case, itlies beyond the power of human perception and criticism,and therefore beyond any possibility of proof. Thepsychologist is not concerned with the substance of thesecomplexes, but with the psychic experiences. Without adoubt they are psychic contents which can be experienced,and which have an indisputable autonomy. They arepsychic partial-systems which either appear spontaneouslyin ecstatic condition and cause powerful impressions andeffects, or else become fixed as mental disturbances inthe form of lunacies and hallucinations, thus destroyingthe unity of the personality.The psychiatrist is always prone to believe in toxinsand the like, and to explain schizophrenia (splitting ofthe mind in a psychosis) in these terms, leaving the107"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"psychic contents out of account. On the other hand, inpsychogenetic disturbances (hysteria, compulsionneurosis, etc.), where the question of toxic effects and celldegeneration cannot possibly arise, there are to be found,in somnambulistic conditions for example, independent,split-off complexes. Freud would explain these as due tounconscious repression of sexuality, but this explanationis by no means valid for all cases, because there can evolvespontaneously out of the unconscious, contents whichthe conscious cannot assimilate, and, in such cases, therepression hypothesis is inadequate. Moreover, theessential autonomy of these elements can be observed inthe effects of daily life which obstinately obtrude them-selves against our wills, and then, despite our mostdesperate efforts toward repression, overwhelm the egoand force it under their control. No wonder that theprimitive sees in these moods either a state of possession,or sets them down to the loss of a soul. Our colloquialspeech reflects the same thing when we say : \" I don'tknow what has got into him to-day\"; \"He is ridden bythe devil55; \"It has him again\"; \"He was besidehimself\"; \"He behaves as if possessed.\" Even legalpractice recognizes a partial lessening of responsibility ina state of affect. Autonomic psychic contents are thereforequite common experiences for us, and such contents havea disintegrating effect on the conscious.But besides the ordinary, widely recognized affects,there are subtler, more complex emotional states whichcannot be described as pure and simple affects but arecomplicated partial-systems which have more of thecharacter of personalities the more complicated they are.Being also constituents of the psychic personality, theynecessarily have the character of persons.

In the course of mental development,consciousness gradually assimilates them and reshapesthem into conscious ideas which then forfeit their originallyautonomous and personal character. Some of the oldgods, after serving as carriers of astrological projections,became mere descriptive attributes (martial, jovial,saturnine, erotic, logical, lunatic, etc.).The instructions of the Bardo Todol, especially, enableus to see how greatly the conscious is threatened withdisintegration through these figures.

In this we differ from theBuddhist yoga doctrine, because we even deny thatpartial-systems can be experienced. Since the repressedmaterial appears again in consciousness in unsuitable form,a great psychic danger arises here, because the partial-systems then behave like any other repressed contents,and induce compulsive, wrong attitudes. This fact, whichis so striking in every case of neurosis, holds true alsofor the collective psychic phenomena. In this respect,our time is caught in a fatal error; we believe we cancriticize religious facts intellectually; we think, forinstance, like Laplace, that God is a hypothesis whichcan be subjected to intellectual treatment, affirmation,or denial. It is completely forgotten that the reasonhumanity believed in \" daemons \" has nothing whateverto do with anything external, but depends entirely onnaive awareness of the powerful inner effect of autonomouspartial-systems. This effect is not stopped by criticizingits name intellectually, nor by describing it as false. Theeffect is collectively always present; the autonomoussystems are always at work, because the fundamentalstructure of the unconscious is not disturbed by thefluctuations of a transitory consciousness.If one denies the existence of the partial-systems,hoping to be rid of them by a criticism of the name, thentheir effect, which nevertheless continues, cannot beunderstood, and therefore they cannot be assimilated to110"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"consciousness.

That sounds quite European andseems to suit our reason excellently. We, indeed, thinkwe can flatter ourselves at having already reached suchheights of clarity because such phantoms of gods seem tohave been left far behind.

In a word, this detachment ofconsciousness can only begin when nothing remains toprevent an inner superiority to the world. It is futile tolie to oneself about this.

When God isnot recognized, selfish desires develop, and out of thisselfishness comes illness.Yoga teaching assumes the recognition of gods to besomething granted.

To thepsychologist, the anima is not a transcendental being butsomething quite within the range of experience. As theChinese definition also makes clear, affective conditionsare immediate experiences. But why does one speak ofanima and not simply of moods ? The reason for this isthat affects have an autonomous character, and thereforemost people are under their power. But, as we haveseen, affects are delimitable contents of consciousness,parts of the personality, in other words. As parts of thepersonality, they partake of its character, and can there-fore be easily personified, a process which is still going onto-day, as the examples cited above have shown. Thepersonification is not an idle invention, inasmuch as theindividual stirred by affect does not show a vague, buta quite definite, character, different from his ordinaryone. Careful investigation has shown that the affectivecharacter in a man has feminine traits. From thispsychological fact comes the Chinese teaching of theyj'o-soul, as well as my concept of the anima. Deeperintrospection, or ecstatic experience, reveals the existenceof a feminine figure in the unconscious, therefore thefeminine name, anima, psyche, dme, Seele. The animacan also be defined as an image, or archetype, or as theresultant of all the experiences of man with woman.This is the reason the anima image is projected on thewoman. Poetry, as is well known, has often describedand celebrated the anima* The relation of the animato the spook in the Chinese concept is interesting to1 I refer the reader to the comprehensive presentation in my book.

Chinesephilosophers are spared certain difficulties which burdenthe task of Western psychologists, because Chinesephilosophy, like all mental and spiritual activity of ancienttimes, is the exclusive constituent of the man's world.Its concepts are never taken psychologically, and havetherefore never been examined as to how far they alsoapply to the feminine psyche. But the psychologistcannot possibly ignore the existence of woman and herpeculiar psychology. This is the reason I prefer to translatehun as it appears in a man, by logos. Wilhelm in histranslation uses logos for the Chinese concept hsing, whichcould also be translated as essence, or creative consciousness.After death, hun becomes shen, spirit, which is very close,in the philosophical sense, to hsing. Since the Chineseconcepts are not logical in our sense, but are intuitiveperceptions, their meaning can only be fathomed throughthe ways in which they are used, and by noting theconstitution of the written signs, or further, by suchrelationships as that of hun to shin. Hun, then, would bethe discriminating light of consciousness and of reasonin man, originally coming from the logos spermatikos ofhsing, and returning after death through shSn to Tao.Used this way the expression logos would he especiallyappropriate, since it includes the idea of a universalessence, and therefore covers the fact that man's clarityof consciousness and capacity for reason are universalrather than something individually unique.

Whoever has understood the thing meantby psychic reality need not fear falling back into primitivedemonology because that reality is admitted. If theunconscious figures are not accorded the dignity ofspontaneously effective factors, one becomes the victimof a one-sided belief in the conscious, which finally leadsto a state of mental tension. Catastrophes are thenbound to occur, because, despite all one's consciousness,the dark psychic powers have been overlooked. It isnot we who personify them ; they have a personal naturefrom the very beginning.

Therefore, religious practiceand morality took on an outspokenly brutal, almostmalicious, character.

Thus itcould easily happen to the Protestant that the personJesus, now removed by centuries, could become thesuperior man within himself.

G, JungIt is no easy task for me to speak of Richard Wilhelmand his work, because, starting very far away from oneanother, our ways crossed in a comet-like fashion. Youprobably knew Wilhelm before I became acquainted withhim, and his life-work has a range which I have notencompassed. Nor have I seen the China that firstshaped and later continued to engross him, nor am Ifamiliar with its language, the living spiritual expressionpf the Chinese East. I stand, indeed, as a stranger outsidethat vast territory of knowledge and experience in whichWilhelm worked as a master of his profession. He as asinologue, and I a physician, should never have comeinto contact with one another had we remained specialists.But we met in a field of humanity which begins beyondacademic boundary posts. There lay our point of contact;there the spark leaped across that kindled the light whichwas to become for me, one of the most meaningful eventsof my life. Because of this experience I may speak ofWilhelm and his work, thinking with grateful reverenceof this mind which created a bridge between East andWest and gave to the Occident the heirship to a preciousculture thousands of years old, a culture perhaps destinedto disappear.Wilhelm possessed the mastership which is only1 This memorial address was delivered in Munich, May 10th, 1930.1391 \\"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"won by the man who surmounts his speciality, and sohis science became a concern touching all humanity-I must not say became-it was that at the beginning andremained so always. For what else could have freed himfrom the narrow horizons of the European, of themissionary, in fact, so that no sooner had he encounteredthe secret of the Chinese soul than he perceived thetreasure hidden there for us, and sacrificed his Europeanprejudice on behalf of this rare pearl ? It could onlyhave been an all-embracing humanness, a greatness ofheart that divines the whole, which enabled him to openhimself without reservation to a profoundly foreignspirit, and to put at the service of this influence themanifold gifts and capacities of his mind. Reachingbeyond -all Christian resentiment, beyond all Europeanpresumption, his comprehending devotion is in itselfwitness of a rarely great spirit, whereas all mediocre mindsin contact with a foreign culture either lose themselvesin blind self-deracination, or in an equally uncomprehend-ing, as well as presumptuous, passion for criticism.Touching only the superficialities and externals of theforeign culture, they never eat its bread nor drink itswine, and so never enter into the communio spiritus, thatmost intimate transfusion and interpenetration whichprepares a new birth,As a rule, the specialist's is a purely masculine mind,an intellect to which fertilization is a foreign and unnaturalprocess, therefore it is an especially ill-adapted tool forreceiving and bringing to birth a foreign spirit. But agreater mind bears the stamp of the feminine, and isgiven a receptive and fruitful womb which can re-shapewhat is strange into a familiar form. Wilhelm possessedin the, highest degree the rare charisma of spiritual mother-* J hood. To it he owed his unequalled ability to feel his140"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"way into the spirit of the East, which made possible hisincomparable translations.To me, the greatest of his achievements is the transla-tion of, and commentary on, the / Ching. Before I learnedto know Wilhelm's translation, I had for years workedwith Legge's inadequate translation, and was therefore ina position to recognize fully the extraordinary difference.Wilhelm has succeeded in bringing to life again in a newand vital form, this ancient work in which not only manysinologues, but even many modern Chinese as well, cansee nothing but a collection of absurd magical formulae.This work embodies, as perhaps no other, the spirit ofChinese culture. The best minds of China have collaboratedupon it and contributed to it for thousands of years.Despite its fabulous age, it has never grown old, but livesand operates still, at least for those who understand itsmeaning. That we too belong to this favoured group, weowe to the creative efforts of Wilhelm. He has broughtthis work close to us, not only through careful translation,but also through his personal experience, on the one hand,as a pupil of a Chinese master of the old school, on theother, as an initiate in the psychology of Chinese yoga,to whom the practical application of the / Ching was anever-renewed experience.But with these rich gifts, Wilhelm has also bequeathedus a task whose magnitude we may, at the present time,suspect, but certainly cannot fathom. Anyone likemyself, who has had the rare good fortune to experiencein a spiritual exchange with Wilhelm, the divinatorypower of the / Ching, cannot for long remain ignorantof the fact that we have touched here an Archimedeanpoint from which our Western attitude of mind ean beshaken to its foundations. Truly it is no small seree tohave produced for us, as Wilhelm did, such an inclusive141"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"and richly-coloured painting of a foreign culture, but itwill be almost nothing in comparison with the fact that,over and beyond this, he has infected us with a livinggerm of the Chinese spirit, which is capable of makingan essential change in our world picture. We have notremained merely admiring or critical observers, but havebecome participants of the Eastern spirit in so far as wehave succeeded in experiencing the living potency of the/ Ching.The function on which the use of the J Ching is based,if I may so express myself, is apparently in sharp contradic-tion to our Western, scientifically-causal, Weltanschauung.In other words, it is extremely unscientific, taboo infact, and therefore out of reach of our scientific judgment,and incomprehensible to it.Some years ago, the then president of the BritishAnthropological Society asked me how I could explainthe fact that so highly intellectual a people as the Chinesehad produced no science. I replied that this must reallybe an \" optical illusion because the Chinese did havea science whose \" standard work \" was the I Ching, butthat the principle of this science, like so much else inChina, was altogether different from our scientificprinciple.The science of the / Ching is not based on the causalityprinciple, but on a principle (hitherto unnamed becausenot met with among us) which I have tentatively calledthe synchronistic pirinciple. My occupation with thepsychology of unconscious processes long ago necessitatedmy looking about for another principle of explanation,because the causality principle seemed to me inadequateto explain certain remarkable phenomena of the psychologyof the unconscious. Thus I found that there are psychic.parallelisms which' cannot be related to each other142"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"causally, but which must be connected through anothersequence of events.

Another example wouldbe the simultaneity of Chinese and European periods ofstyle, a fact pointed out by Wilhelm. They could neverhave been causally related to one another. Astrologywould be a large scale example of synchronism, if it hadat its disposal thoroughly tested findings. But at leastthere are some facts adequately tested and fortified by awealth of statistics which make the astrological problemseem worthy of philosophical investigation. (It is assuredof recognition from psychology, without further restric-tions, because astrology represents the summation of allthe psychological knowledge of antiquity.)The fact that it is possible to construct, in adequatefashion, a person's character from the data of his nativity,shows the relative validity of astrology.

In so far as there are any really correct astrologicaldeductions, they are not due to the effects of the constella-tions, but to our hypothetical time-characters. In otherwords, whatever is born or done this moment of time, hasthe qualities of this moment of time.143"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"This is also the fundamental formula for the use ofthe / Ching. As is known, one gains knowledge of thehexagram characterizing the moment by a method ofmanipulating sticks of yarrow, or coins, a method depend-ing on purest chance. As the moment is, so do the runicsticks fall. The only question is : Did the old KingWen, and the Duke of Chou, in the year 1000 B.C., interpretthe accidental picture made by Â°the fallen runic stickscorrectly or not ? As to this, experience alone can decide.At his first lecture at the Psychological Club inZurich, Wilhelm, at my request, demonstrated themethod of consulting the / Ching, and, at the same time,made a prognosis, which, in less than two years, wasfulfilled to the letter and with unmistakable clearness.This fact could be further confirmed by many parallelexperiences. However, I am not concerned withestablishing objectively the validity of the prophecies ofthe I Ching, but take it as a premise, just as my deceasedfriend did. Therefore, I am only going to discuss theamazing fact that the qualitas occulta of the time-momentbecame legible by means of the hexagram of the I Ching.One is dealing with a relationship of events, not onlyanalogous to astrology, but essentially related to it. Thebirth corresponds to the sticks that are thrown, theconstellation to the hexagram, and the astrologicalinterpretation arising from the constellation correspondsto the text appropriate to the hexagram.The type of thought built on the synchronisticprinciple, which reaches its high point in the I Ching, isthe purest expression of Chinese thinking in general.With us, this thinking has been absent from the historyof philosophy since the time of Heraclitus, and onlyreappears as a faint echo in Leibnitz. However, in thetime between, it was not extinguished, but continued to144"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"live in the twilight of astrological speculation, and remainsto-day at this level.At this point the I Cking touches the need of furtherdevelopment in us. Occultism has enjoyed in our timesa renaissance which is really without a parallel. Thelight of the Western mind is nearly darkened by it. I amnot thinking now of our seats of learning and theirrepresentatives. I am a physician and deal with ordinarypeople, and therefore I know that the universities haveceased to act as disseminators of light. People havebecome weary of scientific specialization and rationalisticintellectualism. They want to hear truths which do notmake them narrower but broader, which do not obscurebut enlighten, which do not run off them like water, butpierce them to the marrow. This search threatens tolead a large, if anonymous, public into wrong paths,When I think of Wilhelm's achievement andsignificance, I am reminded of Anquetil du Perron, theFrenchman who brought the first translation of theUpanishads to Europe just at the period when, for thefirst time in almost 1,800 years, something unheard-ofoccurred, and the goddess of reason drove the ChristianGodhead from the throne in Notre Dame. To-day, when,in Russia, there occur things far more unheard-of thanat that time in Paris, when, in Europe itself, the Christiansymbol has reached such a condition of feebleness thateven the Buddhists think the right moment has come fora mission in Europe, it is Wilhelm, who, as though chosenfrom the soul of Europe, brings us a new light firom theEast. This is the cultural task to which Wilhelm felthimself called. He recognized how much the East couldgive toward the healing of our spiritual need.A beggar is not helped by our giving him outrightmore or less generous alms, although he may desire it.145"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"He is much better helped if we show him the way to freehimself permanently of his need by work. Unfortunately,the spiritual beggars of our time are all too inclined toaccept the alms of the East in specie, that is, to appropriateunthinkingly the spiritual possessions of the East and toimitate its way blindly. That is the danger about whichit is impossible to give too many warnings, and the onewhich Wilhelm also felt very clearly. Spiritual Europeis not helped by what is merely a new sensation or a newtitillation to the nerves. What it has taken China thousandsof years to build cannot be stolen by us. We must learnto acquire it in order to possess it. What the East hasto give us should be merely a help in a work which we stillhave to do. Of what use to us is the wisdom of theUpanishads or the insight of the Chinese yoga, if we desertthe foundations of our own culture as though they wereoutlived errors, and, like homeless pirates, settle withthievish intent on foreign shores ? The insight of theEast, above all, the wisdom of the I Ching, has no meaningwhen we close our minds to our own problems, when welead artificially arranged lives on the basis of conventionalprejudices, when we veil from ourselves our real humannature with all its dangerous, subterranean elements,and its darkness ? The light of this wisdom only shinesin the dark, not in the electric searchlight of the Europeantheatre of consciousness and will. The wisdom of theI Ching, has originated from a background, whose horrorwe can faintly suspect if we read of Chinese massacres, ofthe sinister power of Chinese secret societies, of thenameless poverty, the hopeless filth and vices, of theChinese masses.We need to have a correctly three dimensional lifeif we wish to experience Chinese wisdom as a living thing.Therefore, we first have need of European truths about146"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"ourselves. Our way begins in European reality and notin yoga practices which would only serve to lead us astrayas to our own reality. We must continue Wilhelm's workof translation in a wider sense if we wish to show ourselvesworthy pupils of the master. Just as he translated thespiritual treasure of the East into European meaning, weshould translate this meaning into life.As you know, Wilhelm translated the central conceptof Tao by Meaning. To translate Meaning into life, thatis, to realize Tao, would be the task of the pupil. ButTao will never be created with words and good precepts.Do we know exactly how Tao develops in us or around us ?Is it by imitation, or by reason, or by acrobatics of thewill ? We feel that all these things are ridiculouslyincommensurate with the task. But where shall webegin with this task ? Will Wilhelm's spirit be in us orwith us if we do not solve this problem in a truly Europeanway, that is in reality ? Or must this be at the last onlya rhetorical question whose answer is lost in applause ?Let us look toward the East: there an overwhelmingfate is fulfilling itself. European cannon have burstopen the gates of Asia; European science and technique,European worldly-mindedness and cupidity, flood China.We have conquered the East politically. Do you knowwhat happened when Rome overthrew the near-Eastpolitically ? The spirit of the East entered Rome. Mithrabecame the Roman military god, and out of the mostunlikely corners of Asia Minor, came a new spiritualRome. Would it be unthinkable that the same thingmight happen to-day and find us just as blind as warethe cultured Romans who marvelled at the superstitionsof the Christoi ? It is to be noted that England andHolland, the two main colonizing powers in Asia, are alsothe two most infected with theosophy. I know that our147"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"unconscious is full of Eastern symbolism. The spirit ofthe East is really before our gates. Therefore it seemsto me that the realization of the Meaning, the search forTao, has already become a collective phenomenon amongus, and that to a far greater extent than we generallythink. For example I take, as a very important sign ofthe times, the fact that Wilhelm and the indologue Hauer,were asked to lecture on yoga at this year's congress ofGerman psychotherapists. Let us realize what it meansfor a practical physician who deals directly with a suffering,and therefore receptive, person, to- send out a feelertoward an Eastern therapeutic system ! Thus the spiritof the East penetrates through all our pores and reachesthe most vulnerable places of Europe. It could be adangerous infection, but perhaps it is also a remedy.The Babylonian confusion of tongues in the Western worldhas created such a disorientation that everyone longs forsimpler truths, or at least for general ideas which speak,not to the head alone, but to the heart as well, whichgive clarity to the spirit, and peace to the restless pressureof the feelings. Like the ancient Romans, we again to-day,are importing every form of exotic superstition in thehope of discovering therein the right cure for our disease.Human instinct knows that all great truth is simple,and therefore the man who is weak in instinct assumesgreat truth to exist in all cheap simplifications andplatitudes. Or, as a result of his disappointment, he fallsinto the opposite error of thinking that great truth mustbe as obscure and complicated as possible. We haveto-day a gnostic movement in the anonymous masses,which exactly corresponds psychologically with the move-ment 1,900 years ago. Then, as to-day, lonely wandererslike the great Apollonius, spun the spiritual threads fromEurope back to Asia, perhaps to remotest India.148"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Looked at from such a historical perspective, I seeWilhelm in the guise of one of those great gnostic inter-mediaries who brought the cultural heritage of Asia intocontact with the Hellenic spirit, and thereby caused anew world to rise out of the ruins of the Roman Empire.Then, as now, insipidity, inflated ideas, bad taste, andinner unrest prevailed. Then, as now, the continent ofthe spirit was inundated, leaving only single peaks project-ing like so many islands from the vague flood. Then, asnow, all sorts of devious paths beckoned the spirit and thewheat of false prophets bloomed.In the midst of the clanging disharmony of theconcert of European opinion, to hear the simple languageof Wilhelm, the messenger from China, is a real blessing.One can see from it that it has been schooled in the plant-like naivete of the Chinese mind, which is able to expressprofound things in simple language; it discloses somethingof the simplicity of great truth, the ingenuousness of deepmeaning, and it carries to us the delicate perfume of theGolden Flower. Penetrating gently, it has set in the soilof Europe a tender seedling, for us a new presentment oflife and Meaning, after aU the spasm of arbitrariness andpresumption.Towards the foreign culture of the East, Wilhelmdisplayed an extraordinarily large amount of modesty,something unusual in a European. He erected no barrieragainst it, no prejudices, no assumptions of knowing better,but instead, opened heart and mind to it. He let himselfbe gripped and shaped by it, so that when he came backto Europe, he brought us not only in his spirit, but alsoin his nature, a true image of the East. This deep trans-formation was certainly not won by him without greatsacrifice, because our historical premises are so entirelydifferent from those of the East. The keenness of Western140"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"consciousness and its glaring problems had to softenbefore the more universal, more equable nature of theEast, and Western rationalism with its one-sideddifferentiation had to yield to Eastern breadth andsimplicity. To Wilhelm, these changes certainly meantnot only a shifting of intellectual standpoint, but alsoan essential rearrangement of the component parts ofhis personality. The picture of the East he has given us,free as it was from ulterior motive and any trace ofviolence, could never have been created in such com-pleteness by Wilhelm, had he not been able to let theEuropean in himself slip into tHe background. If he hadallowed East and West to clash against each other withinhim with an unyielding harshness, he could not havefulfilled his mission of providing us with a true picture ofChina.Wilhelm fulfilled his mission in every sense of theword. Not only did he make accessible to us the deadtreasures of the Chinese mind, but, as I have pointed out,he brought with him its spiritual root, the root that haslived all these thousands of years, and planted it in thesoil of Europe. With the completion of his task, hismission reached its climax, and, unfortunately, its endalso. According to the law of enantiodromia, so clearlyunderstood by the Chinese, there grew out of the closeof the one phase the beginning of its opposite. Thus, inits culmination, yang goes over into yin, and position isresolved into negation. I came near to Wilhelm only inthe last years of his life, and then I could observe how,with the completion of his life-work, Europe and theEuropean man drew closer and closer to him, beset himin fact. At the same time, there developed in him thefeeling that he might be standing on the brink of a greatchaAge, a transformation whose nature it is true he could"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"not clearly grasp. He only knew that he was facedwith a decisive crisis. His physical illness went parallelwith this spiritual development. His dreams were filledwith Chinese memories, but they were always sad anddismal pictures that hovered before him, a clear proofthat the Chinese contents had become negative.There is nothing that can be sacrificed for ever. Every-thing returns later in a changed form, and where so greata sacrifice has once taken place, when the sacrificed thingreturns, there must be ready a healthy and resistant bodyin order to be able to meet the shock of a great transforma-tion. Therefore, a spiritual crisis of such dimensions oftenmeans death if it takes place in a body weakened bydisease. For now the sacrificial knife is in the hand of himwho has been sacrificed, and a death is demanded of himwho was once the sacrificer.As you see, I have not withheld my personal ideas,because if I had not told how I experienced Wilhelm,how else would it have been possible for me to speakof him ? Wilhelm's life-work is of so great a value to mebecause it explains and confirms so much of what I hadbeen seeking, striving for, thinking, and doing, in orderto meet the psychic ills of Europe. It- was a tremendousexperience for me to hear through him in clear language,the things that had been dimly shadowed forth to mefrom out of the confusion of the European unconscious.As a matter of fact, I feel myself so very much enrichedby him that it seems to me as if I had received more fromhim than from any other man, and this is the reason I donot feel it a presumption if I am the one to offer, on thealtar of his memory, the gratitude and respect of all of us."}]
