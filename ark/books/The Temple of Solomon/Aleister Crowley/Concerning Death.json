CONCERNING DEATH That She and Her Sisters May Bring Comfort to All Them That Are Nigh Death, andUnto Such as Love Them. Beloved Daughter and Sister, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. It is written in the Book of the Law; Every man and every woman is a Star. It is OurLady of the Stars that speaketh to thee, O thou that art a star, a member of the Bodyof Nuit. Listen, for thine ears are become dulled to the mean noises of the earth; theinfinite silence of the Stars woos thee with subtle musick. Behold her bending downabove thee, a flame of blue, all- touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon theblack earth and her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the littlefloweres, and think that all thy grossness shall presently fall from thee as thou leapestto her embrace, caught up into her love as a dewdrop into the kisses of the sunrise. Isnot the ecstacy of Nuit the consiousness of of the continuity of existence, theomnipresence of her body? All that hath hurt thee was that thou knewest it not, as thatfadeth from thee thou shalt know as never yet how all is one. Again she saith: I giveunimaginable joys on earth, certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death. This thouhast known. Time that eateth his children hath not power on them that would not bechildren of Time. To them that know themselves immortal, that dwell always ineternity, conscious of Nuit, throned upon the chariot of the sun, there is no death thatmen call death. In all the universe. darkness is only found in the shadow of a grossand opaque planet. as it were for a moment; the universe itself is a flood of lighteternal. So also death is but through accident; thou hast hidden thyself in the shadowof thy gross body, and taking it for reality, thou hast trembled. But the orb revolvethanon; the shadow passeth away from thee. There is the dissolution, and eternalecstasy in the kisses of Nu! For inasmuch as thou hast made the Law of Freedom"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"thine, as thou hast lived in Light and Liberty and Love, thou hast become a Freemanof the City of Stars. .pa Listen again to thine own voice within thee. Is not Hadit theflame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star? Is not He Life,and the giver of Life? And is not therefore the knowledge of Him the knowledge ofDeath? For it hath been shown unto thee in many other places how Death and Lovebe twins. Now art thou the hunter, and Death rideth beside thee with his horse andspear as thou chasest thy Will through the forests of Eternity, whose trees are the hairof Nuit thy mistress! Thrill with the joy of life and death! Know, hunter mighty andswift, the quarry turns to bay! Thou has but to make one sharp thrust, and thou hastwon. The Virgin of Eternity lies supine at thy mercy, and thou art Pan! Thy deathshall be the seal of the promise of our age-long love. Hast thou not striven to theinmost in thee? Death is the crown of all. Harden! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head!breath not so deep --- die! Or art thou still entangled with the thorny plaits of wildbriar rose that thou hast woven in thy magick dance on earth? Are not thine eyesstrong enough to bear the starlight? Must thou linger yet awhile in the valley? Mustthou dally with the shadows in the dusk? Then, if it be thy will, thou hast no right butto do thy will! Love still these phantoms of the earth; thou has made thyself a king; ifit please thee to play with toys of matter, were they not made to serve thy pleasure?Then follow in thy mind the wondrous word of the Stele of Revealing itself. Return ifthou wilt from the abode of the stars: dwell with mortality, and feast thereon. For thouart this day made Lord of Heaven and of Earth. The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu Saith with his voice of truth and calm: O thou thathast a single arm! O thou that glitterest in the moon! I weave the in the spinningcharm; I lure thee with the billowy tune. The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu Hath joined the dwellers of the light, OpeningDuant, the star abodes, Their keys receiving. The dead man Ankh-f-na-Khonsu Hath joined the dwellers of the light, His pleasureon the earth to do Among the living. Love is the law, love under will. The Benidiction of the All-Begetter, All-Devourerbe upon thee."}]
