And I beheld the Working afar off, free utterly of desiretowards it; and I was aware of certain things concerning it; as here now to bewrit down.Firstly: the Working shall establish the Aeon of Ra Hoor Khuit by obeyingthe instructions given in the Book of the Law.Secondly: it is a Working of Mercury and Sol, combined even as they are inThe Beast; so that the Word of the Working is hla, 36, the square of 6 andthe sum of the first 8 numbers, &c, &c. Now Aleph is the letter of Hadith asHé of Nuith, and Lamed is their balanced union.Thirdly: Alostrael resumeth Nuit and The Beast Hadith; their Copulation istherefore by this word 36 well signified.Fourthly: it is written, Liber Lapidis Lazuli, Cap III, vv 16–18 that all is vainunless there be “a man’s life spilt for thy love upon Mine Altars.” Thus thenlet His High Priest do sacrifice to The Beast, thereby to consecrate Him to theRite.Fifthly: that the Paris Working the first model for our present Orgia is notto be followed pedantically.Sixthly and lastly: that special names are to be used by us; for The BeastOphion 700, for Genesthai 143 Iacchaion, and for Alostrael a new name notyet given.
