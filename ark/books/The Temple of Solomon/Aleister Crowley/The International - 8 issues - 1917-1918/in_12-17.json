The Internationalis always ahead of time. Instead of being a magazineof the past it is a magazine of the future. The SimonIff stories symbolize the quality of thought and ex-pression which sets the International so uniquely apartfrom its contemporaries. Just as Simon Iff is far inadvance of the modern detective, so the Internationaltakes its place in the vanguard of the new literature,the new freedom.The January Simon Iff story is not in fact a story atall. It is a slice of that mysterious life in which terriblecrimes are committed for reasons which lie deep inthe subconsciousness of their perpetrators. Do youremember the first time that you read Edgar AllanPoe’s stories? Do you remember the thrill and the shockand the horror produced by Poe’s tales? You will havethat same feeling after finishing the January SimonIff tale.We promised you “The Heart of Holy Russia” forDecember, but you will like it all the more in January.For it will help you to understand the Bolsheviki, theMaximalists, the Grand Dukes, Kerensky. In short,you will gain an understanding of that palpitating lifewhich lies behind the dramatic movements now rend-ing Russia. Do you know that St. Basil and IvanVeliky, which helped to make Moscow the greatest ofall the wonders of the world, have just been destroyed?Geomancy is a science enabling those who under-stand its secrets to divine the future, to understand thepast. It will answer any questions. One man became amillionaire after mastering this simple yet fascinatingscience.A new story by Mark Wells has even stirred ourprinter. “You’ve got to hand it to him,” said this untu-tored toiler after reading Mr. Wells’ masterpiece. Thestory explains how a dainty little woman ruled a sav-age king without paying the usual price, and imposedon him the civilization of her conquered race.“At the Feet of Our Lady of Darkness” reveals thesoul of a Franco-Egyptian girl well known in Londonand Paris.The Master Therion speaks confidentially to his dis-ciples throughout the world. In the “Message” andthe “Law of Liberty” he gives utterance to an im-mensely important matter, important to you, too.Besides these magnificent contributions there aremany other delightful articles, poems and stories.

Wisdom is justified of her children. Before we have been dead threehundred years somebody is almost sure to notice it. The great mass of people is a homogeneous mass of brainless idiocy. Menare dumb animals, and women only quack. In times of peace the hack journalists are as inconspicuous as they are insignificant; butwhen war breaks out the hysteria natural to weak minds becomes vocal, and everybody wants to “do his bit” on one side or theother, by squealing when much the best thing to do would be to bury himself.THESE little minds have no conception of the great ideas which distinguish man from mannikin. They imagine that Rodin wasa Frenchman, and Wagner a German. They do not understand that these persons were not men, but Gods. They do notunderstand that the creations of such men are in the nature of that image of the great Goddess Diana which came down fromheaven for us men and for our salvation. They do not understand that Rheims is as sacred as Cologne; that the Kremlin should havebeen protected from the maniacs, who are trying to translate Bernard Shaw into action, as Jerusalem (if there be anything ofartistic value therein) from the British. As a matter of fact, I believe there is nothing but a lot of faked historical monumentscamouflaged by the wily Syrian for the exploitation of American tourists of the Chautauqua brand. If this be so, Allenby, go to it!BUT as for us, we stand above. I do not know whether Bulgaria is at war with England; but if so, it is evidently the duty to Godand man of every Bulgarian to knock the block off General Haig. At the same time, if that Bulgarian does not respect KingsCollege Chapel, or uses my first edition of Adonais for pipe lights, I will knock his block off if I can catch the Bulgar at it. We arewarring for Democracy, but also for civilization, apparently owing to our inherent love of paradox. We have here a war within awar. We have not only to fight the foe without, and the foe within, but also the foe that is the worst of all, the overzealous friend.We feel rather as the President feels about the Vigilantes. If well-meaning asses were only mules how useful they might be inbatteries! We are out to break the political will of another group of nations, and our worst foes are those of our own people who aregiving the show away. We go to war to defend the rights of the little nations, and we imprison Irishmen who can not forget that theirmothers were raped by British soldiers. We are particularly strong on Belgium, and her representative complains that there is to beno seat for Belgium on the Allied war council. The Germans go to war for Kultur, yet they cannot find an expedient for contractingout of the shelling of cathedrals. And if these things are done in the green tree of the people in power, what shall be done in the drytree, and withered sticks of the mediocre. We have our attention taken away from the business of fighting by the miserable gruntsof these self-advertising pigs, who are only guinea-pigs in so far as they can always be counted on to sell their souls for a guinea.It is not only useless and stupid to refuse the benefits of those who at the very lowest estimate were our friends, but the absolutedestruction of the whole principle of civilization.ART is long and political life is short. If we are enraged with the Germans for shelling St. Mark’s, which they have not yetdone, we ought certainly to declare war upon the French because of what Napoleon really did do to St. Mark’s a hundredyears ago. In order to carry out this program still more effectively, we can destroy the statues of Lafayette, and burn our Shakespeareson the ground that the English burnt the Capitol at Washington. It is only the pettiest minds that perceive national qualities inworks of art. At most, national schools form a convenient classification. If the Dutch, as at times has seemed likely, decide that theGerman cause is that of liberty, civilization, and progress, and determine to fight on their side, will some patriot immediatelydiscover that Rembrandt did not know how to paint? Would it not be better to make up our minds about it now? Will Mr. Rooseveltdecide to change his name to something less compromising? And shall we destroy the institution of marriage because the inhab-itants of the Old Kent Road speak of their wives as “my old Dutch”? Shall we turn the feminine of duke into Americaness, to bequite safe, and rather true, anyhow?I CANNOT say how deeply I feel about this matter. The insensate screams of the mob threaten to deafen even those few earswhich were attuned to the still small voice of wisdom. The danger is enormous. Even defeat would be preferable to a universaliconoclasm. It is not a new story. Again and again the most priceless treasures of antiquity, to say nothing of the structure of thecivilizations whence they sprung, have been destroyed utterly and irremediably in the most miserable religious and politicalquarrels. Was not the library of Alexandria worth more to mankind than the whole Roman Empire? Were not the stained glasswindows of the churches of more importance than the entire struggle between Protestant and Catholic? The people who do notunderstand this are Huns.THIS paper is not primarily political. So far as it is so, it is and will be loyal; but it will resent the thesis that in order to be loyalone must be insane. “Battle, murder, and sudden death” is excellent sport, and it is extremely necessary at this moment. Theexcretory system of nature, pestilence, has been constipated by the misguided efforts of medicine and hygiene. We had to get ridof the surplus population, and we chose our own foolish way instead of Nature’s wise way. So not a word against war! But thetreasures of art, of literature, of music, must this time be preserved for humanity; and we are determined to resist to the death anyattack upon those treasures. We are — for the moment — fighting the Germans; but Faust and Siegfried and Zarathustra, theachievement of Kant in philosophy and of Helmholtz in physics, must be put “out of bounds.” We stand above."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL355355THE INTERNATIONALEDITORGEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKASSOCIATE EDITORJOSEPH BERNARD RETHYCONTRIBUTING EDITORALEISTER CROWLEYVOL. XI. NO. 12.  DECEMBER, 1917  PRICE 15 CENTSTHE SCRUTINIES OF SIMON IFF.By EDWARD KELLY.No. 4. — The Conduct of John Briggs.Simon Iff bounded into the Hemlock Club. He was by allodds the oldest member of the club; but to-day he had theelasticity of a boy, and he was so radiant that some peoplewould have sworn that they actually saw flashes of light abouthis head. He bounded up the great stairway of the club twosteps at a time.The porters relaxed their solemnity, for the man’s exalta-tion was contagious. “So Simple Simon’s back from one of ’isGreat Magical Retirements again. I wonder wot in ’Eving’sname ’e does.” “I wisht I knew,” replied the other. “The oldboy’s ninety, if ’e’s a dy.”In the lunch-room the atmosphere was certainly in need ofall the exhilaration it could find. There were only a dozenmen present, and they were talking in whispers. The eldest ofthem, Sir Herbert Holborne (’Anging ’Olborne of the criminalclasses) was neither speaking nor eating, though his lunch laybefore him. He was drinking whiskey-and-soda in a steadybusiness-like way, as a man does who has an important task toaccomplish.Simon Iff greeted them with a single comprehensive waveof the hand. “What’s the news, dear man?” he asked his neigh-bor. “Are you all rehearsing a play of Wedekind’s? Oh, a steakand a bottle of Nuits,” he added to the waiter. “The old Nuits,the best Nuits, for I must give praise to Our Lady of the StarryHeavens!”“You do not appear to require the stimulus of alcohol in anymarked degree,” observed Holborne, in his driest manner.“Stimulus!” cried Iff; “I don’t take wine to stimulate. It isbecause I am stimulated, or rather, fortified, that I drink wine.You must always drink what is in tune with your own soul.That’s the Harmony of Diet! It is stupid and criminal to try toalter your soul by drugs. Let the soul be free, and use whatsuits it. Homeopathic treatment! So give me green tea when Iam exquisite and æsthetic like a Ming Vase; coffee when I amhigh-strung and vigilant as an Arab; chocolate when I am feel-ing cosy and feminine; brandy when I am martial and passion-ate; and wine — oh, wine at all times! — but wine especiallywhen I am bubbling over with spiritual ecstasy. Thus, my dearHolborne, I fulfil the apostolic injunction, ‘Whatsoever ye do,whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God!’ Everymeal is a sacrament to me. That’s the simplicity of life! That’swhy they call me Simple Simon!”The outburst brought his fellow-clubmen out of their apa-thy. One of them remarked that, while agreeing with the the-sis, and admiring the force and beauty of its expression, it wasunseasonable. He wished to tone down the exuberance of theold mystic, for the sake of the general feeling.“Why, what is wrong?” said Iff more sedately. “Not thatanything is ever really wrong; it’s all illusion. But you evi-dently think there’s a great deal amiss; and” — he looked roundthe table — “Sir Herbert seems to be at the bottom of it.”“I will ask you to spare me,” spoke the judge; “this morningI was compelled to perform the most painful duty of my ca-reer. Tell him, Stanford!”“Why, where have you been?” said James Stanford, a longlean lantern-jawed individual who filled the Chair of Historyat Oxford University.“Oh, I’ve been everywhere and nowhere,” replied Simon.“But I suppose a historian would take the view — an utterlyfalse and absurd view, by the way — that I have been sittingin my oratory at Abertarff, meditating, for the last two months.I have heard nothing of the world. Are we at war with theRepublic of Andorra?”Stanford leaned forward across the table, while the rest keptsilent.“You remember Briggs?”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL356356“Knew him well at one time; haven’t seen him for ten yearsor so.”“Well, this morning Holborne had to sentence him to deathfor the murder of his nephew.”“I say, Holborne, that’s a bit thick,” ejaculated Iff, rudely.“Just because you dislike the way he ties his neckties, to goand fit him out with a hemp cravat!”“I am in no mood for your stupid jokes, Iff,” retorted theJudge, severely. “I had no course but to give effect to the ver-dict of the jury, which they gave without leaving their seats.”“But your summing-up must have been a masterpiece of im-becility!”“There was no defence, nor could be. Look here, Iff!” Thejudge broke out hotly. “I thought you knew men. Can’t you seeI’m all broken up over this? I knew Briggs intimately; I wasexceedingly fond of him; this has been the shock of my life.”“Oh, well!” returned Iff, “it is done now, and the best thingwe can do is to forget it. Listen to what happened to me atAbertarff! One of those nasty skulking tramps came round andset fire to my barn. Luckily the stream was flowing at the time— as it does all the time — but, seeing the danger, it directedits course against the fire, and extinguished it.”“Another miracle of Simple Simon!” sneered one of theyounger men, who knew the old man chiefly from his reputa-tion as a magician.“Young man!” replied Simon, “I drink to your better under-standing — and your better manners. (Waiter, bring me an-other bottle of this Nuits!) I shall need much wine.” He fixedhis small oblique eyes terribly on the offender. “The differ-ence between you and me is this,” he continued. “I don’t be-lieve the silly story I have just told you; whereas you all dobelieve the silly story Stanford has just told me.”“Come, come!” said Stanford, “it is stupid to talk like this.You haven’t heard the evidence. You’re simply defendingBriggs because you think you know him; because you thinkyou know that he wouldn’t have done such a thing.”“Oh, no!” said the mystic, “all men are capable of everykind of evil intention. But some are incapable of carrying suchintentions into effect, just as a paralytic cannot walk, althoughhe may desire infinitely to do so.”“There was no difficulty about this murder. It was a quiteplain shooting.”“If you’ll tell me the facts, I’ll prove to you how you arewrong.”“I wish you could, damn it!” interjected Holborne. “Stanfordhas made a very special study of this case. He has been incourt all the time, and he has verified every piece of evidenceby independent research.”“My university asked me to watch the case,” explainedStanford. “As you know, I am a barrister as well as a histo-rian. Briggs, of course, was at Magdalen with me, though Inever knew him well. The Vice-Chancellor begged me to leaveno stone unturned to discover a flaw in the procedure, or inthe case for the Crown. I failed utterly.”“Have you your notes with you?” asked Holborne. Stanfordnodded. “Suppose we adjourn to the smoking-room? They willtake some time to read.”“This is a lovely piece of luck,” remarked Iff, as they fil-tered into the adjoining room. “I come back from my isolation,fairly bursting for distraction, and I walk right into the heartof a first-class fairy story.” But he was quite unable to com-municate his spirit to the other men; he seemed more of acrank than ever; they liked him, and his theories amused them;but they knew better than to apply mysticism to the hard factsof life.Simon Iff took the armchair of the Senior in front of thegreat fire of logs, remarking laughingly that he was the pre-siding judge. Holborne took the ingle seat, that he might watchthe mystic’s face. But Iff playfully adopted an air of benevo-lent neutrality, which we may suppose that he conceived to gowell with his position. His second bottle of Burgundy stood ona table before him, with a cup of the admirable coffee of theHemlock Club. This was almost in the nature of a tribute, fora supply of it was sent to the club every year by the Shereef ofMecca, in memory of Sir Richard Burton, who had been amember of the club. His small pale face was almost hidden bya Partaga Rothschild, in which he appeared more engrossedthan in the story which Stanford proceeded to unfold.The latter prefaced his remarks by an apology. “This is avery simple and very sordid story; in fact, I have rarely metanything so bald.” “And unconvincing,” murmured Simon Iff.“I shall give you only facts,” continued the historian. “Plain,unquestionable facts. I shall not try to tell a story: I shall giveyou the bare bones of the case. You can reconstruct your ani-mal in the approved fashion.”“Good,” said the old magician. “You won’t omit any essen-tial facts, will you, there’s a dear man?”“Of course not. Don’t I know my business?”“I’m sure of it. Your acknowledged eminence ——.”“Oh, don’t rag! This is a serious affair.”“Dr. Stanford will now read his memorandum.”“I begin,” announced Stanford.“One. History of the parties concerned. John Briggs, agedforty-three, was Professor of Engineering at the Owens Col-lege, Manchester, but resigned his chair five years ago in or-der to devote himself more closely to experimental work. Pe-ter Clark, aged twenty-four, the murdered man, was the son ofBriggs’ only sister Ann. Both his parents were dead. Neitherhe nor Briggs have any near relatives living.“Two. The scene of the crime.“Briggs lives with an old butler and housekeeper (man andwife), but otherwise entirely alone, in a house on MarstonMoor in Yorkshire. It stands in its own grounds, which extendto three hundred acres. Detached from the house is a largelaboratory, where Briggs was accustomed to work, and oftento sleep. His lunch was usually brought to him there on a tray,and sometimes his dinner. In fact, it may be said almost thathe lived in the laboratory.“This room has two doors, one towards the house, the otheraway from it. There are no other houses within several miles.“Briggs had one ruling passion, the fear of interruption inhis work. As tramps of a rather dangerous type infested thedistrict, he had, after a violent scene with one of them fourand a half years ago, purchased a Webley revolver. This weaponhad lain loaded on his desk from that day to the day of themurder. It was seen there on the morning of that day by thebutler when he went with the professor’s breakfast. It wasthis weapon which was used to kill Clark.“Three. Relations between Briggs and Clark.“These were extremely hostile. Clark was rather a wild"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL357357youth, and Briggs blamed him for the death of his mother, towhom Briggs was devotedly attached. Her son’s conduct hadgrieved and impoverished her; she had broken down nervously;and in this weak condition a chill had proved fatal to her. Ithad been aggravated by the deliberate neglect of Peter Clark,who had refused to call in a doctor until too late. Briggs hadbeen heard to say that he hated one man only, and that was hisnephew. On one occasion he said to him, before witnesses, ‘Ifthe sheriff balks, Peter, I hope I shall be there to do his workfor him.’ There was thus the greatest possible animus.“Four. Financial relations of the parties.“The Briggs Family Settlement disposes of the sum of ninety-four thousand pounds. From one-sixth part of this Briggs drewan income; Clark, on the death of his parents, was entitled toa similar amount. The balance was held in trust for the nextgeneration; that is, if either Briggs or Clark had children, thefund would be divided among these on their attaining major-ity. If Briggs died without children, the income would accu-mulate with the bulk of the fund in expectation of heirs toClark; but if Clark died first, Briggs, as sole survivor of theearlier generation, would enjoy the income at present paid toClark in addition to his own. Thus Briggs would find his in-come doubled if Clark died, while, if Briggs died, Clark couldonly benefit indirectly through his children, if he ever had any.Thus we see that Briggs had a strong financial motive for themurder; whereas Clark would gain nothing whatever. Nor hadClark any other motive for killing Briggs: on the contrary, hewas always hoping to conciliate his uncle, and get him to helphim, both directly and in a financial way, and indirectly throughhis influence. The bearing of this will be seen later, when wetouch upon the actual circumstances of the crime.“Briggs had been making some elaborate experiments inconnection with aircraft, and was in great need of money. Eightmonths earlier he had mortgaged his house, down to the OldRed Sandstone. This emphasizes the motive for the act.“Five. Conditions immediately antecedent to the murder.“Clark had been staying in the neighborhood, and had pes-tered his uncle intolerably. On one occasion he had come intothe laboratory while the professor was eating his lunch. Thebutler, who was present, says that this was exactly two weeksbefore the murder. He remembers the date, because it was aSunday, and lunch had been late, owing to his having beenover the moor to church.“He swears that he heard the professor say the followingwords: ‘Mark me, Peter. At the house I don’t mind so much;but if you come bothering me here, I shall most assuredly haverecourse to assassination.’ With that he had risen, gone overto his desk, taken up the revolver, and tapped it, nodding hishead repeatedly. The boy, thoroughly scared, had slunk out ofthe laboratory.“Six. The day of the murder.“This was a Sunday. Briggs had again passed the night inthe laboratory. The butler had gone over to church, leaving hiswife at home. She heard the clock strike twelve, the signal forher to prepare lunch. Immediately afterwards she was startledby the sound of a shot; but she was not particularly alarmed,as small explosions frequently occurred in the laboratory.“This fixes the moment of the crime within one or two min-utes, and the medical evidence confirms it.“She expected her husband to return at 12.15; he did not doso. She went out to look for him, and saw him driving towardsthe house with another man, who proved subsequently to bethe vicar of the parish. Reassured, she returned to her kitchen.“The butler, with the vicar, drove to the house, took out thehorse, and went over together to the laboratory.“This is what they saw. The professor was stooping over thebody of Clark. He was apparently in deep thought, and seemedundecided as to what to do. The men were shocked into si-lence, and had the fullest opportunity of watching the actionsof Briggs.“He remained motionless for some little while; ultimatelyhe laid down his revolver, which was still in his hand, andpicked up a Brown automatic, which was firmly grasped inthat of Clark. This was done with the evident intention of rep-resenting the death of Clark as the result of suicide.“This latter weapon, although loaded, had not been dis-charged; the Webley had been fired recently, and the emptyshell was still in the chamber; as appeared later. It was a Webleybullet which killed Clark; it had been fired from a very closerange, estimated at two yards by the experts.“The vicar now interrupted by a shocked exclamation. Briggsremained intent upon the automatic, looking at it as if it weresome strange new object.“The professor looked up as the two men approached him.He waved a hand. ‘Go away! go away!’ was his only remark.“The vicar sent the butler to fetch the police and a doctor;he himself remained on guard. Briggs went over to his desk,put the automatic on one side, and buried his head in his hands.It was clear to the vicar that he was stunned by the realizationof what he had done.“But the vicar made a supreme effort. He went over, put hishand on his shoulder and shook him roughly. ‘Man,’ he cried,‘Don’t you realize what you have done?’ Briggs answered:‘By God, you bet I do.’ This is the only intelligible remarkthat has been drawn from him. A plain confession. Then si-lence.“Seven. Subsequent events.“It has proved impossible to rouse the professor from hisapathy. He has made no defence of any kind. He remainscrouched and inattentive; when addressed he merely repeats:‘Go away! go away!’ He would not even plead when broughtinto the court: he said nothing when he was sentenced thismorning.“The reason for this course of conduct is evident. He is aman of the acutest intelligence, and realizing that he was caughtpractically in the act, is relying for escape upon simulation ofdementia. We investigated the point on his behalf, supplyinghim with writing materials as if it were part of the prison rou-tine. After a short time he seized on them with apparent ea-gerness. Here is what he wrote: ‘Revolve — gyre — explode— balance — soul — wings — action and reaction.’ Underthat he drew a thick line. The rest of the sheet is covered withabstruse mathematical formulae, evidently intended to impressus still further with the idea of madness; but although they areunintelligible to the mathematicians to whom they have beensubmitted, they are, wherever they can be understood at all,perfectly correct. He is certainly not insane. With great shrewd-ness, on the contrary, he has chosen just the one chance ofsaving his neck.”Stanford paused."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL358358“Is that all?” asked Simon Iff.“All?” cried Holborne. “Could any case be more complete?Two strong motives for murder, one of them urgent. Expressedintention to commit it; caught in the act of endeavoring to setup a defence; confession of the crime immediately afterwards;a subsequent attitude compatible only with the simulation ofinsanity. There isn’t a link missing.”“No, but I think there’s a missing link!” snapped Simon Iff.“In heaven’s name, where are your brains, all of you? Lookhere; let me repeat that story, word for word, only instead of‘Professor Briggs’ let us say ‘the cabbage,’ or ‘the antelope,’wherever his name occurs. You wouldn’t suspect them, wouldyou? And I assure you that Briggs is just as incapable of pull-ing a gun on a man as either of those! It simply would notoccur to him to do it.”“My dear man,” said Holborne, “we all appreciate your at-titude, I assure you; but facts are chiels that winna ding.”“Ah, facts!” cried the mystic, with as near a sneer as heever allowed himself. “Now look out, Stanford, I’m going topump lead into you! You promised me two things: to give meall the essential facts, and to give me nothing but the facts.You are doubly perjured, you lost wretch!”“Come, come, I say! I think I’ve given you an absolutelyfull and fair account.”“No: Omission number one. You don’t say why he resignedfrom Owens College.”“Yes, I do; he wanted to prosecute his experiments withless distraction.”“Just half the fact; I happen to know that he was forced toresign.”“What?”“They simply could not get him to lecture. Either he wouldnot go down to the classroom at all, or else he would forget allabout the class, and start hieroglyphics on the blackboard!”“What has that got to do with it?”“Why, the problem is the man’s mind. You say nothing abouthis mind. You don’t even tell us the most important thing ofall; which is, what is he thinking of at this moment?”“Wondering if he’ll dodge the noose,” put in the young manwho had previously laughed at Simon Iff.“Oh, no!” flashed back the mystic, “with death so near him,he must be thinking of really important things — perhaps evenof you!”“That would at least explain his dejection,” he added mus-ingly. “Having crushed it, let us pass on to my next point. Youactually permitted yourself to draw deductions which are quiteunjustifiable. You say that he exchanged pistols with the corpse,evidently to set up a defence of suicide. Evident to whom?You see, you fatally neglect the calibre of Briggs’ mind. Tome, it seems much more likely that he was quite preoccupiedwith some other matter. You judge him by yourselves. Youassume that he killed Clark, and then argue. ‘But if I had killedClark, I should be thinking solely of how to escape.’ I say thatif he did kill Clark, two seconds later his mind would havereturned to the problems on which it had previously been atwork. You men don’t understand concentration: Briggs does.Besides all this, if he was going to put up the suicide theory,why not do it? He did not know that they had seen him changethe weapons.”“Hang it all, he confessed to the vicar.”“That was my next point; he did nothing of the sort. He toldthe parson, emphatically, that he realized what he had done.But what was that? No word of any murder! The question iswhat he did do, and what he is doing now.”“You’re super-subtle,” said the Judge. “I wish you were right,but there’s nothing in it.”“Stick to the point! What does his whole attitude, from thevery moment of discovery, indicate? Simply this, that he isbusy.”“Busy!” It was a general shout of derision. “Busy! with histhroat in a noose! Busy!”“I ask your pardon, Stanford,” said the magician quietly;“you are the historian here, and I beg you to correct me if Ihave my facts wrong. At the siege of Syracuse ——” “TheSiege of Syracuse?” The company became hilarious, despitethemselves.“I forget who conquered it; it doesn’t matter; but whoeverhe was, he gave orders that the great geometer Archimedesshould be spared. The soldiers found him drawing figures inthe sand, and asked him who he was; but he only said: “Getaway! Get away! I’m busy!” And they killed him. Waiter! letme have another cigar and some more coffee!”The Judge was a little impressed. “This is an amusingtheory,” he said, “though I’m damned if I can believe it. Howdo you propose to develop it?”“Will you help me?”“You bet I will.”“Well, I want a copy of that jargon of Stanford’s about‘wings’; and I want five minutes alone with Briggs in the con-demned cell.”“Here’s the paper,” said the historian.“I’ll get you an order from the home secretary this after-noon. I’ll go now. If you can do anything, all England willhave to thank you.” This from ’Anging ’Olborne.“Oh, I can’t do anything; but I think Briggs can.”“Ah, you think he’s shielding some one!” put in the objec-tionable young man for the third time.Simon Iff lit his cigar with deliberation. “I shall certainlybe obliged to you,” he replied with studied courtesy, “if youwill recommend me some of the lighter types of sentimentaldetective fiction. Time often hangs heavy on one’s hands inLondon, for one cannot always be certain” (he rose and bowedto the young man) “of enjoying such very entertaining andilluminative conversation.”“Look here, Iff,” said Holborne; “come with me, and we’llsee the Home Secretary right away.” They left the room to-gether.Two hours later, Simon Iff, armed with authority, was in thecondemned cell. The professor was seated on the floor, hishead sunk deeply on his breast, his hands playing feverishlyin his long sandy hair.The old mystic went close up to him. “Briggs!” he criedaloud. “I’m Iff. You know me! I won’t keep you a moment; butthis is damned important.”The professor gave no sign that he had heard. “I thoughtnot,” said Simon.The magician proceeded to insert his thumbs under the arm-pits of his old friend, and began to tickle him. Briggs wriggledviolently, but only murmured: “Get away!”“I knew he was innocent,” said Simon gleefully to himself."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL359359“But I see there is only one way to get him to talk.”He sat down very positively in front of his victim, and be-gan to recite from the paper in his hand, “Resolve!” “Gyre!”“Explode!” “Action and reaction!” “Balance!” “Soul!”“Wings!” Briggs looked up suddenly, savagely. “You’ll neverdo it!” went on the magician. “You thought you did; but youdidn’t, and you never will. It’s hopeless! Resolve — gyre —explode!”“Damn you; get out!” said Briggs.“Taking G as 31 point 2,” continued the torturer, “and Pi as3 point 24156, and e as ——” Briggs sprang to his feet. “Youcan’t! You’re getting it all wrong. Curse you! Curse you!” heyelled.“You’ll never do it! You’ll never do it!” went on Simon im-placably. “Sin Theta plus Cos Theta equals twice the root ofminus eight! You’ll never do it! You’ll never do it!”“Are you the devil come to torture me before my time?”“Good. No. I’m Simon Iff. And all I want to know is — howlong do you need to finish your problem?”“Oh, get out! Get out!”“Seven times six is forty-four, and ——”“Get out!”“Log one plus X equals X, minus half X squared plus athird X cubed plus ——”“Minus, you dolt!” shrieked Briggs. “For God’s sake, stop!You’re putting me all out!”“Some people are going to disturb you very soon by hangingyou.” He squeezed the professor’s windpipe till he gasped.“Tell me how long you need to finish the problem, and I’llgo, and I’ll see you have all you need, and no disturbance.”“A month, six weeks. Oh, go, there’s a good fellow!”Simon Iff went out without another word. He had an ap-pointment to meet ’Anging ’Olborne for dinner.“Well, I had to put him to the torture,” said the magician;“but I got him to say one rational sentence. Now I want you totrust me in this. Get the execution postponed for a month.Don’t disturb old Briggs. Let him have anything he calls for,in reason; he’ll need little. As soon as he talks rationally again,you and I will go and see him in the cell. I can promise youthis thing is going to clear up like a day in spring. April show-ers bring May flowers.”Just five weeks later Holborne telephoned to Simon Iff tocome round to his house. “Briggs has woken up,” he said; “forthe last week he has been working with drawing materialswhich he had asked for. Suddenly he swept the whole thingaside and looked up at the warden. ‘Who the devil are you?’he said. ‘And where’s the lab. gone?’ They rang me up at once.Let’s get down.”They found Briggs pacing his cell in a rage. “This is anoutrage!” he cried when he saw his friends, “a damned out-rage! I shall write to the Times!”“You’d better talk to us first,” said Holborne. “I may saythat all England has been waiting to hear from you for somemonths.”“I should say so,” retorted Briggs; “and you may go and tellthem that I did it! Alone I did it!” “Are we not talking at crosspurposes?” suggested the mystic mildly. “Our mundane mindsare preoccupied with the small matter of the murder of PeterClark. And I don’t think you did that.”“Who? I. Of course not. Don’t be so silly!”“Well, you were there. We should really be grateful if youwould tell us who did do it.”“That fool Marshall, of course.”“Marshal?” said the mystic.“The farmer down by Saffield. Peter had seduced his wife.He tracked the boy up here — I mean up there; I can’t realizethis isn’t my lab., you know, just yet. Followed him into thelab. Peter drew an automatic. Marshall got my Webley, andfired while the boy was hesitating. Then he threw down thegun, and went out.”“Don’t you think you might have explained this before?”said Holborne. “Do you realize that you’ve been convicted formurder; if it hadn’t been for Iff here, we’d have hanged you afortnight ago.”“How could I?” said Briggs irritably. “You don’t understand.”“Well, explain later. We’ll get you a free pardon as soon aspossible. I may tell you that Marshall fell down a quarry thesame night as the murder. He must have been half insane. Butwe never connected his death with your case. Anyhow, I’ll seeto it that you get out by to-morrow, and we’ll celebrate it atthe club. Perhaps you would make us a little speech, and tellus what you’ve been doing all these months.”“All right. But I’ve got to see Williams right away.”“Williams!” said Simon Iff. “So that is what it was, was it?I’ll tell him to-day to come right down and see you; and we’llhave him up to the dinner to-morrow, and we’ll all live happyever after!”Two days later Briggs was on his feet at a great and specialgathering of the Hemlock Club. Simon Iff was on his best be-havior, except that he would drink only tea, saying that hismood was exquisite and aesthetic like a Ming Vase. Briggs,as the guest of honor, was seated on the right of the presidentof the club, on whose other hand sat Rear-Admiral Williams,a trusted member of the Secret Committee of Public Defense,which is known to just a few people in London as a liaisonbetween Navy and Army, and a background to both.The professor was no orator, but he did not lack encour-agement. “I want to thank you all very much,” he said. “Ofcourse we can’t tell you just what this thing is, but AdmiralWilliams has been good enough to say that it’s all right asfar as he can see, and that ought to be good enough for us all.He’s a jolly good fellow, Williams, and I wish we had a fewmore like him. I mean I’m glad we’ve got a lot more likehim. Oh hang it! that’s not what I mean either. I’m no speaker,you know; but anyhow I thought you’d like to hear just howI came to think of this damned thing. You see I was workingthat morning — just finished verifying Mersenne’s statementfor p equals 167, rather a tricky proof, but awfully jolly, somy mind was absolutely clear and empty. Well, here comesthe Watts and the Kettle business. That poor devil Marshallruns in after Peter, right on his heels. Peter draws; I didn’tnotice particularly, Marshall gets my Webley and fires. I seeit revolve and explode. See! Two ideas, revolve and explode.Nothing in that. Well, then Peter stays on his feet, quite awhile, though he was dead. So I thought of reflex balance;you know, the automatic dodge in our soles; it goes wrongwhen you get locomotor ataxia. Then he gives a gasp, andputs his arms out, like wings: and then I thought of his soulflying away. Nothing in that. Well, then, Plummer throwsdown my Webley by the body and runs out. I picked up the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL360360gun, because its proper place was on my desk; I’m a man ofprecision in such matters; but to get to the desk I had to crossClark’s body, which should not have been there at all. Itbrought me up with a jerk. I stood by it, I dare say for a longtime. Now here’s the funny part. I was thinking, or rathersomething inside me was thinking, for I don’t know to thisminute who was thinking, or what. The next thing I remem-ber, I was picking the automatic out of Peter’s hand; and mymind clove to the contrast with the revolver, the way in whichrecoil is used to reload and recock the Brown. Then all thepieces of my mind flew together. I became conscious of anidea. I would make a duplex rotating engine to act as a gyro-scope, with a system of automatic balances, operated by therecoil of the explosions in the engine. In other words, I hadthe idea for a self-balancing aeroplane, a true mechanicalbird. When the vicar asked me if I realized what I had done,I naturally replied: “By God, I should think I did,” or some-thing of the sort. After that I got more and more absorbed inthe details of the problem — can you wonder that I couldthink of nothing else? I remember nothing but a great deal ofirritating talk around me, though with long intervals of mostblessed silence. Then I woke up to find myself in the con-demned cell! I want to tell you all how much I appreciateyour kindness, and I thank you all very much.”He sat down suddenly, exhausted and embarrassed. “I hopeI said the right thing. I’m such an ass,” he whispered to hisneighbor. But the applause reassured him.A little later the president turned to the old magician. “I’msure we are all keenly interested to hear how Mr. Iff solvedthis case, and saved his friend — our friend — and helpedhim to do this great thing for England. I will call upon him tosay a few words to us.” Iff rose rather awkwardly. “I’m afraidof boring you,” he said; “you know I’m a bit of a crank, withtheories about the tendencies of the mind.”“Go on! Go on!” came from every quarter.“Well, it’s like this. If we get full of alcohol — any of us— too often and too steadily and too long — we begin to seerats and serpents and such things. We don’t see horses andelephants. That is, our minds are machines which run ingrooves, narrow grooves, mostly. We can’t think what welike, and how we like; we have to think as we have beentaught to think, or as our whole race has been taught to thinkby aeons of experience. So I know that there are certain waysof thought in which a given man cannot think, however obvi-ous such ways might seem to another man. For instance, imag-ine a man of high lineage and education and wealth. By someaccident he is stranded penniless in a far city. He is actuallystarving. He revolves the situation in his mind. He exerts hiswhole intelligence to meet the problem. But what does hedo? There are thousands of ways of making money. He couldget a job at the docks; he could obtain relief at a charitableorganization — no such method occurs to him at all. He doesnot look through the want advertisements in the papers. Hisone idea is to go to his consul or some person of position,explain his situation, and make a highly dignified loan. Per-haps he is too proud even to do that; ultimately it strikes himto pledge his jewelry. A thief in a similar position is equallylimited; he looks about him merely for an opportunity tosteal.Similarly, an Alpine guide will despair and die on a quiteeasy mountain if it be unfamiliar. It is the flower of biologi-cal success to be able to adapt oneself to one’s conditionswithout effort. The whole of human anatomy is in accordwith these theses. The brain is merely a more elaborate think-ing machine than the rest of the body. The spinal cord thinks,in its own fashion. Even such simple organs as those whichoperate digestion have their own type of thought; and narrowindeed is the groove in which they move. A bee, inclosed inan empty flower pot, held against a window pane, will beatitself to death against the glass, though it could escape quiteeasily at the other end, if it were only capable of thinkingoutside its groove; similarly, the alimentary canal is so con-vinced that its sole duty is peristaltic action that it will in-sanely continue this movement when rest would save the manattached to it from a lingering and agonizing death. We areall highly specialized and not particularly intelligent ma-chines.In the matter of crime these remarks are peculiarly appli-cable; outside quite obvious things like picking pockets, youhave merely to describe a crime to the police; they will tellyou that five or six men only, in a city of as many millions,could have done it. Swindling has as much individuality andstyle as writing poetry — and it is infinitely more respect-able! But I digress. With regard to this case, I knew at oncethat however much our friend here might have wanted to getrid of his nephew, it simply was not in him to do it. It is nota question of his moral outfit, but of his mental equipment.But much more interesting than this, which is, or shouldbe, obvious to us all, is this point: How did I manage to com-municate with the man, absorbed as he was in some worldbeyond ordinary ken? I found him quite insensible to directappeal. His situation? He did not know that there was anysituation. I tickled him. His body responded automatically,but his mind was wholly disconnected by an act of his veryhighly trained will, and was merely conscious of an irrita-tion and disturbance.So I determined to talk to his mind on its own plane. Iknew from the so-called confession to the vicar that he wasacutely conscious of having done something. I suspected thatsomething to be of the nature of the solution of a problem;and by his continued abstraction, I knew that he had only gota general idea, and was at work on the details. So I told himthat he would never do it, again and again. I knew that hemust have had many moments of despair. It woke him up;the voice of his particular devil — we all of us have one; healways tells us to give up, that it’s hopeless, that we shallnever do it — that voice became material in mine; so heresponded with curses. But that was not enough; to rousehim further I began to attack his mind by quoting mathemati-cal formulae incorrectly. I knew that must upset his calcula-tion, confuse him, rouse him to contradiction. The plan suc-ceeded; he had been deaf — physically deaf, to all intentsand purposes — to all other remarks; but to an attack on thefortress in which he was shut up he was bound to reply. Iforced him to come to terms by refusing to stop the torture.He was distracted, upset, uncertain whether two and two stillmade four. In this way I made him tell me how long he neededto finish his work; and it was then easy to arrange a reprieveto allow him to finish his work. I’m sorry; I hope I have notbored you.” And he sat down abruptly."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL361361NQOBy CHARLES BEADLE.I.One of the thousands turned out yearly by the British edu-cational machine, grandiosely ignorant save of the verb “torule,” Bob Byron was switched at twenty into the positionof Assistant Deputy Commissioner for Native Affairs inSouthern Rhodesia. Civilized peoples think as spoiled chil-dren do; Byron happened to think as an unspoiled child,which comes near to “seeing black.” After twelve monthsof service an unknown lion stuck a paw into his destiny andgave him the satrapy by chewing his superior, the DeputyCommissioner.Caste upheld Byron where a Solomon would have fallen.A native problem which would have baffled any other whiteappeared to Byron to be obvious; the native logic satisfiedhis mind. Shut off in a native world he learned the dialectsslowly and very thoroughly. Natives loved him as a childloves an adult who still believes in fairies. He abandonedthe stereotyped methods calculated to impress the nativemind; he would stalk into a hostile camp with a riding whip,hold an indaba squatting with the elders, and settle a diffi-cult problem with apparent ease. He earned the nicknameof Native Bob, and became invaluable to the Administra-tion.But when whites began to come into the country he de-veloped an absurd sense of equity — an inability to com-prehend that the opening up of a country required the ex-ploitation of native labor. Accordingly he was labelled “dif-ficult;” and the foxy old Governor, who knew nothing ofnatives and cared less, but knew Byron’s value, had himremoved to the most remote district on the Portuguese Bor-der.As the strands of a white man’s normal interests atro-phied, Byron grew the more absorbed in the black mind. Tonative legends and songs he listened until his brain wascluttered with them. No sense of artistry bade him give tohis fellows these impressions of beauty and horrific mys-tery; rather, the native reticence inhibited any suggestionto translate these sagas into his own tongue. His was not anintrospective type of mind, so that he was never aware ofthe influence permeating the texture of his thought pro-cesses.As the years wore on the manifestations grew moremarked: he began to dread the biannual furlough, enforcedfor medical reasons. England became a land of chilly mistsin which many of his kind had been doomed by a fever-ruined health to dawdle out their lives among an alien folk,tormented by vain dreams of the sudorific glory that wastheirs. Native Bob lost all desire to see his own people; forhis tongue was stiffened to English words, his eyes werehaunted by vast spaces and his ears by the throb of drumsin the shrill silence; that hypnotic throb which rouses un-conscious resistance to the civilized inhibitions — a con-flict expressed by the white man in, “Oh, damn thosedrums!” Also it was borne upon him, without any realiza-tion of abnormality, that the frantic strivings after pleasureand gain which composed “Civilization” were — stupid!His fellows spoke to him of things he knew not of; whitewomen asked of him — things of which they did not know.So glad was the heart of Native Bob to leave this purga-tory for his quinine-soaked paradise of solitude and heat —and the distant pulse of drums by night.And to him came black destiny walking in a uniform.II.At the northern foot of the gaunt watershed of the Pungwe,is Nani, a lone koppje, bald topped save for a single eu-phorbia which stands sentinel over a domed mass of gran-ite that chance, in the glacial epoch, had balanced upon acrag; and in the shadow of Nani, like great brown lizardsdozing, lay the square bungalow and native huts of D. C.Robert Byron.On the wide verandah sat Native Bob. As he stared downthe yellow Mazoe valley the pale eyes appeared to be lis-tening to the mutter of a drum in the shrill silence. Awayacross the curve of bleached grass a dark smudge movedfrom the shadow into the oblique rays of the sun; flickeredand steadied, developing into four dots. He raised a glassof whisky and sparklet from the table beside him with thejerky action of fever-worn nerves. His scrawny features weremapped by the sun and malaria; his beard was rusty andstreaked with grey; yet was he young by the standards oftropic life.The violet shadows crept stealthily across the valley andate up the moving dots. An intombizaan, whose white cot-ton robe, wound above the firm breasts and under the arm-pits, fell in classic folds, glided, lithe as a leopard, fromthe doorway, refilled the glass and as noiselessly disap-peared. As the grotesque shadow of the sentinel upon thesummit of Nani shot the crest of the eastern hillside, a tallfigure in a khaki uniform of shirt and knickers, red striped,carrying a brass wired knobkerry, emerged from a thicketof elephant grass; following him came a stunted Mashonawith a rifle upon his skinny shoulders and two women bear-ing loads wrapped in grass mats upon their heads, their hipsswaying rhythmically.At the gate of the zareba the leader stiffened as he swungaside, and marched across the compound with an exagger-ated military step. On the edge of the verandah he haltedabruptly before the white man, and raising the right handhigh above his head, ejaculated a bass: “N’koss!”Impassively Byron regarded the figure silhouetted againstthe amber sky, the tribal cicatrices below each temple gleam-ing blue in the half light. At a murmured word and a slightnod, the hand came rigidly to the knicker seam. A few ques-tions and grunted replies, a jerky military salute, the ebonlegs turned stiffly and the tall figure marched away withautomatic precision . . .As lieutenants to his overlordship Byron had one dozennative police. They were recruited, on the principle thatkinship leads to treason, from alien tribes. Every man whoserved under Native Bob was a model to all the Rhodesias.One of those splinters of fate which change the course of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL362362mice and nations had pierced the foot of the sergeant;through the aperture an evil spirit had entered into the bodyand had ousted the soul of that sergeant into the ghostland.To fill what a soulless Headquarters termed a “vacancy,”they sent, acting on their favorite maxim of handing overany native difficulty to Native Bob, a certain sergeantUfumbula who, said the accompanying report, “exercisedan unusual control over his men as well as natives, but wasgiven to incorrigible outbreaks of savagery.”From the ease of loin cloth in the acrid smoke of his hutamong his women, Ufumbula was summoned to the pres-ence of the white man, whom he discovered in a yellow silkdressing gown lounging on a charpoy on the verandah.Ufumbula knew the reputation of Native Bob as well asany native. So the taboos of the white man’s drill gamewere left behind with the uniform. Ufumbula returnedByron’s greeting in the dialect with native dignity of man-ner and sank upon his haunches . . . Before the indaba wasover, Native Bob understood the secret of Ufumbula’s “un-usual control over his men” — Ufumbula was a witch doc-tor.Ufumbula came from the Pungwe valley, far over the gauntmountains of the mist; rich was he in a folk lore and magicas new to Byron as a hive to a honey bird.After the manner by which Native Bob had won his nick-name and his power over the natives, these two spent thehot evenings in the telling of legends and stories of bloodydeeds and black; in grave discussions, as between medi-cine men, upon the merits of turning water into blood — bythe aid of permanganate of potash; of the divining of thefuture in the entrails of birds and beasts; of the “smellingout” of predetermined victims as possessors of the evil eye;and also they spoke of deeper mysteries, things forbiddeneven to any native who was not of the initiated.So the administration of Native Bob ran sweetly. By daythey played the white man’s game: Deputy Commissionerfor Native Affairs Byron, seated in the Chair of Authority,satrap of the great white King across the seas, assisted bysergeant Ufumbula — and by night they foregathered to at-tend to the serious things of life.Then as the first rays of the moon greened the lone eu-phorbia beside the dome of granite, and the drums pulsedlike an artery in the inscrutable face of the mother of deathand mystery, did Ufumbula begin the revelation of the mo-tive which had urged him from the murmuring river to theuplands to seek service with the white man; the search foran ingredient to complete the making of a potent talismanthat none could resist, such as the mighty Ingombaan hadpossessed; a talisman to be composed of a part of the heartof a leopard to give courage, of the lung of a gazelle to giveswiftness, a tooth of a crocodile to give cruelty, of a certainportion of a virgin to bestow the power to command love,and — but to mention the missing ingredient was taboo,lest the familiar spirit of a rival should overhear.When the telling of the tale was done they sat silent —carven figures in chrysoprase and lazulite in the turquoiseheat.Through the insectile anthem pulsed that rhythm, a singlebeat, monotonous, soaking into the white man’s being asthe first rain soaks into the sand of a river bed. The influ-ence of the drums was always the same; he grew restless,yet remained immobile, receptive to the spell probing everdeeper into the subconscious, vitalizing the clutter of leg-ends and sagas in his mind.The drums ceased. Being seemed in suspension. Began aslower beat — as in the Marche Funèbre, throttling the fe-verish urge to the labor of a failing heart. . . . The pauseshurt, producing the illusion of an arterial control. The senseof inability to resist increased. He closed his eyes in mas-ochistic longing, like a woman in sweet expectancy of alover’s fierce caress. . . . Images floated mistily; red im-pulses stirred. Myths pranced into reality. Grew an obses-sion that he was being possessed by the spirit Nqo — thesublimation of all his ancestors.A change of rhythm partially awoke him. He saw that theintombizaan was squatting beside him. He was swaying un-consciously. Ufumbula was chanting in a minor key. NativeBob obeyed the urge to repeat the incantation in endlessrepetition. Inyama congo! . . . Inyama congo! . . . The meatis red! . . . The meat is red! . . . The meat is red! . . .Now he had the illusion that he had been expelled fromhis body by Nqo, who seemed bound by some fixed law torepeat those two words for ever. His body trembled in afaint alarm, yet was soothed by the delicious joy of beingpossessed. . . . The three figures swayed in unison, and thehum of their voices rose like a gigantic mosquito danc-ing. . . .Suddenly the drums changed to exultation; an impera-tive summons to action. Fear and delight danced madly. Nqoplucked at his sullen limbs; stabbed internally; wrenchedback his lips in a lupine snarl. Hysteric groans in sympathycame from the native camp. The rhythm began to exercise apneumonic control, seemed like a hand convulsively clutch-ing his lungs. In the eyes of Ufumbula was the glare of theepileptic. Broke a falsetto chant ending in the “ough! ough!ough!” of the maddening chorus. The pallid ghost of realitydrowned slowly.“Oh, my friend, Nqo hath spoken!”The whisper came at a moment when dissociation of mindwas almost complete. Ufumbula rose up like a buck fromout the grass. Unconscious of the surrender of his will, Byronobeyed.In the native compound a large fire warred with the moon.Blue and yellow tints flickered on the dusky limbs of bod-ies dancing in grunting unison. A circle of women who werecrouched in a shuffling dance, screamed shrilly in the stac-cato chorus as spear crashed against shield, knobkerryagainst calabash.All suddenly there leaped the great figure of Ufumbulawith horrific cries. Scattering symbolic embers, wild eyesrolling and hands outclawed, spewing froth and screams,he led the hysteric orgy. . . . Beside him pranced and gaspeda white man who wrestled with the yellow ghost of Nqo.III.The art of the medicine man, be he white or black, oratoror witch doctor, is to play upon the emotions of the peopleby exuding powerful stimuli without permitting himself tobe controlled by his own suggestions.A dream is most vivid immediately upon awakening; so"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL363363were the confused memories of the night to Native Bob.The first emotions were amazement and terror — similar tothe emotions of a Puritan maid overtaken by passion. As adrunken parson fears that the congregation may remark hisheavy eyes, so did Byron dread the possible loss of prestigeof the white man. Yet he could not distinguish any trace ofinsolence in the manners of his servants, and the placidityof gazelle brown eyes reassured him. The images of thatsaturnalia faded; became the incredible happenings of anightmare. Clearly could he recall impressions up to a point— after which they merged into the phantastic quality.Haunted by the mysterious uncertainty, he opened thebusiness of the day nervously. But the eyes of Ufumbulaand his subordinates were as inscrutable as ever, irreproach-able; the game was played with the habitual solemnity.But as he sat that evening upon the verandah with hiswhisky and sparklet, penates of his white estate, he waspuzzled by a sense of relief — the satisfaction of an animalwhich has slaked a thirst. Yet behind a pale wonder at themonstrous dream of a yellow ghost with intoxicating handsthere lurked a longing. As he watched the village smokerise in lazy spirals on the heavy air unrippled by the throbof drums, he knew that he was listening, and as a drunkardsternly denies his own desire even as he lifts the glass upto his lips, so Native Bob forbade that Ufumbula should besummoned to his presence.But as the great moon leaped, like a released balloon,above a hairy ridge, came Ufumbula stalking with an easygrace. No word said Native Bob, but listened as Ufumbulabegan to talk as if no buck had fed, no lion had roared withsatisfaction since the telling of his epic story.No drums were there that night, for the feast of the fullmoon was passed. Inscrutable as a sphinx the witch doctorsat and talked, thinking in perceptive images of the goal towhich his impulse urged, and quietly lounged the white man,scarcely conscious of the elemental ego craving for the men-tal drug which loosed the bonds of civilized taboos. . . .But upon the fourth night Ufumbula brought with him ahand drum and with it wove a black cocoon. . . . In the hutof Ufumbula squatted Native Bob, mumbling incantationsto the rhythmic throb in the acrid air of smoke and nativesweat.Thus, easily and inevitably, developed a complete stateof dissociation of personality; the link between Deputy Com-missioner Robert Byron and Native Bob thinned to the tex-ture of a spider’s web. Orgies there were of which everynative from the Zambesi to the Limpopo knew, but no whiteas much as heard a whisper, for he was one of them, of thecaste of the medicine man.IV.Then with the tightening of the heart strings came a sum-mons from Headquarters which disturbed the dual lives ofNative Bob and merged them into one. There was to be aconference upon the native labor problem. Reluctantly, andas sulkily as a schoolboy at the end of a holiday, went NativeBob; and with him Ufumbula, smart and soldierly in his uni-form, a credit to the power of Deputy Commissioner Byron,a veritable familiar to Native Bob.In the capital of tin bungalows scattered like a frightenedflock of sheep around a red-bricked Residency at the foot ofa wooded koppje, Native Bob shocked the Commissioner ofNative Affairs by an uncompromising refusal to urge the dig-nity of labor and the advantages of miners’ phthisis and pneu-monia upon his swarming peoples.“Damn the man! Been so long among ’em that he’s halfnigger himself,” commented the Native Labor agent, think-ing ruefully of his pound a head.“’Straordinary! ’straordinary!” muttered Sir George irrita-bly. “The man’s invaluable. Only got to raise his finger andthey’d come like flies!” and determined to detain Native Bobuntil the coming of a governor from Downing Street.So it was that Native Bob was condemned. The shyness ofthe up-country man is proverbial, a morose breed given tomonosyllables and orgies of contemplative silences. In Na-tive Bob these phenomena were exaggerated by the conflictof a half-freed primitive with the atrophied white partiallyresuscitated by social contact with his kind; the black in himwas forced into the background, and it protested as furiouslyas a recaptured leopard after tasting blood again. In his offi-cial capacity social life was forced upon him, so that eventalks with Ufumbula were taboo. At Government House andprivate dinners he appeared a sullen misogynist even as com-pared with his fellows from the back veldt; painful to ob-serve in the presence of women white and clothed.Now in the township dwelt one Mrs. Stella Downend, thebuxom wife of a treasury official, possessed of two things,each more virtuous than the other. The first was a daughter,pallid in the heat, of body slim, of beauty none; and the sec-ond was a robust hallucination that she understood men. Assex projects romance so was the relation of the one to theother. As her husband was a member of the boiled shirt bri-gade, the wildest place she had ever seen was Salisbury; nev-ertheless, she made a specialty of the up-country man. Shecould scent him from afar; would lie in wait as stealthily asa wild cat, and no matter how skilled the quarry was in junglelore, he knew not enough to escape this ferocious animal,seeking prey for her young. She informed him that she un-derstood him; that his lonely life in the “frightful jungle”must be “perfectly awful”; that what he required was youngsociety — which was the cue for the daughter to break cover.She would herd the two from tennis court to dinner, frompicnics to the card table, supremely unconscious that shewould have answered the call by a fit of hysteria had sheknown what was baying and snarling for expression in themind of the stammering victim.Native Bob as Deputy Commissioner of Native Affairs wasbig game. After him she loosed Sybil.That he did not respond nor even reply to questions, mat-tered not at all; Sybil chattered for him, at him, round him.The sight of this morose, sallow man haunted by the slimyoung gadfly provided grim amusement to his silent kin, forhis persecution was their immunity. After a fortnight NativeBob was seriously contemplating a bolt to his station with-out official permission, or the resignation of his office. Al-though there leaped a joy within him at the latter proposi-tion, the economic chain held him fast.His health began to suffer. He became obsessed by a fearthat he would lose control. At the sound of distant drums thetorture became acute, and often when he was beside Sybil’s"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL364364lithe young body the throb through the warm night caused towell a terrible impulse which shook his hands like an ague.What object that impulse had he did not know. Many timesthe urge to abandon his will became so intense that to savehimself he rose abruptly and left her. But his rudeness causedno remark, nor did it slacken the efforts of the huntress; forall up-country men were “queer, y’know, my dear!”Through the mask of Ufumbula’s official face as he rig-idly escorted Native Bob about the social paths there gleamedan impelling invitation, prompting the impulse to cry, “Oh,my friend, let us go,” to flee away over the shimmering hori-zon to the places of shrill silence; and at times the browneyes rested upon the slim white girl, and then upon the whiteman, conveying an autocratic message, which Native Bobwould desire to obey and yet deny.V.To celebrate the coming of the viceroy of the great whiteking beyond the seas a great indaba was commanded, to bepreceded by a dance of two thousand warriors. Fortunatelyfor Native Bob, official etiquette forbade the employment ofhis services in a district that was not within his jurisdiction;but the news disturbed and worried him. Tied by the officialleg in a plane that was no longer his, he feared the influenceof the drums. But escape was impossible. Relentlessly theday grew near; stinging and baiting, the gadfly buzzed aroundhim; more insistent grew the mysterious message in the eyesof Ufumbula.The Governor arrived. Salisbury looked like an ant heapdisturbed. For three days glided long snakes of warriors intothe long yellow valley to the persistent throb of drums fromthe hour of the monkey to the resting of the bat.From the maze of the official reception and the Governor’sdinner party stalked Native Bob in white duck, an unaccus-tomed sword at his hip, haggard and sallow, with absent lis-tening eyes; to luncheon, dinner and the race course, pur-sued by the blue-eyed cheetah, haunted by the terror of theimpulses that writhed within him. From women white andclothed he fled to sit upon the club verandah as long as anyman was there, clinging with desperate hands, drinking hardto drown the terrible sound of drums by night, fearful of thelonely bungalow policed by white taboo.All the morning pulsed the drums, a single beat, relent-lessly persistent through the yellow glare. As the triangularshadow of the koppje began to devour Pioneer street, thedusky red road to Buluwayo became alive with mule carts,jinrikshas, horses and a few coughing automobiles, swarm-ing to a point a mile away, where, like a huge black fan againsta yellow dress, a great mass of natives squatted, awaitingthe coming of the Governor.Native Bob, helmeted and sullen, sat beside Miss SybilDownend in a mule cart, shrinking in apprehensive fear fromher white-gowned limbs. That persistent throb seemed to beatupon his brain. Reality appeared like a wet rock from which,if he relaxed his clutch, he would slip into the dread pool ofbeautiful dreams. A faint illusion of the arterial control per-sisted. Vague images danced and faded like mists upon ariver. Reality was false; to his own hurt he was clinging tothat which did not exist.“Oh,” exclaimed a voice beside him, “I do wish those hor-rible drums would stop, don’t you? They make me feel funny— as if I were choking. And yet I want to laugh — or some-thing. I don’t know what. Don’t they make you feel like that?Ah — but I expect you’re used to them, aren’t you?”He turned to stare at her. Something in his mind kickedfor freedom at every throb; his muscles contracted spasmodi-cally. He clutched the cushion of the seat.“Oh, how queer you look! . . . Why, what’s the matter?”He wrenched his eyes away; struggled and was consciousof the distending of his nostrils; heard a mechanical portionof his mind making his stiff lips say: “I’m afraid I’ve got atouch of the sun.” The words suggested escape. He contin-ued hurriedly: “You must excuse me. I had better go back.I’m not well.”He called out to the driver to pull up, and rose.“Oh, I’m sorry!” she exclaimed. “Do let me come backwith you, Mr. Byron! I don’t want to see this silly old show.Perhaps I can help or do something.”“No. Go on,” he said imperatively. “Your mother will ex-pect you,” and he stepped down from the cart, bidding thedriver to continue.He stood in the dusty road, staring stupidly, conscious ofSybil’s anxious face. He wondered if he were really ill. Ifonly those drums would stop or —— A sais came along upona brown mare. Native Bob barked an order to dismount,leaped up, gave the mare a cut with his riding whip and gal-loped furiously across the veldt.The thud of the hoofs seemed in time to the rhythm of thedrums. Sweeping in a great circle round the koppje he ar-rived at his tin-roofed bungalow with the mare in a lather.VI.He hurried within and tore off the uniform of white withthe impatience of a lover. He shrank from the inhibited sug-gestion of the white taboo. In the yellow robe he squatted inan inner room. Excitement had produced a physical reaction.He drank thirstily. The distant throb sought him out and pos-sessed him. He began to sway in beatific relief.The roar of the royal salute at the coming of the Governorcontracted his muscles; sent a gleam into the pale eyes. Thepulse of the drums changed to the staccato beat. The realityof the white man’s environment faded. The orgasmic gruntsbegan to exercise the pneumonic control; the invisible handsqueezed his lungs, causing him to grunt in unison. . . . Thetall figure of Ufumbula towered above him, sank and ap-peared to blend with his own personality.The illusion of complete absorption into the rhythm inten-sified. His arteries pulsed under the delicious domination.Masochistic enjoyment became ineffable. The spirit of Nqopossessed him. The Universe throbbed.“Inyama congo! . . . Inyama congo! . . . The meat is red!The meat is red! The meat is red! The meat is red! The meatis red! The meat is red! . . .”A tenuous voice, incalculably distant, was saying:“Oh, Mr. Byron, I just came back to see — oh, what areyou doing?”The words had no meaning. Some part of him, detached,understood. But — Nqo saw not.“The meat is red! Red! Red! The meat is red!

It is Our Lady of the Stars that speaketh tothee, O thou that art a star, a member of the Body of Nuit. Lis-ten, for thine ears are become dulled to the mean noises of theearth; the infinite silence of the Stars woos thee with subtlemusick. Behold her bending down above thee, a flame of blue,all-touching, all-penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earthand her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurtingthe little flowers, and think that all thy grossness shall pres-ently fall from thee as thou leapest to her embrace, caught upinto her love as a dewdrop into the kisses of the sunrise. Is notthe ecstasy of Nuit the consciousness of the continuity of exist-ence, the omnipresence of her body? All that hath hurt thee wasthat thou knewest it not, and as that fadeth from thee thou shaltknow as never yet how all is one.Again she saith: I give unimaginable joys on earth, certainty,not faith, while in life, upon death. This thou hast known. Timethat eateth his children hath not power on them that would notbe children of Time. To them that know themselves immortal,that dwell always in eternity, conscious of Nuit, throned uponthe chariot of the sun, there is no death that men call death.

Nqo."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL366366These words, “Peace to men of good will,” have beenmistranslated, “Good will towards men.” Christ said that hedid not come to bring peace, but a sword; that he would dividemother from son and father from daughter, careless of the ef-fect of such remarks upon the feelings of Dr. Sigmund Freud.There is no warrant to suppose that Christ was any kind of aPacifist. On the contrary, he not only prophesied the most ter-rible wars and disasters to humanity, which, by the theory, hehad absolute power to stop, but he threatened eternal damna-tion to the great mass of men. Billy Sunday’s presentation ofChrist is a perfectly scriptural one. Christmas is therefore aseason of peace to men of good will, and to them only. Butwho are these men of good will? Only those who happen toagree with us for the moment.We have the most artistic photographs dating back not solong ago of Mr. Roosevelt with his arm around the Kaiser’sneck. Immediately before the war Mr. Erbert G. Wells pub-lished a book in which he said that Germany was the one coun-try in the world worth living in. German science, Germanmanners, German morals, German everything was the onlylove of Mr. Erbert G. Wells. No sooner did war break out thanhe published another book to prove that Germans were ravingmaniacs hypnotized by Nietzche. It is evident from these shin-ing examples that our humanitarianism, like all other forms ofthought, is strictly limited by time and space. The circum-stances of the moment must rule our deepest beliefs. In otherwords we must be opportunists. The idea of moral character isoutworn and ridiculous. Herbert Spencer has shown that theanimal which adapts himself to his circumstances is going tosurvive longer than those who resist their environment. Awaythen with all considerations of principle! Good feeling, honor,truthfulness are merely false ideas. They are liable at anymoment to get you into a mess. We must do as Mr. Pickwicksaid, “Shout with the largest crowd.” One of the most danger-ous things that we can do is to think for ourselves. Archimedeslost his life through being intent upon a geometrical problemwhen he ought to have been reading the newspapers so as tosee the proclamation that his life was to be spared. His busi-ness was really to identify himself, and claim the protection ofthe conquerors. We hope that no reader of this paper is sofoolish as to try to think for himself. What are papers for, butto save all this trouble? The only problem that can possiblypresent itself to us is this, “Which is the largest crowd?”The idea of resisting repression is a totally wrong one. Christsubmitted willingly to what is generally admitted to be the great-est crime ever perpetrated, although, as he himself explained,he had twelve legions of angels actually mobilized, which wouldhave made as short work of the Romans as the angels of Monsdid of the Germans in the early part of the war.I have never been able to understand, by the way, why theangels contented themselves with a single victory. It wouldhave been much nicer for everybody if they had marchedstraight on to Berlin. I have, therefore, the highest authorityfor submission to any kind of tyranny. Christ said once again,“Agree with thy adversary quickly while thou art in the waywith him, lest he deliver thee to the officer and the officerdeliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to thejailor, verily I say unto thee, thou shalt not come out till thouhast paid the very last mite,” or words to that effect.It is sometimes a little awkward to draw one’s morals ex-clusively from the teachings of Christ. They sometimes leadapparently to contradictory conclusions; and, being equallybound by both, contentions arise in ourselves which are onlytoo likely to lead to a neurosis; and that, as you know, leads toa kind gentleman asking us about what happened when wewere three years old. The Australians have a better way ofexplaining these things. They say truthfully, “Oh, you are allright,” and then as a sort of after thought, sadly, “It is a pitythe tree fell on you.”Religion is in some respects a difficult if not a fallaciousguide. Quot homines tot sententiae; or, as the Indians say, “Anew language every eight miles.” Our true guide is certainlythe biological indication. Now, as explained above, biologycounsels adaptation to circumstance. We shall save ourselvesknocks if we do what the other man tells us without any grum-bling. We may go so far perhaps as to say “brute” or “pig”when he is not within an ear shot, but even that is a littledangerous, tending rather to the calamity of thinking for our-selves. However, there are certain animals whose idea of bio-logical adaptation is not quite so simple. There is the tiger,who adjusts his environment, or himself to his environment,by means of tooth and claw. The question is whether man is asavage brute like a tiger, or a dear little caterpillar whose high-est aim in life is to look like a dead twig. It depends verylargely as far as I can make out whether one happens to be avegetarian or otherwise. It is a remarkable fact that this ar-ticle appears to lead absolutely no where. The biological testof conduct breaks down in very much the same way as thereligious test. What are we to do?Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law!Now perhaps we shall get somewhere. If we conceive ofeach individual (with his heredity and environment complete)as a machine constructed to serve one definite purpose andone only, we relieve ourselves at once from all difficulty aboutmoral judgment. We can justify the existence of PresidentWilson in keeping us out of war, making the world safe fordemocracy, and all these nice things which he does so splen-didly; and we can also justify the existence of the monster,tyrant, assassin and religions maniac invented by the New Yorkpapers and labeled William. The economy of nature providesfor all types. You cannot feed a horse on rabbits or a snake ongrass, in spite of Mr. Swinburne’s remarks about “the chew-ing of some perfumed deadly grass.” At the same time, wehave a perfect right to take sides with either the horse or thesnake. If I were a machine made in Germany, I have no doubtthat I should shout, “Hoch der Kaiser” whenever there was aslight lull in the conversation. Even so, if I had been born in acannibal island, I should have been constantly agitating for aregular supply of missionaries, and cursed my local Hoover ifthe distribution was insufficient or the price prohibitive. Solong, then, as we are true to ourselves, it is as with WilliamSchwenck Gilbert, “You are right and I am right and everyoneof us is right.” At the present juncture my righteousness con-sists of being an animal of such a nature as to wish the powerPAX HOMINIBUS BONAE VOLUNTATIS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL367367to pass into the hands of those people who are reasonable. I donot quarrel with any one for being insane. I think he is per-fectly right to maintain that he is a poached egg; but I alsothink that it would be more generally convenient if he airsthat belief in seclusion. He will probably disagree with me;and we shall then proceed to submit the issue to various meth-ods of arbitrament, ending with that of arms. But let there beno mistake about it, both sides are absolutely in the right. Evenif I prove that the other man is dishonest in his belief in therighteousness of submarine warfare or whatever it may be,the situation is not changed at all. He has a perfect right to bedishonest if he wants to. I may dislike this quality in him somuch that I am willing to kill him as the only cure; and he isequally right to kill me if he dislikes the color of my necktie.How many people were killed because they wanted to spell“Homoousios,” “Homoiousios” with the iota? But one thingseems evident to me: that unless we get rid of our hypocriticalAnglo-Saxon plague of Pharisaism, we shall never be fit tolive with.The other day I came into a fortune, and went to buy a neck-tie. The young man (or should I say gentleman) who accommo-dated me in this matter was English, and remembered me inthose days of glory when I wandered in Bond street, and boughtas many as three neckties on the same day. Having purchasedmy tie and wept together about Bond street, we began to talkabout the war. I said to him: “If I had come into this shop (orshould I say store) with the firm conviction that you were adangerous maniac, thirsting for my blood, that you were insen-sible to every feeling of humanity, that the fiercest and mostmalignant wild beasts had nothing on you (I believe that is thecorrect phrase) in the matter of atrocity, I do not think we shouldhave settled this matter of the tie (or should I say neckwear)with the philosophic calm which has characterized our inter-view up to this point.” I regret to say that this person was so lostto all sense of patriotism as to agree with me.It is necessary in many circumstances to fight; and, in orderto fight well, one needs certain quite definite qualities. In oldendays I did a good deal of fencing, by which I do not meanreceiving stolen goods. I mean the play of rapier and small-sword. I learned that I must be entirely concentrated on thebusiness on hand, and that elaborate arguments purporting toprove that my opponent was a Chinaman or a heretic, were outof place. I learned also that my best chance of defeating himwas to know what he was going to do before he did it; to readhis mind in his eye and his wrist. I think it will be clear that inorder to read the man’s mind, you must put away from youanything like emotion. You are there to kill him efficiently,and you should practice the detachment of the surgeon, whodoes not wring his hands and wail when he sees the patient onthe operating table.Whether we want to fight Germany or to come to an ami-cable understanding with her does not matter. In either case,we are handicapping ourselves by hating her. We are failing tosee her point of view. The Germans are under the monstrousdelusion that God is with them; that they are fighting for theirhearths and altars. It is none of our business to cure that delu-sion. We must accept it in estimating their minds. We can tellwhat they will do as soon as we can tell what they are think-ing; if we make any mistake as to what they are thinking, wecan no longer tell what they will do. Just so long as we hatethem, we blind our eyes and confuse our minds. Now, withregard to German atrocities, they may be perhaps a little moresystematic than atrocities on the other side; but that is evi-dence of more system, not of more ferocity. I think, therefore,that we do wrong in blaming either side for any atrocity thatthey may have committed, whether it is the murder of an En-glish nurse or a Javanese dancer.And surely the rape and murder of a single Frenchwomanby one of the heroes who are saving France may outweigh athousand such crimes committed by avowed enemies.The mildest of animals, if it feels itself cornered, will re-sort to every means of defence. Queensberry rules were notinvented for men who are scrapping in a life and death com-bat. How is it that the sentimental stay-at-home, domesticGerman becomes Giant Blunderbore? It is not a miracle. It isnot an outbreak of collective sadism. It is simply the feelingthat he is cornered. All Germans feel this. It may be a delu-sion on their part; but they have it; and we have to act on theassumption that they have it. Now what is the proper way todeal with people in this situation? There is only one sensiblething to do. We must remove the cause of their belief. Untilwe do this they are assuredly right in continuing to believe it.We should, therefore, say, “My dear friends, you are quitewrong in supposing that you are cornered. We do not wish tohurt you. We wish to come to an agreement with you on thepoints in dispute.” This may be a little difficult, as we haveall forgotten what those points were; but at least we can try tocome to some arrangement as to what is best to be done. Inother words, let us quit fighting for a few weeks or months,and have a conference. If nothing happens, we can go on fight-ing again with renewed zest. Speaking as an Irishman, I mightgo further and suggest talking and fighting at the same time— an ideal state of affairs! Now one cannot help saying thatthe Germans have shown their good faith in this matter veryclearly. They are always proposing “peace conferences,”thereby indicating that we are not, as some of their publicistsmaintain, “a gang of enraged millionaires bent upon destroy-ing German liberties as American liberties have already beendestroyed,” but a set of sensible people who want to settledown and live happily ever after. We reply, “Certainly not,you are monsters. On with the revel!” In such circumstancesthe German can hardly be blamed for thinking that we are setupon their utter destruction, and this thought is bound to de-stroy in them all considerations of mercy and kindness, or evenordinary reasonableness. They must argue that we who willnot even discuss the question of peace can be none other thanHuns. (Now I’ve said it!) I am told that the German offers arenot sincere. Then call the bluff by agreeing to the principle ofconference. We need not be afraid of an armistice; time is onour side, not theirs.Where such ideas are pushed to the limit the results areutterly abominable. We need only refer to the destruction ofone of the finest races of the world, the American Indian, whichwas due to nothing but the conviction that he was a remorse-less and treacherous savage. The American Civil War wouldhave resulted in the utter ruin of the whole country had it notbeen that Grant, in the moment of victory, forgot all aboutSimon Legree, dismissed the whole howling of the wolves ofthe press as nonsense, and observed succinctly: Let us havepeace."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL368368THE BOX OF COUNTERSBy H. H. EWERSOm dat de werelt is soe ongetruDaer om gha ie in den ru.— Breughel the Elder.I had been waiting a very long time that evening for EdgardWiderhold. I was lying in a long chair, while the boy behindme slowly pulled the punkah. The old fellow had Hindooboys, who had followed him here a long time ago. And nowtheir sons and grandsons served him, too. They are good ser-vants, and know how to wait on us.“Go on, Dewla, tell your master I am waiting.”“Atcha, Sahib.” Without a sound he glided away. I waslying on the terrace, and, like a vision, I saw the “ClearStream” beneath. An hour ago the week-old clouds had dis-solved; an hour ago the tepid rain had stopped falling, andthe broad shafts of low light from the evening sun made barsacross the violet mists of Tonkin.Below the junks were riding at their moorings, and stir-ring from their sleep. The crews crawled out on deck; withround shovels, floor cloths, and tamarind-brooms they sluicedout the water and cleaned the sampans. But no one talked;they worked so quietly it was all but impossible to hear them;hardly a sound rose up to disturb the leaves and tendrils onthe bank. A large junk sailed past, closely packed withlégionnaires. I waved to the officers lying in the sampan;they returned my salute wistfully. I dare say they would haverather sat with me on the spacious verandah of EdgardWiderhold’s bungalow than have sailed up river for days andweeks through the hot rain, up to their miserable station. Icounted — there were at least fifty légionnaires on the junk.A few were Irishmen and Spaniards; a few Flemings andSwiss, no doubt . . . and all the rest were Germans. Whomay they be? No teetotalers, but boys after the heart of Tillyor of mad Duke Christian. There are sure to be some incen-diaries amongst them, robbers and murderers — what bettercould be chosen for the purposes of war? They know theirtrade, you may believe me. There are others, too, fromamongst the upper ten, those who disappear from society, togo under in the troubled waters of the Légion — clergymenand professors, members of the high nobility and officers. Abishop was killed in the storming of Ain-Souf; and how longago is it that a German man-of-war came from Algiers forthe corpse of another légionnaire and rendered to it all thehonors due to a prince of the blood?I lean over the balustrade: “Vive la Légion!” And they an-swer back, bawling loud from their raucous, drinkers’ throats,“Vive la Légion! Vive la Légion!” They have lost their coun-try, their family, their home, their honor, and their money.They have got only one thing left, which has to do duty for itall, esprit de corps —— —— “Vive la Légion!”I know them. Drinkers and gamblers, souteneurs, desert-ers from camps all over the world. Anarchists all of them —who do not know what anarchism is, who rebelled and fledfrom the oppression of some insupportable compulsion. Halfcriminals and half children, small brains and big hearts —real soldiers. Landsknechts with the right instinct, that sack-ing and violating women is a fine thing, their very own pro-fession; for they have been hired for killing, and he who maydo the greater thing should also be allowed to do the lesserone. They are adventurers who were born too late into thisworld of ours, who were not strong enough to hew out theirown pathways. Each of them has been too weak for that, hascollapsed in the undergrowth, and can move no further for-ward. A flickering will o’ the wisp has led him astray longago from the beaten track, and he was not able to find a wayof escape. Something went wrong, but he does not knowwhere. Each of them has been stranded, a miserable and help-less wreckage. But they find each other, they close the ring,they build a new pride of their own: “Vive la Légion!” It ismother and home and honor and country to them, all in one.Listen to their shouts: “Vive, vive la Légion!”The junk draws away into the evening, westward, whereat the second turn the Red River rolls into the Clear Stream.There she disappears, steers deep into the mist, far into thiscountry of violet poisons. But they do not fear anything, thesefair, bearded men; not fever, not dysentery, and least of allthe yellow rebels. Have they not got alcohol enough and opiumand their trusted Lebel rifles? What more could they want?Forty of the fifty will have to die; but, never mind, whoevercomes back signs on again, for the glory of the Légion, notfor that of France.Edgard Widerhold entered the verandah. “Have theypassed?” he asked me.“Who?”“The légionnaires!” He went to the balustrade and lookeddown the river. “Thank goodness, they have gone. The deviltake them; I cannot stand seeing them.”“Is that so?” I said. Of course, like everybody else in thecountry, I knew the peculiar relations between the old fellowand the Légion, and I tried to fathom it. That’s why I feignedsurprise. “Is that so? And still the whole Légion adores you.A captain of the second Légion told me of you at Porquerolles,years ago: if ever I came to the Clear Stream I was to be sureto visit Edgard Widerhold.”“That must have been Karl Hauser, of Muhlhausen.”“No; it was Dufresnes.”The old man sighed. “Dufresnes, the Auvergnat! It’s manya glass of Burgundy he drank here.”“Like all the rest, no doubt!”Eight years ago, the house, nicknamed “Le Bungalow dela Légion,” had closed its doors; and Mr. Edgard Widerhold,“le bon Papa de la Légion,” had instituted his depot of sup-plies in Edgardhafen. That was the small harbor ofWiderhold’s farm, two hours down river. The old man hadpersisted in having even the postal designation,“Edgardhafen,” on the stamp, and not “Port d’Edgard.” Forthough his house had indeed been closed to the Légion sincethat time, neither his heart nor his hospitality had been lack-ing. Every passing junk of the Légion called at Edgardhafen,and the manager took a few cases of wine aboard for officersand men. With it went always the old man’s visiting cardwith the message: “Mr. Edgard Widerhold regrets greatly not"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL369369being able to see the gentlemen this time. He begs of them toaccept kindly the present gift, and is drinking the health ofthe Légion.” And every time the officer in command wouldexpress thanks for the kind present and the hope of beingable to thank the giver in person on his return. But it neverwent any further; the doors of the spacious house near theClear Stream remained closed to the Légion. Sometimes afew officers still paid a call, old friends, whose wine-glad-dened voices had rung often enough through the rooms. Theboys took them to the verandah and put the choicest wines infront of them; but the officers would never be able to see theold man. Consequently they stayed away; slowly the Légiongot used to the new way. There were already many who hadnever seen him, who only knew that at Edgardhafen it wasthe thing to call, to take wine aboard, and to drink the healthof a mad old German. Every one of them looked forward tothis, the only break of the hopeless journey through the rainon the Clear Stream, and Edgard Widerhold was as muchliked in the Légion as before.When I came to him I was the first German he had talkedto for years — of course he had seen many of them down theriver. I am certain the old fellow hides behind a curtain andlooks down whenever a junk of the Légion passes. But to mehe talked again in German. I think that’s the reason why hekeeps me here, always finding some new reason for postpon-ing my departure.The old fellow does not belong to the shouting kind. Heabuses the German Empire like a pickpocket. He is very old,but must needs live ten times as many years to suffer all thepenalties which his crimes of lèse majesté alone would costhim. He curses Bismarck, because he allowed the continu-ance of the Kingdom of Saxony and did not annex Bohemia,and he curses the third Emperor because he allowed himselfto be cheated into swapping the East African Empire forHeligoland. And Holland! We must have Holland, if we meanto live on, Holland and her Sunda Islands. It’s got to be, itcannot be helped; we shall go to the devil if we do not get it.Then of course the Adriatic! Austria is a calculated piece ofnonsense, an idiocy which is a blot on any self-respectingmap. Ours are her German provinces, and, as we cannot al-low them to shut the door in our face, we have to have theSlavonic districts which keep us from the Adriatic as well,Carniola and Istria. “The Devil take me!” he shouts; “I knowwe shall get lice in our furs with them! But rather a fur withlice than being frozen to death without a fur!” Already to-day he sees himself sailing under the black-white-and-redfrom a German Trieste to a German Batavia.Then I ask him, “And what about our friends, the English?”“The English!” he bawls: “they shut up if you hit themsquare on the jaw!”He loves France, and is glad for her to have a spaciousplace in the sun; but he hates the English. Such is his way; ifa German pours poisonous abuse over Emperor and Empire,he rejoices in it and laughs. And if a Frenchman jokes at ourexpense, he laughs, but is not slow in paying him back byrecalling the latest idiocies of the Governor at Saigon. But ifan Englishman dares so much as make the most innocentremark about the most idiotic of our consuls, he waxes furi-ous. That was the reason that he had to leave India. I do notknow what the English colonel said, but I know that EdgardWiderhold lifted up his riding whip and knocked one of hiseyes out. That is now as many as forty years ago, may be fiftyor sixty. He had to flee, went to Tonkin, and was squattingon his farm long before the French came into the country.Then he hoisted the Tricolore on the Clear Stream, sad thatit was not the black-white-and-red flag that waved to thebreeze, but still glad that at least it was not the Union Jack.Nobody knows how old he actually is. Whom the tropicsdo not devour in his younger years they dessicate. They makehim weatherproof and hard, and give him a mail of yellowleather, which defies all corruption. Such an one was EdgardWiderhold. An octogenarian, perhaps a nonagenarian, he wassix hours daily in the saddle. Long and narrow was his face,long and narrow his hands, every finger armed with big yel-low nails, each longer than a match, hard as steel, sharp andcurved like the claws of a wild animal.I offered him my cigarettes. I had long ago given up smok-ing them, the sea air had spoiled them. But he loved them —they had been made in Germany.“Won’t you tell me for once why you banished the Légionfrom your bungalow?”The old fellow did not go away from the balustrade. “No!”he said. Then he clapped his hands. “Bana! Dewla! Wine,glasses!” The boys set the table; he sat down near me, andpushed the papers towards me. “There,” he went on, “haveyou read the Post? The Germans gained a splendid victory inthe motor race at Dieppe. Benz and Mercédès or whatevermake they are. Zeppelin has finished his airship — he prom-enades over Germany and Switzerland, wherever he wants.There, look at the last page — chess tournament at Ostend.Who has got the prize? A German! Really it would be a joyto read the papers if only they had not to chronicle the doingsof the lot in Berlin. Look at their idiocies —— ——.”But I interrupted him. I did not care to hear any more aboutthe diplomatic stupidities of these gigantic asses. I drank tohim “Good health! To-morrow I have got to go.”The old man pushed his glass away. “What — to-morrow?”“Yes; Lieutenant Schlumberger will pass with part of thethird battalion. He is going to take me along.”He gave the table a blow with his fist. “That is a dirtytrick!” —— “What?”“That you want to go to-morrow, to the devil! A low downtrick I call it.”“Well, after all, I cannot stay here for ever!” I laughed. “Itwill be two months, next Tuesday ——”“That’s just it! Now that I’ve got used to you. Had youridden away after an hour, I should not have cared.”But I would not give in. Good Lord, had he not had peoplestaying with him often enough and seen them leave again,one after the other? Until some fresh ones arrived.That made him start. In olden times, yes, indeed, in oldentimes he would not have lifted a finger to keep me. But now,who was there to see him now? Two people a year, and onceevery five years a German, ever since he could not bear anylonger to see the légionnaires.There I got him again. And I told him I would stay anotherweek if he told me why ——That, again, he called a low down trick — what, a Germanpoet bartering his ware, like a tradesman?I argued upon that. “Raw material,” I said. “Wool from the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL370370peasant. But we spin the threads and weave colored rugs.”He liked that; he laughed. “For three weeks I shall sell thestory!”I have learned bargaining at Naples. Three weeks for astory — most expensive. And then, I told him, it meant buy-ing a pig in a poke without knowing whether the stuff wasany use at all. At the best I would get two hundred marks forthe story, and I had been here already two months, and hewanted me to stay for another three weeks — and all thetime I had not produced as much as a line. And, after all,there would have to be something for myself, and as it was Iwas always out of pocket, and, in short, he was ruining me.But the old fellow looked after his own. “The twenty-sev-enth is my birthday,” he said. “I do not want to spend it bymyself. Well, then, eighteen days — that’s the best I can do!I will not tell the story for less.”“All right, then,” I sighed, “that is a bargain!”The old fellow shook hands. “Bana,” he called, “Bana!Take away the wine. Bring shallow glasses and champagne.”“Atcha, Sahib, atcha.”“And you, Dewla, get Hong-Dok’s box and the counters.”The boy brought the box, and at a nod of his master’s putit in front of me, pressing a spring so that the lid movedback. It was a big box made of sandalwood, the delicate scentof which filled the air in a moment. The wood was closelyinlaid with the tiniest leaves of mother o’ pearl and ivory,the sides were carved with elephants, crocodiles, and tigersset in scroll-work. But the lid showed a picture of the Cruci-fixion; it may have been copied from an old print. Only theSaviour was beardless, had a round, or rather full, face, which,however, betrayed an expression of the most terrible suffer-ing. There was no wound in the side of the body, neither wasthere a proper cross; this Christ seemed to have been nailedto a flat board. The tablet at His head did not show the let-ters I. N. R. I., but others, viz., K. V. K. S. II. C. L. E.This presentment of the Crucified God had an uncannyrealism; I could not help being reminded of MathiasGrunewald’s painting, although they had nothing at all incommon. The innermost conception was radically different;this artist did not seem to have derived his powers of attain-ing the extreme limit of realism in portraying the terriblefrom an immense pity or from a capability of understanding,but rather from a passionate hatred, a voluptuous submer-sion in the torments of the sufferer. The work had been ex-ecuted with an immense amount of pains; it was the master-piece of a great artist.The old fellow saw my enthusiasm. “You have it,” he saidquietly.I grasped the box with both hands. “Do you want to makea present of it to me?”He laughed. “Present — no! But I have sold you my story,and the box you hold — is my story.”I was burrowing amongst the counters — round, triangu-lar, and rectangular pieces of mother o’ pearl of a deep me-tallic iridescence. Each single one showed on both sides alittle picture, the contours cut out, the details finely chased.“Will you give me the key to it?” I asked.“You are playing with the key there! If you put the countersin order nicely, as they follow each other, you may read mystory as in a book. But now close down the lid and listen.Fill up, Dewla!”The boy filled the glasses, and we drank. Then he chargedthe short pipe of his master, handed it to him, and put a lightto it.The old fellow inhaled the acrid smoke and blew it outsharply. Then he leant back and motioned to the boy to startthe punkah.“You see,” he began, “it is quite correct what CaptainDufresnes or whoever else it was told you. This house welldeserved being called the bungalow of the Légion. Up herethe officers sat and drank — and the privates down below inthe garden; often enough I invited the latter also to come upon the verandah. You know, the French do not have thoseridiculous notions of class difference as we have them; offduty the ranker is as good as his general. Most of all thisholds good in the colonies, and particularly in the Légion,where many an officer is a peasant, and many a ranker agentleman. I used to go down and drink with the men in thegarden, and whoever I liked I asked to come upstairs. Be-lieve me, I met in those days many a curious beggar, many ahard-boiled sinner, and many a babe longing for his mother’sapron strings. That was my great museum, the Légion, mygreat big book, which told me new fairy tales and adventuresover and over again.“For the boys used to tell me things; they liked to get meby myself and to open their hearts to me. You see, it is quitetrue, the légionnaires loved me, not only because of the wineand the few days’ rest which they got here. You know thekind of people they are, and that each considers his rightfulproperty whatever he claps his eyes on; that it is not safe foreither officer or ranker to leave the smallest thing lying about,for it would disappear in the twinkling of an eye. Well, then,in over twenty years it happened only once that a légionnairestole something from me, and his comrades would have killedhim had I not interceded myself on his behalf. You do notbelieve that? Neither should I if somebody else told me, andstill it is literally true. The boys loved me because they werewell aware that I loved them. How did it all come about?Good Lord, as the time went on. No wife, no child, and quiteby myself out here through all the years. The Légion — well,it was the only thing, that gave me back Germany, that madethe Clear Stream German for me, in spite of the Tricolore. Iknow, the law-abiding citizens at home call the Légion thefoulest dregs and scum of the nation. Gaol fodder, worth noth-ing better than to perish. But these dregs, which Germanyspat out contemptuously on to these latitudes, these outcasts,of no use any longer in the beautifully regulated home land,contained dross of such rare color that my heart laughed withjoy. Dross indeed! Not worth a farthing for the jeweler, whosells big diamonds set in heavy rings to prosperous butchers.But a child would pick it up on the sands. A child and oldfools like myself, and mad poets like yourself, who are both— children and fools! For us this dross is valuable, and wedo not want at all that it should perish. But it perishes. With-out help, one piece after another — and their manner of per-ishing, pitifully, miserably, through long tortures, that’s whatI cannot bear. A mother may see her children dying, two orthree. She is sitting there, her hands in her lap, and cannothelp them; she cannot. But all that passes, and the day willcome when she will get the better of her pain. But I — the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL371371father of the Légion — have seen a thousand children die,each month, nearly every week they died away. And I had nopower to help them, none at all. You see now why it is I donot collect dross any longer; I cannot go on seeing my chil-dren die.“And how they died! In those days the French had not pen-etrated the country as far as to-day. The furthest outpost wasonly a three days’ sail up the Red River, and there were ex-posed posts in and around Edgardhafen. Dysentery and ty-phoid were the usual and expected thing in those damp camps,and side by side with both tropical anæmia cropped up hereand there. You know this particular illness; you know alsohow quickly it kills. Quite a light, weak attack of fever, thatscarcely makes the pulse go quicker, day and night. The pa-tient does not want to eat any longer; he gets capricious, likea fine lady. But he wants to sleep, sleep all the time — untilat last the end comes slowly, the end that he welcomes be-cause at last he will get his fill of sleep. Those who died ofanæmia were the lucky ones, they and the others who fellfighting. God knows, it is no fun to die of a poisoned arrow,but, after all, it is a quick job, over in a few hours. But howfew were there who died like that — scarcely one amongst athousand. And for their luck the others had to pay heavilyenough, those who happened to fall alive into the hands ofthose yellow devils. There was Karl Mattis, who had de-serted from the Deutz-Cuirassiers, corporal in the first com-pany, a broth of a boy, who would not be deterred by themaddest danger. When the Gambetta station was attackedby a force a thousand times superior in numbers, he under-took with two others to slip through and to take the news toEdgardhafen. During the night they were attacked, one ofthem was killed, Mattis was shot in the knee. He sent on hiscomrade and covered his flight for two hours against theBlack-flags. At last they caught him, tied his hands and legstogether, and tied him to a tree trunk, over there on the shal-low banks of the stream. For three days he was lying there,until the crocodiles devoured him, slowly, bit by bit, and stillthey had more pity than their two-legged fellow countrymen.Half a year later they captured Hendrik Oldenkott, ofMaastricht, a seven-foot giant, whose incredible strength hadbeen his ruin; in a state of heavy intoxication he had killedhis own brother with his bare fist. The Légion saved himfrom the gaol, but not from the judges he found over here.Down there in the garden we found him, still alive. They hadcut his belly open, filled the abdominal cavity with rats, andneatly sewed it up again. Lieutenant Heudelimont and twoprivates had their eyes picked out with red hot needles; theywere found in the woods half dead of starvation. They hackedoff Sergeant Jakob Bieberich’s feet and made him playMazeppa on a dead crocodile. Near Edgarhafen we fishedhim out of the river; for three cruel weeks he lived on in thehospital before he died.“Is the list long enough for you? I can go on, string nameon name. One does not cry out here any longer — but had Ished a few tears for each of them they would fill up a barrel,bigger than any in my cellar. And the story contained in thisbox of counters is only the last little drop which made thefull barrel run over.”The old fellow pulled the box towards himself and openedit. With his long nails he searched among the counters, pickedout one, and passed it to me. “There, look you; this is thehero of the story.”The round mother o’ pearl counter showed the picture of alégionnaire in his uniform. The full face of the soldier showeda striking likeness to the image of Christ on the lid; the re-verse showed the same inscription as over the head of thecrucified figure: K. V. K. S. II. C. L. E. I read: K. von K.,soldier, second class, Légion Etrangère.“That’s correct!” said the old fellow. “That’s he: Karl vonK ——” He interrupted himself. “No, never mind about thename. If you want, you could find it easily enough in an oldNavy List. He was a naval cadet before he came over here.He had to leave the service and the fatherland at the sametime; I believe it was that foolish paragraph 218 of our pre-vious criminal code which brought about his prosecution.There is no paragraph in that code too idiotic to win recruitsfor the Légion.“Dear me, he was a joy to look at, the naval cadet! Theyall called him that, comrades and officers alike. A desperatefellow, who knew that he had gambled away the chances ofhis life, and now got his sport by playing the Limit all thetime. In Algiers he had defended a camp by himself; whenevery officer and non-com. had fallen he assumed the com-mand of ten légionnaires and a few dozen goumiers, and stuckto the hole, until relief came up a few weeks after. That waswhen he got promoted for the first time; three times he waspromoted, and as many times reduced to the ranks again.That’s their way in the Légion — sergeant to-day and privateagain to-morrow. As long as they are out in the open it’s allright; but this unbounded liberty cannot stand the atmosphereof the towns; they get into some nasty trouble in a moment.It was also the naval cadet who in the Red Sea jumped afterGeneral Barry when he slipped on the gangway and fell intothe water. Amid the cheers of the men he fished him out,regardless of the giant sharks.“His faults? He drank heavily — like every légionnaire.And, like all of them, he was for ever after the women, andat times he forgot to ask nicely for permission first. And then— well, he treated the natives a good deal more en canaillethan was absolutely necessary. But otherwise a magnificentfellow, for whom no apple was hanging too high. He wasclever; in a few months he spoke the gibberish of the yellowscoundrels better than I had learned to in all the years I havebeen living here in my bungalow. His comrades thought Iwas making a fool of myself over him. Well, well, it was notquite as bad as that; but I was very fond of him, and he, too,stood closer to me than the rest. A whole year he was inEdgardhafen: and he drank a mighty gap into my cellar. Hedid not say, “No, thanks!” when he had only got to the fourthglass, as you do! Go on, drink! Bana, fill up!“Then he went to Fort Valmy, which was the furthermoststation in those days. Four days you have to sail up river in ajunk, crawling through the never-ending bends of the RedRiver. But it is much nearer as the crow flies; on my walermare I can ride up there in eighteen hours. In those days hecame here only very seldom; but, nevertheless, I saw himsometimes when I used to ride there to pay a visit to anotherfriend of mine.“That was Hong-Dok, the maker of this box.“You smile? Hong-Dok — a friend of mine? That’s what"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL372372he was, all the same. Believe me, there are people out herequite your equals — few, very few, I must own. But he wasone of them, Hong-Dok. And perhaps he was more than myequal. Fort Valmy — we shall ride out there one of thesedays; the Marines are quartered there now — no légionnairesany longer. It is an ancient, incredibly dirty town; the smallFrench fortress rises above it on a hill near the river. Nar-row, muddy streets, poor miserable houses. But that is onlythe town of to-day. In olden times, many centuries ago, itmust have been a big, beautiful city, until the Black-flagscame from the north, those cursed Black-flags, who give usso much trouble still. The heaps of débris around the townare six times as large as the town itself; whoever wants tobuild there can get the material cheap enough. But rightamongst these miserable ruins there stood a big old building— you might have called it a palace — close to the river:Hong-Dok’s house. It had been there from time immemorial,and the Black-flags had spared it out of some kind of reli-gious fear.“In that house used to live the rulers of this country, Hong-Dok’s ancestors. He had a hundred generations of ancestors,and still another hundred, and yet a third hundred — morethan all European dynasties put together — but he knew themall. Knew their names, knew what they had done. Princesthey had been and emperors, but Hong-Dok was a woodcarver, as his father had been, and his grandfather and great-grandfather. Because the Black-flags had spared the house,it is true, but nothing further, and the rulers were reduced tobeggarly poverty like the least of their subjects. Thus the oldstone house fell to pieces amongst the red blooms of the hi-biscus bushes. Until a new glamor lit it up when the Frencharrived. For Hong-Dok’s father had not forgotten the historyof his country, as had done all those who ought to have beenhis subjects. And when the Europeans took possession of thiscountry he was the first to give them greeting on the RedRiver. He rendered invaluable services to the French, and inrecognition he was given land and cattle and a small stipend,and was made a kind of civil prefect of the town. That wasthe last little piece of good fortune that the ancient familyexperienced. To-day the house lies in ruins, like the surround-ings. The légionnaires smashed it; they did not leave onestone upon another; they avenged on it the murder of thenaval cadet, because the murderer had escaped them.“Hong-Dok, my great friend, was the murderer. Here’s hisportrait.”The old man handed me another counter. It showed on oneside in Roman letters Hong-Dok’s name; on the other thepicture of a native of the noble classes in native costume.But its execution was careless and lacking in detail, not ap-proaching the beautiful work of the other counters.Edgard Widerhold read my thoughts. “You are right,” hesaid; “it’s no good, this counter, the only one amongst thelot. It is very curious, just as if Hong-Dok did not care to calleven the least attention to his own person. But have a look atthis little gem!”With the claw of his forefinger he shot another counter inmy direction. It showed the portrait of a young woman, whowas beautiful even according to European notions; she wasstanding in front of a hibiscus bush, a little fan in her lefthand. It was a masterpiece of unsurpassable perfection. Thereverse showed again the name, Ot-Chen.“This is the third figure in the tragedy of Fort Valmy,”continued the old man. “Here you see a few minor actors andsupers. He pushed a few dozen counters across the table;they showed on both sides big crocodiles in all sorts of posi-tions; some of them swimming in the river, others sleepingon the bank, a few with jaws wide open, others again whip-ping their tails or raising themselves high up on their fore-legs. A few were conventionalized; most of them, however,realistic; they all showed an extraordinary observation of theanimal’s habits.Another lot of counters slid across to me, impelled by theyellow claws of the old man. “The venue,” he said. Onecounter showed a big stone building, evidently the home ofthe artist; on others were representations of rooms and vi-gnettes of a garden. The latter gave views of the Clear Streamand of the Red River — one of them as seen from Widerhold’sverandah. Every one of these wonderful counters called forthunbounded delight in me; I actually took sides with the artistand against the naval cadet. I stretched out my hand for morecounters.“No!” said the old man; “wait! You shall see it all in properorder, each in its turn. As I have told you, Hong-Dok was afriend of mine, as his father had been. Both of them hadworked for me through all those years. I was practically theironly customer. When they became rich they kept on cultivat-ing their art — only they would not take money any longer.The father even went so far as to insist on returning to methe last farthing of the money which I had paid him one timeand another, and I had to accept it, if I did not wish to offendhim. Thus, indeed, the contents of all the cupboards whichyou are so fond of admiring did not cost me a farthing.“Through me the naval cadet became acquainted withHong-Dok; I took him there once myself. I know what youare going to say: the naval cadet was a petticoat-hunter, andOt-Chen was a most desirable quarry. Is not that it? And Imight have thought that Hong-Dok would not just sit thereand look on? No, no; there was nothing I could foresee. Youmight, perhaps, have thought that; but not I, who knew Hong-Dok so well. When all had happened, and Hong-Dok told methe story, up here on the verandah — oh, in a far more quietand collected way than I do at present — it appeared to me,nevertheless, so unlikely that I found it scarcely possible tobelieve him. Until, right in the middle of the river, a proofcame swimming along, which admitted of no more doubt. Ihave often thought about the matter, and I think I know nowsome of the curious reasons which impelled Hong-Dok to hisdeed. A few, but who could read everything in a brain thatcarried the impress of a thousand generations and was satu-rated to the full with power, with art and with the all-pen-etrating wisdom of opium?“No, no; there was nothing I could have foreseen. If any-body had asked me then, ‘What would Hong-Dok do, if thenaval cadet seduced Ot-Chen or any other of his nine wives?’I would have answered without fail, ‘He would not even lookup from his work!’ Or even, if he is in a good temper, he willmake a present of Ot-Chen to the naval cadet. Thus musthave acted the Hong-Dok I used to know, thus and not other-wise. Ho-Nam, another one of his wives, he caught once witha Chinese interpreter; he thought it below his dignity to say"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL373373as much as a single word to either of them. Another time itwas Ot-Chen herself who deceived him. So you can see thatthere was not a particular preference just for this woman bywhich he was actuated. The almond eyes of one of my Indianboys who had ridden with me to Fort Valmy had fascinatedlittle Ot-Chen, and even if the two were not able to say aword to each other, they soon were in sweet agreement. Hong-Dok caught them in his garden; but he never lifted a handagainst his wife, neither would he allow me to punish theboy. All that touched him no more than if a dog barked athim in the street — he would scarcely turn his head. Theredoesn’t seem to me the most remote possibility that a man ofHong-Dok’s unshakable philosophic calm should have losthis head for a moment and have acted in a sudden ebullitionof temper. And, quite apart from that, the severe investiga-tions which we held after his flight amongst his wives andservants showed clearly that Hong-Dok had deliberated andcarefully executed even the smallest detail of his deed. Thusit would appear that the naval cadet was a constant visitor tothe stone house for three months, and kept up all this timehis relations with Ot-Chen, relations of which Hong-Dok wastold after the first few weeks by one of his servants. But, inspite of it all, he let them go on with it quietly, rather usingthe time to mature the cruel manner of his vengeance, whichI feel certain he must have decided to take from the firstmoment.“But why did he resent as a bitter insult what the navalcadet did, when the same action committed by my Indian boymade him scarcely smile? I may be mistaken, but I think Ihave found the tortuous path of his thoughts after a prolongedsearch. Hong-Dok was a king. We laugh if we find on ourcoins the letters D. G., and most of our European princesderide no less their tenure by the Grace of God. But imaginea ruler who believes in it, whose conviction that he is theLord’s anointed is really as firm as the rocks. I know thecomparison does not quite fit, but there is a certain likeness.Hong-Dok, of course, did not believe in a god; he only be-lieved the precepts of the great philosopher; but that his familywas a thing apart, sky high above everybody else, of that hewas — and quite rightly so — firmly convinced. From ageswithout origin his ancestors had been rulers, monarchs ofunlimited power. A prince with us, if he has got a scrap ofintelligence, knows quite well that there are many thousandsin his country who are very much more clever and a greatdeal better educated than he is himself. Hong-Dok and allhis ancestors were equally certain of the contrary; a giganticchasm had always separated them from the great masses oftheir people. They alone were rulers, while all the rest wereabject slaves. They alone had wisdom and knowledge — theycame in contact with their peers only on those rare occasionswhen ambassadors arrived from the neighboring kingdom onthe sea, or from Siam far away in the south, or even Chinesemandarins across the mountains of the savage Meos. Wewould say, Hong-Dok’s ancestors were gods amongst men.Theirs was a different kind of life: they felt themselves menamongst dirty animals. Do you see the difference? A dog barksat us — we scarcely turn our heads.“Then arrived the barbarians from the north, the Black-flags. They took the country and destroyed the town, and manyother towns in these regions. Only the house of the ruler theywould not touch; they did not hurt as much as a hair onanyone’s head who belonged to the ruler’s house. Wherepeace and quiet had been ruling the country now echoed forever with murder and killing; but the turmoil did not reachthe palace on the Red River. And Hong-Dok’s ancestors de-spised the savage hordes from the North as much as they haddespised their own people; nothing could have bridged thecolossal chasm. Animals they were, exactly as the others;but they themselves were men who knew the wisdom of thephilosopher.“Then lightning cleft the mists on the river. From far dis-tant shores strange white beings arrived, and Hong-Dok’sfather saw with joyous surprise that they were men. He couldsee, of course, the difference between himself and the strang-ers; but this difference was infinitely small, compared withthat which separated him from the people of his own coun-try. And, like so many others among the nobles of Tonkin, hefelt at once that he belonged to them, and not to the others.Hence his ever ready assistance from the first moment, con-sisting chiefly in teaching the French to discern between thequiet, peaceful aborigines and the bellicose hordes of thenorth. And when he was appointed civil prefect of the coun-try the population continued to see in him their real, nativesovereign. It was he who had freed them from the nightmareof the Black-flags; the French had only been his tools, for-eign warriors he had called into the country. Thus he wasconsidered as ruler by his people, with powers quite as unre-stricted as once his ancestors, of whom they were told inhalf-forgotten tales.“Thus grew up Hong-Dok, the son of a prince, destined torule himself. Like his father, he considered the Europeansmen, and not silly animals. But now that the good fortune ofthe old palace had been built up again he had more leisurefor looking closely at these strangers, for finding out the dif-ferences existing between them and himself, also amongstthem. Being in constant touch with the Légion, he acquiredas sure a knowledge as my own in recognizing the privatewho was a gentleman and the officer who was a serf, in spiteof the gold lace. Indeed, all through the East it is far moreeducation than birth which distinguishes the gentleman fromthe serf. He was well aware that all these warriors toweredhigh above his people — but not above himself. While hisfather had considered every white man as his equal, Hong-Dok did not do so any longer, and the closer and the moreintimate his acquaintance with them the fewer he found whocould be considered his equals. He agreed they were won-derful, unconquerable warriors — each single one of themworth more than a hundred of the dreaded Black-flags — butwas that fame? Hong-Dok despised soldiering as much asany other profession. They all were able to read and to write— their own characters, it is true, but he did not mind that;but there was scarcely one amongst them who knew the mean-ing of philosophy. Hong-Dok did not demand that they shouldknow the great philosopher, but he expected to find someother foreign wisdom, equally profound. And he found noth-ing. These white men knew less of the ultimate origin of allthings than the lowest smoker of opium. But there was onething which caused him surprise and greatly lowered his es-teem for them: the attitude they assumed to their religion. Itwas not the religion itself which he disliked, and he thought"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL374374the Christian creed as good as the others he knew of. Now,our légionnaires are anything but religious, and no clergy-man, mindful of his duty, would allow any of them to partakeof the Sacrament. And yet at times, in moments of great dan-ger, a mutilated prayer for help tore itself from their hearts.Hong-Dok had noticed that — and he found that these peopleactually believed that an impossible help might be sent tothem by some unknown power. Now he went on with hisinvestigations — did I tell you that Hong-Dok spoke a betterFrench than I? — and made friends with the kindly militarychaplain of Fort Valmy. And what he discovered then cor-roborated more and more the conviction of his own superior-ity. I remember quite well still, how he talked to me aboutthese matters one evening in his smoking-room, how hesmiled when he told me that now he knew how the Chris-tians really looked at their cult, and that even the priest hadno understanding for the symbolical.“The worst of it was that he was right; I had not a wordto say to him. We Europeans are believers — or we are notbelievers. But for Christians in Europe who guard the faithof their fathers with loving care like a beautiful raimentcovered with profound symbols, you may look with the lan-tern of Diogenes, and you may be quite sure you will findnot a single one out here in Tonkin. But just some suchconception was the most natural thing for this Eastern sage,a thing that goes by itself, indispensable for the man of realeducation. And when he discovered its downright absence,and was not even understood by the priest in thoughts whichhe considered the most simple, he lost a great deal of hisadmiration and esteem. In many things the Europeans werehis superiors — things, however, which he thought ofscarcely any value. In others, again, they were his equals;but in the matter most important of all, the profoundest rec-ognition of all life, they stood far, far below him. And asthe years went on, this contempt gave birth in him to a ha-tred that slowly grew, the more the foreigners became theactual rulers of his country, the more they advanced, stepby step, uniting all power in their strong hands. Already inhis country they did not need any longer that mediating sem-blance of power which they had given to his father, andlater on to himself; he felt strongly that his father had beenmistaken, and that the old stone house near the river wasout of it for ever. I do not believe that, for all that, bitter-ness crept into the mind of this philosopher, who took lifeas it came; on the contrary, the consciousness of his ownsuperiority may have been for him a source of joyous satis-faction. The modus of living with the Europeans which heevolved in the course of the years was very simple; he re-tired into himself as much as he could, but treated them inall externals quite sincerely as his equals. But he closed toeverybody the gates and windows of the house behind hisangular yellow forehead, and if he opened them at times tome, that was owing to a friendship which he had practi-cally imbibed with his mother’s milk, and which was everkept alive by my vivid interest in his art.“Such a one was Hong-Dok. Not for a moment could itstir him, when his wives compromised themselves with theChinese interpreter or one of my boys. Had there been anyresults of these trifling escapades, Hong-Dok would simplyhave had the brats drowned, not out of hatred or revenge,but just as one drowns puppies — simply because they arenot wanted. And had the naval cadet, when he took a likingto Ot-Chen, asked him for her as a present, Hong-Dok wouldhave given her to him at once.“But the naval cadet came into his house like a gentle-man — and he took away his wife like a scullion. On thefirst evening already Hong-Dok recognized that thislégionnaire was made of finer stuff than most of his com-rades; I could see that, because with him he came out alittle from the shell of his courteous reserve. And duringtheir further relations with each other — all that is onlysurmise on my part — the naval cadet most probably treatedHong-Dok exactly as he would have treated some countrygentleman in Germany whose wife he admired. He broughtinto play the whole range of his glittering amiability, and Iam sure he succeeded in fascinating Hong-Dok as much ashe had always fascinated me and all his superiors; you sim-ply could not help liking this clever, fresh, and attractiveboy. That’s what Hong-Dok did, to the extent of descend-ing from his elevated throne, he, the ruler, the artist, thewise disciple of Confucius, to the extent of making friendswith the légionnaire and loving him, certainly loving himmore than anybody else.“Then a servant brought him the news, and he saw fromhis window how the naval cadet took his pleasure with Ot-Chen in the garden.“So, that was the reason of his coming to him. Not inorder to see him — only because of her, a woman, an ani-mal! Hong-Dok felt shamefully deceived — oh! not at alllike a European husband. But that this foreigner should havefeigned friendship for him, and that he should have givenhim his friendship, that was the point. That he in all hisproud wisdom, should have been fooled by this base-bornsoldier who, secretly, like a scullion, went after his wife.That he should have wasted his love on something so mis-erable, so far below him. You see, that’s what this proudyellow devil could not get over.*******“One evening his servants carried him up to the bunga-low. He descended from the palanquin and came smilingup to the verandah. As usual, he brought me a few pre-sents, little fans, beautifully carved in ivory. A few officerswere also here. Hong-Dok greeted them most amiably, satdown with us, and was silent; he scarcely spoke three wordsuntil they left an hour afterwards. He waited until the soundof their horses’ trot lost itself along the river; then he spokeup, quite calmly, quite sweetly, as if he had to give me thebest of news: ‘I have come to tell you something. I havecrucified the naval cadet and Ot-Chen.’“Although Hong-Dok was not at all in the habit of mak-ing jokes, this astounding piece of news caused me but onesensation; there must be some good fun behind it all. And Iliked his dry, casual way of speaking so much that I enteredinto it right away, and asked him, in the same quiet strain,‘Is that so? And what else have you done with them?’“He answered. ‘I have had their lips sewed up!’“This time I laughed. ‘Really, you do not say so! Andwhat other kindnesses have you bestowed on them? — Andwhy?’“Hong-Dok spoke quietly and seriously, but the sweet"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL375375smile did not leave the corners of his mouth. ‘Why? I caughtthem in the act.’“This expression he liked so much that he repeated it.He had heard or read it somewhere, and he thought it veryridiculous that we Europeans should attach particular im-portance to catching a rogue exactly at the moment of hisdeed; just as if it mattered in the least whether he is caughtin it, or before or afterwards. He said it with an accent offeigned importance, with an easily noticeable exaggeration,which showed better than anything else his bitter contempt.‘Am I not right in thinking that in Europe the deceived hus-band has the right to punish the thief of his honor?’“This sweet sneer sounded so sure that I could not findwords to answer him. He continued therefore, still with thesame friendly smile, as if he was recounting the simplestthing in the world: ‘Consequently I have punished him. Andas he is a Christian, I thought it best to choose a Christianmanner of death; I assumed this would suit him best. HaveI done right?’“I did not care at all for this curious way of joking. Notfor a moment did I think he might speak the truth; but Ibegan to feel uncomfortable, and wished he would be donewith his story. Of course I believed him when he told methe naval cadet had got entangled with Ot-Chen, and Ithought he wanted by means of this occurrence to reduceonce more ad absurdum our European notions of honor andmorals. So I said only: ‘But certainly! Quite right! I am surethe naval cadet valued greatly this little courtesy.’“But Hong-Dok shook his head, sadly nearly: ‘No, I donot think so. At least he never said a word about it. He onlycried.’“‘He cried?’“‘Yes,’ said Hong-Dok, with an expression of sweet mel-ancholy and regret, ‘he cried very much. Far more than Ot-Chen. He kept on praying to his god, and in between hecried. Much worse than a dog which is being killed. It wasreally very disagreeable. And that’s why I had to have hismouth sewn up!’“I had had more than enough of these jokes, and wantedto get him to stop. ‘Is that all?’ I interrupted him.“‘Yes, that’s all. I had them seized and tied and thenstripped. Then I had their lips sewn up and had them cruci-fied, throwing them in the river afterwards.’“I was glad that he had done. ‘Well, and what about itall?’ At last I thought to hear the explanation.“Hong-Dok looked at me with big eyes, as if he did notquite understand what I wanted. ‘Oh, it was only the ven-geance of the poor deceived husband!’“‘All right,’ I said, ‘all right! But now do tell me whatyou actually mean! What is the point of your joke?’“‘The point?’ He showed a happy smile, just as if thisword came exactly at the right moment. ‘Oh, please, justwait a little!’ He leant back in his chair and was silent. Idid not feel the least desire to urge him further, so I fol-lowed his example; let him finish his idiotic murder-storywhen he wanted.“Thus we sat for half an hour, neither saying a word.Inside, in the room, the time-piece struck six o’clock. ‘Nowthey must come,’ said Hong-Dok quietly. Then he turned tome: ‘Will you kindly ask the boy to fetch your telescopes?’— I called Bana; he brought my telescopes. But before Hong-Dok got hold of one of them he jumped up, leaned far outover the balustrade. He pointed his arm towards the right,in the direction of the Red River, and shouted triumphantly,‘Look, look! There it is coming, the point of my joke!’“I took my telescope and looked intensely through it. Far,far up river I noticed a little speck drifting in the middle ofthe current. It came nearer, I saw a little raft. And on theraft two people, two naked people. Without thinking, I ranto the extreme edge of the verandah, so that I might seebetter. There was a woman, lying on her back, her blacktresses hanging into the water; I recognized Ot-Chen. And,upon her, a man. I did not see his face, but the reddish, faircolor of his hair — ah, the naval cadet, the naval cadet!Long iron hooks had fixed hands upon hands, feet upon feet,driven deeply into the boards; thin, dark streaks of bloodwere running over the white wood. At this moment I sawhow the naval cadet lifted his head, shaking it, shaking itwildly. I was certain he wanted to make me a sign — theywere still alive, still alive!“I dropped the telescope; for a second I lost conscious-ness. But only for a second. Then I shouted, bawling like amadman, for my servants: ‘Down and man the boats!’ I ranback along the verandah. There stood Hong-Dok, smilingsweetly, amiably. Just as if he wanted to ask me: ‘Now then,is the point of my joke not very good?’“You know, people have often made fun of my long nails.But at that moment, I give you my word, I realized whatthey were good for. I got hold of the yellow blackguard’sthroat and shook him to and fro. And I felt how my clawssank deeply into his cursed throat ——“Then I let him go. Like a sack he fell down on the ground.Like one possessed, I tore down the stairs, all my servantsafter me. I ran down the bank to the river, and was the firstto cast off one of the boats. One of the boys jumped in, buthe went right through the bottom at once, standing up to hiships in water; the centre plank had been broken out. Wewent to another one, a third one — all along; they were fullof water up to the gunwale; out of all of them long plankshad been cut. I ordered the servants to get the big junk un-der way; pell mell we climbed into her. But, as in the boats,we found the bottom perforated with big holes, and had towade through deep water — quite impossible to get thejunk even a yard away from the bank.“‘Hong-Dok’s servants!’ exclaimed my Indian overseer.‘They have done it! I saw them slink around near the river!’“We jumped back on the bank. I gave the order to pullone of the boats ashore, to bail it out, and nail quickly aplank on the bottom. The boys ran into the water, pulled,shoved, pushed, nearly collapsed under the load of the bigcraft. I kept on shouting to them, and in between I lookedout on the river.“The raft came past quite close, alas! scarcely fifty yardsaway from the bank. I stretched out my arms, as if I couldgrasp it, like that, with my hands ——“What do you say? Swimming? Quite so — on the Rhineor the Elbe! But on the Clear Stream? And it was June, Itell you, June! The river was swarming with crocodiles, par-ticularly as the sun was just setting.

Ishouted to him we were coming, coming ——“But it was as if the cursed river was in league with Hong-Dok; it grasped the boat firmly in tough fingers of mud andwould not let go. I also jumped into the water and pulledwith the boys. We tore and pushed, we were scarcely ableto lift it, inch by inch. And the sun was sinking and the raftwas drifting away, further and further.“Then the overseer brought along the horses. We put ropesround the boat and whipped up the animals. Now thingsmoved. One other effort, and yet another, shouting and whip-ping! The boat was on the bank. The water ran from it; theboys nailed new planks on the bottom. But dark night hadfallen long ago when we started.“I took the helm, six men bent heavily over the oars. Threewere kneeling on the bottom, bailing out the water whichkept on coming in. In spite of it all, it rose, until we sat upto the calves in water. I had to tell off two, and yet anothertwo, from the oars for bailing. We advanced with painfulslowness ——“I had big pitch torches for searching. But we did notfind anything. Several times we thought we could see theraft far away; when we got near, it was a drifting tree trunkor an alligator. We found nothing. We searched for hoursand found nothing. I went ashore in Edgardhafen and gavethe alarm. The commander sent out five boats and two greatjunks. They searched the river for three days. But they hadno better luck than we. We despatched wires to all stationsdown river. Nothing — nobody saw him again, poor navalcadet!A SEPTENNIALBy ALEISTER CROWLEY“—— —— What do I think? Well, the raft got stuck some-where on the bank.

Then hestroked his dirty grey beard with his long claws.“Yes,” he went on, “that’s the story. When we returnedto the bungalow Hong-Dok had disappeared, and with himhis servants. Then came the investigation — I told you aboutit already. Naturally nothing new was brought to light.“Hong-Dok had fled. And never again did I hear anythingfrom him, until one day this box with the counters arrived;somebody brought it in my absence. The boys told me itcame from a Chinese merchant. I had investigations made,but in vain. There you are, take your box; look at the pic-tures which you do not know yet.”He pushed the mother o’ pearl counters towards me. “Thisone shows Hong-Dok being carried to me by his servants inthe palanquin. Here you see me and himself on our veran-dah; here you see him, how I grasp him by the throat. Theseare several counters showing how we try to get the boatclear, and here are others recording our search through thenight on the river.

There is blood enough sticking tothem.” —— —— ——.And this is a true tale."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL377377INSPIRED BUREAUCRACYBy GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKGERMANY is an inspired bureaucracy. Her real ruler is thebureaucrat. His impress is everywhere. We generally as-sociate the bureaucrat with the pedant. Frenchmen run to lech-ery. Americans incline to graft. Pedantry is the German vice. Itmight have become the national poison had not Wm. II injectedthe potent antidote of his individualism into the body politic.The men at the helm of German affairs today have maintainedthe Prussian tradition of strict adherence to duty. But their hori-zon has widened. Sustained, not ossified by routine, they fol-low the star of the new.I have met four Ministers of State, four Ambassadors, onesovereign Burgomaster, “Excellencies” by the score, and PrivyCouncilors innumerable. Everywhere I found alertness and life.There was, on the whole, little “red tape.” If we elect a vitalpersonality to office, and we feel that for once we have a man,not a marionette, we bubble over with enthusiasm and are loathto lose him even temporarily in the African jungle. In Germanyevery bureau has its Roosevelt. Few but the inner circle knowtheir names. They claim no public credit for their achievements.Unadvertised and unsung, they plod away at their desks. Buttheir plans are accomplished, their dreams projected.A man of this type, a mind fascinating radio-active, was thelate Friedrich Althoff. The Minister of Culture, to render thespirit, not the letter, of the original term, was the centre of hisceaseless radiation. Strenuous, autocratic, he ruled with an ironrod. It is said that the Kaiser himself made concessions to himthat he would not have made to a fellow-sovereign. There wasno grandiose scheme of reform in which he was not a partici-pant. No vital idea was left orphaned and begging on the stepsof his office. In his bureau the most vital educational idea of thecentury, the international exchange of intellectual commodities,stepped full-fledged from a professional cerebrum. Althoffadopted the waif; he nourished it and sustained it. Who was itsfather we shall never know. I am personally acquainted with atleast four claimants to that distinction. If I give the palm to anyI shall mortally offend the rest.Applying the Napoleonic code, let us not, therefore, inquireinto the paternité. It was Althoff, at any rate, who built thebridge for the foundling across the Atlantic. Every professortraversing the ocean is a living monument to this remarkableman.Yet, so little known was this inspired bureaucrat outside ofhis circle that his death passed unnoticed by the American press.The first Kaiser Wilhelm Professor, John W. Burgess, had notheard of the occurrence until he received a letter from a mutualfriend.Althoff’s spirit still hovers over the Ministry, as Bismarck’sover the Foreign Office. If Bismarck consolidated his country’spolitical strength, it remains Althoff’s distinction to have con-quered the New World intellectually; at least, two have openedto the German mind the citadels of our universities, where for-merly only brave pioneers like Hugo Münsterberg and KunoFrancke had gained isolated footholds. Conquests of peace,unlike conquests of war, are of mutual benefit to conqueror andvanquished, and the gates of German universities swing gra-ciously open to invaders from the American side. Althoff’s spiritabides in the American Institute founded after his death in thecapital of the Kaiser. Surely bureaucracy has its victories andeducation its Bismarcks.OUR Commissioner of Education, our nearest approach tothe German Kultusminister, is practically powerless. HisGerman colleague has a firm grip on matters of religion, educa-tion and art. In the body politic the Ministry of Culture may becompared with the soul. The amount of work transacted in thehumble building, situated, if I rightly remember, at the inter-section of the Wilhelmstrasse and Uner den Linden, is hardlycredible. From morning until night the anterooms are crowdedwith foreign visitors and professorial aspirants. I have seen theMan Higher Up still at work at half-past nine in the evening.His bureau is an intellectual telephone central, where all thewires converge. If we had a new idea we should never dream ofinviting the co-operation of a government official. In Germanyall new ideas are submitted to official sanction, and vital ideasare not often rejected.The German professor receives his inspiration largely fromthe Minister of Culture. His position is curiously hybrid. He ispart of the bureaucratic system, yet intellectually independent.Those who direct affairs at the Ministry are hidden from publicsight. The professor, however, as the Man Higher Up explainedto me, stands between them and the world. The modern Ger-man professor has nothing in common with the type made fa-miliar to all through the Fliegende Blätter. He is a practicalman, alive to the call of the age. There is nothing of the aca-demic fossil about him. He is human, ambitious, and often aman of brilliant intellectual attainment. We labor under theimpression that his remuneration is scant. We certainly under-pay our professors. The income of the German professor I un-derstand to be princely compared with that of his Americancompeer. In addition to his salary he receives a certain tithefrom the students attending his lectures. Popular lecturers areknown thus to have increased their stipends by from forty tofifty thousand marks in a single year. They are officers in thatarmy of culture of which the Kultusminister is the commander-in-chief.Not far from the Kultusministerium we find the Foreign Of-fice. The cluster of buildings harboring this department mayfitly be likened to the brain in the anatomy of the State. Hereare conceived the political scores which, through the joint in-strumentation of the Kaiser and his advisers, have made Ger-many the band-master in the Concert of Nations. It is not oftenthat a false note is sounded. German diplomacy frequently com-bines, with the genius of Richard Strauss, apparent dissonancesinto harmonies effective and startling. I have stated before that,in the opinion of the super-wise, the Emperor’s interview in theLondon Telegraph was a brilliant stroke of diplomacy to be jus-tified by future events. At the same time there seems no doubtthat bungling was not absent from the matter. The fact in thecase is that the fateful manuscript was slipped by mistake intothe wrong portfolio. Some one was careless, one cog was out ofplace, and the whole machinery came apparently to a standstill.Not because it was poorly organized, but because it was so splen-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL378378didly organized. In such an exquisite machine the slightest breakis fatal.THE Foreign Office is almost rustic in its trappings. Thesofas and carpets in the reception-room are positivelyshabby. No one who has ever seen the inside of the ForeignOffice can maintain that Germany is not economical. A dentist’swaiting-room is Oriental in luxury by comparison. Still there isa certain charm in imagining that perhaps it was the ashes fromBismarck’s pipe that burned this hole in the carpet; that hisTitanic back rubbed the bloom from that couch. No stenogra-pher is employed in the political department. Never is the homelyclick of the typewriter heard! In Downing street the secretariesdictate their letters into the ear of the phonograph; in theWilhelmstrasse high officials themselves write their letters outin long hand. Secrecy is bought at the cost of convenience. Quar-ters are crowded. Of comfort, of elegance, no trace. I feel that Icould not work in such a place unless I were at least a privycouncilor. If I were, surroundings wouldn’t matter. I wouldn’tlose my self-respect even in the humblest abode, supplied by aparsimonious government, because, after all, I would myself bepart of that government.I wonder if such considerations account for the German sys-tem of titles? There is to us something funny in calling every-body by his bureaucratic title, because we are ignorant of theeconomic, ethical, æsthetic and social function of the thing. TheGeheimrat, or Privy Councilor, and his varieties, people halfthe fashionable streets of Berlin. He is easily recognizable byhis long frock coat and the distinction with which he carries aportfolio under his arm. Some privy councilors are apparentlypurely imaginary creatures. For a distinction seems to be madebetween “real” and “unreal” privy councilors. The former, the“wirkliche,” has entered the bureaucratic heaven; the mere privycouncilor, like a soul unborn, hovers in the titular limbo. “Real”privy councilors are addressed “Your Excellency,” a title alsobestowed upon high military officials, Ambassadors and Min-isters. Rectors of universities and burgomasters of sovereigncities are called “Your Magnificence.”Even outside the sphere of bureaucracy bureaucratic customsprevail. Social life is impregnated with its spirit. In addressinga person, you label him. The night watchman is Mr. Night Watch-man. His wife is referred to as Mrs. Night Watchman. A colonel’swife is Mrs. Colonel. A doctor’s wife, Mrs. Doctor, althoughladies who have earned the title object to its use by females notso distinguished. The title, it seems, establishes a communionbetween husband and wife which even divorce cannot sever. Iknow of a lady who, when she parted from her husband, wasMrs. Lieutenant. When the rank of colonel was accorded to himshe rose to the occasion. And I have at this moment in my posses-sion her visiting card with the legend, “Mrs. General, Excellency.”It’s rather hard at first to kowtow symbolically every timeyou open your mouth if you are a titleless stranger. Which re-minds me of the young American who registered as Elector ofNew York, was received everywhere like a prince. My fatherhappens to be president of various societies; he was introducedconsequently to a lot of excellencies as “Mr. President.” Henever got rid of the title. I am vice-president of a publishingcompany, and I have firmly made up my mind to adopt that titlethe next time I travel abroad. The porter will make innumer-able genuflections as I enter the hotel, and there will be anawesome catch in the chambermaid’s voice as she brings methe coffee.BESIDES, as I have said, the subject has a distinctly eco-nomic aspect. Germany pays her officials better than wedo. But she cannot afford to pay them nearly enough, consider-ing that her most brilliant men enter her service. In fact, moneyalone could not pay them. And, being an economical lady, shecompensates them with titles and decorations. It is cheaper toendow an official with a high title than to double his salary. Thetitle, more than any amount of money, determines his socialpre-eminence. If he be a poor man, no one expects lavish enter-tainments of him. The millionaire gladly trots up four flights tothe humble dwelling of the Herr Geheimrat. And a cup of teaprepared in His Excellency’s kitchen goes to the head of thesocial climber like Asti Spumanti. When a German officer inmoderate circumstances invites you to dinner, he doesn’t at-tempt to show off. His rank insures his social standing; he neednot buy your respect with truffles or cannonade the castle ofcaste with a battery of champagne pops. These explanationswere given me by a Minister of State whose honorable povertyexemplified the beauty of the system he expounded.The bearer of a distinguished title will try to live up to thattitle. His social privileges entail social duties. German officersare not allowed to go out in civilian garb. The uniform aloneaffords moral protection. Places of evil association are barredto them. Their identity can be ascertained at a glance. Like theAlderman in a small town, they’ve got to be good. And there isalways a stimulus in the hope of promotion: special merit re-ceives special and visible recognition. We reward our million-aire philanthropists by cracking jokes at their expense. The comicpress is their Hall of Fame. I am sure the fear of ridicule hastightened the purse-strings of many a bashful Carnegie. That isone of the reasons why I, at any rate, have never founded amuseum.The public is a doubting Thomas, and reputation in art andscience is an indeterminable factor. A title, a decoration, assaysa man’s worth. American society is afraid to receive the artist,and ignores the scholar. Germany lends the title of “professor”to distinguished artists, and, of course, to distinguished scien-tists. That is their passport. Great artists may dispense with it.Men of Menzel’s stamp need no passport beyond that of genius.Still their path is made smoother thereby. They are in less dan-ger of being snubbed by inferiors. And, of course, in Germany,a title is a thing of very substantial value. A man who assumesa title he has not earned is a thief, and is punished accordingly.Professors of pedicure and clairvoyance are unknown in Berlin.Titles, while ungrudgingly given to those who have a right tothem, are sternly denied to fakirs.We may regard inherited titles as absurd, but titles earned byservice are certainly sensible — one may even say, democratic.It’s the one chance of the burgher to get even with the nobility.While the system establishes a differential social tariff it cre-ates no obstacle that cannot be overcome by merit. And as thesoldier’s uniform lends patches of color to the street, the titlesdevised by bureaucracy brighten the salon. I don’t blame ourheiresses for wanting to marry men of position and title. A simplebaron sheds some lustre on social functions, and it is incrediblewhat sparkle the presence of an Excellency lends to a lady’s“At Home.”"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL379379————A RIDDLE.By Aleister Crowley.How came it that you veiled your naked splendorIn flesh so amber rich, so amber rare,Hilarion?

The mistake which hasbeen made is that people have expected to see the material worldwith their astral eyes; and this cannot be done unless the astralbody is rematerialized, that is to say, brought back to the sameplane as it started from. If you want to find out what is happen-ing elsewhere you have first to form the astral body and travelin it to that place. When you are there you must find sufficientmaterial to build a physical body. This being done, you can seevery nearly as if you had traveled there in the body. Then byreversing the process you come back to your own body with theinformation desired. It cannot be too clearly understood that theastral world is a place with laws of its own just as regular asthose pertaining to what we call the material world. In realityone is just as material as the other. There is merely a differencein the quality of the material. We cannot say, therefore, that thecolor and form perceived by the clairvoyant is really identicalin its nature with that perceived by the physical eye. Yet thereis a certain analogy or similarity; and there is no particular rea-son why the astral world should not be represented plastically.Attempts to do this have been made by clairvoyants from thebeginning of history. The most successful have on the wholebeen of purely hieroglyphic or symbolic characters. Geometri-cal patterns and sacred words and numbers have been used bythe best seers to represent — perhaps not exactly what has beenseen, but the truth of what has been seen. Attempts to make adirect representation have not been successful, but the reasonfor this has not been the impossibility of the task. It has notbeen the lack of good clairvoyants; it has been the lack of goodartists. We cannot say that there is any actual incompatibilitybetween the two powers. In fact, the greatest artists have nearlyalways possessed a touch of mysticism. One might even go sofar as to say that even art itself is of a mystic character, sinceeven the most realistic of painters transmutes the physical factsbefore his eyes into a truth of beauty. A good picture is always apicture of more than the model.In the exhibition held last month by Mr. Engers Kennedy, wehave a very definite attempt to portray that which is seen by thespiritual sight, and the result may be described as extremelysuccessful because the artist is a good artist. These pictures canbe looked at with pleasure from the purely aesthetic standpoint.There is no ad captandum effort to interest people in the subjectof the picture. They stand on their own merits as pictures. But itwould be useless to deny that a supreme interest is superaddedby the representation of the character or mood of the sitter bythe simple means of using the symbolic colors and forms per-ceived by the spiritual eye as background. We need not go indetail into the nature of the method employed. These picturesmust be seen to be appreciated at their full value. But it is cer-tainly possible to predict a great vogue for these portraits. Ev-eryone must naturally wish a representation in permanent formof their inner as well as their outer body.I have been deplorably ignorant of George Gray Barnard. Ihad been asking myself whether any good thing would comeout of America. But when I noticed the most vicious, malig-nant, ill-informed attacks upon him by persons ranging fromthe utterly obscure and ridiculous to those who ought to haveknown better, I thought it was time to look into the matter.The criticisms of Mr. Barnard’s Lincoln betray the most sense-less and vindictive malice. Some of them are so imbecile thatthey condemn themselves. One does not need to know the statueto know that some at least of its critics are beneath contempt.One remarks “why give Lincoln big feet? By actual measurethey were only three inches longer than the ordinary foot.” ! ! !Mr. Barnard (if appealed to on the point) might possibly replythat Lincoln’s feet were big because he trod the earth. The truthis that American idealists want Lincoln to look like a cross be-tween Jesus Christ and Evelyn Thaw. It is very unfortunate thatMr. Barnard should have missed this point of view; but he looksvery much like William Blake, and apparently has an equallystriking similarity in the matter of his thought. It is certainlyalmost incredible that such a statue as “the struggle of the twonatures in man” should have come from America. There is inthis heroic group something of what I call “the true Americanquality.” That is the quality of the pioneer, the man who is upagainst nature and determined to impose his will upon it, theman of ideals painfully stern and impracticable, it may be, butworthy of respect in a certain sense even for that fantastic qual-ity.Lincoln himself was just such an American. But the spirit ofLincoln is as dead as mutton in an age when the Declaration ofIndependence can be considered a treasonable document. Com-mercialism has strangled the beauty of everything, even of vice;and pari passu the slime of the Sunday School is smeared overall American thought. I have not seen Mr. Barnard’s Lincoln,but I can well believe that it is Lincoln as he was, and is, andshall be, body and soul.BARNARD’S LINCOLN UNVISITEDBy a Friend of Rodin’s Balzac and Epstein’s Oscar Wilde."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL380380THE PLAINT OF EVEDedicated to All Valiant Women EndungeonedBy GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKWhen this poem was first written it seemed to me somewhat pale and academic, but recent events in Washington and in New York have given it a newbirth and a new life. Originally his poem was dedicated to a woman of great gifts who is now engaged in driving an ambulance in France. I re-dedicate ittoday to the brave women who are battling to make America safe for Democracy.“Man’s mate was I in Paradise,Since of the fruit we twain did eat,Through the slow toiling days his slave.Because I asked for truth, God gaveAll the world’s anguish and the grave.But, being merciful and wise,He bade His angel bathe mine eyesWith the salt dew of sorrow.

And frequently it happened that two magnificent programshave been offered on the same afternoon and one has simplysuffered agonies of mind in making a decision between the two— such enjoyable orchestral offerings by the New York Sym-phony, Philharmonic, and Boston Symphony, at the first concertof the New York Symphony given at Carnegie Hall. The atmo-sphere was much disturbed by the never-ending procession pass-ing the hall; and one couldn’t help feeling that a brass bandplaying “Over There” and a Symphony Orchestra trying to dojustice to a Beethoven Symphony clashed in a most horribleway — and naturally one’s sympathies were with Beethoven —also with Bach — for whilst Harold Bauer gave an exceedinglyfine rendering of the Piano Concerto in D minor — the strainsof “Good-bye Broadway, Hello France” (from without) madeone want to scream. At a later concert Mr. Damrosch featured avery interesting symphony by the veteran composer Dubois (whohas just enjoyed his eightieth birthday) absolutely French incharacter. The Marseillaise was cleverly introduced into the lastmovement and made a stirring climax.MUSIC OF THE MONTHIt was good to find that the “Star-Spangled Banner” frictionexisted only in the press — and interesting to find that Dr.Muck’s genius almost succeeded in turning into a classic — bya very clever and unique orchestration which gave quite a Wag-nerian effect. What a wonderful conductor he is! Surely one ofthe greatest. His magnetism seems to bring the best out of everymember of his orchestra — and what a marvelous result — whocan ever forget his memorable rendering of Beethoven’s 5thsymphony at the matinée concert? Who has ever heard suchpianissimos from an orchestra?One was also struck by the splendid discipline in his orches-tra — a quiet dignity and earnest — such as is exemplified intheir conductor — and one couldn’t help contrasting the go asyou please attitude of the New York Symphony men — many ofwhom gaze about bowing and smiling to their friends in theaudience. Even during a symphony — whilst counting their barsrest. — This is particularly noticeable amongst the first violins,and might well be called to Mr. Damrosch’s attention.The Letz Quartette, successor to the famous Kneisels — gavea delightful rendering of Beethoven’s F minor Quartette — alsoLeo Weiner’s interesting string quartette. This clever youngHungarian has also written for orchestra — and much moremust be heard from him. The Letz ensemble is not quite what it"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL382382should be yet owing to the rearrangement of the quartette, butone feels that in a very short while these four excellent artistswill leave nothing to be desired.The Flonzaleys will play quartettes of Mozart, Dohnany andHaydn on November 27th with their new viola, Louis Bailly —and the Societé des Instruments Anciens, which gave such de-lightful concerts last season, just arrived from France, will playon November 24th. Of the many song recitals of the month fewbear remembering. Evan Williams’ recital was a veritable treat— also Rothier gave much pleasure; but why did Graveure notgive us a more varied program? With all deference to Bryce-Trehearne, one group would have sufficed. Mona Honeseu sangwith a deal of charm; Christine Miller, Edith Jeanne and MaryJordan also gave recitals.Fritz Kreisler was in wonderful form on October 28th atCarnegie Hall, and played Tartini’s Sonata in G minor mag-nificently. A marvelous man — he has put even Pittsburgh onthe map — of abject infamy. Jascha Heifetz, the 18-year-oldRussian, has already arrived and is a complete master of theviolin — has much poise and dignity, truly remarkable at hisage. His playing created a furore on October 27th, and onelooks forward to his next recital, December 1st. His appear-ance with the New York Symphony was a little disappointingin so much as the Brusch D minor concerto didn’t give suffi-cient opportunity for his exceptional powers. Elman playedthe Beethoven concerts very beautifully, and has, one is gladto say, lost most of his mannerisms. That wonderful youngpianist, Misha Levitzki, played superbly before a very distin-guished audience at his recital, many famous artists beingpresent, and again proved himself to be amongst the great pia-nists of the day. His calm indifference when his chair brokeduring the appassionata (which he played magnificently)caused much comment.And what shall be said of the beautiful and instructive pro-gram given by Joseph Bonnet, the distinguished organ virtuoso(who is on leave from the French army) at his first organ recitaldevoted to the forerunners of Johann Sebastian Bach, illustrat-ing the history of organ music from the earliest composers tothe present time. The second recital was devoted to Bach; andone looks forward with no small degree of interest to the re-maining recitals of this great artist, of which I shall say more inmy next letter.Ever yours,HAUT BOY.DRAMA AS SHE IS PLAYEDthe Empire represents fascinating wickedness. But just forthat reason he got a capital grasp of what average people inEngland really think. The clever people that think Shaw sowonderful do not realize that his characters might possiblyexist in the moon, but have nothing to do with life on thisparticular grain of dust.The play was well enough acted; though, of course, Ameri-cans can never give the tone of English society. John Drewcame nearest to success, though perhaps he was aided by astrong personal resemblance to a well known Welsh aristo-crat. Valma was played extremely well, and MargaretIllington was very good indeed in what I think is one of themost difficult woman’s parts ever written. She was certainlyfar from successful if she wished to make the part sympa-thetic, and indeed I think it never could be altogether so.But the quality of her acting was certainly extremely fine.The famous bedroom scene could not have been betterplayed. Muriel Eden was particularly charming, with thelargest and most fascinating mouth ever seen on any stage.The part of Sir Chichester Frayne was very cleverly played;exactly the right foil to Quex. The Duchess was an Ameri-can Duchess.———“What is Your Husband Doing,” is a marvelous farce. It ismarvelous because it is funny without being risky. Every char-acter in the play is thoroughly respectable and yet contrivesto be intensely amusing. It is a genuinely American farce,borrowing neither from Paris nor from Berlin nor yet fromLondon. Boston would call it “in good taste”; Chicago,“dainty”; San Francisco, “clean cut.” We call it good com-edy. May George V. Hobart never write a worse piece.In “My Lady’s Dress,” Edward Knoblauch created a newcharacter for the theatre. He was the man dressmaker, theexquisite, whose refined cruelty and tastes brought him suc-cess and in the end disaster. With great skill Knoblauch re-vealed the man’s feline qualities, his vanity, his hardness,his practical devotion to business and even his charm. Nowwe have a different kind of man dressmaker on the stage. Heappears in “Lombardi, Ltd.” Lombardi, the latest stage mandressmaker, is very kind, sweet, very good but not very in-teresting. He is so full of self-sacrifice and piety that one’sheart goes out to his traducers. Indeed his sweetheart, whomhe refuses to kiss (so pure is he) is really the tragic figure inthe play. Naturally she runs away with another man withoutthe formality of a wedding certificate. Furthermore, as sheexplains, she will never get married. Lombardi’s goodnesshad ruined the poor child. The most amusing character in theplay is the innocent little mannequin who insists thatLombardi seduce her. She had been told, she explains, thatit was impossible to remain virtuous and be a mannequin atthe same time. “I am ready to be ruined,” she tells the aston-ished Lombardi, “any time you say so.” Needless to say, inLombardi’s shop the poor working girl is safe. I am inclinedto believe that in real life Lombardies do exist in greaterquantities than the kind of dressmaker depicted by Mr.Knoblauch. That accounts for the dullness of life, for thepleasure “My Lady’s Dress” gave everyone.———It was a very great relief to witness the “Gay Lord Quex.”I always thought the play a good one; an excellent portrayalof the manners of the period.

Y.THE HISTORY OF THE BELGIANPEOPLE.FROM THE FIRST AUTHENTICANNAL TO THE PRESENT TIME.The International Historical Society.It is with a somewhat sardonic smile that onereflects upon the fact presented by the existenceof this book. It is not the Englishman whostretches “hands across the sea” and portrays thecharacter and destiny of his greatly belovedcousin. It is a Prussian who gives America a pa-tient and sympathetic understanding and elabo-rate study. It is difficult for an Englishman evento do so much as to read a book of this kind. I amacquainted with a number of distinguished En-glishmen at the present resident in these States;and from no one of them have I ever heard a singlegood word for America. One went so far as tosay that the sole pleasure of Englishmen in thiscountry was to get together and abuse it. I haveheard it said by one of them that the strongestpassion of his lifetime of strong passions has beenhatred or rather loathing for America, that thispassion eats up the soul, destroys the memory ofall other things and with such violence that thebody itself in turn becomes sick. I have heard onemaster of language say that he is being irritatedbeyond all measure hourly by the impossibilityof finding any words to express the intensity ofhis disgust. Yet it is to England that America in-nocently looks for friendship and alliance! It isagainst Germany that she fulminates every dayin her (very-largely-English-owned) press. It isreally painful to read Professor Münsterberg’sbook at the present juncture. He is abominablyfair. Even the most glaring abuses of America,abuses which are admitted by all its own citizenshe refuses to condemn. He always finds a psy-chological reason to explain the apparent wrong,on fundamental grounds which are in themselvesprofoundly and beautifully right. Similarly, inwhat seem to the ordinary observer to be blankspots in American culture, art, literature, purescience, and philosophy, Professor Münsterbergfinds achievement even as well as promise. Hemust have been devoured by passionate love forthe people among whom he lived and worked.One cannot say much for the quality of the grati-tude displayed in return, but I feel, however, thatProfessor Münsterberg himself were he alivewould say that this ingratitude did not matter, thathis book would remain a classical investigationof American conditions, and that its influencewould ultimately lead to a true assimilation be-tween the American and Teutonic temperaments.One might say, if one wished to be epigram-matic, that the Germans are all brains and theAmericans all nerves. There is surely somethingwrong with the world when these two organs ofa microcosm are in apparent conflict. In fact,one cannot believe that it is so. The more onestudies the matter from a philosophical stand-point, the more certain it becomes that thepresent breach of the peace is an artificial andfictitious lesion, a quarrel which does not repre-sent even for a single moment the truth of thematter. It is unnecessary to dilate further uponthe extraordinary thoroughness of ProfessorMünsterberg’s great work. The depth of insightdisplayed is only what one would expect fromone of the greatest psychologists of his period.The thoroughness is characteristically German.But the point of view is more than German: it ishuman.THE AMERICANS.By Professor Hugo Münsterberg.The late Lord Salisbury, on one celebrated oc-casion, lamented that the task of a statesman in ademocracy was made almost impossible by the factthat people did not read history. But after all, doyou know, it was rather hard luck on the people!History was always written with portentous dull-ness, and it was printed in folios or quartos, eachvolume of which weighed about 3.785 metric tons.Even an enthusiast could hardly be expected towade through this kind of book. It was too muchlike digging. In fact it was very often like diggingfor gold in a place where there wasn’t any.But there is no reason in nature why historyshould be dull; and certainly none why it shouldbe presented in steam-roller form. History dealswith realities, the lives of actual people; and it isreality alone in which we are fundamentally in-terested. We have now discovered that fairy sto-ries appeal to us only because they sound sym-bolically the hidden depths of our vita sexualis.We accept stories in so far as we are genuinelytouched by them, and where a historical basishelps our conviction of reality, we get one of thehighest forms of fiction, the historical novel.There is, however, a counterpart to the plan ofbuttressing fiction by history; and that is to writehistory with imagination. Everyone knows howdreadful a sense of unreality is created by theperusal of Blue Books. It is much better to clothefacts with insight, style, and even a touch of ro-mance. Our ancestors certainly possessed skel-etons; but they did not walk about without fleshand blood to cover them.There is, therefore, every reason to rejoicewhen a history appears which satisfies these con-ditions and in addition is presented in a readableform. This volume now under review will go con-veniently into a pocket. Yet the type is excellentlyclear, and large enough to enable even very weakeyes to read without strain. The binding is ex-tremely ornamental and artistic, entirely suitedto the character of the works.This “History of the Belgian People” is uni-form with the excellent series of volumes of the“History of the German People.” It is a book ofextraordinary value at the present moment whenBelgium is once more a point of shock betweenopposing economic currents. Man is determinedin his actions by his antecedents. The Belgianpeople did not descend suddenly from heaven.Their conditions are determined altogether bytheir history. We cannot understand why a manperforms so simple an action as eating unless wego right back through evolution to the nutritionof protoplasm; and the attitude of Belgium in thepresent war can only be understood by going backto the first origins, and considering how climaticand geographical conditions determined the trendof religious, political and economic forces. In aperiod like the present when sanity of standpoint,breadth and completeness of view, and probity ofjudgement are so necessary to combat the hys-terical arguments which are so prevalent on bothsides of the present conflict, it is of the utmostimportance that everyone should grasp the WHYof Belgium.A.

Y.DEMOCRACY IN IRELAND SINCE 1913.THE TERROR.By Arthur Machen.McBride, New York.I have always maintained that Arthur Machenwas one of the most original and excellent mindsof England. The distinction of his thought andstyle is one of the most unmistakable of contem-porary literary phenomena. He failed somewhatto come to his full stature because of an unfortu-nate obsession. His reverence for antiquity is sogreat that he has been compelled to follow thegreat masters in what I may call the frameworkof their art. Thus he began by telling Stevensonstories, and he was obliged to give themStevenson’s sections, so that “The Three Impos-tors” reads like a new episode of “The Dyna-miter.” In particular, “Miss Leicester” or “MissLally” makes a very fair duplicate of Stevenson’sone successful attempt to portray a woman. I wasrather sorry to see Mr. Machen adventure him-self in the province of scientific romance. It wasonly too clear that he would adopt the manner ofMr. H. G. Wells. However, his distinction hassaved him from too margarine an effect. One isable to say with clear conscience that this is anexcellent story, admirably written.At the same time, one must say that this is notat all the time to have written it. The story isgrossly seditious and openly pro-German. Mr.Machen, as his name implies, is, of course, him-self a pure German. It is impossible to understandthe stupidity of the British authorities in not hav-ing him interned, or indeed executed. It will beremembered that he furnished the basis for thefable of the “Angels of Mons,” which did so muchto discourage recruiting in the early days of thewar. This book is equally pernicious. The catas-trophe is caused, according to him, by the fact ofthe animals having lost their fear of and respectfor man, owing to the wickedness of man, theabdication of his human sovereignty. Now, Mr.Machen caused his catastrophe to take place inEngland. His characters blame the wicked Ger-This small pamphlet is without publishers’ orprinters’ marks. It contains an account of the mur-der of Francis Sheehy Skeffington, with an ar-ticle written by Mr. Skeffington, reprinted fromthe “Century Magazine.” The murder of Mr.Skeffington was, as some statesman or other oncesaid: “Much worse than a crime, it was a blun-der.” The murder of Mr. Thomas Ashe comes un-der the same category. In fact, it is always diffi-cult to blame the authors of such atrocities. Natu-rally enough, they always occur in circumstanceswhere clear reason and common sense are inhib-ited. These incidents must therefore be classed ina sense as accidents, and moral indignation isreally a somewhat primitive reaction.It is absurd to class Captain Bowen-Colthurstas a monster and a villain. He was simply an of-ficer who completely lost his nerve. At the sametime, one cannot expect the man in the street totake this philosophical view of what on the sur-face is certainly a most infamous outrage, anabomination almost unbelievable; and we mustnot be surprised that the Irish crudely determineto do away with the entire system which makessuch things possible. The real cure does not lie inany political readjustment; a complete advancein civilization is necessary. Cool reason and com-mon sense and presence of mind must becomenormal to the race. The Irish Republican will re-ply that that is quite true, and that these qualitieswill develop best when Ireland is free. It is hardto reply to this contention. But it is equally clearthat Ireland will have been freed in vain, if thequalities of cool reason, etc., are not thereby de-veloped. Ireland must cease to be the enemy ofEngland the moment England has ceased to showherself the enemy of Ireland.A.
