It’s worthit. We shall not let the standard down.The November number will be perfectly won-derful.There’s one of the best of the Simon Iff sto-ries — a tale of a bank robbery. I’m not surethat it isn’t the most exciting of the whole se-ries. It certainly has got action — ever see aBattery Mule in a panic?Then there’s another of the great Mark Wellsstories of the golden past — one, by the way,with a very strong application to the affairs ofto-day.The Mark Wells stories of Pagan times areall true stories in the highest sense of the word.That is, they make these periods live again be-fore the reader’s eyes. The customs and beliefswhich they describe are authentic, on the au-thority of the greatest of all archaeologists, Dr.J. G. Frazer, Lilt. D., whose classic, “TheGolden Bough,” is Mr. Wells’ chief source ofinformation.We have, too, a startling article onShakespeare by Dr. Louis Wilkinson —Shakespeare as Rebel, Aristocrat and Pessimist.And we have the concluding section of theRevival of Magick — with more to follow.And we have quite a number of other goodthings — and the trouble is that we don’t wantto announce them, because it is so hard to de-cide to hold any one of them over.Now do help us to increase the size of thismagazine to forty-eight pages. There isn’t an-other International in the world, and there neverwill be. We have a new point of view, the rar-est and most beautiful thing that exists.

XI. NO. 10.  OCTOBER, 1917  PRICE 15 CENTSI.Of all the Graces that cluster about the throne of Venus themost timid and elusive is that maiden whom mortals call Hap-piness. None is so eagerly pursued; none is so hard to win. In-deed, only the saints and martyrs, unknown usually to their fel-low-men, have made her theirs; and they have attained her byburning out the Ego-sense in themselves with the white-hot steelof meditation, by dissolving themselves in that divine ocean ofConsciousness whose foam is passionless and perfect bliss.To others, Happiness only comes as by chance; when leastsought, perhaps she is there. Seek, and ye shall not find; ask,and ye shall not receive; knock, and it shall not be opened untoyou. Happiness is always a divine accident. It is not a definitequality; it is the bloom of circumstances. It is useless to mix itsingredients; the experiments in life which have produced it inthe past may be repeated endlessly, and with infinite skill andvariety — in vain.It seems more than a fairy story that so metaphysical an en-tity should yet be producible in a moment by no means of wis-dom, no formula of magic, but by a simple herb. The wisestman cannot add happiness to others, though they be doweredwith youth, beauty, wealth, health, wit and love; the lowest black-guard shivering in rags, destitute, diseased, old, craven, stupid,a mere morass of envy, may have it with one swift-sucked breath.The thing is as paradoxical as life, as mystical as death.Look at this shining heap of crystals! They are Hydrochlorideof Cocaine. The geologist will think of mica; to me, the moun-taineer, they are like those gleaming feathery flakes of snow,flowering mostly where rocks jut from the ice of crevassed gla-ciers, that wind and sun have kissed to ghostliness.

The kingdomof faery has such jewels. To him who tastes them in his nostrils— to their acolyte and slave — they must seem as if the dew ofthe breath of some great demon of Immensity were frozen bythe cold of space upon his beard.For there was never any elixir so instant magic as cocaine.Give it to no matter whom. Choose me the last losel on theearth; let him suffer all the tortures of disease; take hope, takefaith, take love away from him. Then look, see the back of thatworn hand, its skin discolored and wrinkled, perhaps inflamedwith agonizing eczema, perhaps putrid with some malignantsore. He places on it that shimmering snow, a few grains only, alittle pile of starry dust. The wasted arm is slowly raised to thehead that is little more than a skull; the feeble breath draws inthat radiant powder. Now we must wait. One minute — per-haps five minutes.Then happens the miracle of miracles, as sure as death, andyet as masterful as life; a thing more miraculous, because sosudden, so apart from the usual course of evolution. Natura nonfacit saltum — nature never makes a leap. True — thereforethis miracle is a thing as it were against nature.The melancholy vanishes; the eyes shine; the wan mouthsmiles. Almost manly vigor returns, or seems to return. At leastfaith, hope and love throng very eagerly to the dance; all thatwas lost is found.The man is happy.To one the drug may bring liveliness, to another languor; toanother creative force, to another tireless energy, to anotherglamor, and to yet another lust. But each in his way is happy."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"292292THE INTERNATIONALThink of it! — so simple and so transcendental! The man ishappy!I have traveled in every quarter of the globe; I have seen suchwonders of Nature that my pen yet splutters when I try to tellthem; I have seen many a miracle of the genius of man; but Ihave never seen a marvel like to this.II.Is there not a school of philosophers, cold and cynical, thataccounts God to be a mocker? That thinks He takes His plea-sure in contempt of the littleness of His creatures? They shouldbase their theses on cocaine! For here is bitterness, irony, cru-elty ineffable. This gift of sudden and sure happiness is givenbut to tantalize. The story of Job holds no such acrid draught.What were more icy hate, fiend comedy than this, to offer sucha boon, and add “This you must not take?” Could not we be leftto brave the miseries of life, bad as they are, without this mas-ter pang, to know perfection of all joy within our reach, and theprice of that joy a tenfold quickening of our anguish?The happiness of cocaine is not passive or placid as that ofbeasts; it is self-conscious. It tells man what he is, and what hemight be; it offers him the semblance of divinity, only that hemay know himself a worm. It awakes discontent so acutely thatnever shall it sleep again. It creates hunger. Give cocaine to aman already wise, schooled to the world, morally forceful, aman of intelligence and self-control. If he be really master ofhimself, it will do him no harm. He will know it for a snare; hewill beware of repeating such experiments as he may make;and the glimpse of his goal may possibly even spur him to itsattainment by those means which God has appointed for Hissaints.But give it to the clod, to the self-indulgent, to the blasé — tothe average man, in a word — and he is lost. He says, and hislogic is perfect; This is what I want. He knows not, neither canknow, the true path; and the false path is the only one for him.There is cocaine at his need, and he takes it again and again.The contrast between his grub life and his butterfly life is toobitter for his unphilosophic soul to bear; he refuses to take thebrimstone with the treacle.And so he can no longer tolerate the moments of unhappi-ness; that is, of normal life; for he now so names it. The inter-vals between his indulgences diminish.And alas! the power of the drug diminishes with fearful pace.The doses wax; the pleasures wane. Side-issues, invisible atfirst, arise; they are like devils with flaming pitchforks in theirhands.A single trial of the drug brings no noticeable reaction in ahealthy man. He goes to bed in due season, sleeps well, andwakes fresh. South American Indians habitually chew this drugin its crude form, when upon the march, and accomplish prodi-gies, defying hunger, thirst, and fatigue. But they only use it inextremity; and long rest with ample food enables the body torebuild its capital. Also, savages, unlike most dwellers in cit-ies, have moral sense and force.The same is true of the Chinese and Indians in their use ofopium. Every one uses it, and only in the rarest cases does itbecome a vice. It is with them almost as tobacco is with us.But to one who abuses cocaine for his pleasure nature soonspeaks; and is not heard. The nerves weary of the constant stimu-lation; they need rest and food. There is a point at which thejaded horse no longer answers whip and spur. He stumbles,falls a quivering heap, gasps out his life.So perishes the slave of cocaine. With every nerve clamor-ing, all he can do is to renew the lash of the poison. The phar-maceutical effect is over; the toxic effect accumulates. The nervesbecome insane. The victim begins to have hallucinations. “See!There is a grey cat in that chair. I said nothing, but it has beenthere all the time.”Or, there are rats. “I love to watch them running up the cur-tains. Oh yes! I know they are not real rats. That’s a real rat,though, on the floor. I nearly killed it that time. That is theoriginal rat I saw; it’s a real rat. I saw it first on my window-sillone night.”Such, quietly enough spoken, is mania. And soon the plea-sure passes; is followed by its opposite, as Eros by Anteros.“Oh no! they never come near me.” A few days pass, andthey are crawling on the skin, gnawing interminably and intol-erably, loathsome and remorseless.It is needless to picture the end, prolonged as this may be, fordespite the baffling skill developed by the drug-lust, the insanecondition hampers the patient, and often forced abstinence for awhile goes far to appease the physical and mental symptoms.Then a new supply is procured, and with tenfold zest the ma-niac, taking the bit between his teeth, gallops to the black edgeof death.And before that death come all the torments of damnation.The time-sense is destroyed, so that an hour’s abstinence mayhold more horrors than a century of normal time-and-space-boundpain.Psychologists little understand how the physiological cycleof life, and the normality of the brain, make existence pettyboth for good and ill. To realize it, fast for a day or two; see howlife drags with a constant subconscious ache. With drug hunger,this effect is multiplied a thousandfold. Time itself is abolished;the real metaphysical eternal hell is actually present in the con-sciousness which has lost its limits without finding Him who iswithout limit.III.Much of this is well known; the dramatic sense has forcedme to emphasize what is commonly understood, because of theheight of the tragedy — or of the comedy, if one have that powerof detachment from mankind which we attribute only to thegreatest of men, to the Aristophanes, the Shakespeares, theBalzacs, the Rabelais, the Voltaires, the Byrons, that powerwhich makes poets at one time pitiful of the woes of men, atanother gleefully contemptuous of their discomfitures.But I should wiselier have emphasized the fact that the verybest men may use this drug, and many another, with benefit tothemselves and to humanity. Even as the Indians of whom Ispoke above, they will use it only to accomplish some workwhich they could not do without it. I instance Herbert Spencer,who took morphine daily, never exceeding an appointed dose.Wilkie Collins, too, overcame the agony of rheumatic gout withlaudanum, and gave us masterpieces not surpassed.Some went too far. Baudelaire crucified himself, mind andbody, in his love for humanity; Verlaine became at last the slavewhere he had been so long the master. Francis Thompson killedhimself with opium; so did Edgar Allan Poe. James Thomsondid the same with alcohol. The cases of de Quincey and H. G."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"293293THE INTERNATIONALLudlow are lesser, but similar, with laudanum and hashish, re-spectively. The great Paracelsus, who discovered hydrogen, zincand opium, deliberately employed the excitement of alcohol,counterbalanced by violent physical exercise, to bring out thepowers of his mind.Coleridge did his best while under opium, and we owe theloss of the end of Kubla Khan to the interruption of an importu-nate “man from Porlock,” ever accursed in the history of thehuman race!IV.Consider the debt of mankind to opium. It is acquitted by thedeaths of a few wastrels from its abuse?For the importance of this paper is the discussion of the prac-tical question: should drugs be accessible to the public?Here I pause in order to beg the indulgence of the Americanpeople. I am obliged to take a standpoint at once startling andunpopular. I am compelled to utter certain terrible truths. I amin the unenviable position of one who asks others to shut theireyes to the particular that they may thereby visualize the gen-eral.But I believe that in the matter of legislation America is pro-ceeding in the main upon a totally false theory. I believe thatconstructive morality is better than repression. I believe thatdemocracy, more than any other form of government, shouldtrust the people, as it specifically pretends to do.Now it seems to me better and bolder tactics to attack theopposite theory at its very strongest point.It should be shown that not even in the most arguable case isa government justified in restricting use on account of abuse; orallowing justification, let us dispute about expediency.So, to the bastion — should “habit forming” drugs be acces-sible to the public?The matter is of immediate interest; for the admitted failureof the Harrison Law has brought about a new proposal — one tomake bad worse.I will not here argue the grand thesis of liberty. Free menhave long since decided it. Who will maintain that Christ’s will-ing sacrifice of his life was immoral, because it robbed the Stateof a useful taxpayer?No; a man’s life is his own, and he has the right to destroy itas he will, unless he too egregiously intrude on the privileges ofhis neighbors.But this is just the point. In modern times the whole commu-nity is one’s neighbor, and one must not damage that. Very good;then there are pros and cons, and a balance to be struck.In America the prohibition idea in all things is carried, mostlyby hysterical newspapers, to a fanatical extreme. “Sensation atany cost by Sunday next” is the equivalent in most editorialrooms of the alleged German order to capture Calais. Hence thedangers of anything and everything are celebrateddithyrambically by the Corybants of the press, and the only rem-edy is prohibition. A shoots B with a revolver; remedy, theSullivan law. In practice, this works well enough; for the law isnot enforced against the householder who keeps a revolver forhis protection, but is a handy weapon against the gangster, andsaves the police the trouble of proving felonious intent.But it is the idea that was wrong. Recently a man shot hisfamily and himself with a rifle fitted with a Maxim silencer.Remedy, a bill to prohibit Maxim silencers! No perception that,if the man had not had a weapon at all, he would have strangledhis family with his hands.American reformers seem to have no idea, at any time or inany connection, that the only remedy for wrong is right; thatmoral education, self-control, good manners, will save the world;and that legislation is not merely a broken reed, but a suffocat-ing vapor. Further, an excess of legislation defeats its own ends.It makes the whole population criminals, and turns them allinto policemen and police spies. The moral health of such apeople is ruined for ever; only revolution can save it.Now in America the Harrison law makes it theoretically im-possible for the layman, difficult even for the physician, to ob-tain “narcotic drugs.” But every other Chinese laundry is a dis-tributing centre for cocaine, morphia, and heroin. Negroes andstreet peddlers also do a roaring trade. Some people figure thatone in every five persons in Manhattan is addicted to one orother of these drugs. I can hardly believe this estimate, thoughthe craving for amusement is maniacal among this people whohave so little care for art, literature, or music, who have, inshort, none of the resources that the folk of other nations, intheir own cultivated minds, possess.V.It was a very weary person, that hot Summer afternoon in1909, who tramped into Logroño. Even the river seemed toolazy to flow, and stood about in pools, with its tongue hangingout, so to speak. The air shimmered softly; in the town the ter-races of the cafés were thronged with people. They had nothingto do, and a grim determination to do it. They were sipping therough wine of the Pyrenees, or the Riojo of the South well wa-tered, or toying with bocks of pale beer. If any of them couldhave read Major-General O’Ryan’s address to the Americansoldier, they would have supposed his mind to be affected.“Alcohol, whether you call it beer, wine, whisky, or by anyother name, is a breeder of inefficiency. While it affects mendifferently, the results are the same, in that all affected by itcease for the time to be normal. Some become forgetful, oth-ers quarrelsome. Some become noisy, some get sick, someget sleepy, others have their passions greatly stimulated.”As for ourselves, we were on the march to Madrid. We wereobliged to hurry. A week, or a month, or a year at most, and wemust leave Logroño in obedience to the trumpet call of duty.However, we determined to forget it, for the time. We satdown, and exchanged views and experiences with the natives.From the fact that we were hurrying, they adjudged us to beanarchists, and were rather relieved at our explanation that wewere “mad Englishmen.” And we were all happy together; andI am still kicking myself for a fool that I never went on to Madrid.If one is at a dinner party in London or New York, one isplunged into an abyss of dullness. There is no subject of gen-eral interest; there is no wit; it is like waiting for a train. InLondon one overcomes one’s environment by drinking a bottleof champagne as quickly as possible; in New York one piles incocktails. The light wines and beers of Europe, taken in moder-ate measure, are no good; there is not time to be happy, so onemust be excited instead. Dining alone, or with friends, as op-posed to a party, one can be quite at ease with Burgundy orBordeaux. One has all night to be happy, and one does not haveto speed. But the regular New Yorker has not time even for adinner-party! He almost regrets the hour when his office closes."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"294294THE INTERNATIONALHis brain is still busy with his plans. When he wants “plea-sure,” he calculates that he can spare just half an hour for it. Hehas to pour the strongest liquors down his throat at the greatestpossible rate.Now imagine this man — or this woman — slightly ham-pered; the time available slightly curtailed. He can no longerwaste ten minutes in obtaining “pleasure”; or he dare not drinkopenly on account of other people. Well, his remedy is simple;he can get immediate action out of cocaine. There is no smell;he can be as secret as any elder of the church can wish.The mischief of civilization is the intensive life, which de-mands intensive stimulation. Human nature requires pleasure;wholesome pleasures require leisure; we must choose betweenintoxication and the siesta. There are no cocaine fiends inLogroño.Moreover, in the absence of a Climate, life demands a Con-versation; we must choose between intoxication and cultivationof the mind. There are no drug-fiends among people who areprimarily pre-occupied with science and philosophy, art and lit-erature.VI.However, let us concede the prohibitionist claims. Let us admitthe police contention that cocaine and the rest are used by crimi-nals who would otherwise lack the nerve to operate; they alsocontend that the effects of the drugs are so deadly that the clev-erest thieves quickly become inefficient. Then for Heaven’s sakeestablish depots where they can get free cocaine!You cannot cure a drug fiend; you cannot make him a usefulcitizen. He never was a good citizen, or he would not have falleninto slavery. If you reform him temporarily, at vast expense,risk, and trouble, your whole work vanishes like morning mistwhen he meets his next temptation. The proper remedy is to lethim gang his ain gait to the de’il. Instead of less drug, give himmore drug, and be done with him. His fate will be a warning tohis neighbors, and in a year or two people will have the sense toshun the danger. Those who have not, let them die, too, andsave the state. Moral weaklings are a danger to society, in what-ever line their failings lie. If they are so amiable as to kill them-selves, it is a crime to interfere.You say that while these people are killing themselves theywill do mischief. Maybe; but they are doing it now.Prohibition has created an underground traffic, as it alwaysdoes; and the evils of this are immeasurable. Thousands of citi-zens are in league to defeat the law; are actually bribed by thelaw itself to do so, since the profits of the illicit trade becomeenormous, and the closer the prohibition, the more unreason-ably big they are. You can stamp out the use of silk handker-chiefs in this way: people say, “All right; we’ll use linen.” Butthe “cocaine fiend” wants cocaine; and you can’t put him offwith Epsom salts. Moreover, his mind has lost all proportion;he will pay anything for his drug; he will never say, “I can’tafford it”; and if the price be high, he will steal, rob, murder toget it. Again I say: you cannot reform a drug fiend; all you do bypreventing them from obtaining it is to create a class of subtleand dangerous criminals; and even when you have jailed themall, is any one any the better?While such large profits (from one thousand to two thousandper cent.) are to be made by secret dealers, it is to the interest ofthose dealers to make new victims. And the profits at presentare such that it would be worth my while to go to London andback first class to smuggle no more cocaine than I could hide inthe lining of my overcoat! All expenses paid, and a handsomesum in the bank at the end of the trip! And for all the law, andthe spies, and the rest of it, I could sell my stuff with very littlerisk in a single night in the Tenderloin.Another point is this. Prohibition cannot be carried to its ex-treme. It is impossible, ultimately, to withhold drugs from doc-tors. Now doctors, more than any other single class, are drugfiends; and also, there are many who will traffic in drugs for thesake of money or power. If you possess a supply of the drug, youare the master, body and soul, of any person who needs it.People do not understand that a drug, to its slave, is morevaluable than gold or diamonds; a virtuous woman may be aboverubies, but medical experience tells us that there is no virtuouswoman in need of the drug who would not prostitute herself toa rag-picker for a single sniff.And if it be really the case that one-fifth of the populationtakes some drug, then this long little, wrong little island is infor some very lively times.The absurdity of the prohibitionist contention is shown bythe experience of London and other European cities. In Londonany householder or apparently responsible person can buy anydrug as easily as if it were cheese; and London is not full ofraving maniacs, snuffing cocaine at every street corner, in theintervals of burglary, rape, arson, murder, malfeasance in of-fice, and misprision of treason, as we are assured must be thecase if a free people are kindly allowed to exercise a little free-dom.Or, if the prohibitionist contention be not absurd, it is a com-ment upon the moral level of the people of the United Stateswhich would have been righteously resented by the Gadareneswine after the devils had entered into them.I am not here concerned to protest on their behalf; allowingthe justice of the remark, I still say that prohibition is no cure.The cure is to give the people something to think about; to de-velop their minds; to fill them with ambitions beyond dollars;to set up a standard of achievement which is to be measured interms of eternal realities; in a word, to educate them.If this appear impossible, well and good; it is only anotherargument for encouraging them to take cocaine.————IN THE RED ROOM OF ROSE CROIX.The bleeding gate of God unveils its rose;The cavernous West swallows the dragon Sun;Earth’s darkness broods on dissolution,A mother-vulture, nested on Repose.Ah then! what grace within our girdle glows,What crimson web of will-work, wizard-spunTo garb thy glee-gilt heart, Hilarion,An Alpenbluehn on our star-crested snows!O scarlet flower, smear honey on the thighOf this thy bee, that sucks thy sweetness dry!O bower of sunset, bring me to thy sleepWherein move dreams stained purple with perfumes,Whose birds of paradise, on Punic plumes,Declare dooms undecipherably deep!"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"295295THE INTERNATIONALTHE SCRUTINIES OF SIMON IFFBY EDWARD KELLY.No. 2 — The Artistic TemperamentI.Jack Flynn was the centre of a happy group of artists. Theywere seated upon the terrace of the Café d’Alençon to drinkthe apéritif; for although November was upon Paris, the Sunstill remembered his beloved city, and fed it with light andwarmth.Flynn had come over from London for a week to see theAutumn Salon, and to gossip with his old friends. The conver-sation was naturally of Art, and, like the universe itself, hadneither beginning nor end, being self-created by its own en-ergy, so rolled easily through the Aeons in every combinationof beauty.But half of beauty is melancholy, a subtle subcurrent of sad-ness; and on this particular occasion it was visible, giving agrey tone to the most buoyant rhapsodies. The talkers were infact subdued and restrained; each spoke gaily, yet stood uponhis guard, as if there were some subject near his conscious-ness which he must be careful not to broach.It was a curiously distinguished group. Two of the men worethe Légion d’Honneur; the elder of the two, who looked morelike a soldier or a diplomat than a painter, seemed to be theobject of constant solicitude on the part of the younger, whoseruddy, cheerful, ironic face was like a picture by Franz Hals— but a Franz Hals in the mood of Rabelais. He seemed par-ticularly anxious lest the other should say something unfortu-nate, but he should really have been looking round the corner,for there was where the danger lay.Round that corner, all arms and legs, came swinging theagile body of no less a person than the mystic, Simon Iff.His first greeting was the bombshell! “Ah ha!” he cried,grasping the hand of the elder of the two décorês, “and how’sthe dear old Sea?” For the person addressed happened to befamous all over the world as a marine painter. The youngerman sprang to his feet. “Just don’t mention the sea, please, fora few months!” he said in Simon’s ear. It was unnecessary.Even in the general joy at the return of an old friend, Iff’squick apprehension could not fail to detect a suppressed spasmof pain on every face.The mystic turned and greeted the man who had interruptedhim with honest gladness; then his other hand shot out to Flynn.“I’ve been out of the world all summer,” he cried, shakinghands all round, “in a hermitage after my own heart. Fancy acastle dating from the crusades, on the very edge of a glacier,and every practicable route barred against the world, the flesh,and the devil, in the shape of tourists, tables d’hôte, and news-papers!” “You look thirty!” declared one of the men. “And Ifeel twenty,” laughed the magician; “what do you say to a littledinner at Lapérouse? I want to walk across the Luxembourg toa feast, as I’ve done any time these fifty years!”As it happened, only two of the party were free; Major, theyoung man with the button, and Jack Flynn.After some quiet chat the three strolled off together, arm inarm, down the Boulevard Montparnasse.When they reached the Avenue de l’Observatoire, theyturned down that noble grove. Here, at all hours of day andnight, is a stately solitude. Intended for gaiety, devised as asymbol of gaiety by the most frivolous age of all time, it hasbecome by virtue of age the very incarnation of melancholygrandeur. It seems almost to lament that eighteenth centurywhich fathered it.Before they had passed into this majesty more than an hun-dred yards, the mystic said abruptly: “What’s the trouble?”“Haven’t you really seen a paper for six months?” coun-tered Flynn.“Of course I haven’t. You know my life; you know that Iretire, whenever I am able, from this nightmare illusion ofmatter to a world of reality. So tell me your latest evil dream!”“Evil enough!” said Major, “it doesn’t actually touch us,but it’s a narrow escape. We only heard the climax three daysago; so it’s a green wound, you see.”“Yet it doesn’t touch you.”“No; but it touches Art, and that’s me, all right!”“Will you tell me the story?”“I’ll leave that to Flynn. He’s been on the trail all the time.”“I was even at the trial,” said Flynn.“Come, come,” laughed Iff, “all these riddles.”“I’ll make them clear enough — all but the one. Now, nointerruptions! I have the thing orderly in my mind.”“Five: four: three: two: one: gun!”“The place is a small rocky islet off the west coast of Scot-land, by name Dubhbheagg. A few fisher-folk live there; no-body else. There is one landing-place, and one only, even incalm weather; in a storm it is inaccessible altogether. Over-looking this quay is a house perched on the cliff; an old stonemansion. The proprietor is one of our sacred guild, and spendsmost of his time in Central Asia or Central Africa or CentralAmerica or Central Australia — anything to be central! —and he lets the house to any one who is fool enough to pay theprice.“This summer it was rented by the president of the RoyalAcademy.”“What’s that?” said Iff, sharply.“The Royal Academy,” explained Flynn, “is an institutiondevised by divine Providence for the detection of British Art-ists. It brings them into notice by ostentatiously rejecting theirworks. The president is Lord Cudlipp.”“Wasn’t he a Joseph Thorne, or some such name?” askedSimon Iff.“Thornton, I think. Ennobled thirteen years ago,” correctedFlynn.“It was Thornley,” insisted the sculptor, Major.“Yes, Thornley; I remember now. I know him slightly; and Iknew his father before him; an M. P. and a biscuit manufac-turer,” exclaimed the mystic.“A pity the son didn’t follow the father,” murmured Major.“I feel sure that his biscuits would have been delightful!”“You’re interrupting the court,” protested the editor. “Toproceed. Here we have Cudlipp in the Big House ofDubhbheagg, with a man and wife to cook for him, both oldservants, with him thirty years. There are also his son Harry"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"296296THE INTERNATIONALhis daughter Eleanor, her companion-maid, and — a man fromthe Quarter!”“This Quarter?”“Up in Montrouge his studio is, I think, one of those lostcottages with a garden in the middle of a block of houses.Well, this man, or rather boy, he’s not 20 yet, is, or wants tobe, a marine painter like Cudlipp ——”“God forbid!” groaned Major.“Shut up! the boy’s name is André de Bry; he’s half French,half English, I believe, a pretty hot combination.”“So I’ve noticed,” remarked Iff, as they turned intoLapérouse, crept up the narrow stair, and found a table by thewindow in the Salle des Miroirs.“Harry and Eleanor were born seventeen years ago,twins ——”“Which is dead?” interrupted Iff. The others stared.“Excuse an old man’s vanity!” laughed the mystic. “I reallyhave to show off sometimes! You see, I know Jack’s passionfor precision of language. He wouldn’t say the simple thing,‘They are twins,’ or ‘They are seventeen years old,’ and hewouldn’t say ‘They were twins,’ or ‘were seventeen years old,’so I knew that one, and one only, was dead.”“I hope your acuteness will continue through dinner,”laughed the editor. “We need it. Now, then, to business. Cudlipphad sort of adopted André de Bry, used him to prepare hisbigger canvases, and so on. De Bry had fallen in love withEleanor. She returned his passion. De Bry was hopelessly poor— no, not hopelessly, for he had a rich uncle, who had a fad ofindependence. He wouldn’t give André a farthing; but if theboy succeeded in making himself a career, he promised to leavehim every penny he had. The family is noble, much betterthan Cudlipp’s; so the boy was not a bad match for Eleanor,and, contingently, a very good one. He and Harry were per-fectly good friends. There was, in short, no element of dis-agreement worth notice. The days passed pleasantly, either inpainting or fishing, and the evenings in games. One can hardlyimagine a more harmonious group.“On the 18th of August the yacht, which supplied the islandwith stores from the mainland, called and left provisions forthe party. To avert false conjecture from the start, I may saythat it is absolutely impossible that some mysterious stow-away could have landed from the yacht and hidden somewhereon the island. The police subsequently went through the placewith a fine tooth comb. It is thirty miles from the nearest land,is barely a quarter of a mile in its greatest length, has neithera cave nor a tree on it. So don’t talk about that! Well, the yachtweighed anchor on the afternoon of the 18th; that night a stormcame up from the Atlantic, and raged for a whole week. It isphysically impossible that any one should have landed on therock during that period. Furthermore, the Big House stands ona quite unclimbable pinnacle — I’m a rock climber, as youknow, and I went to see it, and there’s not a crack anywhere. Itwas only connected with the rest of the island by a woodenbridge of the cantilever type; and the violence of the wind wassuch that on the second night of the storm it carried it away.This was inconvenient for them, as will be seen; but it simpli-fies the matter a good deal for us. Well, on the 25th the stormabated, and the fishermen were about to put to sea when theyobserved Lord Cudlipp on the edge of the cliff, firing his shot-gun. Seeing he was noticed, he signalled and shouted to themto come up. He met them, so far as he could, at the chasmwhere the bridge had been. ‘There has been murder done here,’he said shortly, ‘take this message and telegraph it at once.’He flung a stone to them, with a paper wrapped about it. Thetelegram asked for the police; also for a gang of men withmaterials to build up the bridge. The following noon reliefarrived.“The rest of the story needs little detail. It is as astonish-ingly simple as it is perplexing. The naked body of the boyHarry was found on the morning of the 23d in the big roomused by the other men as a studio — Harry and Eleanor tooknot the slightest interest in art. Death had been caused by asmall deep wound in the femoral artery; a penknife might havemade it. But there was no blood; and at the post-mortem wasrevealed the utterly astonishing fact that there was no blood inthe whole body — when I say no blood, I mean, not enough fora rabbit! It had been systematically drained. I need hardly tellyou that the whole island went wild with stories of vampiresand witches; I won’t bother you with that sort of rubbish.“But the horror of the circumstances cannot be easilymatched. Imagine to yourselves that lonely crag, itself a monu-ment of desolation, towering from sea to sky, bleak, bare, bar-ren and heartless as sea and sky themselves. Such a place hasalways bred strange stories — and strange crimes.“But think of the feelings of the people in the house, one ofthem certainly a murderer!“However, the police were easily able to narrow down thepossibilities. The boy had been chloroformed or otherwise ren-dered unconscious, without doubt, for there could have beenno struggle. The wound was clean, and obviously inflicted bysome one with first rate anatomical knowledge. It was, too, ahighly civilized crime, so to speak.“This really restricted the field of inquiry to the two paint-ers. Common sense excluded the father, whose main hope ofan illustrious line was thus cut off. On the other hand, de Brywas a doubtful character. In Paris he had been accustomed tofrequent the lowest haunts — the sort of place one finds inthese little streets about here — and as a matter of fact, hewas usually called the ‘Apache’ as a sort of nickname. But noone had ever heard of anything very definite, except an al-leged duel with knives in a shop off the Boulevard St. Germaincalled Tout à la Joie, a low drinking cellar. This came out incourt later, and sounded nasty, though it was proven that hehad been attacked without provocation, and the police had noteven arrested him. Still, a man so ready with a knife — itimpressed the jury badly, I could see that.“To cut a long story short, they arrested André. He refusedto enter the witness box; he had no story to tell; nor, indeed,had any of the others. Harry had gone to bed alive; he wasfound dead in the morning. No quarrel anywhere. No motivefor anybody.“The jury was out for twenty-four hours; they came backwith that joy which only Scotland offers to its jurymen — theVerdict of the Sitter on the Fence: “Not proven.” They allthought he did it, but they couldn’t make up their minds tohang him; so there was the way out. Therefore, André de Bryis at large again; and, by the same token, I came over on theboat with him. He was muffled to the eyes, but I knew him. Sohe’s probably within a mile of us at this minute.”“What do you think of the story?” asked Major, a little anx-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"297297THE INTERNATIONALiously.“Oh, I agree with the natives,” replied the mystic, laugh-ingly, to the astonishment of his hearers. “Excuse my refer-ring to the fact that I’m a professional Magus — still, youshould not be surprised if I tell you that I hold to the theory ofvampires and werewolves and sirens and the rest of the dearcreatures!”“Be serious, master!” urged Flynn, using a title which heknew would put the mystic on his honor.“My dear lad, I believe this murder was done by some onewhom none of them knew to have been there.”“But how could he have got away?”“Vanished whence he came.”“A haunted house? Damn it, something in your tone makesmy blood run cold.”“Well,” slowly answered the mystic, “possibly, in a sense, ahaunted house.”Major called the waiter to bring another bottle of Burgun-dy.“Have you really formed a theory about the case?” askedFlynn. “To me it’s absolutely beyond reason.”“Beneath it, beneath it! Ah well, no matter! As a fact, Ihave not made up my mind. How can I, till I’ve seen this chap’spictures?”“You think there was some motive of jealousy?” snappedout Major.“I don’t think at all till I’ve seen them. Look here! do youknow his work?”“No; he hasn’t shown anything. He’s an absolute kid, youknow. But Tite saw a thing of his in some studio or other, andTite said it was damned bad. So I dare say it’s pretty decentstuff.”“Where’s his studio?”“Don’t know,” answered the sculptor. “I’ll find out to-night,if you’re really set on this. May I call for you in the morning?We’ll go up together; perhaps you’ll let me make it déjeuner— you’ll come, of course, Jack — as I’ve been shouting forBurgundy at your dinner, you shall shout for Claret ay mylunch!”“I’m at Bourcier’s, 50 rue Vavin, as always,” said SimonIff. “The best house, and the best people, in all Paris. Comeround at nine.”“Right. Meet me there, Flynn. It’s a great hunt, the truth!”“With a hunter like Simple Simon, you’ll find it so,” saidFlynn, enthusiastically.II.The next morning saw the three friends tramping it up theBoulevard Raspail, past the great calm glory of the uncon-quered Lion de Belfort, along the busy Boulevard deMontrouge, and so to the very hem of Paris, the “fortifs” dearto the Apache. Here they turned west, and came presently toan old wine shop, through which lay the entrance to the studioof de Bry.He was already at work in his little garden; an old man,leaning on a spade, was posing for him.Major advanced and offered his card. “Monsieur de Bry! Ifeel sure you will pardon me. I am a Sociétaire of the BeauxArts; I have heard that your work is excellent, and I am herewith two friends of the most distinguished to ask the honor oflooking at it.”“Mr. Major!” cried the boy, as he put his brushes down inhis eagerness — at first he had not recognized the great man— “indeed, the honor is altogether mine. But I’ve nothingworth seeing, I assure you.”Major introduced his friends. De Bry, telling the model torest, led the party into the studio. With infinite diffidence theboy began to show his work.In a few minutes Major, with his hands thrust deep into histrousers’ pockets, and his head thrown back, was reduced toutter silence. Simon Iff, who was watching him as well as thepictures, smiled his grimmest smile. The editor, inured to smalltalk by his profession, made the conversation. “It’s all begin-nings,” said the boy, “but this is more what I’ve tried for. I didit in the summer.” The mystic noticed with a darkening facethat he seemed to speak of that summer as if it had held noth-ing but a holiday.The canvas showed the rock of Dubhbheagg amidst thebreakers. It had been painted from a boat on a clear day. Thesky was blue; a flight of wildfowl gave life to the picture. Butthe rock itself was more vital than the birds. It seemed theimage of some great lost God of solitude, eternally contem-plative, eternally alone. It was more melancholy than Dürer’smaster-work, or Thomson’s interpretation of it. And de Bryhad not used the materials of melancholy, or images of death;he had merely painted a rock just as it was when he saw it. Yethe had made it a creature of cosmic life, as significant andvital as the universe itself — and as lonely and inexorable.Simon Iff spoke for the first time. “Is that picture for sale?”he asked. “Yes,” said the painter, rather eagerly. They noticedthat he looked ill.“Probably hasn’t had a meal since that damned affair,”thought Major. “How much?” very stiffly from Simple Simon.The painter hesitated. “Would you give me fifty francs forit?” he asked timidly.The mystic rose to his feet, and shook his stick in the boy’sface. “No, you damned young scoundrel, I will not!” he roared.“How dare you ask such a price?”The boy shrank back; he expected that the old man wouldstrike him.“Do you know who I am?” thundered Simon. “I’m the chair-man of the Art Committee of the Hemlock Club! That’s thetrouble with you artists; you’re blacklegs, every one of you.Offering a thing like that for fifty francs and pulling down theprice of everything but the old Masters! Answer me straightnow; how much is it worth?”The boy was too taken aback to reply.“Have you ever seen a worse thing offered for ten thousandfrancs?” asked Simon, cynically.“Oh yes!” he stammered at last.“I’ll give you fifteen thousand. Here’s a thousand on ac-count; I’ll send a cheque for the balance this afternoon. Sendthe picture to Simon Iff, 50, rue Vavin. And, if you’ve nothingto do, come and see me as soon as the light fails this after-noon. Yes, bring the picture round in a fiacre. About 5, then!”He thrust a big thousand franc note in the boy’s hand, andwithdrew stormily from the studio.The others followed him; but Major stopped a moment. “Didyou like my bust of Rodin?” asked the sculptor. The boy wasstill too bewildered to do more than nod. “I’ll send you a bronze,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"298298THE INTERNATIONALif you’d care to have it. And come and see me, any time youcare to, and particularly any time you need a friend.” De Brygrasped the offered hand in silence.The others had reached the street when Major caught them.“I hope you don’t mean mischief by that boy,” he said to Iff. “Iseem to smell a trap. For heaven’s sake leave him alone! He’sthe biggest thing since Turner; if he keeps on growing, theplanet won’t hold him.”“My mind is quite made up,” returned Simon Iff, coldly. “Ifthe lunch is still on, suppose we take a taxi. If you don’t mind,we’ll have a private room at the Café de la Paix. We shallneed to go rather deeply into this matter.”III.Simon Iff would not talk at all of anything but old times inParis until after lunch, when the decks were cleared of all butthe three Cs — coffee, cigars, and cognac. Then he cleared histhroat.“As you have heard me say about a million times, Jack, ‘Dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.’ Failure to ob-serve this precept is the root of all human error. It is our rightand duty — the two are one, as Eliphaz Levi very nearly saw— to expand upon our own true centre, to pursue the exactorbit of our destiny. To quit that orbit is to invite collisions.Suppose it to be my illusion to think it my will to pass throughthat closed window. I bump my head; I cut my face; I finallymake a mess on the boulevard. Or, I think it my will to stealmy neighbor’s watch. I am caught; police-court, prison, andgeneral disaster. Merely the result of my ignorance in regardto my true destiny. Failure in life and especially criminal fail-ure; collision. Then where is the original collision? In myself.There is a conflict between my conscious will and my uncon-scious will, between the sophisticated babble of reason andthe still small voice of the soul. Poe had quite an idea of this,with his ‘Imp of the Perverse’; Ibsen, the greatest of all real-ists, a more detailed conception, with his ‘troll’; but both imag-ined that consciousness was right and the Inner Light wrong.Now that is a mere assumption, and we mystics, who knowthat Light, know better. It is the first task of every man whowould not only be himself, but understand himself, to makethe union or harmony between these two, perfect. Now of coursemost men, so far as the main path of their lives is concerned,never find these two forces in conflict, never become aware ofthem at all. The troubles of genius are principally due to arecognition of this truer Light, and of its apparent incompat-ibility with the conscious will, or perhaps of a realization thatthey cannot execute their will, because of the pressure of cir-cumstance upon them. Hence the well-earned celebrity of theArtistic Temperament. Frequently we observe that the artist,unable to fulfil himself in his art, turns to vice of one kind oranother. It is as if a sculptor, in a gesture of impatience withhis Venus, dabbed a handful of clay on her nose, and made herlook like an elephant!”“If you knew how often I’ve done just that thing!” laughedMajor.“Well” continued the mystic, “to come to the murder of thisboy Harry ——”“I see where you’re driving,” broke in Jack Flynn. “And asI’m sure you noticed the perfect nonchalance of de Bry whenhe showed us that picture, you are going to prove that he did itunconsciously, or at least that it’s all so natural to him that hehas no sense of it.”“You would find out what I am going to prove if you wouldlet me do it,” said Simon, in some ill-humor. Major had feltashamed of himself for smiling; he was genuinely concernedabout his great new artist.“To come to the murder of this boy Harry,” repeated themagician, “we notice two things. First, the general surround-ings. Storm, isolation, the wild weird atmosphere of the Scot-tish Highlands — enough to send any man, with an originaltouch of madness, over the line. Second, the nature of themurder itself; it is in perfect keeping with the setting. Its de-tails are elaborate. It is not an ordinary murder, but the mur-der of — a — I can’t find the right word.”Major broke in grimly: “The murder of a great mind gonewrong? Of such a mind as conceived, and such a hand as ex-ecuted, those masterpieces? Oh my God!”“Your interruptions will not alter the facts of the case, ormy deductions; pray let me proceed! Besides, there is still onestep to take before we arrive at any such conclusion. I wantyou to remember a peculiar fact about the French Revolution.Here we find a whole set of people, educated, intelligent, com-plex, and above all humanitarian, who suddenly indulge inwholesale massacre. This, like the crime we are discussing,was a perverse crime. It was not at all in accordance with thegeneral will of the Revolutionists, which was simply SocialJustice.“But they had been thwarted for generations; thwarting wasin their blood, as it were; and when they came to action, theybecame perverse. Thus — I beg you to believe — it is notmerely the artistic temperament which produces these hor-rible crimes; it is simply any temperament which is suppressedlong enough. It is more usual to find this manifested in artists,because they are advanced people who understand pretty wellwhat their will is, who suffer more keenly, in consequence,from the thwarting of that will, especially as they usually per-ceive only too keenly the fact that it is the errors and stupidi-ties of other people, people who have strayed far from theirown orbits, that cause the thwarting in question. I will ask youto consider the case of a man who makes friends of spiders.Oh, you say, that is after he has been in the Bastille for twentyyears. Precisely. He may have been a very bad man; he mayhimself have thwarted his own fundamental impulses of love;but the complete suppression of that instinct for so many yearsresults in its peeping out at last, and taking an unnatural form.There are plenty of similar instances which will occur to you.In the case of the French Revolution, we must also considerthe question of atavism. Humanitarian as the leaders were,their forefathers had been inured to fire and sword since thedawn of the race. It was the primitive tribal passion that brokeout in them, after centuries of suppression. So you get thesame phenomenon in both the man and the race.” Simonpaused.“That boy,” said Major, “ has one of the greatest souls everincarnated on this planet, and I won’t believe he did it.”“Your courage is splendid,” replied Simple Simon, “but yourbeliefs do not invalidate the conclusions of science. E pur simuove.”“Is that all?” asked Flynn.“For shame, Jack,” cried the mystic; “I have hardly begun."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"299299THE INTERNATIONALBut I perceive that the light is failing; we had better end thisconversation in the presence of André de Bry.” Major paid thebill; and they went across Paris to the old magician’s littlestudio in the Rue Vavin.It was a small room, and very simply furnished; but the paint-ings and sculptures would have made the fame of any mu-seum. Each was the gift of a master to Simon Iff.“We shall wait for the young man,” said the mystic, as theyseated themselves; you will see that I have no difficulty inforcing him to confess.”“I’ll never believe it,” insisted Major.“Don’t believe it till you hear it!” was the abrupt retort.IV.A quarter of an hour elapsed; then the slim figure of the boyappeared. In his arms was the picture.Simon took it and placed it upon the mantel. Major wasright; there was nothing in the room to equal it. The magicianwent to his desk, and wrote out a check for fourteen thousandfrancs, which he handed to the young painter. “If you wouldsign this receipt?” De Bry complied.“Do not go!” said Simon. “I have much to say to you. Youreally like the picture? You think it worthy of you?”“I wouldn’t have sold it if I didn’t”“Yet you were in sore straits? You were denying yourselffood to pay your model?”“I shouldn’t have sold it to you if I didn’t think it mine.”“That too is worthy. But now, sit down. There are others toconsider in this matter. I am going to ask my friends to remainabsolutely silent while we talk.”“I know what you are going to say,” said the boy. “I think itunnecessary and cruel.”“Wait till I have done. It is not only necessary and kind, butit is very urgent.”“I can’t refuse the first man who has appreciated my work.”“Listen while I tell you a story. Many years ago I knew aman named Thornley, a wealthy manufacturer of biscuits. Hehad one son, Joseph. He asked me one day to recommend atutor for the lad. I told him of a clergyman named Drew, a manof deep scholarship, great culture, and intense love of art. Heworked on the ambition of Joseph Thornley, and the boy, aftera year’s tuition from Drew, decided to be a painter. The tutordied suddenly; but the boy’s ambition remained. He persuadedhis father to let him go to various art schools, where he stud-ied incessantly, with the most praiseworthy diligence.”“Damn it!” roared Major, “he had no more capacity for artthan this chair I am sitting on!”“I asked you not to interrupt,” returned Simon mildly. “Inever said he had! To continue. Backed with ample wealthand influence, and fortified with determination to succeed,Thornley’s career was one long series of triumphs. Althoughprimarily a marine painter, he also did other work, notablyportraits. His picture of the king in the uniform of a BritishAdmiral caught the public taste more than any other of hisefforts. It was in that year that he was not only elected to thepresidency of the Royal Academy of Arts, but raised to thepeerage with the title of Baron Cudlipp. His only sorrow wasthe death of his wife two years after the birth of his children.”The magician turned to André. “Good! Now — how did youspend the week of the great storm?”“Billiards, mostly,” stammered André, taken by surprise.“Chess, too, and some card games. I sketched, of course, nearlyall day. Eleanor had some needlework. Poor Harry was verybored; he did nothing much”“And Cudlipp buried himself a good deal in anthropology?”“Yes; he had Frazer’s ‘Golden Bough’ all the time ——”The boy broke off, and stared. “How did you know that?” hesaid, aghast.“A little bird told me,” said Simon lightly.All of a sudden Major sprang to his feet. “Then Cudlippkilled his son,” he shouted, “Oh! Simple Simon, what a foolI’ve been!” And he suddenly broke down in spasm on spasmof sobs.“I promised these gentlemen,” said Simon, taking no noticeof the outburst, “that I would force a confession from you thisafternoon. I think this is the moment. Come, we are all atten-tion.”“I certainly cannot hear this senseless slander against myprotector without ——”“Hush!” said Simon. “I told you this matter was urgent. Imeant what I said. You must catch the nine o’clock train forLondon.”“Why?” said the boy, defiantly; “who are you to say this?”“I am a person who is going to put a letter in the post in anhour’s time; and you had better arrive before the letter.”“I don’t understand.”“I was explaining to these gentlemen at lunch that all crimewas the result of conflict; that perverse crime, in particular,was caused by conflict of the conscious and unconscious wills.”“Don’t you see?” said Major, mastering himself, “it couldn’tbe you. You were supremely happy; you had the girl you loved;you had found yourself as an artist. But Cudlipp had thwartedhis own inner will all his life; he was meant to bake biscuits;and he had forced himself to do those eye-destroying horrors.But — go on, master! — I still don’t see the whole story.”“I haven’t told you all the facts yet. Cudlipp’s family wasoriginally Armenian, for one thing, the offshoot of some oldBabylonian tribe. Then there was the ‘Golden Bough’ with itsdetailed description of various savage rites, especially the sac-rifice of the first-born, an idea, by the way, which the Jewsonly adopted at third or fourth hand from older and autochtho-nous races. Then the newspapers were filled with long argu-ments about the Chesidim and ritual murder, the trial of thatman somewhere in Russia — can’t think of his name — be-gins with a B — was on at this time. Well, when the sup-pressed genius of the man for baking biscuits — which maybe a passion like another — when that broke out, probablyunder the strain of the long storm, and the wildness of thewhole scene, and possibly some sudden realization that thisboy here could paint, and he himself never could, why, thenhis brain snapped. The recent impressions combined with somefar strain of atavism, and he resolved upon the murder.”“I still can’t see why murder,” said Flynn. “Why should notthis biscuit-baking genius go into the kitchen and bake bis-cuits?”“I want you to recognize the fact, you dear good simple soul,that madmen are a thousand times more logical than the sane.The conclusions of normal men are always balanced by otherconsiderations; we criticize our ideas of proper tailoring, forexample, in the spotlight of our check books. The madman"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"300300THE INTERNATIONALdoesn’t. He wants clothes; he thinks of nothing else; so hegoes down to Savile Row and orders a dozen sable overcoatsand thirty dress suits. It’s much more logical, if logic were all!“So Cudlipp reasoned something like this, as I imagine; ‘I’vewasted forty years trying to paint when I ought to have beenbaking biscuits; now I must make up for lost time.’ How to dothat? The madman’s reason finds it easy. The connection be-tween gold and copper coins is an arbitrary one, isn’t it? Yes.Well, if I haven’t got a barrow-load of coppers, I can give youa fist full of sovereigns, and it’s just as good. The whole ideaof primitive magic (which he had been reading, remember!)rests on arbitrary substitution. The king must die every year,or the sun won’t come back — there’s an arbitrary connection,to begin with, though it’s based on false reasoning, or ratheron correct reasoning from false observation. Now the kingdoesn’t want to die; so he takes a criminal, labels him king,and kills him. Every one is happy. So this man seeks to satisfyhis genius, suppressed for forty years, in a night. Surely itmust be through some monstrous act of violence and horror!That is madman’s logic. Then, as I said before, some ancestralmemory in the subconscious self influenced his recent impres-sion, and that gave the form to the idea. It is also conceivablethat he had a real purpose, thought that the sacrifice of thefirst-born might enable him to become a painter. Gilles deRetz murdered over 800 children in his endeavor to make gold.But of this theory I have no evidence. However, the rest stands.”André de Bry listened with white lips to this speech.“Now will you confess?” asked the magician, with mild per-sistence.“I don’t see why I should.”“Because you are still looking at the past. Can’t you foreseethe future?”“Ought I to kill myself?”“Be serious, sir!” reprimanded Simon. “I see that I musttell you more. So far, I have told you how I know that Cudlippkilled his son, and how he came to do it. You may or may notknow why he did it, but you must know that he did it, if onlyby a process of exclusion. Then — what will he do next?”The boy began to smile. “Oh, Eleanor is with an aunt,” hesaid; “she’s safe enough.”“Now we begin to confess, indirectly,” continued Simon.“But what will he do? Is he conscious of his act? You see, Imust know all. I was already sure that you would never haveleft Eleanor in danger. But there are other problems.”“I’m beaten,” said André. “I’ll tell you all I know.”“Good.”V.“It was I who discovered the body of poor Harry; for I hadrisen with the first light, intending to paint. I needn’t go intothe events of that day, much; it was all suspicion, perfectlyhellish. I haven’t your reasoning powers, Mr. Iff, and I didn’tthink he had done it, particularly. He pretended to suspect me,of course. We can see now, thanks to you, that his whole lifehas been one long hypocrisy, that he has been pretending to bean artist, just like any other fraud. His deadly earnestness aboutit only made it worse; I see that now. But I didn’t see it then;to me he was just a bad painter, and I looked no deeper. Well,by dinner time our nerves were all on edge; Eleanor’s, natu-rally, more than any. After dinner I said I would go to bed,meaning to snatch an hour’s sleep, and then to watch Eleanor’sdoor all night. I had told her to have her companion in herroom — the poor old lady was glad enough to have company,you can imagine.“Eleanor’s manner to me had been strange beyond words;but I only thought that it meant that she suspected me. How-ever, when I said I was going to bed, she jumped up: ‘Do playme a hundred up first!’ she cried; ‘I’ll go mad if you don’t.’We went into the billiard room together. She closed the door,and put her back to it. ‘André,’ she cried, ‘I’ve been insaneabout this all day; but I’m in a fearful position. Only — I can’tlet you go to bed. I must tell you. Papa did it.’ I caught her inmy arms, for she was falling. In a moment she recovered. ‘Lastnight,’ she went on, ‘I woke with frightful dreams — and Ifound my nose was bleeding. I lit my candle, and got up to getwater. Then I knew suddenly that something was wrong withHarry. I always have known; it’s the twin sympathy.’”“Damnation!” interrupted Simple Simon in a fury, “I’m get-ting old. I ought to have known that she knew.”“You’ve done well enough, sir,” said André; “it’s been likea miracle to me to hear you. Eleanor went on: ‘The momentmy nose stopped bleeding I took my black kimono, and wentdown to Harry’s room. The door was open. I slipped in. It wasdark. At that instant I saw the studio door open.’ (They wereright opposite, Mr. Iff.) ‘I knew there would be all kinds oftrouble if I were caught wandering about the house at thattime of night. I kept still. I could see through the crack of thedoor. Papa was silhouetted against the light in the studio. Hehad a wash hand basin, carrying it carefully. I heard him givea short harsh laugh, and say aloud: ‘Now I begin to live.’ Hewent down the little corridor by Harry’s room.’ (It leads to apepper-box turret. Harry’s room has a window on to that cor-ridor.) ‘I went to the side window. I saw papa throw the basinover the cliff. Then he went back, and down the main corridorto his room. I felt for Harry in his bed. He wasn’t there. Ifound matches. The room was empty. I went into the lightedstudio. I saw Harry at once, and knew he was dead. I fainted.When I came to myself I was in my own bedroom. I must havewalked there without knowing. A few minutes later, I sup-pose, the alarm came. Forgive me; I ought to have told youbefore; you must have suffered fearfully. But ——’ I stoppedher. ‘It’s best, I think, that you have told me now,’ I said, ‘wemust save him. We must be on our guard, and do nothing.’ Wenoted Cudlipp’s conduct. It became clear that he would hidehis crime to the end, even to letting me be hanged for it. I toldher that I would never speak to her again if she interfered, thatI would die for the honor of her family. I made her swear byher dead mother. I doubted at first if he were aware of what hehad done, but his manner left no doubt. For instance, he madeno inquiry into the mystery of the basin missing from his room,and never spoke of it in court. So we knew.”“You’re a very noble and very wrong-headed young man,”said Simon; “you don’t really think we can leave things asthey are, do you? Observe what is happening now. The explo-sion in the man’s brain once over, habit has resumed its sway.He’s the hypocritical bourgeois once more — but with thememory of that most fearful deed to lash him.

She went to the devil,and her master fled the country.Not bad, all this, for one’s first year of magick?One of our great exploits was the saving of the life of mymaster. Absolutely unselfish, he would never stir to help him-self, and he was a permanent invalid from spasmodic asthma,with complications. Frater V. N. and I determined, in the nameand for the sake of the Order, to save him. We evoked the spiritBuer to visible appearance. This was not wholly successful; atthat time we wanted things to happen as they did in books —for we were young. But we got the right leg and the foot andankle of the left as solid as need be; and the head, helmeted,was dimly visible through the incense smoke. In those days wewere too pious to use blood, or we might have done better. How-ever, the purpose of the work succeeded. The Master recov-ered, and is alive to this day — fifteen years later.Curious how dull good is, how amusing evil! Much keener inmemory is one night when Frater V. N. and I were alone to-gether working on the talismans and other necessaries for someoperation or other, I entirely forget what. We went out to dinner,and before leaving the room, I noticed that the temple door wasslightly open. It was locked by a Yale key of which there wasbut one, which had never left my possession. In those days mychief alarm was that some one would get into my magical af-fairs. (Nowadays I callously let them in; if they blow their headsoff, that’s their affair, not mine!) So I sedulously slammed andtested the door, and out we went to dinner. On the stairs was ablack cat — not a real cat, either. Back we came from a per-fectly temperate meal, found the outer door secure as we hadleft it, entered, found the temple door wide open, though withno sign of violence, and the altar overthrown, and its furnituretossed in all directions. — And then the fun began!Round and round the big library tramped the devils all theevening, an endless procession; 316 of them we counted, de-scribed, named, and put down in a book. It was the most awe-DO WHAT THOU WILTSHALL BETHE WHOLE OF THE LAW(Continued from the last issue.)Now to more amusing facts of my career. The first thing Ilearnt was to travel in the astral body. This seems to have beena natural gift with me; in half-a-dozen experiments I was al-ready master of the “Astral Plane.” I could go where I would,see what I would, hear what I would. At that time I did notknow of those higher planes to which initiation is the only key.The next step to going out on the Astral Plane is to get it toreturn the visit; in other words, evocation of spirits to materialappearance. It was just as I started on this that I found AllanBennett. The occasion was an initiation into the order of whichwe were both members; but he had not been present since Ijoined it. After the ceremony I was led trembling before thegreat man, and of course, could say not a word. However, in theante-room, an hour later, he came directly to me and began:“So, little brother, you have been meddling with the Goetia.” Iprotested myself unworthy even to pronounce the word! But hehad spotted me as a promising colt, and when, using my oppor-tunity, I made myself even as his familiar spirit, he consented totake me as a pupil. Before long we were working together dayand night, and a devil of a time we had!In my chambers in Chancery Lane I fitted up a temple, thewalls covered by six vast mirrors, so as to throw back the forceof the invocations. There were circle and triangle on the floor,and an altar in the midst of the circle.I constructed all my magical weapons with my own hands,except the wand, which cannot be made, but must be transmit-ted. This, a shaft of almond cut with a single blow of the Mag-ick Knife at sunrise on Easter morn, was transmitted to me byFrater Volo Noscere.The effect of all this was pretty sultry.I was attacked by a black magician in the very early days —the story is told at length and with perfect accuracy of detail inmy tale, “At the Fork of the Roads”; it is too long to cite here. Iwill only say that a woman was sent by the Black Lodge to geta drop of my blood, that she succeeded, that for ten nights fol-lowing I was assailed by a succubus which I killed with myhands every time, that with the help of my master I put her outof business by sending a plague of cats to her house, and that"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"303303THE INTERNATIONALsome and ghastly experience I had known.Strange how they love to open doors! In the East of my bigtemple in Scotland was a secret shrine, on to which foldingdoors opened. These I would lock, padlock, seal, nail down,fasten (in short) by every manner of means; yet, every time I leftthe room, I expected to find them open. Too often to recount, Idid so. I set all kinds of traps for the spirits; it was useless. Aslong as I was in the room nothing would happen; the moment Ishut the outer doors behind me, the inner ones would open noise-lessly. I ultimately had to perform a special ceremony to get ridof the annoyance. The demons who played this game were the49 servitors of Beelzebub; when tamed they became exceed-ingly useful.There is a manuscript in the Arsenal Library of Paris whichhas been translated and published under this title, “The Bookof the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.” It is the best andthe most dangerous book ever written. The translator, who livedat the other end of Paris, had to give up cycling to the library, somany were his accidents. Even afoot, he was in constant dangerof his life. And he misused the book, fell from a very creditabledegree of attainment as a magician to be a loafer, a dipsoma-niac, a sponger, and a blackmailer; in the end he died insane.The book is the address of one “Abraham the Jew” to hissecond son, Lamech, bestowing this magick upon him. The au-thor records his research, his many travels and disappointments.At last he meets with one Abramelin in Egypt, goes with himinto an oasis, and is there initiated by the bestowal of this Sa-cred Magick. He returns, achieves the task, and employs hispowers to the glory of God and the benefit of his neighbor, “forc-ing even bishops to restore stolen property,” winning battles forElectors by the timely creation of “artificial cavalry,” healingthe sick wholesale, and generally bestirring himself as a phi-lanthropist.The substance of the operation is as follows: Get a house in aquiet place, have a terrace opening to the North of your Oratory,have robes and a crown, a wand, and a few other not-too-Per-sian apparatus, and then get busy. Pray more and more everyday to obtain the Knowledge and Conversation of your HolyGuardian Angel. After two months cut out all distractions andpray harder. After two months of that, pray harder still.Then the climax. The Angel appears and instructs. Then andnot till then summon the Four Great Princes of the Evil of theWorld and compel them to swear obedience on the wand, andorder them to operate certain talismans. The next day call theEight Sub-Princes, and the third day their servitors.The book is written throughout in a serious and simple style.It is by far the most convincing mediaeval magical document inexistence. The personality of Abraham himself is evidence.And any person who doubts magick has only to get a copy ofthe book, and refuse to take it seriously. He will get proofs enoughin standard time; place, the back of the neck!But if you take it seriously and reverently, if you aspire withyour whole will to this attainment, you are safe. The blows ofthe demon will fall only on those about you.Yet every obstacle will be put in your way. For example, Ihad command of what was for all practical purposes unlimitedmoney. I didn’t care what I spent on this work. It took me elevenmonths to find a house.In copying out on vellum the talismans, I used the breakfast-room of that house, a room chosen because it was light andcheerful and caught the early morning sun. The weather wasfine. Yet I had to do my copying by artificial light. The suncould not penetrate the murk that gathered about those talis-mans.One day I returned from shooting on the hill to find a Catho-lic Priest in my drawing room. It was to ask my permission todo what he could for my gardener, a total abstainer of twentyyears’ standing who had gone raving drunk.My housekeeper vanished, unable to bear the eeriness of theplace.An adept with whom I had arranged that he should stay to bea link between me and the outer world likewise fled in terrorwithout a word of warning.One of the workmen employed about the place went ravingmad, and tried to kill me. Others again became dipsomaniacs.All my dogs died. My cook very nearly died, and was only savedby a talisman.Such are just a few of many incidents which averted the trag-edy of dullness from my daily life. And all this, mind you, at themere threat to perform the Operation!Time would fail me to tell of all the untoward events thathappened to people who did not even go so far as this. Only tohave that book on one’s shelves is a more serious risk than dry-ing dynamite on a stove!The talismans work automatically. They are as easy to ex-plode as Iodide of Nitrogen, and a sight more dangerous. Myfriend and editor, Captain J. F. C. Fuller, once marked his placein the book with his butcher’s bill; a couple of days later thebutcher was at work; his knife slipped, pierced his thigh andkilled him. As Fuller observed at the time, “It may be only acoincidence, but it’s just as bad for the butcher!”“At my initiation I was taught to be cautious” is a note in onesystem; in another the neophyte is told “Fear is failure, and theforerunner of failure. Be thou therefore without fear, for in theheart of the coward virtue abideth not.”Keep these two precepts constantly in your mind, and youshould go far and fast.Now for the third class of magical operations! It deals nolonger with the brain of the magician himself, as in the case ofvisions and evocations; it acts upon third parties directly. I referto the arts of “fascination” in its proper sense — the word comesfrom the Latin “fascinum.” Love is blind: and fascination in-cludes all arts that have this effect. You transform yourself, likeZeus into swan or bull, like Lucius into an ass, like the Egyp-tian Magi into an hawk, swallow, or Ibis, or like the Syrian intoa dove, and by this means compel the desired object to yourarms. Or you become invisible — in the practical sense thatyou remain unseen by those whom you wish not to see you, andif you are playfully inclined, and hungry, you become a bat or awolf and go afield for blood. These stories are not legends: theyveil true powers. I only once tried vampirism, for examinationpurposes, and in about an hour I bled my victim white. I passedwith honors and special mention.Of course, the reason why one does not do these things is thatin the trance Atmadarshana, on the threshold of masterpiece,one loses one’s Ego for ever. Thenceforth the man exists only asa vehicle for an Impersonal Master; he lives his own life, anddoes his own duty, but the Master in him doesn’t care whathappens to him.The other day a young lady came to consult me. I gave her"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"304304THE INTERNATIONALabout a thousand dollars’ worth of information. She asked mewhat I was going to charge. I said: “Nothing; regard me as abank account on which you can always draw.” She said: “Butyou must eat!” I answered: “I do not see the necessity.”I am always being asked why, if I have all these powers, I donot cause stones to become bread, and throw myself from theWoolworth Building in order to prove the truth of the Ninety-first Psalm, and obtain all the kingdoms of the earth at slightcost to self-respect.Why did Christ refuse in the Temptation on the Mount?It is the same story: I am come to do the Will of Him that sentme. And if I have to die on the cross, that is better than living onit!One form of fascination is the power over animals. Persuadeyour animal that you are not that dangerous wild beast, a man,and your task is over.Remember St. Francis preaching to birds and fishes. I haveseen Allan Bennett do the same with the krait, the deadliest ofthe Indian snakes. We met it on a road. Before I could blow itshead off with my revolver (the first duty of man) Allan inter-posed with his umbrella. But not to kill it. He deliberately stirredit up. It struck at the umbrella. “That,” said Allan, “is anger,”and went on to prove to the (I trust attentive) reptile the terribleresults on character of allowing oneself to give way to anger!He also animadverted on the danger of frequenting the publichighway, and, to conclude, removed the beast gently to the longgrass. As a krait can strike in the fiftieth part of a second, andkill (if he does strike) in about ten minutes, and as Allan’s onlyprotection, besides his divinity, was a pair of thin white ducktrousers, I think that may stand as one of the bravest acts everdone. I consider myself a bit of a hero merely to have stood by!However, I learnt a few tricks of this kind myself; for ex-ample — a thing most useful in the tropics — how to preventmosquitoes from biting one. This is done by thinking kindly ofthem. It must be a genuine spontaneous feeling of brotherhood,or it won’t work. You can also pick up anything hot by fixingthe attention on the fact that “it doesn’t hurt.” But that again isa matter of knack. If you think about it too hard, you can nolonger do it. I believe D. D. Home had this power.Again, you can prevent things from biting you by certainbreathing exercises. Hold the breath in such a way that the bodybecomes spasmodically rigid, and insects cannot pierce the skin.Near my bungalow at Kandy was a waterfall with a pool. AllanBennett used to feed the leeches every morning. At any momenthe could stop the leech, though already fastened to his wrist, bythis breathing trick. We would put our hands together into thewater; his would come out free, mine with a dozen leeches onit. At such moments I would bitterly remark that a coyote willnot eat a dead Mexican, but it failed to annoy him.With invisibility I was very successful. I made a big opera-tion of it in the City of Mexico, and practiced daily for monthsin front of a mirror. I got good at it at last; and several times Ihave saved my life, and even things that I valued, thereby.(To be concluded.)IMAGE.Against the green sky are blue cones,hudding, like pookoo up on a hill,From the restless mutter of the forestand the murmur of the river.STATEMENT.This is the home of my love,whose beauties are sung by the mosquitoesby nightand danced by the fliesby day.SONG.(High tenor chant.)I have feasted upon venison and fish,yams roasted and wild orange!I have drunk of the wine of the palm,and made merry to the sound of drums upon the hill!CHORUS.(Bass.)Wei-walli! ......

As I approached the landing-place, continued the ex-plorer, the savagery of the natives manifested itself in a thou-sand extravagances.In one canoe was to be seen a medicine man, waving a saf-fron rag, who parleyed in some inscrutable jargon; the tenant ofanother, a gorilla-like creature, boarded my boat, and plied mewith idiotic questions as to whether I had been there before,where I was born, who was my father, was I a native of thecountry (!!!), what were my political opinions and my moralcharacter, in short, everything that an imbecile curiosity couldconjure up. He paid not the least attention to my answers. Ilearnt afterwards that this was part of a religious ritual of theseastonishing half-men.The great point was that the stranger must be made to swearsome oath, no matter what, and no matter whether true or false.The fact of attestation guaranteed the favor of their gods. Soagain on landing I was confronted by another creature with ahead resembling that of a sheep, but with the expression of avulture, who exacted another oath to the effect that I was notintending to trade with the natives. I swore as requested, and hewas immediately satisfied; but on subsequent examination Ifound that he had taken advantage of my distraction to rifle myloads, and sequestrate several articles that took his fancy. WhenI complained of this through an interpreter, I was told that thearticles in question were of necessity “either displeasing to thegods, or pleasing to them, since the gods were never indiffer-ent. In the first case, they must be destroyed; in the second theymust be offered to the gods. In either case have you any right inthe matter.” They added that I might flatter my fortune that shehad brought me off so easily, for had I been a native, all mypossessions must infallibly have been seized.But no sooner had I quitted the landing-stage with my portersthan an innumerable company of sordid persons began to jostleme. These were all ragged and dirty; they stank horribly of staleliquor of some kind unfamiliar to me, and also of some filthyaromatic. They began at once to ply me with questions whichmade those of my former tormentor seem almost reasonable.For those other questions were at least such as I could an-swer; the new infliction was absurd. They asked me whether Ihad ever been in their country before; and on my replying “no,”inquired how I liked their country, what I thought of its institu-tions and customs, which they assured me were the best in theworld. They asked if I admired their women, who were the mostbeautiful in the world, and none of whom, as they well knew, Ihad yet seen. They wished even to know things which God alonecould have known, concerning the future; how long I was goingto stay, what I would do, and other matters even more ridicu-lous. They then became extremely insolent, commenting on mypersonal appearance and costume, catching at my clothes andasking their price, seeking information as to my most privateaffairs, and in every way conducting themselves as the soddenand mannerless mongrels that they were.However, being at last for the first time well rid of thesescurvy knaves, I was able to rest to some extent, and to listenwhile I ate my food to the babble around me. On my journeyfrom the landing-place I had already remarked that no man wasTHE DISCOVERY OF GNEUGH-IOUGHRCK(A Fragment)able to fix his mind upon his affairs. Every pebble by the road-side on which the sun’s rays chanced to fall at the proper anglewould catch his eye, and crying, “Cowrie! Cowrie!” he wouldleave his occupation and rush after it. This frequently led tofree fights between savages who had observed the pebble at thesame moment, and they would continue to fight even after theyfound it to be only a pebble. Some seemed altogether hypno-tized by their desire for cowries, and, picking up pebbles, wouldmaintain angrily that they were cowries, or were better thancowries, or would be cowries one day!Their conversation was exclusively on this one subject. Itwas unlucky or irreligious — I was never able to determine theroot-idea in this superstition — to complete a sentence withoutmention of cowries, or to refer to any object without giving itsequivalent in cowries. It was also usual to prefix to every sen-tence a brief invocation of the “official” god; and this I found tobe the only trace remaining of his worship. The real god is afabulous bird — the Aquila duplex of Mungo Park may be acongener. Fabulous, I say, though the natives assert positivelythat it exists. Yet some such bird is to be found in the westernpart of the country. The possession of a specimen is said toconfer the highest happiness.In default of such specimens they have dirty and crumpledoblongs of some substance resembling paper. These are cov-ered with hieroglyphic signs and pictures, and the Big Medi-cine-Man, a mysterious being in the interior of the country, con-secrates them and issues them. Their possession ensures goodluck. Some are more sacred than others; this depends on thesigns written by the makers. For even one of these every nativeis ready to perform any service, however degrading; or to steal,rob, and murder.There is, however, a difference in degree; it is pretended thatsuch crimes are only honorable or even (among the stricter sortof men) excusable when the number or value of the oblongs isgreat. But each man knows in his heart that even one of theleast desirable of these is worth the loss of his soul; for this istheir religion.The food of the country is very varied and delicious, but thecooks are by no means skilful in their art. It is possible, how-ever, after some experience, to avoid actual poisoning; and thisthe natives themselves are not able to do. For instead of usingtheir noses, tongues, and eyes, they judge wholly by ear, which,a good principle in musical criticism, is unsuited to ripe gas-tronomy. Their method is as follows: Certain persons are cho-sen for the loudness of their tones, and appointed to declare thebenefits or the reverse of devouring certain substances. Oneclass cries that such a food is poison; his opponent that it is theonly true nourishment of life. This shouting goes on continu-ously, and the other natives catch the enthusiasm of the shoutersand join in their sacred war-dances, which often develop intofights. The shouters claim the direct inspiration of the god oftruth, or of the god of freedom, or of the god of the people; butin reality they are faithful to the true but unofficial god of thisstrange people, as is every one. Those who most loudly blas-pheme him are in truth often his best servants. The shouters areemployed by the merchants, in effect, and their oracles depend"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"306306THE INTERNATIONALupon the commercial interests of their masters. I remarked uponthis fact to one of their greatest philosophers, and he repliedthat it was the greatest proof possible of their bona fides, thatthe spiritual side of the prophets should be in such perfection ofharmony with their material welfare. “What in the Abyss couldbe better?” (It is the custom to affirm belief in the existence ofa place of eternal punishment by introducing its name into ev-ery question, since certain heretics doubted it of yore.)“Should one prophesy against himself, it would show dis-union in his being, which is no other than madness.”The test of truth is therefore exclusively its utility. This factis of wide bearing, and applies directly to their theory of law.This is as simple in this country as it is complex in others.The first principle is that everything is forbidden. For example,said my interpreter, no man may carry arms. I pointed out that(on the contrary) every man was armed to the teeth. True, saidhe, therefore if any man displease the ruling power, it is easy todestroy him. If he pay not ample tribute, or if he lend not hiswives to the right people, or if he err in thought upon politicalor social questions, there is no trouble in condemning him. Thereis always some crime, which all alike commit, of which he maybe conveniently accused.This rule holds good of all laws. None are in force, unless itbe to satisfy the greed or spite of one of the ruling class. To thisthere is however one important exception. There are certainclasses of Shouters whose duty it is to call attention constantlyto the evil-doer. These wisely concentrate their energies on someone trivial matter — it is not pleasing to the gods to mentionserious affairs at all, in any connection — and they enforce thelaws most drastically for the moment, while the attention of thepeople can be held. Thus, on my arrival, they had just condemneda medicine man to Ten Years of Imprisonment for “conscien-tious-advice-giving.”Other points were also most strange, even to me, an old ex-plorer of many of the dark places of the earth. One essentialpoint of law is that a forbidden thing is no longer forbidden, if itbe called by another name. Thus, it is the custom of the countryto drink arrack from a calabash, coffee from a coco-nut; and it isforbidden to drink arrack upon holy days. Those therefore whowish to do so drink it from a coco-nut, and it becomes techni-cally coffee. Similarly, in calling for the arrack, one must say:bring bamboo-shoots. Thus is the law satisfied.The object of enforcing laws in this sporadic manner is ob-vious. Suppose a merchant spend years of labor in the build-ing up a big trade in silk. The Shouters then say: “Behold thisvillain, the greatest rogue that walketh upon the earth! Lo, heconduceth to luxury and to vanity; and the morals of our women,the purest albeit the fairest that be in all the world, are by himcorrupt.” The indignation of the people is thus aroused, andthey bethink them of the law against silk. The merchant mustthen pay all that he hath to the Shouters, so that they may notsee him.This is a most salutary custom of this people. The merchanthath ever the fear of the Law before his eyes. He is taught con-stantly the instability of human affairs, and so from a merchanthe becometh a philosopher.The greater merchants, however, have found higher truths.They themselves employ armies of Shouters, and none dare of-fend them. In their hands they have gathered all the images ofthe God of the country, without which none may do aught with-out blasphemy, and blasphemy is the one crime that is alwaysand in all places punished, usually by death.It is they that have destroyed or sequestrated all the speci-mens of Aquila Duplex, which is not fabulous at all, and maystill be found in the western districts of the country. But it hasbeen to their interest to persuade the ignorant that the bird isbut a fable, and that the oblong squares are the true God.The evening being now come, I went forth into the market-place to take the air; but no sooner had I come into their mainway, which they call broad (though it is narrow enough if onecompare it with the main street of any civilized town), and white,although it has hardly a white building in all its length, than Iwas assailed by the fearsome beast which is justly the dread ofthe whole country, the terrible man-eating chicken . . .(The remainder of this account has been deleted by the Cen-sor.)ABSINTHEBy JEANNE LA GOULUELAST NIGHTBy FAITH BALDWIN————Within a dim and starlit room last night,Your heart to mine, astir like frightened wings,Your dear lips saying mad, enchanting things,I saw your strange eyes fill with faery light.And suddenly I slipped from out To-dayAnd we were in some green and moon-mad place,And as you smiled, and bent to kiss my face,I knew that, somehow, we had found the wayBack to a Pagan passion and desire,Back to an Age of golden, free-limbed Youth,All Song and Rapture and courageous Truth,The world at Springtide — and the night on fire.And we were bound no more by Time and Space,No longer slaves of Subterfuge and Man,And you who held me in your arms were Pan,And I a dryad crushed in your embrace!Apollon, qui pleurait le trépas d’Hyacinthe,Ne voulait pas céder la victoire à la mort.Il fallait que son âme, adepte de l’essor,Trouvât pour la beauté une alchimie plus sainte.Donc, de sa main céleste il épuise, il éreinteLes dons les plus subtils de la divine Flore.Leurs corps brisés soupirent une exhalaison d’orDont il nous recueillait la goutte de l’Absinthe!Aux cavernes blotties, aux palais pétillants,Par un, par deux, buvez ce breuvage d’aimant.Car c’est un sortilège, un propos de dictame;Ce vin d’opal pale avortit la misère,Ouvre de la beauté l’intime sanctuaire— Ensorcelle mon ceur, extasie mon âme!"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"307307THE INTERNATIONALGROANS FROM THE PADDED CELL(The Minority Report of the Editorial Rooms.)IN the days of the military clan, men were more or less freeand equal. An ordeal was necessary for the attainment of man-hood; a regular ceremony which was far from a joke. Only thestrong and clever could hope to attain the privileges of man-hood. There was no specialization of labor. A man had to beable to hunt and fight; a woman to cook and to do the work ofagriculture. There was hardly room for anyone but what mightbe called the normal human being. One particularly lazy fellow,well skilled in flattery, might get a job as tribal bard; but other-wise he would have to work like the rest. As a man got old,beyond the period when skill and experience failed to compen-sate for lack of strength, he might become an elder by virtue ofhis wisdom; and, of course, the best all-round man had a goodchance of becoming King. But there really was something likeequality of opportunity.TO-DAY all this is absolutely changed. Every importantbranch of work is so specialized that a man must give hiswhole life to his particular job for 40 years or more before he iscapable of holding his own in it. Such a man must obviously bechosen from the start on the ground of inclination and capacity.He must be allowed ample leisure. He must be secured free-dom from all worries and anxiety, or he will never arrive atcompetence. A university education is not nearly enough. It isonly a general ground-work. When a man leaves a university hewants at least 10 years uninterrupted work in his particular linebefore he even begins to succeed in it. In other words, the com-plexity of civilization demands an elaborate caste system. Forone thing, the habit of authority is absolutely necessary to anyone who is to fill a position of responsibility. Put a man who hasdone menial work all his life into an important position. Heinevitably becomes a “Jack in office,” harsh, overbearing andtyrannical. On the other hand, if you take a boy and give himwell trained servants, he will, when he becomes a man, getthings done with perfect suavity and good feeling and absenceof friction. That is why you can take a boy from Eton or Win-chester and send him out to rule a province in India. The “Com-petition-wallah,” the boy of no birth or breeding who obtains aposition in the Indian Civil Service by intellectual merit, is adisastrous failure.THERE must however, be an end to all this talk of equalityof opportunity. It will always be necessary to have a greatmajority of the population engaged in mechanical tasks. It isevidently quite impossible to give every man and woman evena university education. Most people have to earn their living bythe time they are sixteen. Even if this experiment were pos-sible, it would be absurd, because the university education wouldunfit the average individual for the necessary work of life. It isno good to teach a man political economy and Greek, and thenset him to make rivets in a boiler factory for the rest of his life.HOW then are we to make an intelligent selection? The an-swer is perfectly obvious. Men are not by any means bornequal in the matter of intellectual capacity. Take the extremecase of the Hottentot. No amount of teaching will get him tocount beyond the number five, owing to the limitations imposedupon him by nature in the matter of fingers. The same holdstrue to a limited extent even with Caucasians. It is quite truethat occasionally nature, in her merry mood, produces a geniusfrom very unlikely material. It may sometimes happen, for ex-ample, that a stock which has never exhibited any intellectualdistinction at all may get tangled up matrimonially with a luna-tic, and by some lucky combination produce a genius.BUT we do not know enough about genius to take any prac-tical steps along these lines. We are bound to deal withaverages; and there is nothing more certain than this, that ordi-nary talent, as opposed to genius, is to a very large extent inher-ited. The main objection to the hereditary principle is that fami-lies, after a long series of generations of distinguished men,take to producing degenerates and imbeciles. It is the ordinarybiological curve. Now undoubtedly much mischief is wroughtby having a caste which is hereditary and nothing more, be-cause the said degenerates and imbeciles interfere with theworking of the social machine. Our business is to get the rightman in the right place; and the hard and fast rule of primogeni-ture has in many cases worked badly. One may concede thatultimately it is bound to work badly in all cases.IT seems to me that it would be easy enough to guard againstthis difficulty. We must have a leisured class, we must have aprivileged class, or we can never get good men at all. The mostlikely candidates are those whose fathers and mothers haveachieved distinction. This principle has been recognized in En-gland by the practice of raising distinguished men to the peer-age. The idea has been greatly abused by confirming nobilityupon the mere plutocrat. Yet when particularly undesirablepeople have bought these titles, care has taken to make the seatin the House of Lords end with the life of the ennobled bag ofmoney.BUT how are we to prevent degenerates and imbeciles fromsitting in the highest councils of the nation? By the simpleprocess of clearing them out. It would be easy to arrange for atest of manhood, a public test subject to public criticism, so thatno man could assume hereditary privileges without proving byordeal his right to it. These tests could and should be both physi-cal and mental. These ideas are not opposed to democracy in itstrue sense. We want the normal man to govern, and the normalman means a man very far above the average, almost the idealman, just as normal eyesight is the kind of eyesight that only avery few very lucky people possess.THE socialistic idea that every man is as good as every otherman is comic. A great deal of rubbish has been writtenlately about “secret diplomacy.” How can the ordinary man ex-pect to give a sound opinion on the affairs of foreign countries,when the very best men, specially trained for all their lives, areconstantly making the most stupid mistakes? “Popular control”is out of the question, even in the smallest business house. Howthen can we apply it with any common sense to the affairs of a"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"308308THE INTERNATIONALgreat nation? If the people were free to vote, what would theyvote for? Free lodging, free movies and free beer. I myself wouldvote for free beer. Could you expect the lower East Side to votemoney for the encouragement of art or even of science? Of anyof the higher branches of human activity? Yet, the whole struc-ture of society depends upon the cultivation of these higherbranches. Go and ask the ordinary working man whether hewould rather apply the national income to the reduction of rentor to the study of histology! We should never have a cent foranything pertaining to the most fundamental and necessary ac-tivities, if the choice were left to the people.WHAT then is the ideal form of government? The greatestof all the political lessons of history is that society isfounded on the family, and the family on the land. A strongagrarian class is the best defense against invasion, physical ormoral. “A bold peasantry, its country’s pride, when once de-stroyed, can never be supplied.” There is something in the con-tact with earth and air and water and sun which makes menvigorous. All strong and stable states have had Cincinnatus fora unit. The power of England has always lain in the landednobility and gentry. Each great estate has been the nucleus of apeasantry with “soul” — with a peculiar pride in itself. Thelords of the land, great or little, were also the fathers of thepeople. Each took a particular and individual interest in each ofhis tenants.WHEN this system began to break up, owing to the growthof industrialism and of the power of money, the virility ofEngland broke with it. Fifty years ago the smallest squire hadmore social consideration than the most wealthy merchant;rightly so, for he was actually a part of the land itself. A richman could not become a squire by buying land; he became ajoke.BUT your plutocrat has no anchor in the soil; he calculatescoldly that it is cheaper to work a man to death than to lookafter him. He does not know or care what becomes of thosedependent upon him. The idea of solidity of structure is gonefrom the social system. America dwells in tents like the Arabs,and may as silently fade away. Who in this colony feels in hisbones an attachment to ancestral Topeka? We go where the eco-nomic tide drifts us; and we do not go back because there is no“back” to go to. Socialism (as most people seem to conceive it)would make matters a thousands times worse — if there’s thatamount of room for further bedevilment; for Socialism ignoresall but the economic factor. Economics appeal only to the shellof men, never to his soul. And it is the soul which determinesthe action of a true man. A nation swayed wholly by economicconsiderations is a nation lost alike to God and to man. “Illfares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth accumu-lates and men decay.”THE first business of government is to guard the hardihoodof the race. So we must see to it that every child is healthyand well-fed, inured to sport, to hardship within certain bounds.The spirit must be free, the passions strong and well regulated,the intellect unhampered by old wives’ fables. We must assureto every one the first necessaries of life, shelter, food, warmthand the easy exercise of the power of reproduction, withoutshame or sentimentality.WE must make a firm, almost a paternal bond, between the“lord” and his dependents. If an employer were soundlywhipped whenever one of his men or women had a preventablesickness, it would change things considerably! The happiest,the most healthy, the most prosperous class in recent historywere the slaves in the South before the Civil War, wherever theowner was a decent Southern Gentleman, and not a Yankeenigger-driver, with no interest in the slaves beyond dollars. IfAmerica is to survive, nay, to become a nation, it must be by thedevelopment of an enlightened feudalism.LET us not be frightened by a name! Reginald Front-de-Boeuf was not the only type of Norman Baron. And theworld is a very different place to-day. We have a wretched habitof being scared by words like “royalty,” “Socialism,” so that wedo not trouble to ask what such terms really mean. This is be-cause we mix up our rational thoughts with our sentimentalemotions. There was never a moment in the world’s historywhen it was more vitally important to think and to feel as ifwith two separate organs. “God gave the land to the people,” asthe little hymn says; but He did not give them brains, or moralcourage, or the power of self-analysis. There is not one man inten thousand who knows whether his consciousness is coloredby reason or by passion.I PERSONALLY have found this power extremely awkward.Just at present, for example, my heart clings to the great courtof Trinity closer than its immemorial ivy. All my imagination iswith the England of Harry the Fifth, and with the France ofJoan of Arc, and with the Russia of wild and mystic orgies. Butmy intellect refuses to give assent to some of the propositionsmade by the Allies. I am ready, with Drake, to singe the King ofSpain’s beard; or to tear the Kaiser from his gory throne, in amoment of patriotic passion. But I am not prepared to sit downand argue calmly that such actions are ethically right. All hailto the vehemence and fury of war and of love! But not in thesetrousers. I must first gird my loins with the saffron philabeg ofa dhuine-wassail! As a lover, it gives me extreme satisfaction toriot amid the wine-stained and blood-bedabbled tresses of aMessalina or a Catherine; but, as a philosopher, I seem to my-self to have acted with brutish unreason. I maintain, briefly,that Philip drunk is as good as Philip sober; but I cannot fallinto line with the man who asserts that Philip drunk is Philipsober. And alas! that man is everywhere. You rightly enoughdrop nine hundred and sixty-eight million tons of trinitrotolu-ene upon the head of a Saxon peasant whose only idea of you,till then, has been vague and ill-etched. Perhaps he thought ofyou as one of the people among whom his Uncle Fritz went tolive in 1849. You are right to drop that trinitrotoluene; it is asplendid gesture. But — the morning after? Even Antient Pistolproved amenable. “I’ll fer him, and firk him, and ferret him;discourse the same in French unto him!” is followed by the mildacceptance of a modest ransom.NOW this war is not to be settled by appeals to passion andto sentiment.

The remarks of the prohibi-tionist who was holding forth from the big arm chair seemed toexcite him, but one could hardly have said why. But when thatrespectable gentleman paused for breath, the fire leapt up. “MayI add my humble testimony?” he said politely. “I feel morestrongly than most men, I think, upon the subject. Were I to tellyou my story, perhaps you would admit that I had a right to doso.” The man from the Anti-Saloon League got out his notebook with undisguised enthusiasm. “Can’t we induce you totell it?” he asked, scenting something sensational, “nothing soaids the cause as the recital of facts.” “Well,” said the quietman, “I don’t mind if I do. I was married to a young and beauti-ful woman. We passed six years of which one could not pick outa single month and say that it was not a honeymoon. She drankherself into a lunatic asylum.” He stopped there, very suddenly;his words cut bitterly into the heart of every man in the room.They were too shocked for even the conventional murmur ofsympathy. But the prohibitionist, with a smirk, asked for fur-ther details. “I shall be happy to gratify you, sir,” replied theother, and there was a subcurrent of severity in his tone whichmade one or two of the more sophisticated men present prickup their ears. The quiet man lighted his cigar. “My wife’s fa-ther,” he said, “was vicar of one of the most important parishesin London. His wife liked a glass of champagne with her din-ner. However, in her position, it would not do. She had to set agood example to the parish. At the same time she was not goingto give up her champagne, so she sent for a doctor who pre-scribed her champagne, and in order more effectually to silencethe voice of scandal, it was necessary to prescribe for the chil-dren as well. The eldest daughter, at the age of 16, was drink-ing about a quart a day, by the doctor’s orders. She married.Two years later, her husband died. Six years after that I marriedher myself. Presently I discovered that whenever anything hap-pened to depress her she sought consolation in alcohol. ThePuritan idea, the necessity of pretending to be what you are not,had destroyed her sense of freedom. She did the drinking se-cretly. Ultimately the smash came. I had to be away for somemonths on business. In my absence the baby died. I came backto find her a hopeless dipsomaniac. I tried everything. Natu-rally it was useless. She lost all moral sense. I was compelled todivorce her because she refused to follow the doctor’s last or-ders, to spend two years in a ‘home.’ I would not stand by andlet her kill herself so long as I was morally responsible for hermoral welfare. Three months after the divorce, she had to beput into a lunatic asylum.”“A most striking story,” said the prohibitionist, “A most ad-mirable story, a most useful story for our purpose.” But the quietman rose to his feet. “No,” he said, “my tragedy is not a tragedyof alcohol, it is a tragedy of humbug. It is the rotten popularAnglo-Saxon cowardice about the use of alcohol which leadsinevitably to its abuse. It is people like yourself that are respon-sible for all the drunkenness, for all the insanity, for all thecrime that people resort to. In countries where there is no feel-ing against alcohol, where, in honesty and decent freedom aman can sit with his family and drink in the open, we find noneof these troubles.” The prohibition orator became exceedinglyannoyed. “I did not expect this treatment,” he said, “it is mostunwarrantable. I have no doubt at all, sir, that the poor womanwas driven to drink by your own brutal treatment.” “Yes,” saidthe other man, “I can be both brutal and violent on occasion.”And he was.————THE ARGUMENT THAT TOOK THE WRONG TURNING"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"310310THE INTERNATIONALTHE BURNING OF MELCARTHBY MARK WELLSThe Herald of the King of Tyre, borne upon a chariot withsix white horses, made his way through the busy street.In the name of the great god Melcarth, and in the King’sname, he commanded that all strangers should leave the cityupon pain of death.It was two weeks before the winter solstice, but in that glo-rious climate many a flower bloomed already in the gardensof the inhabitants.Cleon, the Greek merchant of Corinth, was prepared for thewarning of the herald, but he was none the less annoyed. Hehad the commercial spirit, and it enraged him to find his busi-ness interrupted by a mere festival. He would not so muchhave minded had Dodeh, his belovéd for the period of his resi-dence, agreed to accompany him. A holiday visiting the is-lands of the coast would have been agreeable if he had someone to play the flute to him, and dance for him upon the deckin the glow of sunset. But Dodeh had refused positively; “herreligion came first in her life” — and Cleon, who was rather asceptic, sighed over the stupidity of fanaticism. He was angry,too, for a somewhat contradictory reason. Since festivals mustbe, he liked to see them. He fancied himself as a travelledman, and he would have liked to bring back a great story toCorinth in the spring. Still there was nothing for it but com-pliance; so he made a feast for Dodeh, bade her guard hismerchandise in his absence, and in particular to beware of theadvances of a certain saucy youth named Ramman, one of thosevagabonds who from all time has infested Eastern cities, liv-ing no one knows quite how.“He shall not called Ramman for nothing,” frowned theGreek, “if he comes about my house in my absence.” This wasa joke, for Ramman is derived from the verb “ramamu,” mean-ing to bellow.Dodeh naturally assured the merchant of her eternal truth,and very likely believed what she said; women usually do, atthe time. Their deceptions are successful because they are un-conscious. They are all faithful, so far as they know; but whenit comes to action, it is the “troll” that rules them.So Cleon took his men and his ship and put to sea; andcruised among the islands till the period of the festival hadelapsed. By some error of calculation the ship master arrivedoff Tyre some hours too soon.The city lay in utter darkness; but on the beach a flameshone out as if it were a beacon. Dawn broke, and they sawthat it was the smouldering effigy of a monstrous man, seatedastride a sea-horse proportionally enormous. When the pilotcame out with the official who represented the city, in order tosee that all was in conformity with Tyrian law, Cleon askedthe latter what this might mean and was solemnly assured that“the god had struck him with a thunderbolt.” The strange sightand stranger explanation struck the fancy of the Greek; and hemore than ever regretted that he was not entitled to witnessthe wonders about which the people of the city made suchmystery.Dodeh received him with exceeding joy, which her demuredemeanor would not hide, for once. She was a woman of twentyyears old, of subtle loveliness. Rather short and plump, shewas built strong and sturdy; her round face was rosy throughits olive, and the effect was heightened by faint blue tattooingson the cheeks and lips. Her eyes were fiery glints beneathdark eyebrows blackened and drawn out with kohl. On herupper lip a fine moustache — the merest hint — betrayed apassionate temperament. She was silky and sullen and swiftand perverse, loving to tease her master with pretended indif-ference, only to overwhelm him with the greater vehemenceat the end, like a cat playing with a mouse. She had all thestealth and self-possession of a cat, moreover; and Cleonthought himself lucky to be beloved of one so skilled in everyart of pleasing and exciting. In short, she ended by winninghim wholly; for not content with the mere art of love, she hadmade herself indispensable to his business, teaching him allthe tricks of the Tyrians, how they imitated ivory, and adulter-ated purple, and mixed silk and wool so that no ordinary eyecould distinguish the fraud. The result was that he carried heroff to Corinth with him when his business was done, and thesmiles of Grecian maids failed to disturb him; he had foundthe one woman of the world. She presided in his house withperfect dignity and charm; the philosophers whose companyCleon affected were more than pleased with her modesty andher education; for she could recite the poems of Sappho, andof Alcaeus, and of Stesichorus and Pittacus and Hermesianax,as well as she could play the flute and dance; while even sternersubjects were familiar to her. She was well acquainted withthe philosophy of Pythagoras and of Heraclitus, and had evenstudied Plato; while, to crown all, she possessed a very prettygift of divination by throwing handfuls of dried leaves into afire made of cedarwood and beeswax. She was not a merepriestess of pleasure, it must be understood; she had beenbrought up from infancy in the temple, and trained and conse-crated to the service of the god.Presently Cleon had to return to Tyre, and this time his voy-age was so successful that he determined to establish a regu-lar branch of his business in the city at the end of the summer.It was July when he and Dodeh reached Corinth for the secondtime, and so devoted was the lover that he made a great festi-val and married her. She readily acquiesced in the Greek cer-emony, but made a single stipulation, that she should be al-lowed to hold in her hand some of the sacred fire from thealtar during the whole ceremony; for such, she said, was thecustom of her people, that the sun, the father of all fire and thegiver of all life on earth, might witness to her fidelity on theone hand and make her fertile on the other. But she said thislaughingly, and Cleon thought that she cared little for her reli-gion, but yet was half-consciously afraid to fail to carry out itsobservances.A month after the marriage they sailed once more for Tyre,where Cleon purchased a large shop for his merchandise, anda house with a garden in the suburbs. All autumn they livedand loved in peace and in prosperity; then Cleon rememberedthat he was still technically a stranger, and would have to leavethe city for the festival. He was much more annoyed than onthe previous occasion; for he had “settled down” with Dodeh,and become fat and lazy; besides, he was all on fire to see the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"311311THE INTERNATIONALceremony of which he had only witnessed the aftermath. Heexpressed his feelings in the plainest words to Dodeh. It wasthe nearest approach to ill-temper he had ever shown.She laughed in her most fascinating way. “Dear baby,” shesaid, “what a fuss about nothing! All you need do is to leavethe city openly and lie off shore a few miles out to sea; I willget a little boat and come for you at night. You shall comeback here; I will disguise you, and we will see the ceremonytogether — except the last day, when women are not allowedto participate. But I will tell you exactly what to do, and youshall see everything.” Cleon was enchanted at her ready com-pliance, and her quick solution; when the time came he leftTyre in great state, taking a most affecting public farewell ofhis wife, to throw as much dust as possible in the eyes of theworld. That night Dodeh did as she had said; they got back tothe villa without being observed, and though it was all darkwithout, within were lights and flowers and a splendid ban-quet ready. Never had Dodeh been so hilarious as she was thatnight; the slightest incidents seemed to amuse her, and in con-sequence she was equally amusing. They really behaved liketwo silly children; one would have said they had been partedfor a year instead of a bare fraction of a day.II.For the next three days the happy couple remained quietlyat home, save for an hour or so in the morning, when Dodehwent to the market and the temple in order not to arousecomment in the city. On the fourth day the festival was tobegin.That morning Dodeh came home with quantities of livequails, which Cleon had not seen before the festival. The ex-planation was that Asteria, the mother of Melcarth, was a quail,and these birds might therefore not be eaten until the birth ofMelcarth, which was to be celebrated that night. Shortly aftersunset Dodeh dressed Cleon in the disguise of a slave andmade him carry the quails; and they went forth together to apart of the city where they were not known. At every placewhere four streets met a bale-fire blazed. Around these firesthe people were assembled, in great solemnity, every one withbright clothes, and most of them carrying one or more livequails, each according to his rank and wealth. Priests walkedup and down the street in twos and threes, chanting:Rejoice! Rejoice!O men of Tyre, rejoice!O women of Tyre, clap hands!Asteria your goddess is ill at ease.She is bowed upon the arms of her handmaidens.Cry aloud that Asteria may be delivered from her pain!Let a man child be born unto Asteria, even the great godMelcarth, Lord of Tyre.Rejoice! Rejoice!Presently the song changed. It became surpassing slow andsad. One priest began:“Now is the hour of the tribulation of Asteria.” Anotheranswered:“Whence came Asteria?”“From the fire of the sun.”“What shall avail her to purge her of her tribulation?”“The fire of the sun.”Then rose the voices of the priests in chorus:“Arise, ye people, let strength and beauty be born of Asteria,mother of Melcarth, Lord of Tyre!”At that all the people shouted together, and began to leapjoyously across the flames, dropping the live quails into themas they sprang. Cleon, following his wife’s direction, imitatedthem. As the quails began to roast, they were recovered fromthe fire, and every one plucked and ate one then and there.When every one had had his fill, the dance began; but Cleonand Dodeh soon slipped away to the quieter pleasures of theflute.On the following day, it was evident that Melcarth had in-deed been born; for there he stood in the great square that wasin the center of the city, in effigy, twenty feet high, upon a sea-horse. Around him was a regular scaffolding of logs, withsheaves of straw; in preparation, as Dodeh explained to herhusband, for the final bonfire. But this day was to be devotedto the drama of the life of the great God. Dodeh had procureda priest’s dress for Cleon, as through her association with thetemple she could easily do. They found a secluded station inthat part of the temple which was allotted to the priests andpriestesses — and this was the only day in the year whenwomen were permitted to enter the holy place. This enabledthem to see perfectly without attracting any special attention.At high noon the herald entered the temple and bade allmen mark the coming of the king. A minute later the rest ofthe procession arrived. Cleon could see it through the opendoor of the sacred building. First came a solid phalanx ofguards, in white tunics and buskins, with shields, corslets,and helmets of carved and polished brass. They carried spearswhich had been gilded in honor of the occasion. Next came acompany of horsemen, their trappings covered with fans ofpeacock’s feathers. After them came many priests; then thecompany of the actors of the sacred drama, in the various dis-guises necessary; then other priests. Next came six giganticmen of swarthy stature, bearing a gilded pole carved with rep-resentations of the deeds of Melcarth, and tipped with the imageof a pine-cone.Last came the king, in a chariot of chased ivory and gold.The car was swathed with a great curtain of true Tyrian purple,against which the king showed marvellously, for he wore silksof the richest blue over his golden armor, and in his helmetwith its crenellated circlet were seven white ostrich feathers.In his hand he carried the sacred rod of office, for he was highpriest as well as king. About him the high ministers of statebore each the symbol of his office.At the temple the king descended, and did sacrifice at thegreat altar where burned the perpetual fire. Only the priestsand the actors entered with him.The king gave the signal, and the sacred play began. Withevery detail the great legend of Melcarth was commemorated;his conquest of the lion and of the dragon, of the Rivers ofDestruction and of the Untameable Sea-horse. They repre-sented his cleansing of the land by rain, his fertilizing of thedesert by rivers; they showed how he had won the golden fruitfrom the gardens of the Sunset, and how he had dragged backhis friend Mazib from the very heart of hell.This was the climax of the mystery, for no sooner had therescued man embraced his savior than the king himself, leav-ing his throne, stepped forward as though to interrupt the pro-ceedings. He lifted his staff, crying “Woe, woe to the city of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"312312THE INTERNATIONALTyre! Melcarth saved Mazib, for Melcarth is a god, the strong,the bountiful. But who shall save Melcarth? For Melcarth goethdown into the grave!” With that he cast his staff upon theground; he tore his blue robes from his shoulders; he unbuck-led his golden armor, and let it clang upon the marble. Ap-pearing only in a loose robe of black without any ornament, hecast dust upon his head from a box presented by the priestwho acted as master of the ceremonies, and uttered a longlament, full of terrible predictions as to what would happen tothe city when Melcarth was dead, ending every phrase withthe woeful question “Who shall save Melcarth? Who shall savethe city of Tyre?”Presently all present began to join in this refrain; it spreadwithout the temple, all down the city streets through the ranksof the assembled people. All tore their robes, all threw dustupon their heads, all beat their foreheads. But now the young-est of all the priests came forward. He alone had not joined inthe lamentations; he had stood silent before the fire of thealtar as if lost in meditation, from time to time reaching hishand out over the fire, or leaning his head towards it. He wasdressed, differently to the other priests, in a short tunic ofpurple with a skirt to the knee, and a golden cord bound seventimes about his waist. On his head he wore a conical cap ofcarved ivory, ornamented with horns like a bull’s. He bore abow and seven small blunt arrows. Standing before the kinghe shot the arrows one by one into the air, while all stoodsilent. Then he spoke.“An oracle of the god, O King!“The word of Melcarth to the City of Tyre!“Melcarth must die, but he must live again!”The king answered with the old phrase: “Who shall saveMelcarth? Who shall save the City of Tyre?”The young man answered: “An oracle of the god, O king! Aman that is a stranger shall save the City of Tyre!”The king lifted his voice, as if appealing to the people: “Isthere any stranger in the City of Tyre?”Immediately confusion arose, every man pretending to ex-amine his neighbor. After a few moments the king repeatedhis question, and again the pretended search was made. Forthe third time the king asked: “Is there any stranger in the Cityof Tyre?” and this time the answer rolled back, a dirge of utterwoe, from every part of the whole city, and even from the sub-urbs and the surrounding fields and hills, where men had beenspecially stationed for this part of the ritual, the idea being toinclude the whole dominion in the sacred formula. With onevoice the priests and the people cried aloud: “There is nostranger in the City of Tyre!” At that the entire populationgave themselves up to frenzies of affected woe, dispersinggradually to their homes, where they were to abstain from foodand from the kindling of any fire, until the morrow. Cleon andDodeh, profoundly moved by the significance of this strangerite, returned to their villa, and sat, as the ritual prescribed,by the dead ashes of the hearth, lamenting till the dawn.The critical moment for Cleon was to arrive on the thirdday of the feast, for no women might accompany the men, sohis wife said. Every man must wear a particular disguise, andshe had been at pains to prepare one and conceal it in thehouse of a friend who lived in the great street which led to thecenter of the city. Cleon would thus have only about half amile to walk to see the burning of the effigy of Melcarth, andthere would be little chance of detection. So a little beforenoon they reached the house appointed. The street was alreadylined with guards for the ceremony, but Dodeh giving a sign tothe officer, she was allowed to enter with Cleon. Here sheremoved his slave’s dress, which she had made him wear toexplain his presence with her, and proceeded to adorn him forthe ceremony. She produced a jar of some sticky substancelike resin, stained purple with the famous dye, and coveredhim from head to foot with it. Over this she threw a lion’sskin, and in his hand she put a club. “We must wait till theprocession comes,” she said, “then you can glide out of thehouse and mingle with it; no one will notice you. Walk up tothe great square with them, but do not speak to any one. Youraccent — though it’s delightful, heart of my heart! — wouldgive you away at once, and it would be terribly dangerous foryou to be recognized as a stranger. We don’t like our myster-ies spied on; only, I love you!”Minutes passed by; Cleon began to find this costume ex-tremely hot and the sacred paint peculiarly irritating; but itwas worth it. Presently a noise of chanting down the streettold them that the procession was near; Cleon, trying hard notto scratch, slipped out of the door. The street was now full ofpeople, many of them in fantastic attire. The sun blazed downupon the scene, and Cleon felt hotter and more uncomfortablethan ever. But he was full of strange excitement; the fierceatmosphere of the festival seemed to have communicated it-self to him.In a few moments the head of the procession appeared. Itwas formed by priests, all wearing the masks of various wildbeasts and bearing flaming torches. As he turned to look, thestreet suddenly cleared; the people had all moved to the sidebehind the steel-clad line of guards. He realized that he wasalone; but instead of retiring among the others, he felt thatthat was the one thing he could not do. He felt a kind of mad-ness surging in his brain, and at the same moment he realizedthat the procession was no longer chanting, but roaring andhowling in imitation of the wild beasts whose masks they wore,and that they were charging him. He bounded madly up thestreet toward the square; the crowd joined in at his heels, andabove the cries he heard the jubilant call of the people:“Melcarth shall live again! Tyre shall be saved!”He reached the square; it was full of men and women withflaming torches on every side. His blood boiled with the frenzyof excitement; he knew that he was shouting in mad gleemingled with horror. Suddenly a flash of sanity came to him;he saw that he was in danger. He dashed at an opening of thesquare, but the flaming torches closed upon him. The agony ofthe poisoned paint was now insufferable; he bounded to andfro, raving he knew not what. Ever the torches seemed to hemhim in.And then the darkness fell from his eyes; a great illumina-tion seized him; he must take refuge with Melcarth, withMelcarth who must die and live again. In an ecstasy he boundedupon the pyre; he climbed over the great logs; he caught thestirrup of the god, and hoisted himself on to the shoulders ofthe sea-horse. As he did so a thousand torches were plungedinto the straw, and the flames roared up to heaven. But throughthem he saw one thing with the last flash of sanity and life; itwas Dodeh, in her harlot’s dress, lying back in the arms ofRamman, laughing and clapping her hands."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"313313THE INTERNATIONALCONFESSIONS OF A BARBARIAN(Written in the Dark Ages Before the War.)BY GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK.GERMANY, to borrow the phrase of a teetotaler, is the clas-sic land of moderate drinking. Out of Germany came thetemperance drink, beer. Bacchus Dionysos has found many sing-ers. Gambrinus is unsung, if not unhonored, of poets. Yet is notthe hop as fragrant as the grape? I am convinced that many poetswho celebrate the vine have been inspired by beer. But beer doesn’trhyme well. We deem it a word without literary traditions. Still,the history of beer is ancient and honorable, and its literaturereaches back to the dusk of the Pagan gods. Julian, the Apostate,was the first contributor to the literature of beer. He wrote a sa-tirical poem against it. He also wrote satirical poems against theChristians. But the pale Galilean has conquered. And, strange asit may seem, beer has been a steady companion of Christian ex-pansion.The watchword “Bibles and Beer” is applicable in a senseunsuspected by those who reproachfully coined it. When the Ro-man world power, the bulwark of Paganism, was demolished,the beer of the Teutons supplanted the Pagan wine. At first theodor of heathen festivals attached to the brew of Gambrinus. Butthe wary Church adopted it along with the holidays of the hea-thens, and it was brewed in the monasteries. And in the drinkingsongs of the Germans, pæans of Christ were substituted for thepæans of Wotan. The Salvation Army and the Protestant churchesseem to adhere to the same ecclesiastical policy; they both bawldevotional hymns to the rousing tunes of the convivial songs ofthe German student.The good monks of the Middle Ages served Bacchus andGambrinus with equal zeal. Chronicles tell of a hop garden nearthe monastery of Freising, in 768. The Swedish bishop and cel-ebrated chronicler, Olaf Magnus, remarked in 1502 that the winein the South and the beer in the North were steadily improving.The papal legate, Raimundus Lucullus, justified his cognomenby a rapturous tribute to the beer brewed in Hamburg. MartinLuther was a jolly good fellow. It goes without saying that hesanctioned beer.Of course, the beer we drink today is superior to the beer of theancient Germans. If Julian had drunk Pilsener, his poetic philippicagainst beer would have remained forever unwritten. He sufferedhis life long from indigestion. His temper in consequence wassplenetic. He lost his empire because his temper ran away withhim. Beer would have saved both his empire and his temper. IfHamlet had been acquainted with Würzburger, pessimism wouldnot have enthralled him. His family skeleton would not have rattledthrough five weary acts of Shakespeare. We might have had acomedy of Hamlet.BEER is the lubricant in the wheels of history. Its salutaryeffect on the digestion has been established by the ImperialGerman Board of Health. And long before the German Empirehad been founded, a shrewd New Testament character advised ayoung Apostle to indulge in mild alcoholic beverages for his weakstomach’s sake and his often infirmities. Alcohol exercises a rec-ognized function in the religious ceremonies of all civilized na-tions. The Mohammedans, who substitute constant sexual stimu-lation for temporary alcoholic excitement, have lagged behind inthe race of the world’s evolution. If teetotalism ever vanquishestemperance in the United States, we shall present a spectaclemore saddening than Turkey.I have never been able to understand why so many parsonsseem to be anxious to controvert the first miracle of the Lord. IfChrist had been a teetotaler, he would not have changed the wa-ter into wine even at his mother’s request. He would have turnedthe wine into sarsaparilla. I am not a Christian minister, but Iwould not dare dilute with ineffectual words the miraculous wineof Cana.An American teetotaler has recently drawn an interesting com-parison between the American and continental method of receiv-ing guests. We, he fondly points out, salute our visitors by urgingupon them the necessity of lavatory procedures. “Do you want towash your hands?” the American host solicitously inquires. Thecontinental host, however, welcomes his guests with an honestlibation. The point is well taken, and illustrates the superior man-ners of the civilized European. Why should he insult his guestsby impugning their cleanliness? Let me inform the writer, in casehe should be again tempted to travel abroad, that the continentalhost expects his guests to wash their hands before they come tohis house. May he profit by this information!What should we offer a guest but the aromatic blood of thehop, or the sparkling gold of the grape? If we were Oriental des-pots, we might add to these a beautiful slave girl. The laws of theland and economic considerations unfortunately compel us to dis-pense with these affecting tokens of appreciation and friendship.Shall they also bar wine? Libations have been poured whereverfriends have met since the days of Homer. The wisdom of theEast, and the traditions of our Teutonic sires, both emphasize thephilosophy of drink. The soul, as Leibnitz has said, is a housewithout windows. The lock of the door is incrusted with Care.Self-consciousness, with seven-iron bands, barricades the en-trance. Alcohol is the magic key that unlocks the door. Compara-tive strangers are transfigured and gladdened by the magic offriendship when it has spoken its Sesame. Irksome barriers, whichnormally only years of close communion could have shattered,are obliterated for the time being. The soul, escaping from itscage for a little while, sings and soars like a bird.PEOPLE on the continent, especially Germans, take theirdrinks with refinement. They drink as they live — æsthetically.We neither live nor drink in beauty. We spend large amounts ofmoney on drinking. But the subtleties of the Bacchic ceremonialescape us. We are novices in the service of the good godGambrinus. That is the reason why our waiters despise us. Youmust have noticed the supercilious servility and condescendingsmile of the French or the German waiter when you give himyour order. He looks down upon us as Barbarians.The German thrives on the light glass of beer or wine with hismeals; whiskey he abhors. We are killed off daily and hourly inGAMBRINUS AND BACCHUS"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"314314THE INTERNATIONALthe dairy restaurants. We shall never have an American art whilewe subsist largely on icewater. The plutocratic few are well pro-vided in clubs and expensive eating-places. The average Ameri-can depends for his lunch on the dairy. Saloons are often uncom-fortable and obnoxious. What we need is Childs’ with the addedinspiration of spirits. In Germany, you find such places every-where. The most famous chain of restaurants is Aschinger’s, asort of inspired Childs’.Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his brochure entitled The Gullet ofBerlin, avers that every second house in the German metropolisis a place where alcohol in some form is vended. Yet drunken-ness is almost unknown. That is because people refrain, as a rule,from strong liquor. I am not one of those who would bar evenliquor. There are times when it is both safe and delightful to takea cordial. But — a cordial isn’t a drink. It is a stimulant, and,taken in excess, a poison. Until he can imprint indelibly upon ourbrains the difference between a drink and a stimulant, let us keepour hands from the whiskey flagon. Who, by the way, is the godof Cognac?We have the deplorable tendency to vulgarize things. Wecheapen literature in magazines. The Sunday Supplement is thedegradation of art. We degrade marriage and love in the court-room. And we make drinking abominable through vulgar andinjudicious excesses. We are like the early Christians who de-throned the gods of the Pagans and made them monstrous andwicked. Jupiter was anathematized as a devil. Mercury was lookedupon as a thief. Phœbus Apollo became an evil sorcerer, Cupidan imp of hell, and the mother of Cupid —The obscure Venus of the hollow hill,The thing transformed that was the Cytherean,With lips that lost their Grecian laugh divine. . . .But the woe of the ancient gods was not ended. It remained tothe New World to contort the loveliness of Bacchus and the be-nign smile of Gambrinus into the hideous grimace of the DemonRum.GERMANY, as I have said, is the mother of moderation. Wecan learn from her, but we can learn more from Denmark.The Germans are naturally moderate. The Danes incline to drunk-enness. And we, I am afraid, are more like Danes than Germans.There is a certain instability in our national temperament thatwill no doubt disappear when the fusion of races has producedthe American type.The Danish brewing industry is of recent growth. In 1840, onlyone hundred and fourteen persons, all in all, were engaged in thebusiness, including the workmen. In those days Demon Rum heldundisputed sway over Denmark. The Danes were drowned inliquor. Their bodies, soaked with rum, withstood the teeth of cor-ruption in the grave. It was dangerous to strike a match in thepropinquity of one of Hamlet’s compatriots. Perhaps the plight ofthe Danish people and of their neighbors, the Swedes, has beenresponsible for the safety match. I am, however, not prepared tomake an affidavit on this.At any rate, about 1870, the temperance wave struck the littlekingdom. The leaders of the movement discerned with rare sa-gacity that intemperance could be fought only with a light alco-holic beverage. They talked to the brewers, and the brewers talkedto each other. After some scratching of heads, they finally pro-duced a light beer pleasant to the taste, containing a small per-centage of alcohol. Later on the State took a hand in the matter bylevying a heavy tax on all beers containing more than 2!/4 percent. of alcohol by weight. Beer with only 2!/4 per cent. of alcoholwas not taxed at all. The consequence was that all breweriesopened up plants for the production of temperance beer.One-half of all the beer produced in Denmark is temperancebeer. They speak of this beer as “non-alcoholic.” Avowed advo-cates of temperance relish it. It is kept on tap in every saloon. Ifyou go to Denmark, by all means try “non-alcoholic” Pilsenerand “non-alcoholic” Muenchener. The Danish brewer is forbid-den by law to brew beer with over six per cent. alcohol. Beer hasalmost entirely supplanted rum in Denmark. It is beer alone thathas saved Denmark and Sweden from toppling to drunkards’graves. If I were a painter, I would depict Temperance with a jugof foaming Pilsener bearing the legend: “In this sign thou shaltconquer.”Denmark, too, has a few extremists who clamor for the totalelimination of alcohol. They have established model saloons,where a drink called “Sinalco,” or “Liquorless,” is vended. Withheroic determination I tasted this sickening concoction. The inn-keeper, a retired officer of the army, looked at me half in pity, halfin scorn. “Do you drink this horrid stuff?” I queried. “Yes,” hereplied; “in fact, ‘Sinalco’ is excellent — with an admixture ofwhiskey.” That, it seems to me, is an amusing illustration of thefailure of absolute prohibition.It was Münsterberg who recently knocked the bottom out ofthe prohibition argument. He restated for the New World the ex-perience of the Old when he affirmed that the human systemabsolutely needs a stimulus of some kind. If we abolish alcohol,sexual and other irregularities will take its place. The anti-liquorpeople were foaming at the mouth. Münsterberg’s arguments couldnot be shaken nor his authority questioned.The professional prohibitionists remind me of the exorcists ofolden days. The people came to them to drive out devils. Thetribes of magicians and medicine men waxed fat and happy, untilhumanity discovered that there were no devils at all, and that, atany rate, they could not be driven out. The antagonists of temper-ance in the prohibition camp have humbugged the Americanpeople by their pretense of driving out Old Nick, when lo, Pro-fessor Münsterberg lifted the veil from their sham, and we dis-covered that alcohol was not a devil.Meanwhile Demon Rum throve and flourished, until he hascome to be really a menace. You can fight wildfire effectuallyonly with fire. You can fight liquor only with beer. But, of course,had the Demon been properly subjugated, the officials of the Anti-Saloon League would have been out of a job. It’s a mighty dan-gerous thing to oppose an enemy by mercenaries whose exist-ence depends on keeping that enemy alive!They are very clever, these Anti-Saloon Leaguers. But whenthey’re up against an honest man, they don’t understand. Theyinvented a pretty little trap for the Harvard professor. Throughthree different literary agencies they swamped him with flatter-ing offers from an alleged group of brewers who were very anx-ious indeed to have him write an article on the advantage of drink-ing beer — “Money no object.” The professor dropped the mis-sives into his waste-paper basket.Let those who favor total abstinence follow the lead of the newInternational Association. Let them investigate coolly and calmly.Meanwhile let us profit by the experience of Europe. Triumphantlyon an ocean of beer the Ship of Temperance reaches its destinedhaven"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"315315THE INTERNATIONALI have four reasons for objecting to the Campaign of Hate. (1)I mention the first only to earn a sneer. It is this: By hating wedamage ourselves. We undo our progress from the savage statetoward the brotherhood of man.Also, we fool ourselves by regarding our brothers as mon-sters. Consul Litton, in his explorations of the Upper SalwinValley, found most hearty welcome in every village on his jour-ney north. Yet in every village the elders warned him that hecould not go on, because the people of the next village werenot, like his informants, quiet, peaceable, civilized folk, butthieves and murderers, with a specialty in poisoned bamboos,pitfalls and spring traps. They were also cannibals. What asseshate and ignorance make of man!(2) The Campaign of Hate, in the second place, has upseteverybody’s nerves. To conduct war properly, one must be calmand business-like. “Now could I drink hot blood and do suchbitter business as the day would quake to look on” is quite un-necessary in the conferences of a Great General Staff. The manwho loses his temper in a fight will probably lose the fight.(3) The Campaign of Hate, in the third place, involved theCampaign of Lies. We are thoroughly muddled mentally, in con-sequence. In the same issue of the same paper we learn fromGeneral Maurice that Germany is beaten to a standstill; fromGeneral Pershing that America is up against a much biggerproposition than any of the Allies, and from others that there isno food in Germany; that England has no more ships; thatCadorna is thundering at the gates of Vienna; that VonHindenburg is on his way to Petrograd, et cetera ad nauseam,until we have absolutely no idea what is happening, and there-fore no idea what ought to be done. In England the lie about themillion-odd Russian troops in Flanders stopped recruiting; sodid the lie that the Germans were such cowards that they darednot advance except behind a shield of old Belgian women; sodid the lie that Liège was holding out. If Germany is starvingand on the point of revolution, why should we send troops? Hate,and fear, and falsehood, are the worst heart-tenants in any hu-man necessity, but worst especially in war. The man who facesthe facts in cold blood, who kills out all emotion, is the manwho gives the best chance to the Will to Conquer.(4) The fourth reason concerns the future. The Campaign ofHate makes it very difficult for us to come back to CommonSense. President Wilson has emphasized this point again andagain in his notes. We are not fighting the German people, oreven their rulers; we are attempting to break their Political Will.Von Bernhardi explained long ago that this was the true objectof any war. Once we break the enemy’s Political Will, peacefollows naturally, and we can all be friends again. But how canwe be friends with monsters, assassins, Huns? The press, withHamlet, “must, like a whore, unpack its heart with words, andfall a-cursing like a very drab, a scullion.” What contemptiblemoral weakness! Could not the President have gone one stepfurther, and asked the newspapers to refrain from epilepsy?But it is only the public who are thus intoxicated with thehashish of hate. The rulers are busy measuring real advantages.I think the time has come to summarize the situation, and topropose a solution. The weakness of the Pope’s note was thatits appeal was sentimental.The real enemies in this war are England and Germany.America may be eliminated, for she, by her own showing,wants no material advantages.France can be eliminated by the restoration of Alsace andLorraine. Let us give her so much, for the sake of a little quiet,and proceed.Russia has eliminated herself, for her Political Will has beenbroken by revolution.Belgium, Servia and Roumania have been eliminated by de-struction.We may then say that the obstacle to peace is single, the con-flict of the two unbroken Political Wills of England and Ger-many.How may this conflict be composed? Firstly, one of the twomay be broken. But the objection to this solution is that which-ever won would be at once confronted by a new set of opposingwills. Neither France nor America could tolerate a completeEnglish victory any more than a complete German victory. Thedefeat of England would throw open the competition for themastery of the sea; that of Germany would leave England intol-erably powerful.Now, it must be observed that at present England and Ger-many are both heavy winners. Surely it is sensible for them tohave “cold feet” and break up the game! “Peace without vic-tory” sounds awfully silly to a victorious people. From a slaveState it is the natural whine, and sounds much better than “VaeVictis.” England has lost nothing so far but a few ships andmen; on the other hand, she is in possession of four-fifths of theterritory of the German Empire!Germany has lost ships and men, no integral territory; andshe is in possession of immense tracts of conquered country.Why, then, do not England and Germany call it off, shakehands, and go out for a drink? Where is the essence of the con-flict? What is it that England cannot endure? There are twovital points: one, the mastery of the seas; two, the control of theroute to India. Germany is threatening both these, by (1) thesubmarine campaign and her naval program; (2) the advance toAsia, the Drang nach Osten. Germany, on the other hand, can-not possibly endure the complete cutting off of her commerce,the grip of the “Ring of Iron.” Is it possible to come to terms onthese points? I think so. Both parties are absolutely right; for itis life or death in both cases.I think that Germany’s need of expansion can be satisfied,and the iron ring broken once for all, by an agreement on thepart of England to allow her the fullest development, by annex-ation, in Germanized Russia. The change is, in addition, aboutthe only hope for Russia herself. Non-Germanized Russia mightbe made stronger and smaller under a Cossack Tsar. We have,then, the conception of a Mittel-Europa from the Rhine to theUral Mountains. In return for this, Germany should withdrawher threat to England’s naval supremacy by permitting a recon-stituted and strengthened France, to include Belgium, and pos-sibly by offering Heligoland as a naval base to England.

Germany would also agreeto a limitation of her fleet; in fact, she would no longer needthis weapon.The only possible access to India save by sea is through Af-ghanistan and Beloochistan. The idea of invasion through thePamirs is a joke at least fifty times as funny as that of invadingAustria through the Trentino. England must, therefore, be al-lowed to defend herself by expansion towards Persia if neces-sary. The Turkish Empire must be reconstituted and consoli-dated on a religious basis, and united under a Caliph. This willact as a big buffer state between India and Mittel-Europa. TheTurks, on the other hand, must abandon Palestine to the En-glish, for the weak spot in England’s communications wouldthen be the Suez Canal. This, however, would not be so vital,once India became impregnable.A matter of further benefit would be the federation of theSouth American republics, and a Latin league of France, Spain,Portugal and Italy. The outlying States, Scandinavia, Holland,Switzerland and Greece would gradually be forced into one orother of the great combinations by the peaceful pressure of eco-nomic forces.It is true that Germany, under this scheme, would be forcedto surrender her South American and African ambitions. Butthe South American adventures were mainly commercial, andthe proposed scheme would rather help than hinder them. As tothe German colonies, they were a weakness.

What does it all matter, whenlove is gone? And who can hold love? Oh, misery! misery!And still so many years to live. To live alone. Or would hecome back? Could he come back? Oh — if only for a littlewhile! Oh, to see him just once more — his dark face, hisblack eyes, to smell his tobacco breath, to feel the grasp of hisstrong hand. . . . One o’clock — no — he would not comeback. This time all was over for ever — she felt it, she knewit. But perhaps to-morrow? He might regret — repent — hemight come for breakfast, like the last time. Oh! jolly, happy,divine breakfast! No, no, never again. His love was dead. Sheknew it. And would he love some other woman? Would hiseyes burn into another’s eyes, his kisses crush another’s mouth!God — God — this was hell. She could not bear it. She wouldnot. She must make an end — now — immediately.With feverish hands she felt for a tiny Japanese dagger heonce had given her. It must end her agony ——Yet — he might come to-morrow!HELEN WOLJESKA.THE SILENT PARTNER.Since childhood she had been with me, disturbing my peace,mocking at content, filling me with wild restlessness, withstrange longings.I grew up. I knew love. . . . Did I know love? She shook herhead derisively. She laughed at his reverential tenderness. Shemade mock of the sanctuary of our affection. It was then I roseup against her! I thrust her out of my life for ever. And, to besure she never would return, I chained her with an iron will,deep, deep, into the darkest dungeon of my heart — so deep, sodark, that I never dared to look into it again.The years passed. I lived a life of quiet, peaceful happiness— wifehood, motherhood — I quite forgot the silent partnerwho lay fettered and twisted, far from sunlight and life andlove. . . . Perhaps she had died?One magnificent autumn day, ablaze with gold and scarletand lapislazuli, the fulness of life suddenly thrilled me, over-powered me. . . . Oh! all that had gone before seemed so drab,so poor, so meaningless. I heard a call insistent, throbbing, irre-sistible. And I followed, intoxicated, delirious — I became queenin a universe of passionate glories.And then, of a sudden, my silent partner stood before me —wan, tortured, perverted. She had broken her chains. She hadarisen terribly. Flame-eyed and insatiable, she drove me fromorgy to orgy. And in the fulness of my frenzy — she slew me.HELEN WOLJESKA.———NOCTURNE.A yellow satin ribbon across the mat ivory of her frail shoul-der held up the tattered batiste chemise.

The first two acts are thrilling, but the last sceneof the third act is a trifle absurd. Though possibly true to life, itis not true to art. However, with a little rewriting, “De LuxeAnnie” can be made theatrically a real success. It belongs to thesame category as “The Thirteenth Chair,” though technically itis inferior. In spite of its flaws we must admit that the playenthralls nine-tenths of the time. This is more than we can sayof nine-tenths of the plays now running on Broadway.***I saw “Friend Martha” at the Booth Theatre last night. Therewas a lot of early William IV stuff; the old ancestor’s picturethat slides and admits the hero by a secret passage, and theindignant father, and all that sort of elopement drivel. But whatkilled the play is the characteristic Americanism, the theme of“mother-love” (excuse my blushes). Let us write a warning uponits tomb. Freud’s theory is apparently something as follows: Inthe prenatal stage of existence there is complete peace. (Do notignorantly compare this with Nibbana!) All wants are satisfiedwithout struggle or anxiety. At birth the child is forced into astrange and possibly hostile universe, and the cry which accom-panies the first entrance of the air into the lungs is supposed tobe a cry of pain. As a matter of fact, I see no evidence that painis felt. However, the want soon asserts itself, and this is as-suaged by the return to the mother. The child thus learns to runto its mother in any distress, and this habit persists to a greatextent during life. Death itself, the final release from pain, isgained by a return to the great mother of all — the earth. Thehero, on the contrary, spends his time in getting away from themother. Thus, the Oedipus-complex is the formula of coward-ice. It is evident that the man who marries in order to have ahome is using this formula. He wants his pies made the waymother used to make them. But it does not follow that chastityin the ordinary sense of the term is necessary for the hero. Whyshould not the hero accept death (or love, as you may call it), inorder to assist him to break away from the infernal mother? I donot see anything unmanly in the marriage by capture. Of course,one may say that it is the satisfaction of a need by means of areturn to a symbolic mother, and that the hero should only sat-isfy such needs as do not involve any such formula. But as longas it is a case of conquest I do not think that this position can bemaintained. One might, however, agree that it is wrong to yieldto seduction; that one should have nothing to do with any womenbut the unwilling. There is a great deal to be said for this pointof view. Certainly at least, the habit of going to a woman forrest and comfort has a deplorable effect upon the soul. Mostcertainly in point of fact and experience, it is impossible to workunless you can conquer the impulse to wear carpet slippers af-ter a long day at the office. It is really a question of Nietzche’s“Be Hard, My Brethren.” Thus, Platonic love, in the highestand hardest sense of the word, is more moral than any otherform of affection. It is clear, therefore, that pacifism is the di-rect result of the cult of the mother. Everything that is shamefuland cowardly is implied in the love of the mother. One of themost abominable tricks which people play on children is to tellQUELQUE CHOSE (SOME SHOWS)them that unless they do exactly what their mother wishes theywill be assailed by life-long regret after she is dead. This loath-some superstition is utterly false. I think that the best reformwould be to kill all women as soon as they have borne, say, twochildren. It should at least be a plank in any reasonable plat-form of reconstruction. Whether they should be eaten is a mat-ter of economics and of dietetics, somewhat beyond the scopeof a mere theatrical notice.***Adolf Bolm’s Ballets-Intime is sublimated vaudeville; as such,it is great. Itow is a Japanese dancing in a Japanese manner;Bolm, himself a Russian, dancing in a Russian manner.Roshanara is an English woman with a French temperament,and there is no pretense of Orientalism in her Oriental dances,which therefore please. She does them in a purely Parisianmanner. But Ratan Devi tries to sing Indian songs in a trulyIndian manner, and her mimicry succeeds so well that she re-ally finds self-expression by dint of technical excellence. Alas!it is not the soul of India that she expresses; it is the suburbanhousemaid with a passion for the Bow Bells Novelettes. Shetranslates Marie Corelli into Sanskrit for us, and the result isintensely gratifyingly to lovers of Marie Corelli. It is only fair tosay that the conditions were all wrong for her. Last year, whenthe whole theatre was devoted to her alone, the effect was muchbetter. Mr. Bolm put her on a mat, outside the curtain, and nodoubt she felt forced to adopt a coarseness and theatricalism invoice and gesture which were exquisitely absent at her regularrecitals. But give me Roshanara, and give me Mitchio Itow!Real French or real Japanese — but not any imitations. TheAmerican Supers who assisted Mr. Bolm were doubtless ama-teurs who paid him highly for the privilege of appearing withhim: we except the very charming Butterfly.***Scientifically speaking, there is a great deal to be said infavor of Mr. William Le Baron’s ideas on eugenic marriages asexpressed in his last play, “The Very Idea.” This delightful com-edy, however, does not take itself too seriously. You will notcome away a firm believer in eugenics, but you will feel verymuch like that enthusiastic Frenchman who shouted down fromthe pit on the opening performance of “Le Misanthrope”: Cour-age, Moliere! That is good comedy.Unfortunately for the theatre in this country, we hear verylittle of the author. The name of the star is written across thesky in electric letters. The name of the author, if mentioned atall, appears in six-point type “somewhere in the program.”Therefore we will leave it to others to praise Ernest Truex’snotable work in “The Very Idea.” Our chief concern is to boostMr. William Le Baron, for when a man has done good work thatis the time you must stand by him. (Of course this will be dis-puted.) George Jean Nathan recently stated that there were someother things beside the “Star-Spangled Banner” which makehim stand up. We arise to honor any American who can write sobrilliant a play as “The Very Idea.”J. B. R."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"318318THE INTERNATIONALTHE GATE OFKNOWLEDGE“Philistine and Genius,” by Dr. Boris Sidis. Boston: RichardG. Badger.This essay on education appears certain to become a classic.With extraordinary acumen Prof. Sidis discovers the primary causeof all our evils to be the violation of the biological law whichprovides for variation. Variation is the means of evolution. Ourwhole educational system is directed to stamping out every de-parture from type. What we really do is to place the most stupid,the most bound, the most cowardly, upon a pedestal. Procrustesis our ideal educator. We cramp genius, we punish originality, westifle inquiry, we place our children in Rooms of Little Ease wherethey can neither stand, sit nor lie with comfort. Our sex taboo,our religious taboo, our social taboo are omnipotent. We deliber-ately crush out all originality by these three engines of torture.Prof. Sidis does not mention it, but one of the reasons whysuch genius as we have is so enormously removed from the com-mon level is that the genius, in order to develop at all, must beoriginally endowed with almost superhuman moral strength. Thegap between him whose spirit has not been broken and him inwhom “education” has been a success grows constantly widerwith the perfection of our methods for suppressing him. It is quitetrue, as Prof. Sidis says, that every child has latent genius. Thedoctrine of the New Aeon is “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law,” which is explained by stating that, “Everyman and every woman is a star.” The trouble arises from theforcing of these stars into collisions by the distortion of their or-bits.The business of the educator is to discover the true will of thechild, the purpose for which he was born upon this planet, and toassist him to develop that will to the highest possible point; toremove the restrictions from that will so far as possible. Ourpresent method is the precise contrary of this. No sooner does achild manifest tendency towards and capacity for any given in-vestigation than the teacher takes alarm. It is the old fable of the“Ugly Duckling.”We hope that Prof. Sidis will not rest upon his oars. — A. C.———“The Shadow Line,” by Joseph Conrad. (Doubleday, Page &Co.)The plot of this novel is identical with that of Lord Dunsany’s“Poor Old Bill.” The difference is that between the realist andthe fantastic. It is very instructive to read them side by side. Jo-seph Conrad is the greatest master of atmosphere now living, sofar at least as the East is concerned. In fact, I do not know even animmortal shade who can compare with him.Rudyard Kipling gives the violence, the coarseness and thehorror, which are very effective from the literary point of view,but which do not exist in the East, so far as I know.Stevenson, on the other hand, has everything toned down. Hethrows a Scotch mist over the proceedings. Conrad describes theEast, both subjective and objective, in precisely the same termsas I should do if I had his power of expression. There is no needto tell the story of the book; any story or no story would have donejust as well. He takes me back ten years to my long lonely walkacross China, to the explosive casuality of Hai-Phong, to the FataMorgana which I saw off Hoi-How, to the Akashic obsession ofsilence and darkness and stillness which closed in upon us inthose very waters which he describes in “The Shadow Line.”Even the captain’s woman is a living portrait of one whom I knewin those ensorcelled days, a tuberculous hag of paint and rotten-ness and vice, who yet possessed the power to awaken the veryfountain of calf-love from its frozen sleep. It is very interesting tocompare Conrad with Stevenson. Stevenson is never happy un-less he has the decks awash with blood and slime. Mr. Conrad isone of those rarest and most supreme of artists who does not needincident in order to be interesting. He does not fear to use it, buthe does not depend upon it. It is rather significant that Englandshould have had to go to Hungary for her supreme prose artist. —A. C.———“What Every Man and Woman Should Know About theBible,” by Sidney C. Tapp.In 1904 I was in a particularly malarious district in Burma.Death drove his cruisers at a gallop, four abreast: Plague, Chol-era, Typhoid, Dysentery.I remember going down to the bank of the Irrawaddy in thehope of some breath of fresh air — and I came upon the carcassof a mule, most actively putrescent. I made a mental note to avoidthe repetition of any such experience, but history repeats itself; Iwrote to Mr. Tapp for a copy of his book.Surely our civilization is pestilential enough without the pu-trescence of such degenerate paranoiacs. Mr. Tapp wallows inpsychopathy, and gloats; to him the most innocent pleasures seemfoul, and a cemetery excites no idea in his mind but the digging-up of corpses for the delectation of necrophiles.I leave for the Irrawaddy basin by the first steamer.

Yet, people sit downand offer the use of their brains and hands (whichare, after all, more important than offices anddrawing rooms) to any stray intelligence that maybe wandering about. People use the Ouija Boardwithout taking the slightest precautions.The establishment of the identity of a spirit byordinary methods is a very difficult problem, butthe majority of people who play at Occultism donot even worry about this. They get something,and it does not seem to matter what! Every inan-ity, every stupidity, every piece of rubbish, is takennot only at its face value, but at an utterly exag-gerated value. The most appallingly bad poetrywill pass for Shelley, if only its authentication bethat of the planchette! There is, however, a goodway of using this instrument to get what you want,and that is to perform the whole operation in aconsecrated circle, so that undesirable aliens can-not interfere with it. You should then employ theproper magical invocation in order to get intoyour circle just the one spirit that you want. It iscomparatively easy to do this.

E. V.“The A∴ A∴ is an Occult order having a definite purpose,and was started by a man of immense power (The MasterTherion, Ed.), perhaps the greatest living. The place of this greatBeing in the Occult Hierarchy is a profound mystery, and heand his mission are causing a great amount of speculation at thepresent time.“Judged by any ordinary standard, he is absolutely and en-tirely evil, he has broken his occult vows and all codes of mo-rality, openly stating that he has done so and will continue to doso. He may have a very great purpose in view.“No living person perhaps has had such an influence on oc-cult thought, and wrought so much change therein. He has know-ingly taken upon himself a tremendous Karma, but what will bethe ultimate result it is impossible to judge. To all appearance,as I remarked, he is the personification of evil.”Later, during private conversation, Mr. Lazenby continued:“He is a very wonderful being; an ordinary man like myselfhas no possible means of judging what his ultimate motive is.“Looked at from known standards he is evil, but from a dis-tance, in perspective, one may imagine that he is taking thisgreat Karma for some definite end, he may be the Savior of theWorld.“In any case 300 years from now he will be looked upon asone of the greatest of the World’s geniuses.“I should not care to have any part in his work myself. Youhave this to remember, however, that you are connected with agenuine Occult order, not a pseudo-occult one such as Heindel’sand others which are worthless.”What has the Master Therion to say about this?C. S. J.Mr. Lazenby has so long and so laudably labored upon theproduction of canned soup that he has neglected that of the wineof Iacchus. But I think he only needs to be shown. It is some-thing to be hailed as a possible Savior of the World by one’savowed and bitter enemies. Nunc dimittis! Anyhow, to be calledthe “Personification of Evil” is not exactly a precise charge. If Iwished to attack Mr. Lazenby, I should define my accusation. Ishould say that, under Alpine conditions, the Lentil Soup Squaresdissolve too slowly.I believe that H. P. Blavatsky was a great adept. I judge herby her highest, “The Voice of the Silence,” not by any mistakesthat she may have made in other matters. I consider that herwork has been treacherously ruined by Mrs. Besant, the streetcorner atheist, socialist, and advocate of abortion. Of this of-fense she was actually convicted. Mrs. Besant’s whole objectseems to have been to prevent disciples from making those boldexperiments which open the gates of the higher planes. I do notbelieve that any man or woman can come to ultimate harm by apassionate will to seek truth. They may go insane. They may beslain. They may be damned. These are only ordeals which dothem good. If they can stick it out, they will get through. Mrs.Besant wants to be like conscience, to make cowards of us all.In my first initiation I was told, “Fear is failure. Be thou there-fore without fear, for in the heart of the coward virtue abidethnot. Thou hast known me; pass thou on.” To prevent men fromconfronting the unknown, to side track them with petty drivelabout minor ethics, to deck them out with the stolen regalia oforders of whose secrets they are profoundly ignorant: these arethe works of the Brothers of the Left Hand Path; and of these Ibelieve Mrs. Besant to be the greatest now alive.THERION, 9°=2o A∴ A∴THE INTERNATIONAL FORUM———Students of the Occult should pos-sess the following books:THE EQUINOXNos. 1 to 10The only standard work of reference onoccult subjects.
