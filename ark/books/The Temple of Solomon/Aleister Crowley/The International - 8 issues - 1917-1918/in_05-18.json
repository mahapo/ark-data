KEASBEY“I knowThe past, and thence I will essay to gleanA warning for the future, so that manMay profit by his errors and deriveExperience from his folly.” — SHELLEY.THE editorship and control of THE INTERNATIONAL have passedover into our hands; the policy of the magazine will remainthe same. THE INTERNATIONAL has been, is now, and for sometime shall be (just how long depends upon our success, or per-haps better, our ability to survive) — AN AMERICAN MAGA-ZINE OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, LITERATURE, ART,AND EVENTS OF CURRENT INTEREST — a magazine ed-ited formerly by an established poet, a magazine to be edited inthe future by a dismissed professor. Established poets are few,dismissed professors are many — they’re becoming as plentifulas blackberries these days. So if there is anything in the quanti-tative theory, we ought to be able to survive. But it’s qualitychiefly that counts. So we are going to rest our case (and mea-sure our success maybe) upon the qualitative standard. For whenall is said, civilization itself, including politics, literature, art,events of current interest and all the rest, is nothing more norless than the measurement of human qualities in quantitativeterms.———BUT international politics are so hopelessly confused. Howcan such equivocal qualities be measured in quantitativeterms? The old standards are all obsolete. Nor is one able torise “above the battle” and take a bird’s-eye view of the exist-ing situation — aviators succeed in doing so, but philosophersare sure to fail. With a lateral stretch of our imagination, maywe not, however, look out over the battle lines and project our-selves into the era beyond the war? Such at all events is oureditorial desire and such is to be our editorial plan — to pro-duce an American magazine dealing with international politicsbeyond the war.———TO Literature and Art we are going to add Music and theDrama. They are already included, be it said, as a perusal ofrecent issues will show; so this is merely a matter of emphasis.The keynote of our policy in these respects is contained inour caption: An American Magazine of International Literatureand Art. American art and literature are far more insular thaninternational. We propose to emphasize the continental note,not in the narrower European connotation, but in the broaderworld-all acceptation of the term. Anglo-Saxonism is very well,in its way, but there ought to be other notes sounded in theliterary and artistic scale, the Slavic and Romanic, the Scandi-navian and Teutonic, the Asiatic, and even the African withal.These and other elements are included within our literary andartistic constitution, therefore they should find expression, weopine. But as in international politics, so in literature and art,American continentalism will constitute the keynote of ourpolicy, not North American continentalism exclusively, but Pan-American continentalism, including the art and literature of ourSpanish-American colleagues on the south.———CONCERNING events of current interest, the question comesup as to what these events actually are. Americans aremostly from Missouri, or as the New England phrase goes: “Dotell; I want to know!” Events of current interest are accordinglysimply what the newspapers elect to record. Very good, but theseevents so recorded are only consequences after all, whereas we,as scientists, are primarily interested in the antecedents thereof— remember THE INTERNATIONAL is to be edited henceforth by adismissed professor. Thus our policy in this respect will be ratherto explain than simply to set forth. This we shall do by callingattention scientifically to the geographic and ethnic conditionsand considering the economic antecedents of the interestingevents that occur.———TO our original announcement, published in the April issue,we added a few words to the following effect: Our trinity isdistorted, topsy-turvy, indeed. With so much falsehood, all thisugliness, and hate, too, prevailing in the world, we are going totry — and we hope you will help us — to set our trinity upright,by telling the truth, appreciating beauty, and stimulating love inthe world. Now we are asked to enlarge upon this idea. Ouranswer is: the May issue of THE INTERNATIONAL. In this issue wehave endeavored to do what we could toward restoring our over-turned trinity. You’ll find nothing of hate therein, no ugliness,and of falsehood, not even an inkling. On the contrary, what wesay ourselves seems to us at least to be true; our contributorshave added beauty, you’ll admit; while amongst us all and to-ward our readers the spirit of love prevails.THE EDITOR AND HIS ASSOCIATES.OUR POLICY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918130130WHO are those haggard hostsGroping the roads of earth — unburied ghosts —Pale youth and tottering age, a spectral throngBy some invisible Master lured along?They grope in every land,Drawn ever onward by some dread command;And in their shadow, ever at their side,The wraiths of all their hopes and dreams that died —Phantoms that fling wild laughters and wild tearsInto the crater of the wasted years.And evermore behind them as they grope,Three crosses loom upon life’s barren slope —Three crosses, side by side,Where Honor and Love and Truth are crucified.What is this Thing that scatters blight and ban,This stealthy Demon that unmakes a man?What gives to dust of poppy and coca leafThe power to build unreckonable grief?What curse is on this dust?What terrible “Thou must?”What spirit builds this inframundane spell,This fleeting heaven in the heart of hell?Behold their eyes in burnt-out sockets glareWith glazed and frenzied stare.Their bones are torture and their blood is fire,Their will all withered to a fierce desire —The hunger for a flame that feeds a flame,And hurls red conflagration through the frame.Ever they grope, and ever the Demon criesInto their ear the music of his lies.He whispers, “I am rapture, rest from pain;I brace the body and I light the brain.”“SLAVES OF THE DRUG”BY EDWIN MARKHAMAuthor of “The Man with the Hoe and Other Poems”And so he builds illusion into his slaves,Hiding from them his skeletons and graves.He lulls one grief, a thousand wake from sleep;He stills one ache, a thousand palsies creep!Behold his bargainings: for life’s bright bloom,He gives the bitter ashes of the tomb;For strength, he gives a crumbling rope of sand;For honor, gives dishonor’s scarlet brand.He whispers peace, but gives eternal thirst;He builds bright visions filled with fangs accursed.He comes with feasting and a king’s salute,But leaves black tables of the Dead Sea fruit.He offers realms, but gives a prison cell;He pledges heaven, but brings the booth of hell.For Beauty’s gesture and her look of light,For starry reason and for manly might,He gives the skulking step, the furtive eye,The curse, the groan, the death that cannot die.O brothers of the sorrows,O brothers of the terrible to-morrows,O captives blasted by the charnel breath,Your names are written in the Book of Death.Yet brothers of the gray battalions, wait . . .Resolve: you still are greater than your fate.You still can win the same, sweet dream of old,Regain your soul’s lost hold.Strong are the shackles — strong — yet stronger stillIs the grim grapple of the awakened Will.O brothers, in that mightSlumbers a power to shatter death and night.O brothers, in your Will a god awaits,A god with power to bend eternal Fates!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL131131THE MOBILIZATION OF AMERICANDEMOCRACYHE problem before us is the mobilization of democracy in America. But mobilization of itself is not enough;when mobilized, our American democracy must be made social and productive, productive in character andsocial in spirit. Only under such conditions, the conditions of productive social democracy, can American de-mocracy expect to succeed.There are only two kinds of States: oligarchies and democracies, as Aristotle told us so many centuries ago.In oligarchies the few rule because they possess the wealth — landed wealth or monied wealth, as the case maybe. In democracies the many rule, because they possess the capacity, we say; but this is a fallacy. In order to ruleeffectively, the many also must control the wealth, either severally, as in the old-fashioned individual democracies, or jointly, as inthe up-to-date social democracies of to-day.When it comes to war and peace, oligarchies are on one side, democracies on the other. Oligarchies as disposed to be aggressive,since the few have interests to subserve: landed interests under the aristocratic oligarchies of old, monied interests under theplutocratic oligarchies of our day. Democracies, on the other hand, are inclined to be conciliatory, provided, of course, they areconceded sufficient space within which to expand. This is the case because democracy implies the power of the people and thepeople are inherently opposed to war, though they will fight to a finish if defense is involved.BETWEEN oligarchy and democracy there is another distinction even more fundamental than the above. Oligarchies areexploitative, democracies are productive. In either of these ways — exploitation or production — wealth can be acquired, butonly through production can wealth be secured, owing to the operation of an inexorable law: Exploitation allows inefficiency andtends toward diminishing returns; production requires efficiency and makes for increasing returns. To be sure, some oligarchiesare both efficient and productive, but I have never heard of a democracy that was both inefficient and exploitative, have you?Evidently exploitation is the quicker of the two processes, suited to the sudden success of the few; whereas production appears tobe the slower of the two procedures, adapted to the normal development of the many.WITH these three distinctions in mind I ask you to visualize the existing situation, in a series of antitheses, so to say: betweenexploitation and production, oligarchy and democracy, war and peace. On the one side are the privilege-seeking, war-ragingoligarchs, out for exploitation on every hand; on the other side are the liberty-loving, peace-desirous democrats, endeavoring tobecome productive in every way.BECAUSE individual in spirit and competitive in character, democracy in America has not been so productive as it should.Another reason is: we have relied less upon our inherent capacities and more upon our natural resources. To speak of democ-racy in Europe is anachronism, you say; not so. Democracy is not only prevalent in Europe, but far more productive than democracyin America. Because European democracy is social in spirit, cooperative in character and, for these very reasons, efficient withal.Which goes far toward explaining what is otherwise incomprehensible, that outworn Europe should still be able to compete withvirgin America.BUT all this is altering under the inexorable logic of economic events. To the extent that American democracy is becomingcooperative in character and social in spirit, to just such extent is democracy in America becoming productively efficient andpeacefully inclined. There are signs of this everywhere and all around; you have only to rise above, or delve below, the disturbedsurface hopefully to appreciate and clearly to understand. To make the world safe for this sort of a democracy, social in spirit,cooperative in character, productive in capacity, and peaceful in purpose — this is indeed an ideal, an ideal well worthy of us andone which we Americans should whole-heartedly and efficiently strive to fulfill.LINDLEY M. KEASBEY."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918132132AS Aline Wentworth paused in the entrance of the PinkParrot cabaret a sudden faintness assailed her, but itwas less a physical than a spiritual nausea which, for a mo-ment, turned her giddy with a shrinking distaste for the gar-ish riot of noise and scent and color which swept out at heras from the humus of a tropical furnace.Despite the hastily formed resolution in obedience to theurging of which she now found herself in this most free andeasy of all unconventional resorts, she stood a moment un-certainly as the whirling kaleidoscope of dancers gyrated pasther in sensual abandon of pose — of bacchic revel — flushedfaces, painted lips, leering eyes — all seeming to focus uponher in a common invitation of suggestive intrigue.As she, standing as it were upon the brink of this languor-ous, steep wave of sound and motion, with a sudden harden-ing of impulse moved off in the direction of the cloak-room,eyes greeted her with that passionate, unresting query whichis the symbol of the Masque — a male dervish, leaving for amoment the unceasing revel, accosted her with the carelessease of a faun questing, as of right, for Daphne, Chloe, Ama-ryllis — Phyrne — it was all one. But his speech was of theargot of his environment:“Y’ look good t’ me, kiddo,” he said.Through the slits in his domino his eyes burned with awastrel invitation; mingling with Aline’s as yet uncertainmood, he seemed a falcon, hooded and doubtless jessed, too,beneath the modern equivalent for sandals, with spurs of thesatyr.But she passed him with a little, tremulous rush.In this most unconventional of all unconventional resorts,as I have said, the Domino was at once the symbol and theunalterable rule. Aline was wearing a frock, simple yet suaveas the sheathing of a many-petalled flower, out of which, asshe submitted to the ministrations of the negro maid, hershoulders rose in a sheer perfection of satiny firmness.As she adjusted the black velvet mask her thoughts — hersensations merged in a dizzy whirl of retrospect and antici-pation. She recalled the parting kiss of her husband, and thenthe unsuspected telephone message from his brother and part-ner, Stacy Wentworth, that Henry was leaving that afternoonfor Pittsburgh. “Henry” — “Pittsburgh” — there was noth-ing in the sound of either of that romance which, it appeared,had been so cavalierly denied her during the short span oftheir married existence. A parting kiss it had been, as unsus-pected, however, as had been the message. She recalled hersudden resolve to see for herself this life — this deviouscurrent of bright shallows and obscure undercurrents whoseedges only had she before observed from the safe shelter ofher husband’s protection.It had been from her husband indeed that she had firstheard of the Pink Parrot; doubtless in his convivial days ithad been known to him. But now — of course . . .She made a slight grimace of disgust, or perhaps it wasthe beginning of a smile born from the depths of a conscious-ness that in her blood there ran a fiery current — a subtleleaven which even now, to her mingled alarm and yet some-THE RAGGED EDGEBY HAMILTON CRAIGIEhow satisfaction — appeared to urge her forward into thatmaelstrom whose eddies even now brought to her rising pulsea strange, barbaric rhythm in some way oddly familiar.She was, she told herself, excellently well disguised. Herfrock was a new one which even her husband had never seen;her domino would baffle the most searching inventory of hercharms; like many another, she felt herself secure — armoredagainst the world for whatever of adventure the evening mightdisclose.Curiously, too, with the final adjustment of her mask therecame upon her an odd lightness of spirit — almost an excita-tion — an insurgence of some dormant strain of irrespon-sible gaiety, so that, with a last slight shiver of departingprudence, or prudery — have it as you will — she plungedinto the eddying vortex of the dance, which in a boiling cho-rus of song, of high-pitched talk, and of frenzied laughter,closed in about her like a garment of brilliant texture, hardas steel, yet woven of what tenuous fabric who will say?For a space, breathless and drifting with the ebb-tide oftable-seekers at the close of the number, the new-found flameof her anticipation might have flickered and died with thealmost physical oppression of close contact with the swirl-ing crowd when a hand on her arm, steadying her against theonslaught of an impetuous couple, guided her to a seat at atable somewhat removed from the press. A voice which shedid not recognize murmured in her ear:“Allow me”, it said, and with the words she seated herselfmechanically and as mechanically observed her vis-a-vis ashe gazed at her in silence through the holes in his domino,leaning forward in his chair as if waiting for her to begin.In her swift inventory there was little in his appearancewhich she might have used as a basis for a more than hap-hazard appraisal. And yet — she was convinced — there wasnothing of the satyr about him, nothing, surely, of the faunwhose crude invitation she had but lately repulsed.A domino will mask a voice as well as a face, yet, as shecontinued silent, and he began to speak, she was immedi-ately aware both of his youth and of his breading — thatintangible something which, for lack of a better name, wehave called savoir faire.If, beneath his suave exterior there lurked the sybarite, itwas not apparent in his accent, smooth, finished, and to herfamiliar only because he spoke in the language to which shewas accustomed.She did not know him — of that she was quite carelesslycertain, so, when he said, with a grave inclination of the head:“Will you join me in a cocktail — er — Miss . . .” shenodded brightly, and as if her murmured assent had materi-alized him out of the confusion of sound and light, there ap-peared at her elbow an elderly waiter, who, having takentheir order, departed even as, for one brief instant, her men-tal reflexes had almost urged her from her chair in a suddenrealization of her position. Actually, she had not moved by ahair’s-breadth.“You’ve not been here before to-night”, remarked her com-panion, in low tones in which there was less a question than"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL133133a statement of fact.“N-no,” she murmured, in reply. Something somewhere inher brain raced furiously — she was conscious of a half-formed resolution to escape before the waiter could returnwith their order. Somehow, for a brief space, as it seemed,the drinking of that cocktail would be to her a symbol — asign — a pledge of forgetfulness which she was half-mindedto forego ere it was too late. But even as she hesitated uponthe brink of departure the servitor again was at her elbow,within her fingers was the slender stem of the glass — withveiled lids she sipped — then sipped again — and as thepotent magic of the mixture penetrated her veins somethingwithin her snapped with the sharp sweetness of an almostphysical pain.It was not that she had never before tasted of these aro-matic concoctions, but any one of a number of causes con-spired to fire the madness in her blood as with the secretflame of a barbaric rite.The music, beating with its sharp insistence of a staccatomeasure, weaving strange patterns of many-colored sound— the talk — the laughter — the lights now seemed lessunreal and shadowy than that hearth which she had left but ashort hour ago.She leaned forward to her companion in a sudden accessof confidence. At that moment, for one swift, fleeting sec-ond, it was as if she was re-enacting a pose — apart — as if,from somewhere in a dim, distant past, was resurrected for abrief interval a personality fusing, in an insidious liaison,with that soul and with that body of hers known and yet un-known to her to be Aline Wentworth.Her veins throbbed — burned with a curious, sudden de-sire — of what she knew not — and yet this physical excita-tion was not born of the stimulus of the cocktail. Atavism —race-heritage — call it what you will — perhaps the obscureleaven of her desires — similar to that secret wish so shame-lessly exposed in dreams — was now fixed in a sudden, un-controllable emotion of sex-perception. But conventionality,even in the Pink Parrot, must have its innings.“You — you — don’t think me forward — you know I’mnot — I’m not . . .” she said, and hesitated.For the first time the eyes of her companion embraced herwith a smouldering hint of passion. She felt his glance uponher shoulders, lingering like a caress upon their swellingsheerness of beauty. I say she felt his glances with a physicalperception of their quality, and it is perhaps significant ofher reaction to the strange and sudden mood that was uponher that she did not shrink — did not employ that uncon-scious feminine shielding of sex either by look or movementwhich at any other time would have been as instinctive asinvoluntary.But she leaned forward with a provocative invitation, inher pose a challenge of which she was quite well aware, asthe voice of her vis-a-vis came slowly:“You — you beauty,” he said throatily, in his glance a lookof understanding which sent the blood in a swift rosy surgeacross her face and shoulders. Small drops of moisture, likea faint dew of desire, spread in a mist above her daringdecolleté as, their fourth cocktail having been served, theyrose, in mutual consent, as the sensuous melody of the musicheralded the dance.She came to him with a little, swaying motion, like a lilyupon its stem, and as they whirled off to the rapid, inchoaterhythm of the stringed orchestra she felt his grasp tightenabout her, and for a moment, in a delicious faintness, suf-fered him to guide her — to envelop her with the keen pas-sion of his skill as they were swept onward in what now wasbeginning to assume the unrestraint of a Bacchanalian revel.His voice murmured in her ear:“Are you happy?” it said, with a faint undercurrent of some-thing which she could not quite comprehend.“Yes — yes” she replied, and then, with the slightest mea-sure of meaning in her tone: “Almost . . . with you.”She raised her head from its position on his shoulder, andthey exchanged a long look — a look before which the barri-ers of caste, of breeding, of self-restraint went down in theswift disintegration of that ruthless fire in whose white-hotflame are fused the elemental passions of love and hate. Butas she looked she became aware, with a certain strange feel-ing of unease — why, she could not have told — that, wherehis mouth smiled at her beneath the disguise of his domino,appeared a rent in the smooth velvet — almost a ragged edge— a ravelling of the cloth which to her mounting imagina-tion gave to his smooth lips almost the quality of a sneer.Abruptly, unreasonably, she was conscious of a wish tosee the face of her partner — an almost ungovernable im-pulse prompted her to snatch away this troublesome incog-nito which, in her present wayward mood, she might easilyhave done.Added to her obsession, the potent power of the liquor shehad drunk showed in that further disintegration of speechwhich is the seal of Bacchus for his devotees.As they returned to their table she said, with a certain slightroughening of tone — the merest gloze, as it were, to thedelicate cadence of her voice:“What — what name shall I call you — Partner?”The man regarded her for a moment with a curiously level,passionless look. It was as if for a moment a personality otherthan the one which he had shown during their brief inter-course peered out of his eyes in a cold, even a daunting re-gard.Then, abruptly, into his gaze there came the same sugges-tion of an ardent fire as he said:“Call me Launcelot, an it please you, Princess.”“That is not your real name,” said the girl, unsteadily. “Iwant your real name — yours — and I’ll give you — I’ll giveyou — mine — in exchange for it — tell me,” she urged.A faint shadow passed over the man’s face as, with anappearance of casualness to which she was blind:“Why — er — ‘Wentworth’ — d’you like it?” he said.A sharp intake of her breath stung her throat with suddensuffocation; her fingers, holding her glass, trembled slightly,as, startled out of her increasing recklessness of spirits, sheleaned forward in her chair, gazing almost with an appear-ance of fright at her companion.“Your — your last name?” she faltered. A breathless sus-picion had fastened upon her — a frightful suspense for themoment constricted her throat, so that she spoke with diffi-culty. “Could it be — was it possible?” she thought, her veinslike ice, and then flushed as with a bath of fire.Something in his manner — something forgotten and yet"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918134134half recalled added poignancy to her unease, and yet, shetold herself, it could not be — it must not.Half hysterically she compared the man: his height — theshape of his head — his hands — his voice — with certainother specifications which in her memory were, she knew,indelibly fixed. Then, nevertheless in a fever of doubt, de-spite her self-assurance that every characteristic of a certainfamiliar personality was indeed to her the most common de-nominator of her most certain knowledge, she waited, breath-less, for his answer.But in her companion’s face was reflected nothing of heragitation as he said, with a slow smile and a slightly jocularair:“My first — in this incarnation — at your service;‘Wentworth Darrel,’” he said, easily. “Now, then — yourown . . . ?”“Aline Fortesque” she lied promptly, with a sudden returnto her former feverish gaiety. “Do you like — Aline?”“Like her?” he said, bending forward sharply, his eyesbright with something other than the effect of his potations.“I — love her.”A misty smile usurped the transient pallor of her face. Thecumulative effect of many drinks, added to the shock fromwhich she was but just recovering, operated as a last effec-tive breach in the thin armor of her reserve. She swayed to-ward him uncertainly.“You — you may — if you like . . . love her,” she said,scarcely above a whisper.Around them at that moment the liberty which was thekeynote of the night-life of the Pink Parrot was fast degener-ating into license. Casting a bemused glance about her, Alinesaw that which, at any other time, would have filled her witha shuddering distaste, but now . . .At a table on their right an elderly Bacchus with the goatishcountenance of a satyr was shamelessly kissing the pinkshoulders of his companion with an abandon which wasmatched by the quite obvious love-making of a couple at theirrear. Young girls walked to and fro between the tables with alicentious calmness of pose which somehow fired her imagi-nation with a perverse desire to emulate their sang-froid ofsuggestion. And over all the music — sharp, staccato, fever-ish — beat time to the madness in her blood so that withdifficulty she restrained an impulse to dance before the as-semblage even as now danced the Hula-girl before them, slim,suggestive of potential amour, with bare bosom and limbscontorted in a frenzy of pictured passion.Her companion leaned closer, laying his hand upon herbare shoulder with a proprietory air.“It is the dance of desire, Sweetheart,” he said.She turned to him a face, beautiful, flushed, reckless withthat last final abandon than which, in a woman, there is nosurrender more complete.“Do you really wish to know who I am?” she breathed.And at his murmured response against her ear, said, with anowlish solemnity which struggled against her faint, franticlaughter:“You — you spoke of ‘incarnations’ — well — I’ll tellyou — secret — Phyrne — Sappho — all of ’em — I’m theincarnation of all of ’em . . . but I can be true . . . to . . .”She paused uncertainly in the act of raising to her lips herhalf-drained glass. Around her the lights revolved in a cor-uscating, fiery maze, out of which, as from some dim, dis-tant avenue, appeared the face of her companion, the raggededge of his domino lifting . . . lifting, so that she was con-scious once more of a renewed desire to see his face, to touchit — to — to — kiss it, perhaps . . .In the midst of this whirlwind of sound and motion shefelt herself lifted; as in a strange dream — a fantasm of un-reality — she somehow walked or was carried up . . . up . . .interminably, as it seemed, upon a winding stair. Then,abruptly, she was facing an open door, and once more lights,but this time, dim, subdued.Then, by some odd reflex of her consciousness, for a mo-ment she stood, swaying giddily, but with her blurred visionfor a space restored to something less than normal.Before her stood her companion of the evening, silent andstrangely inscrutable as to his eyes, glowing, one might havethought, behind the impersonal barrier of his mask, with thecold gleam of an executioner or of a resurrected familiar ofthat Inquisition of dreadful memory.Quickly, so quickly that he could not forestall her motion,on an impulse, even as his arms closed about her bare shoul-ders in a tightening embrace, she darted forward a clutchinghand — grasped — and with one sharp jerk tore from itsfastening the velvet mask, its ragged edge ripping into thinshreds and tatters, even as reputations shrivel and die in thehot flame of passion.But at what she saw a death-like grayness overspread herface — she tottered — a sharp sigh issued from her throat,and with a choking moan she lapsed into unconsciousness.After an interval, whether of seconds or of days she couldnot have told, she awoke with difficulty. There was an acridtaste upon her tongue — she was conscious of a feverishthirst which caused her to drink avidly of the water at herlips. But, as, her thirst temporarily assuaged, she gazed up-ward at the face above her, a shriek burst from the perfectcolumn of her throat — again she nearly swooned as the bit-ter realization of her plight struck her like a blow.But the face which gazed into hers was no less haggardthan her own. The ashes — the dregs of his swift, suddenpassion had drained his cheeks to a pasty grayness; the fin-gers which offered her now the sobering libation of a purercup trembled no less than his lips as he said, hoarsely:“Aline — thank God — there is yet time.”The woman raised herself painfully from the couch whereonshe had been resting, in her face an odd mixture of disgust,comprehension, and, scarcely understandable to her compan-ion, a dawning something in her face which somehow, evenat this moment, gave to her expression the sincerity almostof a new birth.“You — my — my — brother!” was all she said.At the pregnant monosyllable her companion wincedslightly; then he said, with a mixture of eagerness and em-barrassment:“Well — your — brother-in-law,” he amended. “I — Ithought —” he hesitated.

KEASBEYOURS is an age of self-made men and man-made insti-tutions. Imagine an ancient arrogating to himself hisown creation, or a mediævalist attempting to reconstructsociety! Yet such is the presumption of our individual mor-alists and the social uplifters of our day. Having modifiedthemselves they would make over humanity, — and me-chanically, mind you, in accordance with standardized ide-als. What a strange state of conventional complacency! Fromthe religious point of view it is certainly sacrilegious, fromthe scientific standpoint obviously absurd, — yet when eco-nomically interpreted very easily explained. You have onlyto fasten your attention upon the factors of production andfollow their succession historically, — from the NaturalState, through the Proprietary Period, to this the Commer-cial Era, or capitalistic age.Of the three factors of production — land, labor, and capi-tal — two are inherited and one is acquired. Then again,labor is naturally, while land is legally inherited; whereascapital is conventionally acquired. Apply these distinctionsto the course of human development, the existing situation,with all its conventional complacency, becomes compara-tively clear.In the Natural State labor was the productive factor thatprevailed, because land was still free and capital non-exis-tent as yet. Now labor connotes personal power, muscularand mental combined, which is naturally inherited, so sci-ence assures us; but, being no eugenists, the ancients re-garded personal capacity as a gift of the gods. A self-mademan forsooth! God made man in his own image, — imaginea Homeric hero arrogating to himself his own creation! Inthose olden days strong men derived their strength, and wisemen acquired their wisdom, altogether from the gods, fromwhom they were directly descended, and with whom theywere intimately associated. Therefore the ancients respectedtheir personal capacities, and regarded the results of theirlabors with religious awe. And even as human capabilitieswere god-given, so also were earthly institutions divinelyordained. Man-made institutions indeed! Imagine Mosesintroducing the Decalogue as a reform bill before the House!In these ancient days wise men were instructed to incul-cate, strong men were called upon to execute, the commandsof their gods. Therefore, in the Natural State, terrestrialinstitutions seemed to be celestially established, and hu-man society appeared as a reflex of the heavenly hierar-chy.During the Proprietory Period land became the produc-tive factor that prevailed, — as appropriation proceeded,through conquest and conversion, on the part of the war-riors and priests. Now land is the source of physical power,mechanical or generative as the case may be, both of whichhave long since become legally inheritable. But, being nojurists, the original appropriators regarded their real prop-erty as a benefice conferred, — in first instance by the Al-mighty, — “God,” said King David the Psalmist, “has giventhe earth to the children of men.” Not in fee simple, to besure, but as a trust estate to such of them as showed specialcapacity; for upon these his chosen creatures, strong menand wise men, God conferred authority to occupy and ad-minister the earth. Not in their own right, or even in theirown interests, however; but as surrogates, so to say, or vice-regents of the Almighty, in behalf of their subjects andcharges, the children of men. So it was in the beginning,but is not now, and never shall be again; because, as appro-priation proceeded, inheritance was inaugurated, and suc-cession ensued. Consequently, in the course of a few gen-erations, the heirs and successors of the original appropria-tors ceased to consider themselves simply as beneficiaries,and came to regard themselves as actual owners, — or pro-prietors in their own right, the titles to their real estateinhering henceforth, either in their feudal families, or elsein the ecclesiastical corporations to which they belonged.Whereupon real property interposed itself between God andhis children, estates were established, and landlordism be-gan to prevail. Strong men and wise men were now no longeressential; since, secure in their possessions, weaklings andfools could prevail. Nor was it necessary that terrestrialinstitutions should in the future be celestially supervised;since the State, which comprised the confederacy of feudalfamilies, and the Church, which included the hierarchy ofecclesiastical corporations, henceforth secured their sup-port from the earth beneath, instead of from the heavensabove as heretofore. So it came to pass during theProprietory Period that land-established institutions becameprevalent and real estate men ruled supreme.In the course of the Commercial Era capital has come tobe the productive factor that prevails, — to the extent thatoccupations are differentiated, markets are organized, andmoney is accepted as a medium of exchange. Now capitalconstitutes commercial power, selling power on the one side,purchasing power on the other side of exchange. Neither ofthese commercial powers descended from the heavensabove; since God himself gainsaid; for it is written in theScriptures: Christ “cast out all them that sold and bought inthe temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-chang-ers and the seats of those that sold doves.” Nor were eitherof these commercial powers derived from the earth beneath,because the proprietors thereof were opposed; for it is re-lated in history that the ecclesiastics condemned usury, andthat the aristocrats stigmatized trade. But if neither de-scended from the heavens above nor derived from the earthbeneath, whence then did selling power and purchasingpower proceed? From the Exchange System, I should say,which was established in between by the outcasts fromheaven, and extended round about by the disinherited ofthe earth.But to such establishment and extension of the exchangesystem both the Church and the State stood opposed. Thusthe outcasts were deprived of direct resort to heaven andthe disinherited were excluded from immediate access tothe earth. Therefore, in the face of such restrictions, they— the outcasts and disinherited who bought and sold onthe market place — saw fit to protest. So it came to a ques-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918140140tion of the Commons on one side over against the LordsSpiritual and the Lords Temporal on the other. The latter,including the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the feudal con-federacy, had not only received sanction from heaven, butalso inherited the earth. For the former, comprising the com-mercial classes, there was nothing for it, therefore, but toopen up independent connections with the Almighty, andcome to some agreement among themselves, — to providefor the differentiation of occupations, the organization ofthe market, and the circulation of money, so that capital inthe future could be conventionally acquired. To these endsindividual initiative, religious tolerance, free trade, andcontractual relations were required, all of which reformsthe Protestants peremptorily insisted upon. Thus the thirdestate, composed of self-made men, arose and ranged itselfin opposition to the other two, which were God-ordainedand land-established besides. Then, to the extent that suchopposition was successful, God-ordained and land-estab-lished institutions gave way; and, in the course of the Com-mercial Era, self-made men and man-made institutions cameproportionally to prevail.All of this is intelligible so far as self-made men andman-made institutions are concerned; but how is our con-ventional complacency to be explained? By success, I shouldsay; for it is defeat, according to Emerson, that educatesthe man. Our captains of industry conceive of themselvesas self-made men; as a matter of fact they are market-mademen, who owe their success in sooth, not so much to theirown initiative, as they do to the exigencies of exchange. Soit is also with our conventionalized institutions. We regardour government as a man-made democracy; as a matter offact it is a money-made democracy, which owes its successin sooth, not so much to contractual relations, as it does tothe contingencies of exchange. Whether it be hypocrisy, orfaulty reflection on our part, is altogether immaterial. Mar-ket-made men in the midst of money-made institutions, weconceive of ourselves as self-made men in the midst of man-made institutions. So situated, we arrogate to ourselves ourown creation, whereas in reality we are the creatures ofexchange; thus environed we pride ourselves upon our con-tractual relations, whereas actually they also are the prod-ucts of exchange. Hence our state of conventional compla-cency, arising from the fact that we take credit to ourselvesfor our individual and social achievements, which shouldbe attributed to the vicissitudes of exchange.But this conventional complacency of ours is becomingunstable, and, as I foresee things, a severe shock is in store.You have only to look back over the historical process; thepast relations between the three productive factors are al-ready revealed. In the Natural State labor showed itself suf-ficient, because land was still free and capital non-existentas yet; during the Proprietory Period free labor was sup-pressed, and appropriated land ruled supreme; in the courseof the Commercial Era capital has succeeded in assertingits ascendancy, not only over emancipated labor, but alsoover monopolized land. So you see, labor, land, and capitalhave run their respective courses, and each has ranged it-self successively in opposition to the other two. Such is thehistorical succession, which has given rise to present con-ditions, and produced our conventional complacency by theway. Now another alteration is evidently in order; in con-clusion, therefore, I shall ask you to look forward: the fu-ture relations between the three productive factors are aboutto be revealed.Exploitation on capital’s part has recently given rise to areaction, and another revolution is already under way, origi-nating in the organization of labor, proceeding thence to-ward the socialization of capital, and leading eventually tothe liberation of land. So far this revolution is only in itsinitial, or negative stage. Laborers are organizing industri-ally, to resist the exactions of capital, and agriculturallyalso, to oppose the restrictions of land. From such negativeaction it is only a short step to positive procedure, overagainst capitalism and landlordism on the proletariat’s part.This step taken, such positive procedure is likely to con-tinue, along the lines of industrial and agricultural co-op-eration, industrial co-operation accomplishing progressivelythe socialization of capital, agricultural co-operation lead-ing eventually to the liberation of land. Consequently, inthe future Social State, no one productive factor will pre-vail over the other two; because — through the organiza-tion of labor, the socialization of capital, and the liberationof land — all three productive factors will become co-op-eratively combined. Then you have only to ask yourselves:under such co-operative conditions whence will productivepower proceed? Not from the heavens above, as supposedlyin the Natural State; not from the earth beneath, as actuallyduring the Proprietory Period; nor yet altogether from theexchange system, which in the course of the CommercialEra has come to be established and extended, round aboutand in between. But if not from any of these separate sources— personal, physical, or commercial — whence, in the com-ing Social State, will productive power proceed? From thecommon centre, of course, around which land, labor, andcapital are going to be co-operatively combined.We are still a long way from this conclusion, I grant;but co-operation is proceeding and “coming events casttheir shadows before.” Already under the adumbrationsof socialism the effulgence of capitalism is becoming ob-scured. In the subdued light of public opinion one can catchthe reflection that the market projects toward successfulindividuals; under the pall of popular disapproval one candetect the glamour that money casts around our conven-tionalized affairs. Thus even at present, under perfunc-tory investigation, self-made men and man-made institu-tions are shown up as they actually are: market-made menexhibiting their false faces, money-made institutions ex-posing their seamy sides. And we have only arrived at theorganization of labor! As we proceed toward the social-ization of capital the shadows will be short-ended, as weapproach the liberation of land obliquity will be rectified,and the truth at last revealed: Human character at its bestand social systems in their fulfilment are the outcome ofco-operative procedure. There will be no shadows thenfor self-made men to stand in, conventional complacencywill be dissipated, and man-made institutions will be ex-posed to the full light of day. So when the Social Statearrives at its zenith co-operatively produced individualswill rule over the earth and socially established democra-cies prevail."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL141141JACK BIDDLE FROM NOWHEREBY FORD TARPLEYRENA had been standing on the porch when they passedwith him. Her mother said it was very immodest ofher and she remembered how others had looked surprised,but she did not care for when he saw her he had droppedhis head and shut his eyes: no one could know how thathad pleased her. She would have liked seeing him longerbut they had led him straight away to the little jail andshe had not dared to follow.The jail was a little wooden shack behind some trees onthe bank of the river nearly in front of where Rena lived.It was very old and seldom used except to confine for thenight occasional tramps and drunks — prisoners of a moreserious kind being cared for in Salem which was only tenmiles distant. Rena wondered why they were not takinghim there. She also wondered what his name was andwhere he was from — but all that she could find out inThe Eagle which had been delivered in the afternoon andvery soon she would go up to the house and read it. Nowthe house was full of people: they had been coming andgoing all day and she couldn’t bear meeting them. Shehad tried staying in her room but even when she coveredher head with cushions she could hear what they said andthey all said the same things over and over.Here in the orchard it was quiet. She sat in the longgrass beneath a fruit laden apple tree, and a book of po-ems lay in her lap. She had been trying to read them allafternoon — trying to occupy her thoughts and free her-self from the mad bewilderment into which the day hadplunged her . . .In front of the book was written: “To Rena from BertKern on her seventeenth birthday.” How many times thathad thrilled her. It was the first present from a boy thatshe had ever had. She remembered sleeping with it underher pillow and reading it the first thing every morning.That was several years ago and now she and Bert wereengaged to be married.She should have gone to Bert this morning and in someway expressed her appreciation for what he had done; forit was he who had caught the prisoner. But when he hadentered the dining room at breakfast time she had evadedeven his eyes; and it was then that she had gone to herroom.Bert thought he understood. He told her mother that heunderstood. And then he muttered: “Poor little girl — poorlittle girl.”And that is the first thing he said when he found her inthe orchard — “Poor little girl — poor little girl.” A faintsmile came to her lips as she arose to meet him. He drewnear her and laid his hands gently on her shoulders andlooked curiously into her eyes.“My little sweetheart, what Hell you have been through!And I can’t tell you how I have suffered too.”“Listen Bert, please don’t talk to me any more about it.Please — I ask you — please,” she said, gently breakingaway from him.“But Rena dearest, there are a few questions I must askyou — or rather, I want you to tell me things yourself. Weare engaged you know Rena, and you ought to be able totalk to me without minding. We must give the police cer-tain information. You have told us absolutely nothing andso far we only have Mr. Radcliffe’s report.”“What was that? What did he say?”“Only how he heard you screaming — and how half anhour later he found you on the bank of the creek cryingand that you had been assaulted by a drunken youth whohad made his escape. That’s all.”“Isn’t it enough?”“Not for me anyway, Rena. I ought to know at least.Where did you meet him? How did he approach you?”“I was walking in the woods just on the other side ofthe bridge and we met. He asked me the way to the road. Ididn’t know at first that he was drunk so I told him and hebegan talking about other things. Then he grabbed hold ofme.”“What happened then?”“I fainted.”“You remember no more?”“Hardly.”There was a long silence and then she said: “What doeshe say, Bert? Have they talked to him?”“He won’t say anything about it at all. He gave a namebut I suppose he just made it up.”“What was it?”“Jack Biddle. And he says he is nineteen. But we can’tfind out where he comes from. But the officers are comingover from Salem to-morrow morning and they will makehim talk. They couldn’t get away to-day — a pretty stateof affairs there. We sent over for help last night but couldget none.”“Poor Herb, how tired you must be! Why aren’t you homesleeping now?”“Rena! As if I could sleep! To have a thing like thathappen to the girl I love! Why nothing has ever come intomy life so horrible.”“Yes Bert, it is terrible, but now why worry about it.You have done every thing there is to do and it is best toforget such things.”“We are not worrying, Rena! We are simply taking thenecessary precautions. We have the fiend confined, andwe have got to do our best to keep him there. You knowhow old the jail is — anything might happen. It must beguarded night and day.”“Well, it is being guarded.”“Al is going off at nine and I am taking it.”“Silly!”“I can’t trust it to anyone else, and anyway I couldn’tsleep. You don’t know how upset I am.”“But what has happened? Is my life ruined? Am I anydifferent from what I was yesterday?”He gazed at her some moments dismayed and then thegreat pleading eyes overcame him. A sad smile appearedon his face and he took her in his arms."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918142142“My poor little sweetheart! Nothing could make you anydifferent. You are as pure as the flowers in the fields andthe words in the bible and you don’t understand. And Ilove you more for I know that you need me to look afteryou.”He kissed her many times on the cheek; and then sheraised her lips and kissed him.“Oh Rena you do love me don’t you?” he muttered. “Youdo, I know you do. You couldn’t kiss me that way if youdidn’t. If it were not for your kisses sometimes I shouldhardly know whether you loved me or not.”The gold had almost ceased struggling with the shad-ows in the long grass and among the heavy green branchesof the apple trees. It was after six o’clock. It was that hourbetween day and dusk of a glad summer’s afternoon. Herein the peace and quiet it was hard to realize the sordidfacts that had happened since the last setting of the sun,and in spite of them all, Herbert felt a thrill like a tremblepass through his soul. He loved. And here before him withwistful eyes staring into the distance was she whom heloved and she was his. Perhaps she was young and couldnot love as he, but the great confidence of his heart toldhim that he could expect no more and he felt that she waslearning. Were not those kisses of flame still warm uponhis lips? And could they be ought but real?“Rena, sweetheart,” he said after a long silence. “It isalmost time for supper.”“I was wondering, Bert, if father had not died, and Ihad gone back east to study music, what would have hap-pened to me.”“Tell me you are glad, little Rena, that you didn’t go. Itis comfortable here and pretty. Why should anyone wantto break out into a strange world? It will be like heavenwhen we have a little home of our own. Tell me you areglad.”She had taken his arm and they were strolling up to-wards the house.“I am glad,” she answered.———It was nearly midnight. Rena and her mother sat beforethe fire in the living room. Her mother was sewing. Shewas a wrinkled little old lady. One would have taken herrather for Rena’s grandmother. She had been many yearsan invalid.Rena was reading. She had finished the greater part ofa novel that evening. Finally she closed the book and putit on the table.“Mother, now see the time. You know that you shouldhave been in bed long ago. You must come immediately.”She spoke gently but with authority.“I shall wait up for you Rena. I don’t see why you can’tmake Herbert his coffee now. And there is no need of himhaving coffee anyway. Those sandwiches and a glass ofmilk would be all that he will want.“Yes, mother dear, I will make the coffee right away,but first I am going to take you up to bed.”“Rena, my poor little daughter!” said the mother withtears in her eyes as Rena was leading her upstairs.An hour later, Rena sat with Bert on the ground beneatha lantern about thirty feet from the little jail.The supper was finished. He turned and took her in hisarms.“Why did you come out here, little Sweetheart! It is muchtoo nice of you. But you shouldn’t have. I ought to scoldbut I can’t.”“I knew you would be lonely Bert. If you insisted upongoing on guard you should have had some other man withyou too so you could get a little sleep. This is the secondnight that you have been up.”“But you see how lucky I am after all. If anyone elsehad been here you wouldn’t have come. Anyway Rena Irested several hours this afternoon.”“Has he been quiet?”“Once he asked for a light and a magazine or a book,”Bert laughed.“What did you say to him?”“I told him he wasn’t stopping at a hotel.”“Is that all he has said?”“Yes.”“How quiet it is. The stars are all out. It is going to be anice day to-morrow.”“The moon ought to be up pretty soon.”“I like it best this way — just the black and stars. Let’sgo over by the river where we can see them in the water.”“We must stay here.”“He won’t do anything, Herb. He’s only a boy.”“You can’t tell. Anyway I feel easier here . . . Rena,rest your head upon my shoulder.”“Then lean back upon the moss of this log. It’s comfort-able and you must be tired, poor dear.”“I could never be anything but happy with you so near.”“I will stay right here until you go to sleep and then I’llbe watchman myself. Every few minutes I’ll walk aroundand see that every thing is all right. And I’ll call you if Ihear the least little noise.”“No sweetheart I don’t want to go to sleep.”She put her face against his and lay beside him. An owlhooted in the distance; there was the hushed, almost im-perceptible sound of the flowing river, and at times abreeze whispered among the trees. All else was silent.For half an hour or more Rena lay there and then qui-etly she arose.“Herb,” she whispered.He did not move.Hastily she glanced around her and then in a momentshe was at the door of the jail. It was held by bolts andbars and one lock. The key which was too large to put inone’s pocket was hanging tied to a stick by the lantern. Itwas not difficult to make an entrance but now that shehad begun she didn’t care whether Herbert awoke or not.She was determined and she would have her way.“Boy!” she called softly when she had penetrated intothe darkness. And then again: “Boy — Jack — are youasleep?”There was no answer. She stood motionless and silent,waiting to hear him breathe. But there was no sound. Whatif he were dead! Or if he had escaped another way! Shewas afraid. But he must be there. She wanted him there.She had never wanted anything so badly in all her life."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL143143She called him again — this time more loudly.

Thenhe unlocked the door and with the lantern went inside.“It was with the old hinge he did it. Rena!

We value whatthe ancestors expressed, because we can read at the sametime what they left unexpressed. I have no hesitation tosay that the poets who sing like Byron or that golden-tongued Tennyson are admirable; but the good modernpoets, no particular names mentioned, are unique at leaston account of their inability (ability perhaps) in singing.It takes much talent to describe the outward beauty, and,true to say, even some original gift to appreciate it; butyour real courage will be proved in your entire loss of de-sire of outward things. One can be taught by another howto see and understand the outward beauty, but there’shardly any guidance in the invisible matter, and you areyour own guide, alone in the world, in your change fromthe visible to the spiritual. It is easy to change your dressand hat according to the season and style; but the outsideattire, even the best kind, is of no avail for your spiritualchange. It is natural course to enter the invisible from thevisible, as you step into night from day; but you must letit come after having enough satisfaction of the outwardthings. The mellow perfection of the night only comes af-ter all the splendor of the sun.As for me, I have no strong love with the outward things,and always take a deep delight in the little inward world— the largest world perhaps — of my creation, and rarelysing the visible beauty. Is it because I am philosophical?Perhaps I am, without knowing it at all. Is it because I amsomewhat logical? Perhaps I am, although people (I in-cluded) do not notice it. One thing I can say with muchfaith is that it takes a great energy to gain an assertion,and a tireless persistence to be content with the invisiblethings. You must fully understand the beauty of life, ifyou want to see the beauty of death; and life will be morebeautiful from the reason of contrast with death. And death,again from the contrast with life, will be more tender inpathos, more subtle in rhythm. My song is always withthe falling leaves and the dying day.I am not ready to say such is the poetry of modern Japa-nese poets; it is so at least with some of them. And it is amost striking contrast with the material civilization ofpresent Japan, which was brought at once from the West;the West, strangely enough, sent us at the same time herspiritual literature under the arbitrary name of symbol-ism. Now, that symbolism is not a new thing at all; for us,it is a continuation, of course with much modification, ofour old thoughts and emotions. It is interesting to notethat it came here when we were much criticized as mate-rialists without capacity of understanding any spiritualbeauty. As somebody says, the real modern civilization ofJapan is nothing but the old civilization which has changedits form; and I say that the true new literature is, indeed,the old literature, baptized in a Western temple. We haveled, for a thousand years, our insular lives; we have beenmaterially poor (many thanks for that poverty), and thenwe found it quite easy to commune with our minds. As thereality was never so splendid, we were obliged to seeksatisfaction in dream; as we could not sing so well, welearned the art how to sing in silence, the art how to leaveunsung. Poetry was never a criticism of life in Japan, as itwas for one time in the West; but it was the words of ado-ration or love of nature and life. It is only the modern noteto make the most of literature and life; it is, I dare say,from the hidden desire to value the no-literature and deathmore than the literature and life themselves.We must not lose our insularity, although it needs astrength of consciousness; what we want is intensiveness,the art of distillation of our thought, which only comesfrom the true pride and real economy of force. Universal-ism is often a weakness itself. We do not need, in our Japa-nese literature, any long epic and song, because they aretouched more or less by pretension. Our song is a pottedtree of a thousand years’ growth; our song is a Japanesetea-house — four mats and a half in all — where we burnthe rarest incense which rises to the sky; our song is anopal with six colors that shine within.MY ATTITUDE TOWARDSTHE FLOWERSMY own attitude towards the flowers is the attitudeof the so-called flower-master, or, to speak moreexactly, that of the tea-master, because the former is nowtroubled by the theories which originally came to exist asa proof of adoration as if a dew from the burst of dawn.And the latter is the art of accident, though it may soundrather arbitrary, born from the proper setting. When I callthe flower-arrangement of the tea-master the natural, Imean to emphasize the point of formalism in those of theflower-master for which the word “decorative” is merelyan excuse. As you and I know well, the flowers are suffi-ciently decorative in nature without adding any emphasis;I think that “decorative” is one of those two or three wordswrongly used in the West when applied to our Japaneseart; and it is my own opinion that the true decorativenesswill never be gained in any art of East or West through thepoint of emphasis. The real decorativeness of, for instance,Korin or Hoitsu lies, at least to our Japanese mind, in theplace where he is least decorative or, let me say, most natu-ral; the word natural for the Japanese art is verily old andnew. Now to turn to my attitude in looking at the flowers.I aim it to be natural, because my mind ever so hates tomodify the beauty of the flowers; I dare say it is a new art(if I can call it so), not only to the West, but also to theEast, which I gained perhaps through my perfect forget-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL145145ting of the old Japanese flower art. When I cannot see theway how to explain myself, I always say: “I see the realnature in flowers.” If you say I admire the selection of theflowers, you are wrong, because I never select them as itmight appear to you; my chief value as a flower adorer, ormystery, if I have any, is how, and more important, where,to leave the flowers to sing their own quiet songs in alittle vase, bronze or China, upon the tokonoma.My mind astrays to the well-known story of Rikiu, thetea-master, of the sixteenth century, regarding the morn-ing-glory, which Taiko, the great prince, entreated him toshow him; it goes without saying that the morning-glorywas yet the rarest plant at that time. It is said that Rikiuhad put all the flowers, of course morning-glories, awayfrom the garden for the fine pebbles and white sand onthe appointed day, where Taiko, as you can imagine,walked most sulkily towards the tea-room, where the greattea-master prepared the morning tea for his lord. The lordat once questioned himself where the morning-glory Rikiupromised was planted; but lo! when he entered the room,just one single morning-glory most winsome and delicatelike a forgotten moonbeam, welcomed him from thetokonoma. Indeed, it was a great sacrifice for Rikiu to cutoff all the other morning-glories; but it was the heroic wayto give the one flower its full distinction. I think that theother flowers did not die in vain. So it is with my attitudetowards the flowers when I look at them; I do not see themass of them, and what I see in them, whether they be awillow or a branch of plums or the petals of lotus or thecrawl of morning-glory, is just a touch or hint of theirbeauty, and I object to seeing the rest of them. To call myown way suggestive often leads people to misunderstand-ing; if I have any artistic significance or merit in my atti-tude, it is my understanding of how to leave the space inthe picture, nay, the tokonoma where the vase for the flow-ers stands, or to speak more poetically, how to cover upthe space of that tokonoma with the most graceful noth-ing; therefore my tokonoma has no stupid vacancy. Youmight call it a Japanese art if you will; but I believe thatthe true art has no East or West as it is always born fromnowhere.THE EAST: THE WESTI LOOKED aside through the window where the young-green willow branches, to use a Japanese phrase, al-most smoked in uneasiness like the love-touched heart ofa girl, when our talk (nothing better than an informal talkon art and poetry to fill an hour of an April afternoon al-ready grown gold and slow) flagged; we three found a ha-ven from the city’s noise by a little table at the restaurantoff Ginza, the Boulevard of Tokyo. My friend-composerfinished his cup of tea, and took up again his talk wherehe had left off.“Once I made the late Mr. K., the well-recognized Japa-nese musician connected with the Kabukiza Theatre, lis-ten to the tune of Payne’s ‘Home, Sweet Home.’ What didhe say, do you suppose, when it was over? You are mis-taken to think his musical mind rightly responded whenhe appeared fallen in meditation; he said to my amaze-ment: ‘That was very grand.’ And he said further that hewould like to play it, for instance, at the scene first orlast, where many samurais in formal dress, sitting in per-fect order, were ready to speak their greeting of New Year’sDay to their lord just stepped out from within; indeed,that was what I never expected to hear. However, I wasamused to think it was another instance to prove how dif-ferently in music the Japanese mind, at least, the old Japa-nese mind, is pleased to work from the West; you can imag-ine how mystified he looked when I told him about thenature of tune I had played him.”This delightful talker looked upon me as if he wantedmy word of endorsement; my mind grew at once alive,being given an interesting subject even for serious con-sideration; and I said:“I had my own experiences not only once when I foundmyself in exactly the same situation as that Mr. K.; it wasin the earlier days of my American life, when my exoticJapanese mind was still far from being acclimatized inthe West. Once in New York, my American friend took meone evening to a certain Webber and Field to see the so-called artists in the ‘cake-walk’ — whether they werenegroes or whites I hardly remember now — that fantasticway of step on the stage most popular in those days. I knewthat I could not help laughing when I saw the players withstove-pipe hat red or blue, with ribboned huge cane inhand, leaping across the stage like vagarious spirits whohad dethroned themselves of their own free will; but oncewhen I closed my eyes to give my sense of hearing fullplay, what do you suppose? I confess that my tears strangelyfell without being called. My friend said sarcastically: ‘Isit a Japanese way to cry when you are jolly?’ When hemeant that we Japanese often act in the reverse, and gen-erally speaking, that we are paradoxical people by nature,I think that somehow he hit the right mark; but I dismissedthe whole thing without answering him, because it was aquestion too complicated to explain in one breath. And Iam sure that he would have asked me why, even if I hadtold him simply that the music merry to him sounded tome sadly.”“Dr. C., you know, the German professor at the MusicalCollege,” my friend-composer interrupted me, as, doubt-less, he wished to say something before he forgot it, “mostsavagely denies even to-day after twenty years’ residencehere our having any harmony in music; but the fact is thatour Japanese mind is most deliciously, tenderly, sadlymoved where the Western mind finds it most unsatisfac-tory. Listen to a samisen music (which is said in the Westto be nothing more than a noise wild or primitive at thebest) in a little lyrical tune, for instance, with the songwhich you (Yone Noguchi) translated:His haoriShe hid,His sleevesShe held.‘Must you go, my lord,’Says she.From the lattice windowShe slid"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918146146The shoji slight,And she cries:‘Don’t you see the snow?’“Our Japanese mind, I believe, through the hereditarysense of hearing which is suddenly awakened by the shrillof a ghost in tune of this samisen, the three-stringed in-strument, not wild to us, but suggestive, not primitive butquite complex, will soon become impassioned into imagi-nation; I dare say that we shall feel even a physical painfrom love that the tune inspires, the love intensified intoa feeling of sensuality. It is at such a moment when weforget the world and life, and pray to enshrine ourselvesin love; why is it the samisen does make us feel so, whilehaving no power at all to command the foreign mind?”“Not only in our sense of hearing” — I again resumedthe chance to speak — “the other senses, whether they befive or ten, also work quite differently from those of theWesterners; and I cannot forget one instance to make methink that the American sense of seeing is a thing of adifferent order; that was the case of Sada Yacco and hercompany when they presented to the San Francisco audi-ence, well, long ago, the sad scene of the farewell ofKusuoki and his little son. We thought it most strange whenthe saddest part to us Japanese made almost no impres-sion on the American mind; of course, their ignorance ofthe Japanese language counted a great deal; but when thesad facial expression of the Japanese players was taken asthat of violence or anger, we thought that the matter wasaltogether hopeless.”“Does not such misunderstanding of the East with theWest or the West with the East,” ventured my other friendat the table, “exist also in literature and poetry?”“I myself experienced as a writer in English that myown meaning or imagination was often wrongly taken; Ican say at least that I found frequently that they were notfully understood; although it might be true, as a certainEnglish critic commented on me the other day with hislearned authority that I relied too much upon the words,that is to say, that I attempted to make them express toomany colors and meanings. I dare say (is it my Orientalpride?) that the Western minds are not yet wide open toaccept our Japanese imagination and thoughts as they are.It is a short cut, I have often thought, to look in a book ofEnglish translations from the Japanese, when we want toknow the exact weakness of the English language and lit-erary mind. Last night, before I went to bed, I opened thepages of English translation of our hokkus, wherein thefollowing piece was declared to be the most delicate:Thought I, the fallen flowersAre returning to their branch;But lo! they are butterflies.“While I do not say that that is particularly poor, I neverthought before, like many another Japanese I am sure, itwas so good as a Japanese poem; if it means anything, itis the writer’s ingenuity perhaps in finding a simile; but Iwonder where is its poetical charm when it is expressedthus definitely. Definiteness is one of the English traits, Ibelieve; and again, it is the strength of the English lan-guage and letters, but it is strange enough that it turns atonce to weakness when applied to our Japanese thoughtsand fancies of indefiniteness. To call the Japanese lan-guage ungrammatical, the Japanese mind vague, does nojustice to them; their beauty is in their soaring out of thestate of definiteness. Sadness in English is quite anotherword from joy or beauty; it is very seldom that it expressesthe other; but more often in our Japanese poetry they arethe same thing; but with a different shade. ‘Sadness inbeauty or joy’ is a phrase created comparatively recentlyin the West; even when sadness is used with the other inone breath, it is not from our Japanese understanding; forus Japanese, the words never exist apart from our colorand meaning. Not only in language but also in real life’saction, is it so; it was the art of poetry of MonzaemonChikamatsu, the great Japanese dramatist, that he madethe cases of double tragedy of two unfortunate lovers (thismost favorite subject) most beautiful and joyous; for themit was a joy and beauty to go to death through love. Wehave a phrase: ‘We cry with our eyes, and smile in heart.’As we have no right expression, let us admit for a littlewhile the phrase ‘the paradoxical Japanese’; such a maintrait of the Japanese makes it difficult for the Western mindto understand us; and again it is why our poetry is a sealedbook in the West.”THE MOODSWE are revellers at the banquet of the moods underthe moon or forest; ask us not whether we are rightor wrong, happy or sad, sane or mad. I only know that mylife grows with the growing moods, and my literature withthe growing life; that’s quite enough. Let us sing, dance,and sing again; we may, in course of time, fight or theo-rize or assert or deny, as if a sad creature, only to makeafterward our song and dance doubly fresh and free.Thought is great, doubtless; but the moods are greater.Thought, when it comes into existence with no touch ofthe moods, can be, at its best, a still-born child; it maylook quite perfect, but, alas! it is dead. It was the life ofthe moods that created, in olden days, the gods and god-desses, and peopled the forest and stream; and it is thelife of our modern moods as artists to make a forest orstream turn to a mass of green and light on the canvas.The moods are everything; for the sake of the high soar ofmy moods, I ask the women, wine, music, flowers, andbirds to make their own sacrifices. It is from the moodsthat the clouds fly, and the rains fall. We need not attemptto restrain our moods, but should let them take their ownnatural course; when they are bad and worthless, they arebound to die, without waiting for your force to be used.And there is always hope and passion when they grow andlive; the things that grow and live are ever divine.FAITHTHE followers of Buddhism in the imperishable rai-ment of silence sit before the inextinguishable lampof Faith, by whose light (indeed, the light older than lifeand the world) they seek the road of emancipation.

Slonimsky, in “Dekorative Kunst,” says of Alastair:“Modern art expresses itself in two diametrically op-posed fashions: impressionistic painting on one hand, con-ventionalized design on the other — Manet and Beardsley— the realm of three dimensions vs. that of two. Alastairrepresents this latter principle most clearly among livingartists. He does not only continue Beardsley’s work, heintensifies it, and has a right upon the attention of everyart-lover.“The fundament of Alastair’s art lies in its characteris-tic flatness, which at once removes the shackles of an alltoo truthful realism, an all too evident corporeality, andallows us to drift into that fantastic world of two dimen-sions, in which alone these sultry and yet so weary crea-tures could have come to life. And as we revel in this newworld, we are charmed by Alastair’s linear melody, re-vealing pathos and lyricism and irony, and mirroring — inthe very abnormalities of his art — the foibles and sins ofall humanity. . . .”ARCOTT.ELENORA DUSEafterALASTAIRALASTAIRWE value a writer, an artist, a singer, for the emo-tions he arouses in us.

We have been walking about this town sinceseven-thirty this morning. There does not seem to be an un-occupied room in the whole district and I don’t know whatwe shall do.”The woman looked at the girl.“But what did you do last night?” she asked.Black eyes flashed beneath thick lashes tipped with gold,and a little smile broke around the girl’s red mouth.“He was in camp last night,” she said, “and I only arrivedon the boat this morning. You see —” She was about to makesome explanation and hesitated, looking at the man quickly.Then they both looked up at the woman a step above them,and the expression in her eyes drew them on.“The fact is,” said the soldier earnestly, “this young ladyand I are to be married to-day at two o’clock and to-morrowat noon my company leaves camp, we’re on our way, perhapsto France — we never know.”“Yes,” chimed in the girl, “and I got a wire from him downhome yesterday and I just had to come. I live with my fatherand he gave me the money to come along and say ‘Good-bye’to Bob; he’s known him since he was a baby, he said I’d beall right. And then I made up my mind we’d get marriedwhile I was here. I think it’s easier to wait when you ‘be-long,’ don’t you?”The woman on the doorstep smiled.“I don’t know,” she said, “I never belonged.”“But it looks as if she’d have to go back home this after-noon,” said the man. “I suppose you don’t know of anyoneabout here who would rent us a room under the circum-stances?”In the back of the woman’s mind hasty thoughts were flit-ting back and forth. She had an extra room and it contained acot. Her own room held a large bed and was a convenientroom with a pretty arrangement of furniture and leading to anicely-fitted bathroom. But she was not prepared to rentrooms and she had long before determined that such mar-riages as the couple before her contemplated were unwiseand inevitably unsuccessful. Moreover, she lived alone andwas considered by her relatives very selfish and there wasno reason on earth for putting herself to the inconvenience ofhousing a couple of total strangers, even for one night. Thethought of breakfast in the morning loomed up too, and shewondered suddenly if the boy liked eggs.And with all the reasons why she should not give in up-permost in her mind, she said:“I will make it possible for you to stay here to-night; I cando it with a little fixing. You’d better bring your things rightin.” And she held the door wide open, while he carried in thesuitcase and the bag.“It’s very kind of you Ma’am, I’m sure we appreciate yourtrouble,” he said a little stiffly.“Bob, it’s just darling of her!” cried the girl, “I surely neverwill forget it,” and as the woman looked at her she held outher little mesh wrist bag, “I feel like saying ‘Help yourself,’for Dad gave me twenty dollars when I left and yet I couldn’tbuy a room anywhere!”The soldier flushed to the roots of his hair.“You forget Ethel,” he said, “it’s my affair now, paying fora room!”“Oh, my!” said Ethel, “is it really, though!”The woman of the house smiled a little grimly to herself.Their levity scarcely became a pair, she thought, bent so soonupon the great adventure. But she saw the boy’s protectingglance and she caught the girl’s half sigh when the word “to-morrow” sounded, and she thought perhaps it was better theyshould be gay a little while before they parted.So she set about removing her belongings from the largeroom to the small and bade the strangers return as early asthey wished. They were going at once to seek their licenseand a friend from the camp who would be witness to theirwedding.The incident disturbed her strangely. She was thirty-fiveyears old and cynical as to a personal love affair. She livedserenely alone, fostering vague hopes of fame into an obses-sion whenever one of her morbid stories was accepted by aradical or careless editor. She allowed herself to watch forthe mailman with undue eagerness and she drank chocolateand ate cheese for her luncheon because she refused to admitthe subsequent indigestion. She had her own ideas on self-ishness and her own beliefs in humanity, and because shewas unneighborly and preferred reading to gossip they wereseldom interfered with by contact with persons.The arrival, therefore, of two young, human animals bentupon the fulfilment of Nature’s laws under emergency, andseeking aid from her as if she were an ordinary and rightfulassistant in the course of everyday affairs, filled her mindwith surprise, conjecture, and perplexity.The habit of several years, the conduct of mind becominga maiden lady of thirty-five, she found bouleversé by the im-minence of an experiment — one being tried, she knew, atall times on all sides of her, in all corners of the earth, butone, none the less, so remote and foreign to her conscious-ness that she felt as might a chrysalis within a pricked co-coon.While she remade the large bed in her room with freshsheets and pillow-slips she found herself peculiarly annoyed.ILLUMINATIONBy DOROTHY WILLIS"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL149149The feeling was so sharp and definite that she began to ana-lyze it, and found as she dwelt upon it that the real annoy-ance came from her inability to regard the bed without moreinterest than she felt as she made it every day for herself.She wanted merely to make the bed and get to the nextsmall change she contemplated for her lodgers’ comfort. In-stead, she found her attention focused upon the pillows andher thoughts upon the way she had tucked in the sheet. Thegirl Ethel, just as she left the house, had opened her suit-case to get out a clean handkerchief, and from the edge peepeda stretch of soft white nainsook threaded with a pale blueribbon.The woman of the house saw it and looked at it and thoughtabout it. She felt inclined to exercise her prerogative as host-ess by taking the nightgown out and folding it across thepillow. But she would not do so, for her desire annoyed herand she thought it must be repressed.There was no curiosity in her reflections and there was nomorbidity. Thoughts danced in her mind a pleasing little whirland fancies made intricate little patterns that wore lashestipped with gold and were caressed by a man’s strong hand.But the fact that thoughts and fancies of so alien a type hadplace at all in her she found disturbing.Because she had determined long before to be immunefrom love!When she came to the dresser, a broad affair boasting asplendid piece of glass, she found herself choosing instinc-tively a fresh, spring-like scarf to replace the plain whitemat she herself had used. The material was dotted with purpleviolets and she sought a broad mauve ribbon to loop the cur-tains at the window. And the room looked prettier than shehad ever made it look before. But her thoughts ran riot allthe afternoon. She discovered that sensation follows uponsuggestion, a fact she had forgotten if she ever knew it in thepast. In spite of solid common-sense and practical analysisof her own previous condition of security, the lure of the pastdrew her into dreamy contemplation, and she saw in herselfthe potential bride.The suggestion, made to her immunity, broke it down andshe not only saw but felt the potential rosy warmth of love asit might have been allowed to surround her womanhood.Fame, the will o’ the wisp, for which she had relinquishedwhat she thought a mild and foolish temptation to matrimony,seemed something inexcusably futile and flickering comparedwith the protection of a man’s curved fingers, and in responseto the extraordinary expansion of her sympathies she beganto wonder if she could not arrange for the young couple tohave the house to themselves if they came in early.This marked the ultimate in her self-sacrifice, for shealways went to bed at nine o’clock and hated to be awakelater.As it happened, however, there was no need for her un-selfishness. It was eight o’clock when the boy and girl ar-rived and she saw at once the broad new band of gold suc-cessfully triumphant on the girl’s left hand.They saw merely an accommodating woman who had rentedthem a room at an uncertain rate, and with the callousness ofyouth and happiness they said:“Thank you so much for fixing things so nicely; there isnothing more we want at all. Oh, and we have arranged tohave breakfast with the friend who was our witness!”Then the woman, who all day had been reluctantly dwell-ing on their case, whose very foundations of peace and se-renity had been undermined by their need and appeal, whosevitals, as it were, had been disturbed astonishingly becauseof them, retired to her small room with its discomfortable cotand said to herself, “I shall have to have my hot bath in themorning when they have gone!” Wherein lay the profoundesttragedy of her rather tragic life.After a night of sleeplessness caused partly by the unfa-miliar bed and partly by thoughts so unfamiliar as to be ex-citing, she came in the dawn to a determination, influencedmost strongly by a peculiar feeling that for the results shewished she had no time to lose. A definite change had takenplace in her immobile mind. As clearly as she had previ-ously seen it her duty and wisdom to follow the line of mostresistance she now saw it an essential matter to submit pli-antly and yield herself to the obvious designs of Life.In the tremendous elation of her discovery she forgot theinterest the boy and girl had for her and bade them good-byewith slight attention. When she went to the room she wasrather startled to find two dollar pieces lying on the dresser.In the obsession of her self-interest she had not thought ofmentioning the fact that they were welcome to the room as awoman’s wedding gift! And because her lips were set andher eyes unsmiling the pair had taken her to be quite ordi-nary in the matter of payment and had left what they thoughtadequate.She changed the sheets and took the bow of mauve ribbonfrom the curtain. She swept out the small room since shenoticed it was dusty and generally cleaned up the house alittle more than usual. Then the gas heater was lighted andshe prepared for that morning bath she promised herself over-night.And all the while her mind was furiously active and intentupon the letter she proposed to write.Before she went to the bathroom she carefully locked theback door. It was a long time since she had taken a daylightbath and there seemed to her mind something a little strange,a little immodest about the proceeding.Daylight poured in at all the windows. She felt queer, un-dressing in her room with the blinds up, lest anyone shouldbe able to see through the thick curtains. In the bathroom afog of steam rose and made her privacy a little more certain,but she locked the door and her actions were distinctly fur-tive.“Suppose someone comes to the door!” she said to herself.But no one ever came except the postman or a stray peddler,and it was past the postman’s hour. Only when she slid be-neath the bright translucent water she felt really at ease.“If anyone comes now they’ll have to go away!” shethought, and her mind began to play with her intention onceagain. The brilliantly white bath-tub mirrored her limbs.Lying idly at ease in the warmth she saw the beautiful curvesof her body and the creamy tint of her flesh. She saw themagnified effect of blue veins under the water on her breastand the hollow of her elbow she filled with diamond dropsthat stood, jewel-like, on her skin.Subconsciously she was thinking of a bride, permitting thevirginal thoughts of love and the ignorant suppositions of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918150150————FOREIGNERSI.RODA-RODApassion, place in her maturely innocent mind.Consciously she was thinking, “I am not too old, I am nota ‘dried-up’ old maid; he said he would give me three yearsto find out my mistake; I have found it out in one, and it isnot too late.”On her elbows she lifted herself above the water and satwith her chin on her rosy knees, watching the sheen of herarms and the tapering line of her ankle.And suddenly, violently, someone knocked upon the frontdoor of the house.She started and listened. Again the knocking came with-out pause enough to permit anyone within to reach the door.She leaped up in the water and stood erect. Again the knock-ing, and almost at once footsteps departing down the pave-ment — a man’s steps she was sure.She subsided again into the water. “Only an agent for teaor feather brushes!” she said to herself; “what a nuisancethey are!”She was glad the boy and girl had come to her for help.She was quite satisfied that her new decision was right andwould bring happiness and satisfaction. She felt she had givenFame a fair trial and found it wanting in certainty, whilelove now seemed to her the foundation of the world. In herinnocence she smiled at what she knew was the beauty ofher body, and then quite swiftly she smothered her big spongewith frothy soap and rubbed her skin until it tingled.When she had finished she dressed and put on a newlywashed house-dress of lavender linen and brushed her curl-ing hair back from her forehead.Then she ate some lunch and sat down to write the lettershe had planned.It took her quite a long time. The man who loved her liveda long way off and she wanted the words she wrote to beboth adequate and ardent. She did not want him to think theywere written on impulse or that she was doubtful of her ownfeelings. She was not. She knew what she wanted at last.She was ready to give him what he asked and to settle downand be at peace. If her mind had been influenced by the boyand girl it was only because she was ready for such influenceand ripe for the sensations that had followed. She tried toput something of her certainty on paper but she found it hardand ended by entreating him to come to her that she mightmake things plain.It was nearly five o’clock when she stamped the letter andopened her door to go and mail it.From the ledge of the screen a little yellow paper flutteredto her feet. Reading it she found the cold, brief statementthat effort had been made at noon to deliver a telegram toher, and that it would be kept at the office until called for.With vague surmises she put on her things and got on thestreet car to go and claim the message. In her hand she car-ried her letter, smiling faintly as she thought of the pleasureits receipt would give.When she produced the yellow slip a dark-haired girl tookit and went away, returning in a moment with the message inan envelope. She looked at the woman a trifle curiously, butsaid nothing.Beside the wall a long wooden seat was placed for peoplewho awaited answers to their wires, and there the womansat while she opened her envelope.Ten minutes later the dark-haired girl noticed she was stillsitting there, with a strange, dull look upon her face and thetelegram lying face up on her knee.The girl remembered the name, and when she went overto the files again she looked to refresh her mind with theimport of the message, and she read:“Am offered a commission on the strength of Philippineexperience. Passing through Lyndon on my way to accept,Wednesday at 3 o’clock. If you can reconsider your decisionbe at the depot and I will leave the train and discuss withyou acceptance or refusal according to your wish. Train waitstwo hours. If you are not there, good-bye. Roger.”Then the girl with the dark hair put on her hat, for it washalf-past five o’clock, and her day’s work was done.RODA-RODA is one of the younger Austrian writers.His witty and whimsical books of anecdotes, “DerPascha Lacht,” “Von Bienen, Drohnen, und Baronen,”“Der Schnaps, der Rauchtabak, und die verfluchte Liebe,”etc., have opened up an entirely new region to interna-tional literature: the half oriental borderlands of theAustro-Hungarian monarchy. Turks and Slavs, Austrianaristocrats, and Jewish pedlars, peasants, soldiers,Croatians, Dalmatians, and Bulgars, usurers, popes andgypsies move through his pages in picturesque proces-sion. His keen wit and quick perception at once seize theessentials of each individuality, and with a few vivid lineshe portrays these strangely primitive and child-likepeoples of the Near East.Roda-Roda is himself a son of the Slav Balkans andknows every language and dialect of that region. He wasborn April 13, 1872, on Pussta Zdenci, a large Slavonicestate. As a young man he studied law in Vienna and laterserved as officer in a regiment of Croatian artillery. Aboutfifteen years ago he left the army to devote himself en-tirely to literature. He made his home in Munich, wherehe soon became a favorite contributor to Simplicissimusand Jugend.Besides his many witty volumes of Balkan anecdotes,he has written several comedies and translated, from theSerbian, a one-act play by Branislaw Nuschitsch."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL151151SNAP-SHOTS FROM THE BALKANSI.TWO gypsies stood on the marketplace of Serajewo and soldbaskets.“Baskets, baskets for sale,” called one of them, “beauti-ful reed baskets — thirty para the piece!”“Beautiful reed baskets — fifteen para the piece!” called theother.Later, they both were spending their earnings on drink, theyexchanged confidences.“How is it possible, O Rom,” asked the first gypsy, “that youcan sell your baskets so cheaply? I steal the reeds for mine, andyet I have to ask thirty para the piece.”“O Rom,” answered the other, “I steal the finished baskets.”II.A peasant met a pope and asked him: “Do you still maintainwhat you preached in church last Sunday, that if anyone strikeyour right cheek, you should offer him your left cheek also?”“I cannot take back these words,” said the pope, “they arewritten in the gospels.”The peasant was delighted, for he had long cherished a grudgeagainst the pope — and with much gusto he boxed his cheeks,first the right and then the left.After the pope had somewhat recovered, he said: “That is allright, O brother in Christ, but don’t you know that it is alsowritten that with whatever measure you measure, with that shallyou yourself be measured?” And with much gusto, he boxed thepeasant’s cheeks, first the right and then the left.The Turkish lord of the manor just then happened to pass,and asked one of the onlookers what was the matter with thepope and the peasant.“O, nothing, sire,” answered the man, “they are just explain-ing the gospel. . . .”III.A rich peasant had but lately given his daughter in marriage.“You have done a foolish thing,” said one of his neighbors,“in selecting Toscha Meistrowitsch for your son-in-law. He hasbeen a great spendthrift and will have to use your daughter’swhole dowry to pay his debts.”“Man!” cried the peasant, “why did you not tell me this sooner?”“Well, you see,” hesitated his neighbor, “he owed me a lot ofmoney too. . . .”IV.The imperial forester sat before his house, smoking his pipeand sunning his long white beard.With humble mien a miserable Giaour approached him andsaid: “Effendi, deign to hear my request. Winter is at hand, andI have not a splinter of wood in the house. Graciously permitthat I cut some in the imperial forests. And may God preservethee many hundred years.”The imperial forester meditated a long while. Finally he said:“Dost not see, Giaour, that I am busy?”Sadly the petitioner went home.That night he complained to a neighbor who was an experi-enced and traveled man.The neighbor laughed.“How canst laugh at my distress?” cried the Giaour indignantly.“How can I help laughing,” retorted the neighbor, “when youwere foolish enough to appear before the imperial forester with-out a backshish!”The Giaour took these words to heart and talked them overwith his wife. The next morning she selected a beautiful lambas offering to the forester.But her husband thought the backshish much too costly.She then suggested a pot of lard.But again her husband thought the backshish much too costly.Finally he had an inspiration.He filled a pot three-quarters full of clay, then neatly coveredthe top with lard. This done, he once more proceeded on hiserrand.With many reverences he approached the dignitary, and, hum-bly depositing his gift on the floor, he asked for a permit to cutwood in the imperial forests.And this time his request was granted.The imperial forester winked an eye.The scribe wrote the permit.And, overjoyed, the Giaour departed.He had scarcely gone, when the venerable forester decided totaste of the gift — and detected the fraud.“Bring that Giaour back!” he roared.The scribe flew out, shouting: “Hey — you!

There is something wrong with your permit!”But the Giaour did not stop running.“Never mind,” he called over his shoulder, “there is some-thing wrong with my present too.”And he disappeared among the trees.V.Lieutenant Nikola Derwodelia had ordered a new cap fromVienna. When the notice from the postal authorities, announc-ing the cap’s arrival, reached him, he was much perplexed —for his knowledge of legal German was decidedly limited, andhe did not know what to do with the yellow paper.“Brother,” he appealed to an elder officer whom he consid-ered a man of the world, “supposing you had ordered this cap.”“Supposing nothing!” interrupted the other suspiciously. “Ihave not ordered it. Am I the imperial double eagle that I shouldneed two caps?”VI.It was market day.A peasant stood on the square and offered two horses forsale: a young one which he valued at six ducats, and an olderone at three.A gypsy came up to him and, after much bargaining, boughtthe old mare for three ducats.The next day, however, he appeared at the peasant’s gate.“Friend,” he said, “I have changed my mind. Here is your oldhorse back. I’ll take the young one instead; the one you pricedat six ducats.”The peasant was pleased, took the mare from the gypsy, andbrought the young horse from the stable.Lightly the gypsy mounted it.“All right, friend,” he said, “it’s a bargain.

So you have your six ducats.” And he galloped off at fullspeed.The peasant never saw him again.Translated by TOM RANSFORD."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918152152THE CHARACTERISTIC GESTUREBy ALEXANDER HARVEYSHE would lift that head of hers, that overwhelming head,slowly, very slowly. She would then lift those eyelids moreslowly still. Finally she lifted her arm, the right arm, until thehand played with an ear.How vague, how almost inconsequential seemed to PickthorpeDouglas the characteristic gesture of Aglaia Zabriskie when Istrove to convey to him in mere words an adequate impressionof its effect upon a beholder.“You have never seen her do it,” I reminded him. “Certainexperiences have to be lived through, like the ingratitude of achild or the responsibility of public office, before they can beunderstood. The characteristic gesture of Aglaia Zabriskie —”“Do not misunderstand me,” interrupted my dear PickthorpeDouglas, tossing red roses here and there about the library inhis aesthetic way, “I don’t mean that her characteristic gestureis nothing in itself. I mean no more than that you are peculiarlysusceptible to it.”“Pickthorpe,” I declared with a profound conviction of thetruth of my remark, “if Napoleon at the crisis of the battle ofMarengo had seen Aglaia Zabriskie lift that head and then thoseeyelids and then that arm he must have abandoned the conquestof the world to offer her his love!”He had too much confidence in my judgement to persist inhis incredulity. Pickthorpe Douglas threw the remaining rosesinto the aquarium and filled his carved pipe with the Shen-Sotea leaves he was so fond of smoking.“I have always believed,” he told me, when he had dischargedthe fumes from his mouth into a large hollow glass sphere, “thatMark Antony fled from the naval battle to Cleopatra’s galleybecause of some spell she cast upon him then. Perhaps she, too,lifted her head slowly and then her eyelids and then an arm.”I sat stunned. Might it not be that in the characteristic ges-ture of Aglaia Zabriskie or rather in its effect upon me therewas afforded some clue to an unsuspected principle at workthroughout the long course of human history?“You make me think, Pickthorpe,” I told him. “You makeeverybody think.”“Let us clear up a point or two,” he suggested. “Aglaia neverindulges in this gesture unless she happens to be alone withyou.”It did, indeed, seem so. Pickthorpe Douglas himself had knownAglaia and all her family intimately ever since they were chil-dren. He had never seen this gesture. Neither hadCrackanthornton Littleton, who loved Aglaia so madly and sovainly.“I am sure she never does it except for me,” I reiterated forthe thousandth time. “Of course, I can institute no systematicinquiry lest I render Aglaia and myself alike ridiculous.”“True.” Pickthorpe Douglas knocked his pipe out until theembers of the tea leaves had all fallen into a jar of bay rum.“The psychological problem here would be unintelligible to themultitude.”“How,” I asked, “would you state the problem?”“That all depends,” he told me, “upon whether Aglaia is awareof her characteristic gesture.”“You don’t mean,” I retorted, “that she doesn’t know she doesit?”“That’s the very thing you must find out.”“I can’t ask her.”Pickthorpe Douglas drew a goldfish out of the aquarium witha silk net kept by him for the purpose.“I understand,” he said, restoring the fish after a minute in-spection of its fins, “a question put to her on the subject wouldreveal in you a lack of delicacy, of insight —”He had divined. Yet there was much more than that in thedilemma. Aglaia Zabriskie tolerated no approach to the recessesof her nature, no inquiry into the sanctities of her being. I oughtto know by the sheer subtlety of my comprehension of her soulwhy she lifted that head, why she raised the eyelids only aftershe had raised the head, why the arm was not elevated until thehead and the eyelids had, in a manner of speaking, gone first.Nevertheless, it had never once until this moment even occurredto me that the characteristic gesture of Aglaia Zabriskie wasunconscious. To ask her why she did it all only to be told thatshe did not know she ever did it — this meant that I did notunderstand her. I boasted that I understood her. The imbecilityof the boast was now revealed in the point raised by PickthorpeDouglas.“Let me see,” he observed next. “You have an appointmentfor to-day with Aglaia.”“I am to see her within a half hour.”“You must contrive to find out this very day what is at thebottom of all this.

For three years I would haveno key to the characteristic gesture of Aglaia Zabriskie unless Itold Pickthorpe Douglas that evening whether or not it was un-conscious. And I dare not question the girl directly!“Pickthorpe,” I pleaded, “give me a suggestion.”“Is there a mirror in Zabriskie’s drawing room?”“A huge glass as high as the ceiling.”“Has she gone through her performance in front of it?”“Never.”“Get her in front of it this time.”The thing seemed so easy and so elucidating that I seized myhat.“If she sees herself do it and she is unaware of it, she willstart with surprise or halt or modify the procedure.”“Pickthorpe,” I cried, wringing his hand, “you are the Aristotleof New York.”I lost no time in repairing to the home of Aglaia Zabriskieon Fifth Avenue. The moment I had entered the Pompeiiandrawing room, startling with its huge wall paintings, I receivedjust such a shock as petrified Macbeth when the wood beganto move.That immense mirror, rising from the waxed floor to the fullheight of the colored ceiling, was obliterated with soap.A strong sense of impending disaster chilled me to the boneas I paced the length of the immense apartment, halting onlywhen the mirror itself made all further progress impossible.Instead of retracing my steps, I paused and peered into the faceof the mirror. No reflection of myself afforded me the slightesthope. From top to bottom the glass was so efficiently soaped"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL153153that the sheer opacity of the effect made it look like a sheet oflead — not lead shining and new but lead that is old and faded.The perversity of my fate just then seemed too tragic for soundor movement and I might have stood for the next half minute asa model of grief in front of a class in sculpture.“How very good of you to come so promptly, Mr. Updegraff.”It was the perfect Aglaia Zabriskie! Never before did the radi-ance in her eyes more hopelessly extinguish the cut glass on themantelpiece.“I observe,” said I, awaking from my trance and betrayingmy obsession before I had spoken the conventional form of greet-ing, “I observe that the mirror has been soaped.”She allowed her gaze to be guided in accordance with themotion of my trembling hand. How terrific these moments seemat the time!“Soaped!” The concern in her voice answered to the panic inmine. She had realized a something momentous in the circum-stance to me. “Mamma is having the house cleaned.”She turned in the direction of the front windows and hadpaced half across the floor before I found courage.“I am very anxious to see myself in the glass.”Aglaia Zabriskie was struck by the gravity of my tone, theelement, I may say, of the poignant in my manner. She turned togaze into my eyes before speaking.“I will tell the butler to have the soap removed.”She did, in effect, raise her voice in the well of the staircaseoutside the drawing room. No answer. We might have been theonly living mortals amid all that luxury of marble and mahoganyand shining brass. I walked myself to the threshold and consid-ered the feasibility of adding my own power of lung to the sil-ver of her accents when I saw something at the head of thestairs.“A mop,” I said, indicating it with a wave of the hand. “I willwipe the glass myself.”“Nonsense!” she objected. “The butler will be here soon, nodoubt.”I thought of the departure of Pickthorpe Douglas for Siamand of the precious time I might lose forever. Ignoring her politeremonstrance, I fairly leaped up the steps to the top of the stair.I rushed upon the mop I found there as if it were a well in adesert and I a famished camel. The next moment I had trodupon a piece of soap — the very soap employed by the footmenin the obliteration of that fatal mirror, as I learned long, longafterwards. In turning upon the soap as it mashed beneath myweight I fell against a bucket. Down the stairs all fell, the bucket,the cake of soap, the suds with which the receptacle was filled,the mop, and I.For a moment I lay at the foot of the stairs, fearing that likeLucifer I was never to rise again. My blacked and roving eyesencountered those of Aglaia Zabriskie. There she stood uponthe threshold of the drawing room, looking down at me whilethe suds flowed about my shoulders.“Mr. Updegraff!”My name had barely escaped her lips when she lifted thathead of hers, that overwhelming head, slowly, very slowly. Shethen lifted those eyelids, more slowly still. Finally she liftedher arm, the right arm, until the hand played with an ear. Whatneed had I now to be told that the characteristic gesture of thewoman I loved was unconscious? It was her reaction to a sup-pressed merriment that half suffocated Aglaia Zabriskie. Mymind reverted, even while she assisted me to a sitting posturebeside the bucket, to the fact that I alone evoked the character-istic gesture of the well-bred girl. How often, oh, how often,had I not been almost the death of Aglaia Zabriskie! I couldinterpret correctly at last the quizzical look in the countenanceof Crackanthornton Littleton when he laughed and told me thatI alone had the privilege of witnessing the characteristic ges-ture. While the butler scraped the soap from the soles of myshoes, I comforted myself with the assurance that it would be awork of supererogation to hunt up Pickthorpe Douglas beforehe went off to Siam.ALEXANDER HARVEY.————SONNETFrom Sir Rabindranath TagoreI falter near and take her hands in mine,And closely fold within my living chain.I long to drink with joy her grace divine,And keep her close in sight her wealth to gain.I’ll kiss her lips her smiles to snatch away;The light within her eyes will colour mine;Her lotus-touch will form my sweet array,And clothe my every limb in honeyed shine.Alas, no use; ’tis fruitless quest for aye:I long in vain to seize the blue on high.As I go near her beauty flees away,I grasp her form — my wearied heart doth sigh.At dawn I go back home with heavy mind:The wealth of heart is not in form confined.Translated by FLORA AMY MORGAN."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918154154INTELLECTUAL DRAMABY GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKThe drama in America is the lowest of the arts. She isthe handmaid of the mimic propensity inherited by us fromour simian sires. Theatricalism has chained the Muse tothe wheel of its motor. Plays are written to order. Theauthor’s name hardly appears on the program.I have never been one of those who place the drama onthe uppermost rung of the ladder of art. A poem, a statue,a picture, is wonderful each in itself. It needs no inter-preters. It summons no other art or artifice to its aid. Thedrama depends for its support on various scaffoldings, al-though the great dramas of Shakespeare and Æschylus areno less effective in the library than on the stage. The littledramas of contemporary American playwrights, like fairy-gold when the charm is withdrawn, are tatters and rags ifdivorced from the footlights. The great dramatists havewritten to express themselves. We write to express oth-ers, usually actors of inferior mental caliber. Shakespearegarbed the body of the Muse with new splendor. We, withrare exceptions, manufacture dramatic tinsel to cover upthe mental and physical deficiencies of some over-adver-tised female.In Shakespeare’s days the mimes were called “shadows.”The substance, the play, remained after their exit. InAmerica to-day the play is the shadow. We have no brainsfor abstractions either in politics or æsthetics. We areswayed solely by the personality of the actor. Ellen Terrywas more real to us than Shakespeare himself. We placethe shadow above the substance. In America the playwrightis successful if he adapts himself to the actor. Abroad theactor is successful if he adapts himself to the playwright.Abroad they have great dramas and great actors. We haveno dramas. And we develop not actors, but virtuosi.The actors of Reinhardt, for instance, are men andwomen endowed with brains. They have a serious interestin art. Acting to them is more than “business.” They areall individualities with the stamp of genius, who willinglysubmerge their egos in the harmonious whole. WhereverReinhardt rules, intellectual values are at a premium. Styledetermines destinies. Bernard Shaw thrives in his care.His Chamber-Play House is the citadel of the bizarre. It isa hot-house for exotic genius, a mansion of many moods.Within its confine poets may safely play with intellectuallightning, the psychologist may with impunity empty hisvials of pestilential bacilli. Its public is immune againstevery mental disease. Unlike the naive audiences of ourAmerican play-houses, we find here grown men who havepassed safely through the ailments of intellectual imma-turity. Schnitzler’s orgasmic “Reigen” leaves himunstartled. The hysterical Greeks of Hugo vonHofmannsthal, that brilliant young Viennese, arouse a re-sponsive chord in their breasts. Shaw’s Cæsar is the Su-perman conscious of his part in the world’s evolution. Heattains through cerebration what Peter Pan knows by in-stinct. Salome is the gorgeous encasement of morbid beautyand misdirected desire. The theme of Wedekind’sFrühling’s Erwachen is universally human. The dramatistunfolds before our eyes puberty with its pure and ecstaticaffections and its curious sensual nightmares. Wilde, withthe unfailing veracity of the great poet, has doomed Salomein his play, as she is doomed in the process of evolution.Normal humanity, of which Wedekind’s youthful hero,Melchior, is a typical incarnation, overcomes the perilsbesetting its path. Wedekind’s hero dallies with death, butin the end life is triumphant. This is not the sort of thingto which the Tired Business Man — that atrocious bogeyraised whenever Art lifts her head in the American the-ater — would repair for a tonic.The intellectual stamp dooms a play to failure inAmerica. The absence of it dooms it to failure abroad. Ofcourse, The Merry Widow was an importation from Eu-rope. And even abroad, I admit, the Merry Widow waltzwas more popular than the dance of Salome. But a distinc-tion is made between entertainment and art. We cater onlyto entertainment. And if we have an idea, we attempt todisguise the intellectual germ in a thick layer of saccha-rine sentiment and theatrical clap-trap.Mme. Dumont, of Düsseldorf, has attempted to purgethe drama with its eternal problems from purely local as-sociations. She has abolished decoration, and everythingmerely temporal or limiting the message of art. There areno properties, no scenery at all. Her background consistsmerely of an immense sheet of linen, sometimes with chro-matic borders, and illuminated from behind with simple,dominant colors defining the basic mood of the scene.There are no footlights, nothing to distract the attentionfrom the words of the poet. Mme. Dumont’s method shouldbe tremendously effective in staging the mystic plays ofMaeterlinck and of Yeats, where the characters, vague andelusive, pass shadowlike before our vision. Her stage, withits glimpses of infinity and vague suggestions, representsaptly the unique mentality of the author of The Death ofTintagiles.Satiated with all things, the ancient civilizations are everready to hail something new. Out of the mental unrest ofmodern times was born the tenth of the Muses: the newArt of Nudity. Many things that once were natural are to-day arts. There was a time when men’s motions were natu-rally graceful, when dance was instinctive. But in thecourse of time mankind forgot; and what was once a func-tion of every human being is resurrected to-day in the pol-ished art of Isadora Duncan, of Ruth St. Denis, of HelenMoeller.Song, we are told, is older than speech. The conversa-tion of men in olden days was rhythmic. Poetry to-day isan art confined to the few. In the golden ages of the Greeksand in the Paradise of the Hebrew, men were splendid andnude. Then came sin, and we swathed our bodies in hid-eous clothes. And so long have we hidden and marred themthat at last nudeness, like singing and dancing, has be-come an accomplishment.The new art of nudity has so far been primarily defendedfrom the point of view of the sculptor.

The Museof Nudity is not the youngest, but the oldest of all themuses. In her domain, the extremes of civilization, thesophisticated and primitive nature, are blended.On Nov. 6, 1909, at the formal opening of the “NewTheatre” Governor Hughes declared: “This theatre shallbe devoted to art. But it shall never become a museum ofabnormalities.” Yet what is all art but a museum of abnor-malities? Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, the tortured creaturesof Isben, Hauptmann, Brieux, are not conventional nor-mal types. In biology the exception proves the rule. Artthrough the abnormal depicts the normal. Perfectly nor-mal people are perfectly dull. The dramatic struggle callsfor the contention between conventional and eccentric so-cial forces.The province of art is to provide caviar for the general.If the general refuse this fare, then, indeed, are we in adifficult plight.

It announced that the famousProfessor, accompanied by his niece and three pupils, hadquietly stolen into New York on the previous day and wouldremain in New York to give lessons for the period of thewar.It was many a long day since I had experienced such athrill; for I hoped that my great ambition was about to berealized, an ambition of some years’ standing, to studywith the famous Leopold Auer! I had cherished this wishnot merely because of his fame, but because I had heardso many of his marvellous pupils and made up my minddefinitely and completely that the Auer method was themethod for me. The exquisite singing tone, the brilliantand absolutely-perfected technique, so colorful, so tremen-dously alive, so rounded, like pearls — and always, al-ways singing. Yes, always I had said to myself: the Auerpupils possess an indefinable something which appeals tre-mendously to me.Having sobered down a little I wrote a note to the vet-eran Professor, asking if I might call and talk with him, asI wished to take lessons. By return of post I received amost cordial reply, saying: “I will see you on Thursday atfive o’clock in the afternoon.”It was with my heart in my mouth that I entered Auer’ssuite in the Hotel Netherland. I sat down, feeling moreexcited than words can express. After a few moments avery dignified, but active, gray-haired man crossed theroom to greet me — and I was at last talking with themaster of masters.He put me at my ease immediately by saying: “Take offyour furs, my dear child, it is too warm in here. Now then,”he continued, “what can I do for you? You wish to takelessons? Now tell me, how long did you study before youplayed in concert?”“Four years and a half,” I answered.“Ah, but this is very good. And with whom have youstudied? Let mesee your hand;ah, I wish I hadsuch a hand;with such ahand you shouldbe able to doanything.”I told him thatI had injured theposition of myleft hand a littlethrough doing aRussian dancewith my violin.“My dearchild, this musthave been im-mensely difficult and you must have worked so hard toaccomplish it.”He was interested to hear that I had studied the dancein Moscow with an artist of the Imperial Ballet, whom heknew. Then he realized that time was flying and manypeople coming to see him, so asked if I would wish tohave an interview (which meant, to play to him) in a week’s"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL157157time. “My fee,” he con-tinued, “is twenty-fiverubles.” “Oh yes,” I re-plied, feeling verymuch pleased . . . whenhe made a tragic cor-rection: “I meantwenty-five dollars.”“Make the arrange-ment with my niece,”he added. “Good bye,my dear child”. . . .I left the Netherlandand climbed on top ofa bus, feeling as I imag-ine one feels after one’sfirst aerial flight. Thenext morning found mepractising my Guar-narius at top speed. Hehad said “bring a slow melody for the tone, and an étudefor the technique.” I worked for three or four days beforedeciding what I would play at the interview.At last the eventful day arrived, and as I set out for theNetherland I think I felt more nervous than I had ever beenin my life, for I knew that by one word or gesture thisveteran master could hurt and humiliate me more than Idared think.As I entered his room he left the pupil he was teachingand asked me would I please wait, as he was behind time.This proved fortunate, for during my half hour’s listeningto the pupil I regained my calm sang froid. I became veryinterested in his simple manner. He wouldn’t shout at thepupil; calmly and patiently he would rise from the pianoand take the boy’s violin, saying: “No, music is like flow-ers, it must bloom.” Then Auer would play a few bars andlet the boy try again. “That’s better,” he said, “courage,you will get it by next lesson. Now good bye”; and turningquickly to me: “Please take your violin.” In order that Ishould have as little as possible to worry me, I had de-cided to play Wilhelmj’s arrangement of Schumann’s“Abendlied” and handed the accompaniment to the Pro-fessor. We began, but after two bars he stopped and said:“Not quite in tune, my dear child; again, yes? Can you nothear that it is not quite right?” “Yes,” I replied, “but Icannot imagine what is wrong.” “Alright, dear child, oncemore. Ah,” he laughed goodheartedly, “I am playing inthe wrong key; I am playing it in the original key! Now webegin again.”This unexpected little episode put me in a very goodhumor and all my nervousness disappeared, for if Auercould make a mistake, he surely must forgive me! Afterthis we played without a stop. He then took my violin andexplained how it should be played. We played it a thirdtime, and then the étude.“You have two faults to correct,” he said, “but the storyof your Russian dance tells me you have much patience,so you should correct them in three weeks. You will workwith my assistant, Miss May Bang, and come back to mein a month.”“May she bang my faults out of me,” said I to myself.“Good bye,” he said, and called quickly to his next pupil.And so ended my interview with the famous LeopoldAuer.CHANSON NAÏVEBY LIBUSSA DUMBAA MASQUEBY LIBUSSA DUMBALast night I had a dream of you,It was a dream of love, Dear.The earth was bathed in silvery light,The moon stood still above, Dear.As in old days, you came to me,And were again my own, Dear.When I woke up, no moon did shine —I was alone, alone, Dear.“Good morning” — “Awful weather” —“The Kent’s ball was a bore” —“Your husband?” — “He is better” —“Caruso’ll sing no more” —A nod, a smile, a greeting . . .And over is the meeting.No flash of eye, no tremorsOf voice or lip betrayThat in his dreams all night longWithin her arms he lay —That in her dreams she yielded . . .And winter turned to May.————"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONALMay, 1918158158UTOPIA OF USURERS, by G. K. Chesterton.BONI AND LIVERIGHT.In his Utopia of Usurers G. K. Chesterton writes up to his title, and withsuch a title this is something to say. Utopias suggest idealists, whereas usu-rers are supposed to be practical men. Can it be that they too, the capitalists,indulge in utopias? A typical Chesterton paradox! But paradoxes of theirvery nature turn out to be true. So on further examination we find capital-ism also is a utopia — a utopia of usurers.“I hate this rage to destroy,” Jean-Jacques Rousseau remarked, and pro-ceeded straightway to write his Contrat Social. I wonder if G. K. Chestertonwill ever arrive at such a constructive stage? The poor old capitalistic sys-tem has so little to recommend it anyway, it seems a shame to attack it soviciously. And after all, what has Chesterton to offer as an alternation? It’sdifferent with Shaw.But it is well for the ordinary man to know how the extraordinary manis going to arrange things in the world. — To be sure the difference be-tween the ordinary and the extraordinary man is in this instance not amatter of mind but a matter of millions. This is exactly what Chestertonshows: how the men of millions are going to arrange things satisfactorily,“what they are going to do with art, science, religion, and other humaninstitutions.”“A fascinating subject,” as another reviewer remarks, “treated in a wayto startle the most callous out of their indifference.” With Chesterton onone side and the Bolsheviki on the other all but the absolutely calloused arealready startled out of their indifference, or their “conventional compla-cency” as we choose to say.———MEN IN WAR, by Andreas Latzko.BONI AND LIVERIGHT.On Saturday, January 12, an article in the New York Evening Post calledattention to Menschen im Krieg, a war book, which had appeared anony-mously in Switzerland, with the imprint of Rascher & Co., of Zurich. Theauthor, evidently an officer in the Austrian army, had to hide his identity onaccount of his book’s bitter assaults on militarism. The Evening Post ar-ticle compared “Menschen im Krieg” with Barbusse’s “Le Feu,” addingthat, while the latter was realism, the Austrian book was artistic realism,and regretting that it was available only in German, “since its vitality ex-ceeds that of our present best sellers, and it ought to be given a chance.”The following week six different publishers sent cablegrams to Rascherin Zurich, asking for the American rights to “Menschen im Krieg.” Thefirm that had cabled first was Boni and Liveright, who accordingly securedthe rights, and now their excellent translation of this intense and vital bookis being offered the public under the title “Men in War.”“Men in War” consists of several stories, each giving a different view ofwar, but each showing its naked repulsiveness, devoid of all romantic andsentimental trappings, and each singling out for attack one of the factorsthat helped and always will help bring about war: the poisoning influenceof the press — woman’s hysterical worship of “heroes” — the machina-tions of ambitious politicians, rapacious capitalists and a ruthless militarycaste — and finally the ignorance of the ever-easily-hypnotized masses. Ina last chapter the bestializing effect of warfare is vividly portrayed by a fewpages of gripping, bloody tragedy. And throughout the whole book the gulfwhich divides the public’s bloodthirstiness from the average soldier’s dis-gust of slaughter and brutality is glaringly illumined.———THE SANITY OF ART, by Bernard Shaw.BONI AND LIVERIGHT.A book or play by Mr. Shaw is always certain to find an appreciativeaudience. This writer’s charm lies in his being brilliant without being deep.If he went to the depths, he no longer could amuse us, for there the ridicu-SOME OF THE LATEST AND BEST BOOKSlous is apt to turn into the tragic. But as he lightly and wittily skims over thesurface of things, showing off others’ foibles to us, he fills us with that cozyand grateful “better than thou” feeling, that glad sensation of enjoying —in company of an Elect — a laugh at our neighbor’s absurdities.“The Sanity of Art” has Dr. Max Nordau and his book “Degeneration”as victims. I do not know “Degeneration,” so must accept Mr. Shaw’s viewof it — a view which he is careful to justify by quotations; but, quotationsare like statistics, you can prove anything with them. At any rate, I am notinterested in Dr. Nordau’s book. I don’t suppose that you are. But Mr. Shaw’sremarks à propos of it are well worth reading, for they deal with the eternalstruggle of the revolutionary Young against the academic Old. Writtentwenty years ago, they are as vital to-day as they were in the nineties — to-day, which sees the insurgents of that yesterday as well-established conven-tionalists, fighting in their turn the hopeless, tragic fight of the used-up manwho thinks that the world, which no longer believes as he does, is doomedto go to the dogs.———MY UNCLE BENJAMIN, by Claude Tillier, translated by Adele SzoldSeltzer.BONI AND LIVERIGHT.This is a gaily rambling old-world tale, full of pithy philosophy, agree-able pessimism, and real fun. It is truly a pleasure to become acquaintedwith the vivid personalities of Benjamin, his drastic little sister MadameMachecourt, old Dr. Minxit, M. Page, M. Rapin, the Midwife, and all therest of them, so wittily portrayed in word and silhouette. It is a charmingrococo book, and the translation is excellently done.———MARIE GRUBBE, by Jens Peter Jacobsen, translated by HannaAstrup Larsen.BONI AND LIVERIGHT.This Danish masterpiece is a gorgeous historical drama — not acted bythe familiar, caparisoned manikins, but by full blooded, sensual, impulsiveRenaissance men and women. It is the life story of the beautiful and intensewoman, who, unhappily married to a king’s son, finally found peace andhappiness as the wife of a peasant ferryman, who beat and loved her.———WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS, by Alexander Harvey.B. W. HUEBSCH.A book of literary criticism that reads like a breathless romance. Begin-ning with glitter and praise and joy, it subtly conveys the feeling of impend-ing tragedy. Towards the middle of the book the first distant rumblings ofthunder are heard. And in the last chapters the storm finally breaks forthwith overwhelming force.Literature, love, women, and a great many other fascinating topics aretreated brilliantly and lustily, illumining life in general and, incidentally,the independent, striking personality of the author.———TWILIGHT IN ITALY, by D. H. Lawrence.B. W. HUEBSCH.A dreamer, intense and sensitive, full of compassion, of kindly humor,and yet fanatic to a degree, has written these colorful sketches of present-day Italy. His pictures of people and places are wonderfully graphic, har-monious, subtle, and his earnest, searching philosophy tries to probe to thedepths of both men and nature. It is a fascinating and enchanting book. Hiscriticism of Ibsen and Hamlet, however, provokes a half-regretful “Honisoit . . .”"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"May, 1918THE INTERNATIONAL159159$150100A Subscription toTHE INTERNATIONALis delectation for a yearREADING IS BELIEVINGWe’ll take a chance tooEnclose a one dollar bill.ORif you’re from Missouri tryTHE INTERNATIONALnine months for$100100—————————THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY, Inc.1123 Broadway, New York, N.
