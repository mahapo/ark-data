There is something in February whichmakes one want exotic luxury. If we are wealthy, weroll off to Palm Beach; if we are sensible, we get whatis after all a much better effect out of the Interna-tional. As the Earth passes through the waters of themonth of Rains, we shall gloat. And is not winternearly over? Will not the Sun come back to us at theend of March?All ancient peoples have been careful to celebratethe return of the spring with drama. All plays are,properly speaking, based upon this one supreme com-edy-tragedy which appeals to us all of necessity, sincewe are ourselves partakers of that Mystery.Some such thoughts, stirring in ourselves, made uswonder whether we could not offer a banquet of dramato the readers of the International. Some of our bestcontributors hastened to our aid. Dr. Hans Ewers of-fered his “The Price He Paid”; Mr. Charles Beadlebrought out his Eastern comedy, “The Palm Tree andthe Window.” We have a charming little Scottish dia-lect play from the pen of Lord Boleskine, which mayfail to please our Puritans, but that cannot be helped.The Master Therion is contributing his Gnostic Mass,which is of intense interest as well to the general read-ers as to the Theologian and Archaeologist.Joseph Bernard Rethy’s “Lady Godiva” is one ofthe wittiest, albeit most romanesque, mummeries everstaged. You will all like it.I am not so sure about “The Saviour,” by AleisterCrowley. The author is not all I could wish, in manyways. His play is decidedly not for all tastes. In fact,it is mostly to please him personally that we print thebeastly stuff.However, there are others.The rest of the paper would be more interesting ifthere were more of it. When, oh, when, will the brightday dawn when we can offer forty-eight pages withillustrations? A little bird has whispered that it maybe soon. However, if our readers want to help us, it isonly necessary for each one of them to go out and getsix more.And so we wish you all a safe passage through themonth of the Waters.A.

Truly, indeed, it has been a giant’s taskin these days to avoid the contagion of hysteria, the spiritual rabies of the baser sections of the press.But in the last week or so statesmen have taken to borrowing (often without acknowledgment) from the editorial matter ofthe International. There is no longer any pretence that the Germans are other than “men of like passions with ourselves,” or thatthe Kaiser has dragooned them into unwilling submissives.Also, there is a general acceptance of the belief, highly unpopular in Bolshevik circles, that the organized hierarchy is themost stable structure of society, that a man is better than a mess, and a cathedral than a pile of stones.The excuse given in private by the extremists for their bombast in public has been that it was necessary to spur the unwillingpublic into war. The situation would be Gilbertian were it not so devilish; but its usefulness is over. It is time that the voice ofreasonable men should be heard in the land. It is probably hopeless to ask people to think for themselves. In the last week or sothe New York Times, Sun, and even the World, have more or less turned upon the President to rend him. The public isbecoming familiar with what must be to the man in the street quite inexplicable tergiversations. The extremists are nowattacking Mr. Wilson as they attacked us a month or so ago. We can, therefore, appeal to rational thought and calm balance, andsay to men and women of good will everywhere in the world, “Come forward, make yourselves heard, give your support to thepeople who are fighting the battles of good sense.”It is not for us, perhaps, but for other statesmen, to determine what can honorably be accepted by any given nation, but we canat least insist that those who speak for us shall speak with good faith and without rancor, with sympathy and understanding. Weshall not fight with less courage and determination because we are chivalrous. The days of the cave-man, when crazy andunthinking rage could determine a victory, are past. A handful of British soldiers were able to defeat countless hordes ofMadhists because this was understood. It was the Dervish who possessed the fanatical rage, the unthinking courage. The Britonopposed to him cool thought, armchair organization, careful aim. He did not hate his enemy. He simply shot him dead. Kiplingexpressed the feeling of the British soldier admirably in his famous poem:“So ’ere’s to you, Fuzzy Wuzzy, an’ the missus an’ the kid,We ’ad orders for to smash you, so course we went and did.”That is the spirit in which should all of us be fighting. The observer will notice that, ever since Lord Lansdowne formulatedthe feeling of that silent element in England which determines her policy, statesmen have been making clear their war aimswith much more elasticity than before. There is a feeling in the air that it is time to talk things over quietly. One cannot do thiswith a cannibal who is suffering from acute delirious mania; and, therefore, the theory that the enemy was this kind of a personhad to be given up by all parties. In other words, the slogan of “Deutschland uber Alles” and its equivalents in other languageshave had to be altered to our own little effort in motto making: “Humanity first.”I have no wish to rub it in with an “I told you so,” to point out that my so-called pro-German-writings of last year are the sameas the utterances of the President of the United States and of the Premier of England of this year. For, in truth, I am notconscious of victory, but of defeat. It has not been the spirit of humanity which has dictated the change of policy. That changehas been forced upon the various governments by necessity. My work is yet to do. It is still necessary to prove to men that theyare cutting their own throats by anger, greed and ambition. It is still necessary to appeal to self-interest. The planet has beentaught an appalling lesson; but will men learn it? Will they really understand that even on the lowest ground the philosopherand the poet are their real friends, that the man of the world is really as much of a fool as he is a knave. Selfishness is thehighest stupidity. I cannot hurt my brother without hurting myself. That is what some of us have been preaching for many a longday; and because we have preached it we have been called unpractical; we have been called traitors. The event has proved onlytoo terribly that we were the patriots and the sages. The time has come to put that lesson into practice. We must take away thepower from the self-seeking scoundrels who have been boosting themselves as practical men; and, although the mechanicaldetails of reconstruction must necessarily be left to people of experience in each branch, yet the theory must be left to peoplewho understand truth in its deepest sense. We must entrust the supreme government to the supreme philosopher.In the meantime our urgent necessity is to make place for the moderate man, to him who has shown by his detached attitudethat he could see an inch or two beyond his nose. The President’s “war aim” message is most significant in this connection. Wedo not want people with entirely new theories of government. This is no moment for revolutionary social measures. The worldis one vast wound, and the business of the moment is to heal it so far as may be. For this purpose we need soothing applicationssuch as universal charity, and we must complete the work of sterilizing the bacillus of hatred. There could never have been awar if the men in power had had the slightest realization of what it was going to be like. Yet these people were all excellentspecimens of the type of man that has been in power for centuries. The moral is to get rid of the type. However, for the moment,the political issue is less radical in character. It will be enough if we sternly refuse a hearing to the bloodthirsty cries of thosepeople who think that the People is but a mob of savages, and that the only way to obtain power over them is to appeal to theirmost senseless passions.We want moderate men.ALEISTER CROWLEY.WANTED — MODERATE MEN."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL3535THE INTERNATIONALEDITORGEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKASSOCIATE EDITORJOSEPH BERNARD RETHYCONTRIBUTING EDITORALEISTER CROWLEYVOL. XII. No. 2.  FEBRUARY, 1918.  PRICE 15 CENTSSimon Iff, the mystic, was the most delightfully unclubbableman in the Hemlock Club. But all was forgiven to a man of hispowers — and of the extraordinary charm which he radiated,even when sitting silent in his favorite window. It was a genu-ine triumph for any one to get him to talk. One Christmas eveningafter dinner, the editor of the “Emerald Tablet” informed himthat the Committee had made a new rule to the effect that theeldest member of the Club who happened to be present musttell a story under penalty. It was a genial lie, and appealed toSimple Simon’s sense of humor. “What sort of a story?” hegrunted.“Tell us of the first occasion on which you used your powersof reading men.”The mystic’s face darkened. “It’s poetic justice. You shall bewell paid out for your impudence in inventing new rules. Thestory is hideous and horrible; the gleams of heroism that shinein it only serve to make the darkness more detestable. But youshall hear it: for one reason, because the result of my interfer-ence was to save this Club, and therefore the Universe (whichrevolves about it) from irreparable disaster.I.His Majesty’s Sloop “Greyhound” was wrecked in the Bay ofBiscay in the month of April, 1804, of the vulgar era. She wascarrying dispatches to Sir Arthur Wellesley. Captain Fortescue,who was in charge of them, escaped the wreck, in companywith a sergeant of marines named Glass. They found themselvescast ashore on the north coast of Spain. Many days’ journey laybetween them and their destination. However, they fell in withfriendly guerrillas, who aided them in every way. But the luckchanged when they were within sight, almost, of their goal. Abattle had taken place; and Masséna, retreating, had chosen aline which cut them off completely from Sir Arthur’s positions.THE SCRUTINIES OF SIMON IFFBy EDWARD KELLYNo. VI — IneligibleBecoming aware of these facts, they broke away at right anglestowards some mountainous country, intending to traverse it, and,descending the opposite slopes, to fetch a compass round aboutthe flank of the French army. Unluckily for them, they wereperceived as they crossed the first range of hills, and a detach-ment of light infantry was sent in pursuit.Immediately on seeing this, their Spanish guide took to hisheels. They were thus not only hunted but lost. They knew thegeneral direction of the British lines; they had about two hours’start; otherwise they were hopeless.They gained the crest of the second range just as their pursu-ers, spread out in a long line, swarmed over the first; but inbeginning their descent, which was excessively steep, with onlya narrow mule-path among the enormous tangle of rocks, theycame upon a cottage; and the path ended. Fortescue recognizedthe place, for the guide had spoken of it on the previous day; itwas the home of a desperate brigand, a heavy price upon hishead from French and English alike. They had no choice, how-ever, but to go on. Chance favored them; the brigand was away,leaving but one drowsy sentinel. Fortescue ran the man throughwith his sword before he had time to seize his gun.The two Englishmen found themselves alone in the cottage.Could it be defended? Possibly, but only for an hour or two;reinforcements would arrive in case of a prolonged resistance.The vital question was to find the way to the valley.The cottage was perched upon the edge of a cliff; they couldsee the path winding away below. But access to it seemed to becut off. Glass it was who reasoned out the situation. There mustbe a way through some cellar. Quickly he searched the cottage.A trap-door was found. Glass descended the ladder. All waswell. He found himself in a large room, half filled with barrelsof gunpowder. A narrow door gave exit to the path below. “Comeon!” cried Fortescue."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL3636“We shall be caught, sir,” answered Glass. “Let me stay here;I can delay them long enough to let you get away.” The officersaw the good sense of this; his first duty was to deliver thedispatches. He wrung Glass by the hand, and ran out.The sergeant of marines knew that he had barely an hour; buthe had a plan in his mind. His first action was to twist a longmatch from the gunpowder to that window of the cottage whichlooked over the cliff; his next to strip himself and the dead sen-tinel of uniform, and to dress the corpse in his own. He thenfound a piece of rope and hanged the body in the doorway.He dressed himself in the brigand’s best clothes; but, notcontent with masculine adornment, he covered himself with theall-sufficing mantilla. He was a smooth-faced good-looking boy;with the shawl, he made a quite passable Spanish girl — to thewaist.He then took up his position at the window by the door, sothat the lower part of his body was hidden, and awaited thepursuers. It was near twilight when they arrived. Their leadergrasped what he thought to be the situation. “Where is the other?”he cried. Glass smiled divinely. Unluckily for him, he knewonly a few words of any tongue but English. But a finger to hislips, and the sign of beckoning, reassured the others; they fileddown the path, and crowded into the cottage. “Where’s the girl?”cried the leader, “are we in a trap? Look to your arms, men!”Before he had ended, Glass, who had run upstairs to the otherroom, had touched fire to the match. “Let Samson perish withthe Philistines!” he roared, and at the same moment leaped fromthe window.The cottage sprang into the air, killing every man in it; Glasslay fifty feet below upon a thorn-bush, with one arm broken andmany bruises, but good for many another day’s adventure.A day later he had scrambled to the valley, where a shepherdshowed him kindness, and led him by a circuitous route to theBritish lines.Here he found himself a hero; for Fortescue had seen theexplosion, and given all due credit to his companion. But thesergeant’s arm went ill; for default of treatment, it had begun tomortify; the same night the surgeon removed it at the shoulder.Sir Arthur Wellesley himself came to the hospital to salutethe gallant lad. “Be glad it is the left arm;” he said brusquely:“Nelson lost his right. And for you, we’ll salve you with a com-mission as lieutenant in the regular army.” Glass was overjoyed;the loss of his arm seemed little, if he could have a sword at hisside, epaulets on his shoulder, and the rank of an officer and agentleman thenceforward.II.Lieutenant Glass, obtaining six months leave, at the end ofthe campaign of 1805, returned to his ancestral croft on thenorthwest side of Loch Ness to find that both his father andmother were dead. A friend in Inverness had warned him as hepassed through; but piety made him persist in his journey; hemight as well spend his leave there as elsewhere.It was a stone cottage of two rooms, set high above the lochupon the moor. Away westward stretched the desolate slopes ofMeallfavournie; below, the gloomy waters of the loch growledwith the cold anger of the Highland winter.There was no other habitation for a couple of miles. Aroundthe croft was a niggard space of cultivated land, yielding withbitter toil a few oats and a few potatoes; nothing more.The laird, Grant of Glenmoriston, had sent a man to takepossession of the croft, pending instructions from Glass. Hewas a sturdy lad of sixteen years, self-reliant and secretive; hehad kept the cottage in excellent order, and tilled the soil aswell as may be in that inhospitable country. Glass kept him onas permanent gardener and servant; but he was rather an accen-tuation than an alleviation of the loneliness. However, on thefirst Sunday, when the lieutenant walked down to Strath Errickto church, he found himself the apple of the congregational eye.Even Chisholm, the minister, a dour narrow Calvinist of theoldest school, was moved to make a complimentary referencein his sermon; and, after kirk was over, carried away the officerin triumph to the manse, there to share the miserable substitutefor a meal which is all that any Scot dare eat on Sunday, inapprehension of the Divine displeasure.Chisholm was a widower. He had one daughter, skinny andfrosty, with a straight back, thin lips, a peaked nose, bad teeth,and greedy eyes. But her flat chest almost burst as the ideacame to her, as it did in a flash, to become Mrs. LieutenantGlass. It was a way out of her horrible environment; despite thelost arm, he was a fine figure of a man; he was a hero, had beenmentioned twice in despatches since he had gained his com-mission; he would get his company very soon. Promotion wasquick in those days. Captain, major, colonel — possibly evenGeneral Glass! She saw Strath Errick left far north; instead,presentation at Court, social advancement of every kind; possi-bly a stately visit or so later on, and a snubbing of the localgentry who had always looked down upon the minister’s daugh-ter. She soon discovered that she had four clear months to catchher fish; poor and plain as she was, she had no rivals in thedistrict; Glass, the crofter’s son, for all his epaulets, had nomore chance to marry into the local aristocracy than she had.She went to work with infinite thoroughness and persistence;she enlisted her father’s aid; she laid siege to Glass in everyknown form.The lieutenant, for his part, knew that he might do muchbetter. The salons of London were full of better matches; andhis peasant ancestry would not be known there. All Highland-ers of rank were “gentry” to the average London mother. Butthe same instinct that led him to live in the deserted croft madehim now hesitate to transplant himself to London; the soilgripped him; he soon determined to throw out a new anchor inthe granite; and in March, 1807, he was married to Ada Chisholmin the kirk of Strath Errick. A month later he rejoined his regi-ment; he had taken his wife to Edinburgh for the honeymoon,and she left him at Leith to return to her father’s house, whilehe set sail for the new campaign in Europe.He gained his captaincy the same year; two years more elapsedbefore he saw his wife again. In the summer of 1809 he againdistinguished himself in the field, and obtained his majority. Asevere wound left him in hospital for three months; and on re-covery he asked, and was granted, six months’ sick leave.His wife was enthusiastic; she had traveled all the way toLondon to meet him; and he arranged to have her presented atCourt. Her head was completely turned by its splendor; and sheresolutely opposed the spending of the six months in Scotland.They went accordingly to Bath instead, and she revelled in thesocial glories of the place.Glass was not at all in love with his wife; and she had nomore sex than one of the oatmeal scones; but he was an extraor-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL3737dinarily simple soul, with rigid ideas of honesty. He had ac-cordingly been faithful to her in his absence, while she wouldno more have thought of deceiving him than of eating grass.They left Bath in December, 1809. They had been extrava-gant; and, nolens volens, she was obliged to go back to herfather’s manse to live. Probably her husband would get his regi-ment in a year or so; the war might be over too, by then; andthey could live pleasantly enough in London, or a jolly garrisontown, for the rest of their lives.In June, 1810, Glass had a letter from his wife, apprising himof the birth of a son. She proposed to call him Joshua, as hisfather was so great a captain.The arrival of Joshua changed Glass as completely as a drug-habit or an access of insanity. He knew that he would have towait a long time for his colonelcy. Short of capturing Napoleonsingle-handed, he had no chance in the world. His quick risefrom the ranks had made him hated by snobbish and incompe-tent fellow-officers; and the extreme modesty of his mannerwas no protection. They hated him, as birth without worth al-ways hates worth without birth. Even Wellington — who hadnever lost sight of him — could not do every thing against sobitter an opposition. His fellow-officers had even laid trap aftertrap for him, and it had needed all his Scottish caution to avoidthem.These reflections settled him in one momentous decision. Hemust save ten thousand pounds. Joshua must go to Eton, andstart on fair terms, if human determination could secure it. Heconsequently, from an open-handed, free and easy man, becamea miser. Instead of increasing his wife’s allowance, he cut itdown. And he sent every penny he could save from his pay to afriendly banker in Edinburgh, who promised to double it in fiveyears. I may tell you at once, lest you start the wrong hare, thathe kept his word.III.That is not such a horrible story, so far, is it? And there seemfew elements of tragedy. Well, we go on.After the banishment of Napoleon to Elba, Major Glass re-joined his wife. This time there was no trip to Bath. The cottagewas furnished with just the extra things needed for Joshua; Glasshimself helped to till his own land, and market the produce.Ada resented this bitterly; there was no open quarrel, but shehid poison in her heart. “I have six thousand pounds in bank,”he had said, “but there’s no hope of a regiment now the war’sover; let us play safe a year or two until we have ten thousand;then we can live where we like, as gentlefolk, and make a greatercareer for the boy.” She saw the prudence of the plan, and couldnot argue against it; but she really hungered for social plea-sures, as only those do who are not born with the right to them.The boy himself gave no concern on the score of health; hewas hardy as a Highland lad should be; but his dispositiontroubled his father. He was silent and morose, was very long inlearning to speak, and he seemed lacking in affection. He wouldlie or sit, and watch his parents, in preference to playing. Whenhe did play, he did not do so simply and aimlessly, as mostchildren do. Even when he broke his toys, he neither cried norlaughed; he sat and watched them.Major Glass went back to his regiment at the end of 1814;his wife once again took shelter with her father. But a monthlater the minister fell ill; in March he died. Another ministeroccupied the manse; and there was nothing for Mrs. Glass butto go back to the croft on the moor. The boy still worked on thelittle apology for a farm; and his sister came to help tend Joshua,and assist in the housework.In 1815 Major Glass was present at the decisive battles inBelgium. And here befell the fate that transformed this simplecareer into the tragedy of horror which you have insisted that Ishould relate to you. The major was in command of the lastparty that held the shot-swept walls of Hougomont; and he ral-lied his men for their successful stand against Napoleon’s finaland desperate effort to regain that critical point. The Britishwere flooded at one spot; Glass, with a handful of reserves, leda rally, and broke the head of the French dagger-thrust. Andthen it was that a sabre-stroke beat down his guard; a secondblow severed his sword-arm. He was carried hastily to the ruinsof the farm, and his wound bandaged; but Napoleon, seeing histroops flung back, ordered another artillery attack; and a can-non-ball, breaking a rafter of the building, brought down theremains of the roof. A heavy beam fell across the Major’s legs,and crushed them.Such, however, was the prime soundness of his constitutionthat he did not die. It was a helpless, but perfectly healthy, torsowhich was carried some months later into the little croft aboveLoch Ness. His wife recoiled in horror — natural horror, nodoubt. It was only when he told her that the surgeon said that hemight live fifty years that she realized what infinite disasterhad befallen her. All her schemes of life had gone to wreck; shewas tied to that living corpse, in that wretched cottage, prob-ably for the rest of her life. “Half-pay,” she thought; “how longwill it take now to make up the ten thousand pounds?”IV.If Ada Glass had been a woman of intelligence, either goodor evil, she would have found some quick solution. But herthoughts were slow and dull; and she was blinded by the sense-less hate in her heart. Her days had been infinitely dull, eversince her father’s death; now, in that emptiness, a monster slowlygrew. And her husband understood her before she did herself.One day he found it in his mind that she might murder him; shehad dismissed the girl who had helped her, saying that nowthey must save money more carefully than ever. His quick witdevised a protection for himself. Calling the boy Andrew, nowa stout fellow of twenty-six years old, he sent him into Invernessfor a lawyer.With this man he had a long private interview, during whichseveral papers and memoranda were selected by the lawyer fromthe Major’s portfolio, in accordance with his instructions.That evening the lawyer returned to the croft with the newminister of Strath Errick, thus disposing of the difficulty causedby the inability of the soldier to sign papers.Later that night, Mrs. Glass having returned fromGlenmoriston, where she had been sent so as to have her out ofthe way, the major told her what he had done.I have placed my money, he explained, in the hands of twoexcellent trustees. If I should die before Joshua comes of age,the whole will be left to accumulate at the bank, and you mustlive upon the pension you will receive as my widow. The capi-tal will then be transferred to him at his majority, under certainrestrictions.

She began at last, deliber-ately, to pass from thought to action, to make her husband’slife, hideous at the best, into a most exquisite hell.You are perhaps aware that our greatest misery is impotenceto act freely. Deprivation of a sense or a limb is wretched prin-cipally because of the limit it sets to our activities. This, morethan anything else, is at the root of our dread of blindness orparalysis. You remember Guy de Maupassant’s story of the blindman on whom his family played malicious tricks? It seems pe-culiarly cruel to us because of the victim’s helplessness. Now,of all the savages upon the earth, there are none more ferociousor more diabolical than the Highlanders of Scotland. Dr. Frazergives many instances of incredibly vile superstitions, in vogueeven at this hour as we sit in the enlightened Hemlock Club.“Scratch the Russian and you find the Tartar?” well, scratch theScotchman, and you have a being who can give points and abeating to the Chinese or the Red Indian. The sex-instinct isespecially powerful in the Celt; where it is nobly developed, wefind genius, as among the Irish; but where it is thwarted by areligion like Calvinism, it nearly always turns to madness or tocruelty — which is a form of madness.To return to the point, Ada Glass set her wits to work. Thehideous loneliness of the Highlands in the eye of all those whohave not the true soul of the artist is a true antecedent conditionto morbid imagination; and Ada Glass and her sexlessness thependant to it.She began operations by neglect. She postponed attentionwhen he called for her; and she became careless in the prepara-tion of his meals. He saw the intention, and agonized mentallyfor weeks. Ultimately he resolved to kill himself in the onlyway possible, by refusing food. She retorted by the tortures ofTantalus, setting spiced and savory foods under his nose, sothat he was physically unable to resist — after a while. Thefiendishness of this was heightened by its manner; the wholeplan was carried out with inconceivable hypocrisy on both sides.She would use such words of love and tenderness as had neveroccurred to her on the honeymoon.Such courses are set upon a steepening slope of damnation.Soon ideas incredibly abominable came into her mind, perhapssuggested by the tortures of hunger and thirst to which she sub-mitted him. For she varied her pleasure by offering him sweet-smelling foods that on tasting were found to be seasoned withsalt and pepper, so that only extreme hunger would make a maneat of them. Then she would excite his thirst by such hot dishes,and put salt in the water which he demanded to assuage it. Butalways she would apologize and blame herself, and weep overhim, and beg forgiveness. And he would pretend to be deceived,and grant his pardon. And then she would speak of love, and—— but no! gentlemen, I must leave you to dot the i’s andcross the t’s in the story.Presently — after months of this miserable comedy — shetook it into her head to excite his jealousy. (I want you to re-member all the time, by the way, that these people were abso-lutely alone, with no distraction whatever, save the rare andformal visits of the minister. And Glass was far too proud andbrave to speak of what was going on.) She began to set her capat the gardener. As I said, she had no more feeling than a sauce-pan; it was all bred out of her by Calvinism; but she knew howto act. She knew her husband’s own stern view of marriage; shethought she would break his spirit by infraction of her vows.For that is what it had come to, though she probably did notrealize it; she wanted to see the hero of a dozen campaignssnivel and whine and whimper like a cur. Many women indulgea similar ambition.So she set herself to snare the gardener. It was an easy task.He was a rough, rude laborer, a vigorous, healthy animal. Andshe wooed him as she had seen the fine ladies of Bath do withtheir cavaliers. Once his first shyness was overcome, he be-came her slave; and from that moment she began to play hernext abominable comedy. Her husband must suspect for a longwhile before he knew for certain. And so she laid her plans. Shewatched the fleeting thoughts upon his face hour by hour. Soonshe imbued her lover with hatred of his master; and she per-suaded him one day to kiss her in the room where the Major layon his pallet of straw. She had long since deprived him of a bed,urging the trouble of making it up. The spasm of pain upon hisface, the violent words that he addressed to her, these were hergreatest triumph so far. She went on with her plan; she went tothe utmost extremity of shamelessness; the gardener, with nosensibility, thought it merely a good joke, in the style of Boccacio.For weeks this continued, always with increasing success; thenGlass suddenly made up his mind to bear it — or something inhis heart broke. At least it became evident that he was no longersuffering. Her refinement imagined a new device, a thing soabominable that it almost shames manhood even to speak of it.She resolved to corrupt the child. Joshua was now old enoughto understand what was said to him; and she privately coachedhim in hate and loathing for his father. Also, she taught him thepleasures of physical cruelty. (I told you this was a hideous story.)Major Glass, deprived of all exercise, had become terriblyobese. He was a frightful object to look upon; a vast dome ofbelly, a shrunk chest, a bloated and agonized face. Four stumpsonly accentuated the repulsion. It was only too easy to persuadethe child to play infamous tricks. By this time she had thrownoff the mask of her hypocrisy; she taunted him openly, and jeered;she spat out rivers of hate at him; and she let him know that sheno longer wished the society of Bath, that she was glad that hemight live half a century; for never until now had she knownpleasure. And she incited the boy to stick long pins into thehelpless log. “You’re not even like a pig any more,” she laughedone night, “you’re like a pincushion!” And Joshua, with an evillaugh, walked up upon that word, and thrust three pins into thetense abdomen. He ran to his mother gleefully, and imitated theinvoluntary writhings of the sufferer.This game recommenced every night. The intervals were butanticipations of some further abomination. He had long prayedaudibly for death; now he began to beg her for some means of it.She laughed at him contemptuously. “If you hadn’t settled themoney as you did, I might have thought of it. After all, I oughtto marry again.”He answered her in an unexpected vein. “I’ll make it easy foryou. One night, when snow threatens, take Joshua down to aneighbor’s. Pretend you are ill, and stay the night. Leave thedoor open when you go; I think a chill would kill me. And I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL3939want to die so much!” She gloated over the weakness of hisspirit. “If you’ll swear on the Bible to do that,” he went on, “I’lltell you the great secret.” Instantly she became attentive; shedivined something of importance. “When I was in Spain,” contin-ued Glass, “I was quartered in a certain castle belonging to oneof the grandees. He was an old man, paralysed, as helpless as Iam to-day. His lady, at the first of the invasion, had buried thefamily treasure in a secret place. There are diamonds there, andpieces of eight, and many golden ornaments. They told me thisone night under the following strange circumstances ——” hebroke off. “Give me water! I’m faint, of a sudden.” She broughtit to him. Presently he continued in a firmer voice. “One day wewere attacked by a body of French troops — a reconnaissancein force. The castle was surrounded. I and the few men withme, our retreat cut off, prepared to defend ourselves, and ourhost and hostess, to the last. We were driven from floor to floor.But one of my men, sore wounded, lying below, determined ona desperate resource. He managed to crawl to the cellar, wheregreat quantities of wood were stored; and he set it on fire. TheFrench, alarmed, beat a hasty retreat from the precincts; I andmy few remaining men pursued them to the gates. The fightwould doubtless have been renewed, but at that moment theplumes of our dragoons appeared in the distance. The Frenchsprang to their horses and were off. I returned hastily to thecastle, and we succeeded in extinguishing the fire. I bore thelady in my own arms into the fresh air, through all the smoke;two of my men rescued the old count. That afternoon they had along conference together, and in the evening said that they haddecided to tell me of the treasure.In case misfortune should happen to them both, I was to pledgemyself to convey the paper, which they then intrusted to me, totheir only son, who was fighting in our army. I readily agreed. Afew nights later the devil tempted me; I opened the paper. Itwas a mass of meaningless figures, a cipher; but I had the key.I worked it out; I went to the place indicated; there lay the trea-sure. But my heart smote me; not mine be a fouler than the sinof Achan! I replaced the earth. I returned, and prayed all nightfor a clean heart.Shortly afterwards I changed my quarters; we were retreat-ing. On our next advance I returned to pay a visit to my kindhosts. Alas! They had been murdered by a band of guerillas. Asduty bade, I sought the son; but again I was too late; he hadfallen in battle on the third day of our advance.I have kept the secret locked in my breast; I would not touchthe treasure, though it was now as much mine as anybody’s,because I had been tempted. But now I see necessity itself com-mand me; I am no longer man enough to endure the torturewhich I suffer ——” Here his voice broke. “I will give you thekey if you will do as I say; and when I am dead you are free to goand find it.”Ada Glass made her mind up in a moment. She was eager.After all, there were other pleasures in the world than — whatshe had been enjoying.“Take the Bible,” said Glass, “and swear!” She did so with-out a tremor. It was an oath to commit murder; but the Scotsmind does not halt in such a case.“Good,” said the Major. “Now look in the uniform case; you’llfind the cipher sewn into my tunic; it’s in the lining of the leftsleeve.” His wife obediently unpicked the stuff. A small map,with a row of hieroglyphic figures, was in her hand. “Now tellme the key!” Glass began to breathe with difficulty; he spoke ina faint voice. “Water!” he whispered. She brought him a fullglass, and he drank it, and sighed happily. “The key’s a word,”he said. “What? I can’t hear you.” She came over close to him.“The key’s a word. It’s in the Bible. I’ll remember it if you’llread the passage. I marked it in the book. It’s somewhere inJudges.” He was evidently speaking with the greatest possibleeffort; and even so, she could hardly hear him. She brought theBible across to him, but it was too dark to read; so she fetchedthe lamp and set it upon the floor at his side. “About ChapterEight: I can’t remember.” “Chapter which?” “I think it’s eight.”“Eight?” “Yes.” It was the faintest murmur. He had been likethat for some days; now it alarmed her; might he die withoutrevealing the secret? She fetched some whiskey, and gave it tohim to drink.“Oh, is it this,” she said, “about Samson in the mill? It’smarked in red.” “Yes,” he said, still very faintly, “read fromthere.” She sat down by his head, and began to read. After eachverse she questioned him; he signed to her to go on. Presentlyshe came to the verse “And Samson said ‘Let me perish withthe Philistines’.” “It’s there,” he said. “It’s ——” his voice diedaway to nothing. “You’re not ill, are you?” she cried in alarm.“I’m going to die,” he gasped out, word by word. “Tell me theword!” she screamed, “for God’s sake, man, don’t die first!”“It’s ——” Again the voice died away. “Do, do try!” she said,putting her ear over his mouth. Instantly, with utter swiftness,his iron jaw closed like a vice upon her ear. She pulled away,screaming, but she might as well have tried to dislodge a bull-dog. Indeed, she helped him to roll over toward the lamp. Ajerk of one stump, and the oil flamed among the straw of thepallet.The dying shrieks of his mother woke Joshua. He jumped outof bed, came into the room, saw the two bodies writhing in theflames. He clapped his hands gleefully, and ran out into thesnow.———“I admit it’s a pretty ghastly story,” cried Jack Flynn, whohad evoked it; “but I don’t see what in heaven’s name it has towith you, and saving the Hemlock Club!”“Because, my young friend, as usual, you have not conde-scended to wait for the end of it. The events that I have been atthe pains to recount occurred during the usurpation of Georgethe Third, so-called.” (It was the club custom always to speakof the Georges as usurpers.) “My part begins in the year 1850of the vulgar era.”In February of that year an anonymous book entitled “A Jeal-ous God,” was published through a well-known firm — I forgetthe name for the moment. The book made a great stir in reli-gious circles. The author, evidently an authority on theology,had taken the teachings of Victorian Science as a commentary,and his work was principally intended to complete the ruin ofDeism. The author insisted upon the cruelty and imbecility ofnature; pointed out that all attempts to absolve the Creator fromthe responsibility must culminate in Manichaeism or some otherform of Dualism; and proceeded to interpret the wisdom of theDeity as His ability to trick His creatures, His power as Hiscapacity to break and torture them, and His glory as witnessedchiefly by the anguish and terror of His victims. I need hardlysay, that the author, although anonymous, professed himself amember of the Exclusive Plymouth Brethren."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4040He was proposed for this club, as a prominent and deservingheretic of great originality; and I was the youngest member ofthe committee appointed to inquire into the matter. I took aninstinctive dislike to the unknown author; I opposed the elec-tion with my ability. I proved that the book was perfectly ortho-dox, being but an expansion of John III:16. I pointed out thatCharles Haddon Spurgeon had endorsed the principal teachingsof the book; that evangelical clergymen all over England weredoing the same thing, with only negligible modifications; but Iwas overruled.We then proceeded to inquire into the authorship of the book;we discovered that his name was Joshua Glass.”A thrill of terrible emotion passed through the old man’s hear-ers. “I refused to withdraw my opposition. I investigated; and Idiscovered the facts which to-night I have set forth before you.”“But there’s nothing in the rules against that sort of thing!”interrupted one of the men.“You will not let me finish!”“I beg your pardon.”“I studied the facts with intense care; I tried to trace to theirtrue source the phenomena displayed by all parties. UltimatelyI came to a conclusion. I began to believe that in this case aphysical correspondence with the mental and moral state ex-hibited might exist. . . .”“And so?” interrupted Jack Flynn, excitedly, a gleam in hiseye. “I insisted upon a physical examination. I found a malfor-mation so curious and monstrous that, despite his human par-entage, it was impossible to admit him any title to membershipof our race.”There was a long silence of complete astonishment. The oldmagician opened his case, drew out a long cigar, and lighted it.“Any one coming my way?” he asked, rising.“I’m coming, if I may, sir,” said Flynn, sprightly. “I want totalk mysticism for an hour, to get the taste out of my mouth.”Wolf looked like a poet. He had the traditional long hair anddreamy eyes ornamenting a dark face, and he was as poor as apoet, but he wrote the most miserable drivel —— But he was avery agreeable fellow, Wolf was, and all the Yiddish writingfraternity was very anxious about his welfare. None of the newWeeklies or Monthlies ever started without at least one of Wolf’spoems. Yet Wolf was slowly starving.Berger, the well known Jewish banker, was a very frequentguest of the writer’s club. So Berger was approached in Wolf’sbehalf; not that he give the poet alms but that he give him a job.Wolf got the job and was paid fifty dollars a month. His dutieswere manifold; he had to roll packages of nickel and silver coin,and in spare time he turned out rhymed advertisement whichthe banker published in the papers.Wolf must have felt at first very grateful to his patron em-ployer. Regular meals after a long period of intermittent starva-tion make one cheerful and happy. This was the cause that aftera while his appetite was more directed to quality than to quan-tity; it frequently happened that Wolf should run short of moneyat the end of the week.He would then come around the club and borrow a dollar ortwo to be returned at the first opportunity.As he had a job, Wolf’s poems were no longer forced uponeditors by kind friends. They had to stand on their own merit.Very few of them were either bad enough or good enough to beprinted, so Wolf became known as “The Banker” and lost stand-ing as a poet.One Sunday afternoon Berger sat in the cafe of the club drink-ing tea and talking of the expensive things he owned. He wasnot given to bragging. It was business. He wanted to gain theconfidence of the people so that they might deposit with himthe money of the Jewish war relief-funds.“I made some improvements on my country house and it costme forty thousand dollars.”“And what is the house worth?” someone asked, which wasjust what Berger wanted.“A quarter of a million,” he replied negligently between sipsfrom his glass.Wolf came in and sat down at the same table with his em-ployer and the rest of the people. To talk of his fortune wasplainly inviting disaster; and a well known journalist who wascollecting funds for the war relief saw his opportunity and askedthe banker to contribute. It was a bad stroke. The whole caféstood at attention.“What is the top figure on your list,” the banker calmly asked.“Hefner, with thousand dollars.”“Which Hefner, the banker or his brother, if you please, tellme?”“The banker.”“Well, if that be so, if Hefner gives thousand dollars, I caneasily give five thousand dollars and feel it less than if he givesfifty cents.”Thus speaking Berger took out his check-book and the whileall the heads drew into a circle over the piece of paper, thebanker filled out the promised sum, and tendered it to the happysolicitor. It created a sensation. Every new guest was told aboutit. “Berger gave five thousand dollars.”People hastened down the stairs, rushing to the cafe to tell toeverybody the great news. It was telephoned to the Jewish andEnglish papers. While expecting the reporters, Berger contin-ued to speak as though nothing important had happened, of thecostly things he possessed. All the while Wolf sat as quiet as amouse. Simply struck speechless.“I bought last week two chairs and they cost me a hundreddollars,” Berger said; “a carved oak table for a hundred andfifty, a candelabra for seventy dollars; and my cane costs meforty dollars.”The eyes of every one were on this lucky mortal when WolfCOSTLY PILLOWSBy KONRAD BERCOVICI"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4141youth and strength. It is hard even now to say if this had beenbetter. The holy man did indeed recover, did attain to yet greaterthings, did awake a great people to aspiration; no operation couldever have been more successful. Yet still remaineth doubt as towhether the natural order of things had not conceived a finerflowering.But this is a general objection of the sceptical sort to allmiracles of whatever kind, and leadeth anon into the quagmireof arguments about Free Will. The adept will do better to relyupon the Book of the Law, which urgeth constantly to action.Even rash action is better than none, by that Light; let the magi-cian then argue that his folly is part of that natural order whichworketh all so well.And this may be taken as a general license to perform anyand every miracle according to one’s Will.The argument has therefore been swung to each extreme; and,like all arguments, ends in chaos.The above concerning true miracles; but with regard to falsemiracles the case is altogether different.Since it is part of the Magick of every one to cause both Na-ture and man to conform to the Will, man may lawfully be in-fluenced by the performance of miracles. But true miraclesshould not be used for this purpose; for it is to profane the na-ture of the miracle, and to cast pearls before swine; further,man is so built that he will credit false miracles, and regard truemiracles as false. It is also useful at times for the magician toprove to them that he is an impostor; therefore, he can easilyexpose his false miracles, where this must not be done wherethey are true; for to deny true miracles is to injure the power toperform them.Similarly, none of the other objections cited above apply tofalse miracles; for they are not, properly speaking, magick atall, and come under the heading of common acts. Only in so faras common acts are magick do they come under consideration,and here the objection may be raised that they are, peculiarly,Error; that they simulate, and so blaspheme, the Truth. Cer-tainly this is so, and they must only be performed for the pur-pose of blinding the eyes of the malicious, and then only in thatpeculiar spirit of mockery which delights them that be initiatesin the Comedy of Pan.The end of the matter then is that as in Comedy and Tragedyall things are lawful, live thou in Comedy or Tragedy eternally,never blinding thyself to think Life aught but mummery, andperform accordingly the false miracles or the true, as may beThy Will.Love is the law, love under will.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It is not possible for the Master, O my brethren, who hasfought so long with those things within Himself which havehindered Him, to expect that if toys be given to children theywill not play with them. But watch may rightly be held lest theyinjure themselves therewith; this paper, therefore, as a guard.O my brethren, even as every dog is allowed one bite, so letevery wonder-worker be allowed one miracle. For it is rightthat he should prove his new power, lest he be deceived by thewile and malice of the apes of Choronzon.But with regard to the repetition of miracles the case is notsimilar. Firstly cometh forth the general magical objection. Thebusiness of the aspirant is to climb the Middle Pillar fromMalkuth to Kether; and though the other Pillars must be graspedfirmly as aids to equilibrium, he should in no wise cling to them.He aspires to the Knowledge and Conversation of his HolyGuardian Angel, and all other works are deviations. He may,however, perform miracles when necessary in order to carry outthis main work; thus, he may perform a divination to assist himto discover a suitable house for the purpose, or even evoke aplanetary spirit to guard him and aid him during the time ofpreparation, if it be necessary. But in all such works let him bewell assured in himself that his sole object is really that Knowl-edge and Conversation. Otherwise, he has broken concentra-tion. And the One Work alone being White Magick, all othersare Black Magick.Secondly ariseth a similar objection derived from consider-ations of Energy. For all miracles involve loss; as it is said, “sheperceived that virtue had gone out of Him.” The exception istherefore as follows, that such miracles as tend to the conserva-tion or renewal of Energy are lawful. Thus the preparation ofthe Elixir of Life is blameless; and the practices of the IX° ofO. T. O. in general, so far as they have for object the gain ofStrength, Youth and Vitality.It may further be considered just to perform miracles to aidothers, within certain limits. One must consciously say: I delib-erately sacrifice Energy and my own Great Work for this Ob-ject. Therefore the magician must first of all calculate whetheror no the Object be worthy of the sacrifice. Thus, in the firstyear of the Path of the Master Therion, he, with V. H. FraterVolo Noscere, evoked the Spirit Buer to save the life of V. H.Frater Iehi Aour; saying in themselves: The life of this holyman is of vast importance to this Aeon; let us give up this smallportion of our strength for this great end.

Thetwelve cents interest plus the fifty cents for storage the pawn-shop-keeper charges every week, brought up the cost of thosetwo pillows until they are the costliest things of their kind inthe world.”When Wolf finished telling his story, Berger knew that hisfive thousand dollars were wasted.

When Iheard your opinion, there was only one thing for me to do; Iwrote to cousin Henri in Paris, and he has got me a position Iwould rather hold than take out of my knapsack that field-marshal’s baton that they told me hid there!”“And what is that?” asked the doctor.“I am to go with du Chaillu to the Gold Coast — with duChaillu, the greatest of all our explorers!

Hadn’t you better catch her first?”“Ah no! I trust her. And she is better with her people for ayear or two. She is very young yet to marry. And they will neverlet her marry any one else; there are family reasons, too, youknow. Besides, she loves me. Ah! bonjour, Monsieur le Curé,”he broke off, rising on his crutch and bowing. The doctor rose,too, but his bow was painfully formal. The priest gave them hisgreeting, and passed on.He was an extraordinary type, strong and long, but so leanthat he enjoyed the reputation of the most stern asceticism. Hisface was in contradiction, for it was haughty, passionate, ambi-tious, and overwhelmingly sensual, with an expression of avidand insatiable desire. His eyes were dead, lack-lustre wells ofquenchless passion. He was either a very good or a very badman.“You do not like Father de Choisy,” said Larue.The doctor was silent a moment. “Why should a man of hisnoble family and his amazing ability be lost in this desert?” hesaid at last. “He ought to be a bishop, by now, and here he is inArques-le-Roi. Oh well! we know what we know. We have seenwhat we have seen.” The soldier’s frankness took some offence.“I cannot hear you speak evil of my priest,” said he.“I was wrong,” replied the doctor, crossing himself, “and mayGod pardon me! I had better stick to my bistoury. Here’s yourhated rival, by the way. A surly fellow swaggered towards themand, sitting down at a table on the other side of the doorway,called for brandy. He was already partly drunk, and his nod tothe others barely civil; his greeting an unintelligible grunt. Whenthe patron of the inn came out with the brandy, he invited himto take a “petit verre.” The good man complied.“Should I fear a drunken lout of that type for a rival?” saidthe soldier aside to his medical friend.THE MASS OF SAINT SECAIREFrom the French of Barbey de RochechouartTranslated by Mark WellsThe young man, whose name was Dufour, cast a hostile glanceat the Captain, and, touching his glass to the innkeeper’s, pro-posed “The fairest eyes, and the truest heart in Arques!” Thegood man drank willingly; he did not guess that all this wouldlead up to a brawl. Dufour’s next toast was more provocative.“Drink to my love, the fair Félise!” he cried. Captain Laruemade no movement; ‘Felise’ was non-committal, though he knewthat insult was intended.“I am a lucky man, patron,” the boor went on; “she loves meso, Félise! Every night we have a stolen meeting in the woodbehind the château. The old man suspects nothing, or the dragonon guard either. Ah, but she is sweet, the little piece of mut-ton!”This time the doctor spoke to his friend. “It is useless to havea row. Let us go down to your house together!” Larue nodded,and rose stiffly. “Bon soir, patron!” he said, and the old manrose politely and returned the salutation. But the youth was outfor trouble, and filled his glass again.“And here’s luck to my Félise; and when I’ve done with her,may she marry some rotten old cripple!” Larue turned and facedhim.“Your conversation is interesting, sir; pardon me if I askwhether you are referring to me!” The sot replied with the oneFrench monosyllable that cannot be construed as a compliment.Larue turned and faced him. He clubbed his crutch, and struckthe boor a swinging blow on the head. He dropped like a treeunder the axe of the backwoodsman. The captain took no fur-ther notice; he walked home nonchalantly with the doctor. “If Iwere not a good Catholic,” was the latter’s only comment, “Icould cry Vive la Revolution Sociale! To think that that swineshould be the richest man in Arques!” Just then the door of avery smart little house opened, and a lady appeared. She wasdressed in widow’s weeds, very heavily and very quietly, andshe had composed her face to melancholy. Sacred books were inher hand; she was evidently on her way to vespers. Her facebelied the rest of her attire; for all its composure, it radiatedsome element of matured rottenness which would have bettersuited a woman of the Buttes Montmatre or the Halles. Evil,conscious, joyous evil, laughed behind her mask. The soldiercould hardly refrain from a gesture of aversion as she passed. “Iam not a good Catholic, my dear doctor,” he replied, “for char-ity is above all the Catholic virtue; and when I see that womanI say ‘There goes the devil to mass.’” “Shame!” cried the doc-tor, “the good Marquise! she is the model of all the virtues. Iwonder what my hospital would do without her. Why, she of-fered to nurse your leg!” “I know, I’m a brute,” answered thesoldier, “and I’ve a silly way of trusting instinct instead of rea-son; if I must find you a reason, it’s this; I notice that the chil-dren avoid her. Come in, and have a glass of wine before wepart. Next week I’ll be packing my kit, and off on the long trailagain!” “Well,” laughed the doctor, “with our funny likes anddislikes, you had better bring your ape-man back to Arques toteach us manners.

The greatclock of the ancient church of Arques tolled twelve. Arques, bythe way, was a place of some ecclesiastical importance. As itsname, Arques-le-Roi, implied, it had at one time been a favor-ite resort of the Kings of France, who had a château there. Thischateau had passed into the hands of the Dufours, enormouslywealthy manufacturers of silk, with factories at Lyon employ-ing 20,000 people.So the church was disproportionate to the village. It containedsome extraordinary fine stained glass, and the architecture wassuperb. It occupied a charming situation against the slope of agreen hill, crowned with fantastic rocks about which popularfancy wove many a legend of fays, and druids, and magicians.It was winter, and the skies were cold — glittering with stars.But when the half hour sounded after midnight, and the vestrydoor opened suddenly, young Dufour, who came out, was paleand sweating heavily like one in a great fever. He staggeredrather than walked; he seemed to grope both for sight and forsupport. Presently, reaching the white road, he seemed to re-cover himself a little; but he still shook and trembled as hewalked along it.Presently de Choisy himself came out. He was in perfect pos-session of all his faculties; but instead of turning into his house,as might have been expected, his long determined stride tookhim to the old bridge across the river. On this bridge were cer-tain shelters, Gothic in type, which had been shrines before theRevolution. At the sound of his step, the lady who so arousedthe antipathy of Captain Larue stepped out of the central niche.“You are late, François!” she cried. “It is a wonder I am here atall, Jeanne; something happened.”“Good!”“It nearly killed Dufour.”“Oh how splendid! How I wish I had been there. What wasit?”“Probably imagination. But I’m not given that way. Dufourhowled, and then fainted. Bringing him round has kept me allthis time.”“But what was it?”“Well, it seemed to both of us that there was something abovethe altar — something with an ass’ head and bat’s wings; butenormous — enormous!”“Oh how I wish I had been there!”“You shall come next time. But he must never know, ofcourse.”“Of course. These three months have been hell upon earth.How happy I am!” She put a hand upon his arm, and a look oftigerish ecstasy came into her eyes.“To be the altar!” she cried, “to hold the chalice of the LivingOne! To outrage God and Christ! I live for nothing else! Herewas what hindered me!” She drew a square black case from thefolds of her heavy fur.“The imp of Satan?” laughed the priest.“You told me; I obeyed.”“No baptism, no burial. But not here. Let us go to the oldwell behind Pére Fauchard’s orchard!”As they walked the conversation turned on other themes. Itappeared that Dufour, an atheist, not by conviction, but by per-versity, and very superstitious, was squandering his father’smillions on an attempt to learn black magic. He was absolutelycrazy about Félise, the betrothed of Larue, and not only usedthe priest to teach him the Black Art, which he supposed a shortcut to all his longings, but to supply him with information, andto use his influence with the girl’s parents. The mother, a bigot,was rather in favor of the rich young man; but the father was anold soldier, and counselled Félise to be true to his brother-in-arms. No news had come from Larue in the two years, exceptone letter, dirty and brief, written in pencil with a hand quakingwith high fever, in which he announced that he was well, butwas about to plunge into a swamp even deadlier than that hehad been through, and heaven only knew when he could writeagain.De Choisy then began to speak of his own affairs. He seemedto build great hopes of his bishopric on Dufour’s wealth andinfluence; strings were being pulled in all directions at Romeand elsewhere.“How good you are!” cried the Marquise, “you never reproachme. I can never forgive myself that it was I who broke yourcareer.”“It was worth it,” he replied, with a smile.“I have sold my soul to the devil,” she purred, “to you — andthe price is your bishopric. You shall have it! And will you giveDufour his heart’s wish, too? I should like him to have that thinlittle beast of a Félise!”“I think she would yield but for her father!”“Well — can we not do as we did for my — for the Mar-quise?”“I think we may have to. It is a pity; the doctor here is a greatfool, but he is incorruptible, and he suspects me, for all my holyorders.”They came to the well. The priest took the black bag. “In thename of the devil,” he cried aloud, “sin to sin, shame to shame,fire to fire, child of Satan, I give thee to thy father!” With thathe flung the bag into the well. Then the apostate priest and thewretched victim of his abominable desires embraced with allthe ecstasy of long-pent passion.An hour later they suddenly became aware of the gray worldwithout their self-kindled hell of unlawful lust.On the hard road a mile away they heard the hoofs of a greathorse that thundered through the night. They started up in alarm;who, in the devil’s name, rode such a gallop in the small hoursbefore dawn? With quick understanding of the exigencies theyparted silently. They had no need of assignations; they wouldmeet again at the first mass of the morning.III.Indeed, the morning brought some confirmation of their alarm.One of de Choisy’s plans — a plan which would net him half amillion francs could he carry it through — had gone exceed-ingly agley. For the horseman of the night was none other thanour old friend Larue, back safe and sound from Africa. He hadtaken horse and ridden like the wind. He could not waste amoment on his way to the girl whose love had helped him toendure the thousand hardships of his journey, and steeled himto be sword and shield to du Chaillu, to bring his expedition toa successful end. The fabled ape-man was no fable after all, buta reality.The news was all over the village by early mass. The good"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4444old patron of the inn, awakened by Larue with a colossal shout,had served him breakfast, and as the early laborers passed, theyspread the tidings. Larue had gone straight over to the châteauof his betrothed to put an end to her anxieties — a man fromAfrica does not stand on calling-hours — and every one was inraptures. Except Dufour.This forlorn wretch sought out de Choisy, and found him atbreakfast, in his garden; for the morning had broken warm andsunny. The youth was in a state bordering on madness; havingblasphemed God, he now blasphemed the devil; and he brutallyreminded the priest that he had invested a quarter of a millionfrancs or thereabouts in black magic, and all he had had for itwas the scare of his life. The priest put him off smoothly; allwould yet go well; they would find a way to get rid of the ob-noxious soldier. But Dufour had spent the night with the brandybottle, to try to recover the nerve which he had lost when theapparition above the altar had knocked him senseless; he hadtried the same medicine for the shock of the news of Larue’sreturn; and he was in no condition to listen to the priest’s soph-istries. In vain de Choisy explained that the appearance in thechurch was a sort of warning of the ill luck that had followed,that it was only needful to evoke the devil again, ask his advice,and follow his instructions.Luckily Madame la Marquise de Branlecu happened to passby. On her arm was a basket of fine cakes and meats; she wasvisiting her poor. She paused, and looked over the wall,courtesying to the priest and asking his blessing. But Dufour,now savagely drunk, roared out his story at her. Her woman’swit rose deft to the occasion. “How nice for you!” she exclaimed,pretending to misunderstand, “and so your friend has come backafter you thought him lost. You must ask the good father to sayfor him the Mass of St. Sécaire!” She courtesied again; the priestrose and blessed her solemnly; Dufour stood aghast. Her mis-understanding, her nonchalance, stupefied him. The priest im-proved the occasion. “You are a young fool,” he said; “go homeand drink no more. Come to me when you are sober! I promiseyou by the faith of him we saw last night that you shall haveyour wish.” With a heavy hand on the wretch’s shoulder, hepushed him through the gate.Some hours later, the Marquise sought her lover in the con-fessional. “Abandoned woman!” he cried out upon her, “areyou so lost that you dare to mention that accursed rite? I havesinned, no doubt, but — the Mass of Saint Sécaire!”“My dear Father,” she answered laughingly, “I dare not ar-gue with a priest upon theology. But it seems to me that wehave no hope of salvation — unless we repent, which the devilforbid! — and that being so, the best thing we can do is to standas high as we can in the hierarchy of the damned! Come, let usdo it! If it succeeds, the money means success for us; if it fails,we are no worse off. Besides, I want to do it; I want to do it! Iwant to do it! I want to be your clerk!” “By all the flames ofhell!” replied the apostate, “certainly men are lost throughwomen. I will do it, though the devil drag us to damnation inthe very church itself!”That evening de Choisy explained to Dufour the peculiarmerits of the Mass of Saint Sécaire. “Let it work quickly!”grumbled the fool, “I bet he wastes no time in putting her in thepen.”In point of fact, the preparations for the mass took longerthan those for the marriage; the Church joined Captain Larueand Félise D’Aubigny in holy matrimony only four days later.It was a hard task to persuade Dufour to patience; but onecannot perform the Mass of Saint Sécaire except at the half-moon when she is waning. The priest and his mistress thoughtit best to admit him to a portion of their secrets; and he wascomforted.The Marquise exercised all her fascination and her tact; hehad only a few weeks to wait; if he got no satisfaction by then,why, we were all in the same boat. We would all give up thissilly magic, which led nowhere; Dufour should have his moneyback; we would try to get Félise for him in some other way, andall remain good friends.And, alone with de Choisy: “If the fool kicks, put him on tococaine; he’ll be mad in ten days, and no one will believe aword he may say. But that’s a last resource.”One night — they were rehearsing the mass for the grandoccasion — she asked him point blank if he believed in magic.“Well,” he answered, “I do and I don’t. Nothing has everhappened — nothing to be sure of. And yet — I hardly knowhow to put it — well — it comes off. I do an evocation to pro-duce a certain effect: nothing comes of it. But I hear a fortnightlater, perhaps, that something happened at that very time whichbrings about that effect in a perfectly natural way.”She showed that she did not care if it happened or no. “I loveit; I love it!” she cried; “there is nothing else in the world forme. But I want to see the devil myself; I want to give him all Ihave given you.” The priest made a wry face; then he turnedand crushed her with a kiss. “I love you for everything,” hecried.IV.The great clock of Arques-le-Roi boomed out eleven strokes.Instantly, at a distance of some three miles, a man’s voice an-swered it.The man was Father de Choisy. He was dressed in his mostnoble vestments, but the crosses on them had been elaboratedby dividing each arm into two parts, so that each cross madefour Ys at the base. He was standing at the ruined altar of adeserted chapel, a place long since given over to the owl andbat. There was enough roof left to give shelter to occasionaltramps or gypsies, but all trace of door or window was departed.By his side stood the atrocious woman who inspired him, robedalso as a priest, but with her garments looped in such a manneras to make the dress indecent. There were two lights upon thealtar, candles of black wax, both on the north side of what servedfor crucifix.This was a live toad nailed to a scarlet cross. Around it waswrapped a strip of linen, torn from one of Captain Larue’s shirtsby a bribed laundress. For incense a stick of yellow sulphursmouldered on charcoal.Through the open roof the stars looked calmly down upon theprofanation. The voice of de Choisy was the sole vibration inthat still air. He began to say the Mass, but reversing the orderof the words of every sentence. His voice was a peculiar nasaldrone, rising and falling by sharp and inharmonious changes.When he should have made the sign of the cross, instead hespat upon the ground, and crossed it with his left foot. The di-vine names he replaced by a peculiar hissing whistle.The host was triangular, made of unleavened oatmeal mixedwith blood. For chalice he used a vessel consecrated to all base-ness and impurity, and the cloth with which he covered it was a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4545napkin drenched in blood. It held no wine, but water from thatwell where he had hidden the evidence of his guilt.As the hideous rite proceeded, the priest became aware ofgreat need of firmness. His knees shook under him; again andagain he looked round as though to see some presence that hefelt. No: there was nobody there but his clerk, whose flamingred hair shone like fire itself in the night, curling out like ser-pents from under the biretta, and whose tigerish green eyes wereblazing with intense excitement. Neither noticed that the starsno longer shone above the chapel; neither realized that the at-mosphere had become suddenly hot and suffocating.It is impossible to tell the details of the final consecration ofthe accursed elements, with what defilements and curses theconsummation of the mass took place, or with what hideousgestures the apostates abandoned themselves to the adoration.But this must be told, that with the consecrated water the priestbaptized the toad in the name of Pierre Larue, saying: “As thiscreature of toads shall wither and die upon the cross, so let it bewith Pierre Larue!”The great clock of Arques-le-Roi boomed midnight. The cer-emony ended. The hysteria of the abominable celebrants dieddown; suddenly the woman took the priest’s arm. “Look!” shecried. The priest came to himself. The whole chapel was ablazewith globes of fire, and the storm shook the walls of the chapelwith whirling rage. A rotten beam came crashing from the roof.“Come away!” said the priest, unshaken, “there is danger here.”But at that instant the storm died down; the electricity of the airdischarged itself finally to earth; the stars shone out again. Butthe horror of real loneliness enveloped the celebrants as theystood without the chapel. From their sanctuary they had comeback into the world; and they were no longer of the world. Theyhad cut themselves off irrevocably from their fellow-creatures.The realization came to them simultaneously; for a moment theystood aghast. Then the woman’s passion turned loneliness toexaltation; she clung wildly to her accomplice, and their mouthsmet in solemn resignation to, and acceptance of, their ineffableand appalling doom.V.It was six months later. Pierre Larue and his bride had re-turned from a long honeymoon, beginning at St. Moritz, and con-tinuing through Pallanza and Florence, Rome and Naples, whencethey had gone to Seville for Easter, and returned through Spain.The village heard that they were well, and Dufour was indespair. But the priest had bethought him to pretend that thedevil had given him a certain “Wine of the Sabbath,” and pliedhim with a decoction of strange-sounding but quite innocentherbs which they gathered in mysterious ways at moonwane; inthis brew the cunning priest had infused solutions of morphineand cocaine. The sot soon took the habit, and thought less ofFélise every day; he spent most of his time running to the priest’shouse for a draught of the Devil’s Wine. De Choisy naturallyrefused to supply it for home consumption; unless it were keptunder a priest’s roof (it appeared) it would lose its virtue.It was early in June when Madame Larue came to the priest’shouse. She was a slight pretty girl with dark brown hair, a quietand pleasing manner of real delicacy and elegance. Marriagehad apparently not changed her; she was still looking out uponthe world with the child-eyes of innocence. One could see thatshe feared no evil; she had never known it. Her manner towardsthe priest was as simple and reverent as if she had been at firstcommunion. She told him her trouble very childishly, as if hehad indeed been her father in the flesh. “Pierre is changed,” shesaid; “he is not the same man that I married. I think he is ill, buthe will not admit it. He does not seem to care about any thing.He is always drowsy, and I think he has lost flesh.” De Choisygave her the obvious counsel, to tell her trouble to the doctor,ask him to dinner, and get him to make a quiet examination ofher husband. She promised to do so, and went away smiling.Only a few minutes later Dufour arrived for a dose of the Devil’sWine. “Courage, my son!” cried the excited priest, “the Massof Saint Sécaire is working at last. Pierre Larue is sick of amysterious malady. Courage, and a little more patience; the goalis in sight.”Two months later the illness of Larue was the common talk.Occasionally he would sally forth as of old to drink his wine onthe terrace of the inn; but he hardly spoke to any one, and wouldfall asleep in the sun, his Pommard barely tasted. He had grownstrangely thin and haggard; his weak leg seemed to give himtrouble, and he walked leaning heavily on a stout cane. Thedoctor had no idea what was the matter with him; his treatmenthad no effect whatever. One day the patron of the inn asked himpoint-blank if he knew, and if he hoped; the doctor shrugged hisshoulders. The innkeeper bent down and whispered in his ear.“Everybody says that he is dying of the Mass of St. Sécaire.”“Bah, my friend, God is stronger than the devil. I am a goodCatholic, I hope, but this is superstition, not religion. Trust me;I’ll get to the bottom of it. It’s more like poison than anything Iknow; but I don’t know what poison could produce the symp-toms; besides, his wife’s devoted to him, and the servants havebeen with him for twenty years.” However, he wrote a letterthat night to a Paris doctor, one Arouet, who had been withLarue on his travels. “Your old friend is sick,” he wrote, “be-yond either my diagnosis or my treatment. You know his consti-tution, and you are up-to-date in medical knowledge as I, alas!cannot afford to be. Will you come and see him?”A fortnight later the great doctor was with his friend. Hemade a thorough examination, and took back to the local doctorsamples of blood and so on for analysis. Arouet was working atthe microscope that evening in the doctor’s study. “You know,”said the local man, “this is one of the mysterious cases whichmake men superstitious. The village folk all say that a bad priesthas bewitched him with the Mass of St. Sécaire.” “What in thedevil’s name is that?” cried the man at the microscope. “Lookhere!” and the other took down a copy of Bladé’s “Quatorzesuperstitions populaires de la Gascogne,” and pointed out apassage in its early pages.The great man read it in astonishment; it was as follows.“Gascon peasants believe that to revenge themselves on theirenemies bad men will sometimes induce a priest to say a Masscalled the Mass of Saint Sécaire. Very few priests know thismass, and three-fourths of those who do know it would not sayit for love or money. None but wicked priests dare to performthe gruesome ceremony, and you may be quite sure that theywill have a very heavy account to render for it at the last day. Nocurate or bishop, not even the archbishop of Auch, can pardonthem; that right belongs to the Pope of Rome alone. The Massof Saint Sécaire may be said only in a ruined or deserted church,where owls mope and hoot, where bats flit in the gloaming,where gypsies lodge of nights, and where toads squat under thedesecrated altar. Thither the bad priest comes by night with his"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4646light o’love, and at the first stroke of eleven he begins to mumblethe mass backwards, and ends just as the clocks are knellingthe midnight hour. His leman acts as clerk. The host he blessesis black and has three points; he consecrates no wine, but in-stead he drinks the water of a well into which the body of anunbaptized infant has been flung. He makes the sign of the cross,but it is on the ground and with his left foot. And many otherthings he does which no good Christian could look upon with-out being struck blind and deaf and dumb for the rest of his life.But the man for whom the mass is said withers away little bylittle, and nobody can say what is the matter with him; even thedoctors can make nothing of it. They do not know that he isslowly dying of the Mass of St. Sécaire.”“You know,” said the sad little man, “I am a good Catholic,and I sometimes wonder whether God does not now and thenallow the Devil such power. Certainly Larue is wasting terribly,and I believe the priest here is a bad man.”“To hell with your nonsense!” roared the other, “you ought tobe ashamed of yourself, you, with your scientific training! Ifhe’s a bad man, you’re a bad doctor! But I don’t blame you; as ithappens, I’m one of about three men in France who can tell youwhat is wrong. Come and look at this slide!” The local mancame over. “Those things are filaria,” explained the Paris doc-tor, “it’s a kind of worm; you get it in drinking-water. Poor oldLarue is dying of what the Africans call the Sleeping Sickness,and there’s not a damned thing we can any of us do to save him.”“Ah!” sighed the other, “there is mercy in God; it would havebeen more hopeful if he were dying of the Mass of St. Sécaire!”“Incorrigible!” shouted the man from Paris, the whole argu-ment of the incompatibility of an all-powerful and yet benevo-lent deity with the existence of the plagues that torture manthundering through his ill-trained and therefore atheistic mind.VI.Seven years had passed. It was the high Mass of Easter in theCathedral at Auch. In her carved oak seat, with its gilt coronet,sat the most devout and most esteemed of the ladies of the dis-trict, Jeanne, Marquise de Branlecu, her charms yet riper andlovelier than of old. Humbly she knelt to receive the blessing ofFrançois de Choisy, the Cardinal Archbishop.And further down the nave were two others; Dufour and awoman, the long agony of her life making her look twice herage — his wife. For after the death of Pierre, Félise had bowedto the inevitable, and accepted the millions of the great silkmanufacturer of Lyon. They have three charming children.TO-DAYBy DAVID ROSENTHALTo-day, I live againThe love of yesterday;The rose that shedIts petals redStill blows its perfume on my way.The lips I pressed one timeI press again this hour;The vintage dead,Still spills its redEnchantment, like some dawn-flung shower.A POEMBy ALEISTER CROWLEYI have ransacked heaven and earth,Hilarion, for gramaryeOf words to witness to thy worth.For incense-clouds of poesyI have ransacked heaven and earth.God came, and Light and Love and Life;The mystic Rose flowered fair and fain;All skies ensphered the worshipped wife;All failed in fragrance; all in vainGod came, and Light and Love and Life.Jewels and snows and flowers and streamsLent flashing beauties to my verse;They are but phantoms fed on dreamsTo thy reality — I curseJewels and snows and flowers and streams.I sought for fancy’s witch-device;Arabian fable, Indian hymn,Chinese design and Persian spice —Besides thy truth how ghostly dimIs fancy’s bodiless witch-device!I love the legends of the past;Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome,The Celtic rune, the saga blast —Thou art the sea, and they the foam,The lovely legends of the past.In the heart’s wordless exaltation,The silence of the depth of things,There only sobs mine adoration;There only may I wave my wings —Silence, and love, and exaltation.Once rolled your tears, like rainFrom half reluctant skies;And now like dew,The tears of youAgain find refuge in mine eyes.The hours you gave me once,Of laughter, lutes and dance,Are gusts of songThat blow alongThe years’ monotonous expanse.To-day I live the loveThat was youth’s major part;The rose that diedOnce at my sideStill bleeds its fragrance in my heart."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4747I.Keep always this dim corner for me, that I may sit while theGreen Hour glides, a proud pavane of Time. For I am no longerin the city accursed, where Time is horsed on the white geldingDeath, his spurs rusted with blood.There is a corner of the United States which he has over-looked. It lies in New Orleans, between Canal street and Espla-nade avenue; the Mississippi for its base. Thence it reachesnorthward to a most curious desert land, where is a cemeterylovely beyond dreams, its walls low and whitewashed, withinwhich straggles a wilderness of strange and fantastic tombs;and hard by is that great city of brothels which is so cynicallymirthful a neighbor. As Félicien Rops wrote, — or was it Edmondd’Haraucourt? — la Prostitution et la Mort sont frère et soeur— les fils de Dieu! At least the poet of La Légende des Sexeswas right, and the psycho-analysts after him, in identifying theMother with the Tomb. This, then, is only the beginning andend of things, this “quartier macabre” beyond the North Ram-part; and the Mississippi on the other side, is like the spacebetween, our life which flows, and fertilizes as it flows, muddyand malarious as it may be, to empty itself into the warm bosomof the Gulf Stream, which (in our allegory) we may call the Lifeof God.But our business is with the heart of things; we must go be-yond the crude phenomena of nature if we are to dwell in thespirit. Art is the soul of life; and the Old Absinthe House isheart and soul of the old quarter of New Orleans.For here was the headquarters of no common man — no lessthan a real pirate — of Captain Lafitte, who not only robbed hisneighbors, but defended them against invasion. Here, too, satHenry Clay, who lived and died to give his name to a cigar.Outside this house no man remembers much more of him thanthat; but here, authentic and, as I imagine, indignant, his ghoststalks grimly.Here, too, are marble basins hollowed — and hallowed! —by the drippings of the water which creates by baptism the newspirit of absinthe.I am only sipping the second glass of that “fascinating, butsubtle poison, whose ravages eat men’s heart and brain” that Ihave ever tasted in my life; and as I am not an American anx-ious for quick action, I am not surprised and disappointed that Ido not drop dead upon the spot. But I can taste souls without theaid of absinthe; and besides, this is magic absinthe! The spiritof the house has entered into it; it is an elixir, the masterpieceof an old alchemist, no common wine.And so, as I talk with the patron concerning the vanity ofthings, I perceive the secret of the heart of God himself; this,that everything, even the vilest thing, is so unutterably lovelythat it is worthy of the devotion of a God for all eternity.What other excuse could He give man for making him? Insubstance, that is my answer to King Solomon.II.The barrier between divine and human things is frail but in-violable; the artist and the bourgeois are only divided by a pointof view. “A hair divides the false and true.”I am watching the opalescence of my absinthe, and it leadsme to ponder upon a certain very curious mystery, persistent inlegend. We may call it the mystery of the rainbow.Originally, in the fantastic but significant legend of the He-brews, the rainbow is mentioned as the sign of salvation. Theworld had been purified by water, and was ready for the revela-tion of Wine. God would never again destroy his work, but ulti-mately seal its perfection by a baptism of fire.Now, in this analogue also falls the coat of many colors whichwas made for Joseph, a legend which was regarded as so impor-tant that it was subsequently borrowed for the romance of Jesus.The veil of the Temple, too, was of many colors. We find, fur-ther east, that the Manipura Cakkra — the Lotus of the City ofJewels — which is an important centre in Hindu anatomy, andapparently identical with the solar plexus, is the central pointof the nervous system of the human body, dividing the sacredfrom the profane, or the lower from the higher.In western Mysticism, once more we learn that the middlegrade of initiation is called Hodos Camelionis, the Path of theCameleon; there is here evidently an allusion to this same mys-tery. We also learn that the middle stage in Alchemy is whenthe liquor becomes opalescent.Finally, we note among the visions of the Saints one calledthe Universal Peacock, in which the totality of things is per-ceived thus royally apparelled.Would it were possible to assemble in this place the cohortsof quotation; for indeed they are beautiful with banners, flash-ing their myriad rays from cothurn and habergeon, gay and gal-lant in the light of that Sun which knows no fall from Zenith ofhigh noon!Yet I must needs already have written so much to make clearone pitiful conceit: can it be that in the opalescence of absintheis some occult link with this mystery of the Rainbow? For un-doubtedly one glass does indefinably and subtly insinuate thedrinker within the secret chamber of Beauty, does kindle histhoughts to rapture, adjust his point of view to that of the artist,at least in that degree of which he is originally capable, weavefor his fancy a gala dress of stuff as many-coloured as the mindof Aphrodite.Oh Beauty! Long did I love thee, long did I pursue thee, theeelusive, thee intangible! And lo! thou enfoldest me by night andday in the arms of gracious, of luxurious, of shimmering si-lence.III.The Prohibitionist must always be a person of no moral char-acter; for he cannot even conceive of the possibility of a mancapable of resisting temptation. Still more, he is so obsessed,like the savage, by the fear of the unknown, that he regardsalcohol as a fetich, necessarily alluring and tyrannical.With this ignorance of human nature goes an even grosserignorance of the divine nature.He does not understand that the universe has only one pos-sible purpose; that, the business of life being happily completedby the production of the necessities and luxuries incidental tocomfort, the residuum of human energy needs an outlet. TheABSINTHE — THE GREEN GODDESSBy ALEISTER CROWLEY"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4848surplus of Will must find issue in the elevation of the indi-vidual towards the godhead; and the method of such elevationis by religion, love, and art. Now these three things are indis-solubly bound up with wine, for they are themselves species ofintoxication.Yet against all these things we find the prohibitionist, logi-cally enough. It is true that he usually pretends to admit reli-gion as a proper pursuit for humanity; but what a religion! Hehas removed from it every element of ecstasy or even of devo-tion; in his hands it has become cold, fanatical, cruel, and stu-pid, a thing merciless and formal, without sympathy or human-ity. Love and art he rejects altogether; for him the only meaningof love is a mechanical — hardly even physiological! — pro-cess necessary for the perpetuation of the human race. (But whyperpetuate it?) Art is for him the parasite and pimp of love; hecannot distinguish between the Apollo Belvedere and the crudebestialities of certain Pompeian frescoes, or between Rabelaisand Elinor Glyn.What then is his ideal of human life? One cannot say. Socrass a creature can have no true ideal. There have been asceticphilosophers; but the prohibitionist would be as offended bytheir doctrine as by ours. These, indeed, are not so dissimilar asappears. Wage-slavery and boredom seem to complete his out-look on the world.There are species which survive because of the feeling ofdisgust inspired by them; one is reluctant to set the heel firmlyupon them, however thick may be one’s boots. But when theyare recognized as utterly noxious to humanity — the more sothat they ape its form — then courage must be found, or, rather,nausea must be swallowed.May God send us a Saint George!IV.It is notorious that all genius is accompanied by vice. Almostalways this takes the form of sexual extravagance. It is to beobserved that deficiency, as in the cases of Carlyle and Ruskin,is to be reckoned as extravagance. At least, the word abnormal-ity will fit all cases. Farther, we see that in a very large numberof great men there has also been indulgence in drink or drugs.There are whole periods when practically every great man hasbeen thus marked; these periods are those during which theheroic spirit has died out of their nation, and the bourgeois isapparently triumphant.In this case the cause is evidently the horror of life induced inthe artist by the contemplation of his surroundings. He mustfind another world, no matter at what cost.Consider the end of the eighteenth century. In France, at thattime, the men of genius were made, so to speak, possible, bythe Revolution. In England, under Castlereagh, we find Blakelost to humanity in mysticism, Shelley and Byron exiles,Coleridge taking refuge in opium, Keats sinking under the weightof circumstance, Wordsworth forced to sell his soul, while theenemy, in the persons of Southey and Moore, triumphantly holdssway.The poetically similar period in France is 1850 to 1870. Hugois in exile, and all his brethren are given to absinthe or to hash-ish or to opium.There is however another consideration more important. Thereare some men who possess the understanding of the City ofGod, and know not the keys; or, if they possess them, have notforce to turn them in the wards. Such men often seek to winheaven by forged credentials. Just so a youth who desires loveis too often deceived by simulacra, embraces Lydia thinking herto be Lalage.But the greatest men of all suffer neither the limitations ofthe former class nor the illusions of the latter. Yet we find themequally given to what is apparently indulgence. Lombroso hasfoolishly sought to find the source of this in madness — as ifinsanity could scale the peaks of Progress while Reason recoiledfrom the bergschrund. The explanation is far otherwise. Imag-ine to yourself the mental state of him who inherits or attainsthe full consciousness of the artist, that is to say, the divineconsciousness.He finds himself unutterably lonely, and he must steel him-self to endure it. All his peers are dead long since! Even if hefind an equal upon earth, there can scarcely be companionship,hardly more than the far courtesy of king to king. There are fewtwin souls in genius — rare even as twin stars.Good — he can reconcile himself to the scorn of the world.But yet he feels with anguish his duty towards it. It is thereforeessential to him to be human.Now the divine consciousness is not full-flowered in youth.The newness of the objective world preoccupies the soul formany years. It is only as each illusion vanishes before the magicof the master that he gains more and more the power to dwell inthe world of Reality. And with this comes the terrible tempta-tion — the desire to enter and enjoy rather than remain amongmen and suffer their illusions. Yet, since the sole purpose of theincarnation of such Master was to help humanity, he must makethe supreme renunciation. It is the problem of that dreadfulbridge of Islam, Al Sirak; the razor-edge will cut the unwaryfoot, yet it must be trodden firmly, or the traveler will fall to theabyss. I dare not sit in the Old Absinthe House for ever, wrappedin the ineffable delight of the Beatific Vision. I must write thisessay, that men may thereby come at last to understand truethings. But the operation of the creative godhead is not enough.Art is itself too near the Reality which must be renounced for aseason.Therefore his work is also part of his temptation; the geniusfeels himself slipping constantly heavenward. The gravitationof eternity draws him. He is like a ship torn by the tempest fromthe harbour where the master must needs take on new passen-gers to the Happy Isles. So he must throw out anchors; and theonly holding is the mire! Thus, in order to maintain the equilib-rium of sanity, the artist is obliged to seek fellowship with thegrossest of mankind. Like Lord Dunsany or Augustus John, to-day, or like Teniers of old, he may love to sit in taverns wheresailors frequent; he may wander the country with gypsies, or hemay form liaisons with the vilest men and women. EdwardFitzgerald would seek an illiterate fisherman, and spend weeksin his company; Verlaine made associates of Rimbaud and Bibila Purée; Shakespeare consorted with the Earls of Pembrokeand Southampton; Marlowe was actually killed during a brawlin a low tavern. And when we consider the sex-relation, it ishard to mention a genius who had a wife or mistress of eventolerable good character. If he had one, he would be sure toneglect her for a Vampire or a Shrew. A good woman is too nearthat heaven of Reality which he is sworn to renounce!And this, I suppose, is why I am interested in the woman whohas come to sit at the nearest table. Let us find out her story; let"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL4949us try to see with the eyes of her soul!V.She is a woman of no more than thirty years of age, thoughshe looks older. She comes here at irregular intervals, once aweek or once a month; but when she comes she sits down to getsolidly drunk on that alternation of beer and gin which the bestauthorities in England deem so efficacious.As to her story, it is simplicity itself. She was kept in luxuryfor some years by a wealthy cotton broker, crossed to Europewith him, and lived in London and Paris like a queen. Then shegot the idea of “respectability” and “settling down in life”; soshe married a man who could keep her in mere comfort. Result:repentance, and a periodical need to forget her sorrows. She isstill “respectable”; she never tires of repeating that she is notone of “those girls,” but “a married woman living far up-town,”and that she “never runs about with men.”It is not the failure of marriage; it is the failure of men torecognize what marriage was ordained to be. By a singular para-dox, it is the triumph of the bourgeois, who is the chief sup-porter of marriage, that has degraded marriage to the level ofthe bourgeois. Only the hero is capable of marriage as the churchunderstands it; for the marriage oath is a compact of appallingsolemnity, an alliance of two souls against the world and againstfate, with invocation of the great aid of the Most High. Death isnot the most beautiful of adventures, as Charles Frohman said,on the “Titanic” ere she plunged, for death is unavoidable; mar-riage is a voluntary heroism. That marriage has to-day becomea matter of convenience is the last word of the commercial spirit.It is as if one should take a vow of knighthood to combat drag-ons — until the dragons appeared.So this poor woman, because she did not understand that re-spectability is a lie, that it is love that makes marriage sacredand not the sanction of church or state, because she took mar-riage as an asylum instead of as a crusade, has failed in life, andnow seeks alcohol under the same fatal error.Wine is the ripe gladness which accompanies valor and re-wards toil; it is the plume on a man’s lance-head, a flutteringgallantry — not good to lean upon. Therefore her eyes are glassedwith horror as she gazes uncomprehending upon her fate. Thatwhich she did all to avoid confronts her; she does not realizethat, had she faced it, it would have fled with all the other phan-toms. For the sole reality of this universe is God.The Old Absinthe House is not a place; it is not bounded byfour walls; it is headquarters of an army of philosophies. Fromthis dim corner let me range, wafting thought through every air,salient against every problem of mankind; for it will alwaysreturn like Noah’s dove to this ark, this strange little sanctuaryof the Green Goddess which has been set down not upon Ararat,but by the banks of the “Father of Waters.”VI.Ah! the Green Goddess! What is the fascination that makesher so adorable and so terrible? Do you know that French son-net “La légende de l’absinthe?” He must have loved it well,that poet. Here are his witnesses.Apollon, qui pleurait le trépas d’Hyacinthe,Ne voulait pas céder la victoire à la mort.Il fallait que son âme, adepte de l’essor,Trouvât pour la beauté une alchemie plus sainte.Donc, de sa main céleste il épuise, il éreinteLes dons les plus subtils de la divine Flore.Leurs corps brisés souspirent une exhalaison d’orDont il nous recueillait la goutte de — l’Absinthe!Aux cavernes blotties, aux palais pétillants,Par un, par deux, buvez ce breuvage d’aimant!Car c’est un sortilège, un propos de dictame,Ce vin d’opale pale avortit la misère,Ouvre de la beauté l’intime sanctuaire— Ensorcelle mon coeur, extasie mon âme!What is there in absinthe that makes it a separate cult? Theeffects of its abuse are totally distinct from those of other stimu-lants. Even in ruin and in degradation it remains a thing apart;its victims wear a ghastly aureole all their own, and in theirpeculiar hell yet gloat with a sinister perversion of pride thatthey are not as other men.But we are not to reckon up the uses of a thing by contem-plating the wreckage of its abuse. We do not curse the sea be-cause of occasional disasters to our mariners, or refuse axes toour woodsmen because we sympathize with Charles the First orLouis the Sixteenth. So therefore as special vices and dangersappertain to absinthe, so also do graces and virtues that adornno other liquor.The word is from the Greek apsinthion; it means “undrink-able” or, according to some authorities, “undelightful”. In ei-ther case, strange paradox? No; for the wormwood draught it-self were bitter beyond human endurance; it must be aroma-tized and mellowed with other herbs.Chief among these is the gracious Melissa, of which the greatParacelsus thought so highly that he incorporated it as the chiefingredient in the preparation of his Ens Melissa Vitae, whichhe expected to be an elixir of life and a cure for all diseases, butwhich in his hands never came to perfection.Then also there are added mint, anise, fennel and hyssop, allholy herbs familiar to all from the Treasury of Hebrew Scrip-ture. And there is even the sacred marjoram which renders manboth chaste and passionate; the tender green angelica stalks alsoinfused in this most mystic of concoctions; for like the artemi-sia absinthium itself it is a plant of Diana, and gives the purityand lucidity, with a touch of the madness, of the Moon; andabove all there is the Dittany of Crete of which the eastern Sagessay that one flower hath more puissance in high magic than allthe other gifts of all the gardens of the world. It is as if the firstdiviner of absinthe had been indeed a magician intent upon acombination of sacred drugs which should cleanse, fortify andperfume the human soul.And it is no doubt that in the due employment of this liquorsuch effects are easy to obtain. A single glass seems to renderthe breathing freer, the spirit lighter, the heart more ardent, souland mind alike more capable of executing the great task of do-ing that particular work in the world which the Father may havesent them to perform. Food itself loses its gross qualities in thepresence of absinthe, and becomes even as manna, operatingthe sacrament of nutrition without bodily disturbance.Let then the pilgrim enter reverently the shrine, and drink hisabsinthe as a stirrup-cup; for in the right conception of this lifeas an ordeal of chivalry lies the foundation of every perfection"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5050of philosophy. “Whatsoever ye do, whether ye eat or drink, doall to the glory of God!” applies with singular force to theabsintheur. So may he come victorious from the battle of life tobe received with tender kisses by some green-robed archangel,and crowned with mystic vervain in the Emerald Gateway ofthe Opal City of God.VII.And now the café is beginning to fill up. This little room withits dark green woodwork, its boarded ceiling, its sanded floor,its old pictures, its whole air of sympathy with time, is begin-ning to exert its magic spell. Here comes a curious child, shortand sturdy, with a long blonde pigtail, her slave sly and side-long on a jolly little old man who looks as if he had steppedstraight out of the pages of Balzac.Handsome and diminutive, with a fierce moustache almostas big as the rest of him, like a regular little Spanish fightingcock, Frank, the waiter, in his long white apron, struts to themwith the glasses of ice-cold pleasure, green as the glaciers them-selves. He will stand up bravely with the musicians by and by,and sing us a jolly song of old Catalonia.The door swings open again; a tall dark girl, exquisitely slimand snaky, with masses of black hair knotted about her head,comes in; on her arm is a plump woman with hungry eyes, anda mass of Titian red hair. They seem distracted from the outerworld, absorbed in some subject of enthralling interest; and theydrink their apéritif as if in a dream. I ask the mulatto boy whowaits at my table (the sleek and lithe black panther!) who theyare; but he knows only that one is a cabaret dancer, the other theowner of a cotton plantation up river. At a round table in themiddle of the room sits one of the proprietors with a group offriends; he is burly, rubicund, and jolly, the very type of theShakespearian “Mine host.” Now a party of a dozen merry boysand girls comes in; the old pianist begins to play a dance, and ina moment the whole café is caught up in the music of harmoni-ous motion. Yet still the invisible line is drawn about each soul;the dance does not conflict with the absorption of the two strangewomen, or with my own mood of detachment.Then there is a “little laughing lewd gamine” dressed all inblack save for a square white collar; her smile is broad and freeas the sun, and her gaze as clean and wholesome and inspiring.There is the big jolly blonde Irish girl in the black velvet béretand coat, and the white boots, chatting with two boys in khakifrom the border; and there is the Creole girl in pure white cap-à-pie, with her small piquant face and its round button of anose, and its curious deep rose flush, and its red little mouth,impudently smiling. Around these islands seems to flow as ageneral tide the more stable life of the quarter. Here are honestgoodwives seriously discussing their affairs, and heaven onlyknows if it be love or the price of sugar which engages them sowholly. There are but a few commonplace and uninterestingelements in the café; and these are without exception men. Thegiant Big Business is a great tyrant; he seizes all the men forslaves, and leaves the women to make shift as best they can for— all that makes life worth living. Candies and American BeautyRoses are of no use in an emergency! So, even in this mostfavored corner, there is dearth of the kind of men that womenneed.At the table next me sits an old, old man. He has done greatthings in his day, they tell me, an engineer, who first found itpossible to dig Artesian wells in the Sahara desert. The Legionof Honor glows red in his shabby surtout. He comes here, one ofthe many wrecks of the Panama Canal, a piece of jetsam cast upby that tidal wave of speculation and corruption. He is of theold type, the thrifty peasantry; and he has his little income fromthe Rente. He says that he is too old to cross the ocean — andwhy should he, with the atmosphere of old France to be had astone’s throw from his little apartment in Bourbon Street? It isa curious type of house that one finds in this quarter in NewOrleans; meagre without, within one comes unexpectedly upongreat spaces, carved wooden balconies on which the rooms open.So he dreams away his honored days in the Old Absinthe House.His rusty black, with its worn red button, is a noble wear.Black, by the way, seems almost universal among the women;is it instinctive good taste? At least, it serves to bring up thegeneral level of good looks. Most American women spoil whatlittle beauty they may have by overdressing. Here there is noth-ing extravagant, nothing vulgar, none of the near-Paris-gownand the just-off-Bond-Street hat. Nor is there a single dress towhich a Quaker could object. There is neither the mediocritynor the immodesty of the New York woman, who is tailored ormillinered on a garish pattern, with the Eternal Chorus Girl asthe Ideal — an ideal which she always attains, though (Heavenknows!) in “society” there are few “front-row” types.On the other side of me a splendid stalwart maid, modern inmuscle, old only in the subtle and modest fascination of hermanner, her face proud, cruel and amorous, shakes her wildtresses of gold in pagan laughter. Her mood is universal as thewind. What can her cavalier be doing to keep her waiting? It isa little mystery which I will not solve for the reader; on thecontrary ——VIII.Yes, it was my own sweetheart (no! not all the magazines canvulgarize that loveliest of words) who was waiting for me to bedone with my musings. She comes in silently and stealthily,preening and purring like a great cat, and sits down, and beginsto Enjoy. She knows I must never be disturbed until I close mypen. We shall go together to dine at a little Italian restaurantkept by an old navy man, who makes the best ravioli this side ofGenoa; then we shall walk the wet and windy streets, rejoicingto feel the warm subtropical rain upon our faces; we shall godown to the Mississippi, and watch the lights of the ships, andlisten to the tales of travel and adventure of the mariners. Thereis one that moves me greatly; it is like the story of the sentinelof Herculaneum. A cruiser of the U. S. Navy was detailed toRio de Janeiro. (This was before the days of wireless telegra-phy.) The port was in quarantine; the ship had to stand ten milesout to sea. Nevertheless Yellow Jack managed to come aboard.The men died one by one. There was no way of getting word toWashington; and, as it turned out later, the Navy Departmenthad completely forgotten the existence of the ship. No orderscame; the captain stuck to his post for three months. Threemonths of solitude and death! At last a passing ship was sig-nalled, and the cruiser was moved to happier waters. No doubtthe story is a lie; but did that make it less splendid in the tell-ing, as the old scoundrel sat and spat and chewed tobacco? No,we will certainly go down, and ruffle it on the wharves. Thereis really better fun in life than can be got by going to the mov-ies, when you know how to make terms with Reality."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5151There is beauty in every incident of life; the true and thefalse, the wise and the foolish, are all one in the eye that be-holds all without passion or prejudice; and the secret appears tolie not in the retirement from the world, but in keeping a part ofoneself Vestal, sacred, impact, aloof from that self which makescontact with the external universe; in other words, in a separa-tion of that which is and perceives from that which acts andsuffers. And the art of doing this is really the art of being anartist. As a rule, it is a birthright; it may perhaps be attained byprayer and fasting; most surely, it can never be bought.But if you have it not, this will be the best way to get it —or something like it. Give up your life completely to the task;sit daily for six hours in the Old Absinthe House, and sip theicy opal; endure till all things change insensibly before youreyes, you changing with them; till you become as gods, know-ing good and evil, and this also — that they are not two butone.It may be a long time before the veil lifts; but a moment’sexperience of the point of view of the artist is worth a myriadmartyrdoms. It solves every problem of life and of death —which two also are one.It translates this universe into intelligible terms, relating trulythe ego with the non-ego, and recasting the prose of reason inthe poetry of soul. Even as the eye of the sculptor beholds hismasterpiece already existing in the shapeless mass of marble,needing only the loving-kindness of the chisel to cut away theveils of Isis, so you may (perhaps) learn to behold the sum andsummit of all grace and glory from this great observatory, theOld Absinthe House of New Orleans.V’la, p’tite chatte; c’est fini, le travail. Foutons le camp!Sullen and peevish, the weather steals their form from mydesires! I turn over the leaves of my Verlaine; for “in my heartare tears as, in the city, rain.” Devoutly I read him once more,and I burn incense to appease the mystic longing of my soul.And now, after a little, my spirit takes wing.Deserted, my eyes follow the coral verses; my fingers uncon-sciously turn the pages, while poems, other than these, engravethemselves upon my brain. Poems sacred or poems accurst? Doesit matter so long as they are beautiful, so long as they make mequiver?It rains!The raindrops strum their melody upon the casements. Uponmy heart, upon my skull they seem rhythmically to drive fur-rows whence my sensibility, and my thought, may germinate.“For weary heart, o the song of the rain.”I have closed my Verlaine.I will go and wake softly the silent psaltery, with its sorrow-ful and sacred voice. It sings to me the pious poems of longsince. They are yet more poignant when heard in a place uncon-secrated. For this Temple of mine is the Temple of my ownGoddess, Our Lady of Darkness, kind to initiates. This Templeof mine is concentrated. It is robed in old silks of China; richrugs from the East; skins torn from the tawny terrors of thejungle; cushions soft as the marrow of a baby’s bones. Sage isthe smile of my gilded idols, and the ever-burning lamp whichis cooking the essence destined to evoke my dreams, starred allover with strange butterflies, which lattice its lucidity, makesitself the tireless accomplice of my vice.The web of rushes, so hard, and yet so kind, lures me beyondresistance. My blood runs slow and cold within my veins. Myeyes are overcast. My temples drone.“Quick, Nam, a pipe! Opium is so kindly when the heart isdying.” And with his spindle fingers of amber, the boy cooksthe drug. Eagerly I fill my lungs.“Now sing to me.”Softly, with the very voice of prayer, her psalms the ancientairs of over-yonder. It seems as if a breeze laden with the ener-vating fragrance of the plains of Annam entered with it.He sings. I smoke.Little by little reality slips away.Now it is blue of twilight amid the rustle of leaves. The birds,weary of flying, send their complaints leaping to heaven, beforethey put their heads beneath their wings, and the sea, the greatsavage, with long groans, crushes against the rocks her lofty-prancing waves.The sun has hidden himself, staining the horizon with bloodyweft. It is the hour of the mirage!Melancholy and slow, wrapped in a thousand sombre veils, Ipass to and fro upon the bank, and listen to the eternal moan ofthe waters, and the light song of the breeze. The full fledgedgrass of the little wood near by, washed by the dew (and o sosoftly green!), asks me to trample it with my bare feet.Briskly I take off my sandals, and so, upright in the wet green-sward, wrapped closely in my veils, I think myself a great blacklily, born from a magic wand.And now I sway like the flowers on their stalks. I sway be-cause the breeze is soft; because the sea and the leaves makemusic together. I sway because the dance is in myself, and be-cause the rhythm of the waters cries to me, “Dance!”Slowly, in cadence, I open my arms, because the branches dothe same; my eyes half closed; my head keeps time with theUniverse; my legs shudder; my feet irresistibly tear themselvesfrom the ground to dance. I am going to dance until I lose breath;to dance for myself; to dance for the stars. Drunk with the fra-grance of damp earth, and pine, I twist and wheel till my veilsfall; until the dew covers my naked body with its dissolvingkiss, until my hair falls free, and lends a lovelier veil to mydance.I dance like one hypnotized. I clasp my hair in my hands. Ibound and writhe in one immense desire for pleasure.Now the breeze, light and warm, flits by as if the captive ofmy madness. The stars glint like the eyes of perverts. The seaherself has ceased its moan.

Thisis only a prophylactic war, a vaccine against war. We are fight-ing for international integrity and righteousness, which are theonly safeguards against war. We fight merely in order that wemay not have to fight again. We want peace.It is of no use to prepare this peace by any other method thana most vigorous prosecution of the war. Were it possible for theThird Liberty Loan to fail, the result would be merely to pro-long the war, to the utter exhaustion and ruin of Europe, whichwould in its turn destroy this country by destroying its marketsabroad.The entrance of America into the war has already done mar-vels to move men toward peace, not because Germany was fright-ened, but because all men could recognize that the participationof a new continent must render the extremist positions — onboth sides — untenable.Every month now shows statesmen on both sides better dis-posed to the idea of peace by negotiation and concession, a peacelike that after a lover’s quarrel, not like that imposed by a mur-der on his victim, the root of a vendetta.America’s failure to prove her power and determination couldonly mean that England would return to her ideas of a fight to afinish. A triumphant success for the New Liberty Loan wouldput such heart into all lovers of peace that an honorable settle-ment would follow almost instantly. For man’s sake, let us stopthe renewal of active warfare with the spring, if it be possible.A cent per cent. oversubscription of the Third Liberty Loan isthe practical way to make this not only possible, but certain.It is conceivable that there may be, among the readers of thisarticle, some “enemy alien,” or some sympathizer with the Ger-man cause. May I ask him if he is more ‘pro-German’ thanmyself?From the very beginning I have tried to see this war fromwithout, as if I were an inhabitant of some other planet. I haverefused to take sides. I have exonerated Germany from all blameof starting the war; I proclaimed the Irish Republic on July 3,1915, nine months before the riots in Dublin; I have excusedthe sinking of the Lusitania; I have defended the execution ofEdith Cavell; I have denied that German atrocities were otherthan sporadic, or worse than those committed by the Russiansin East Prussia; I have advocated “unrestricted” warfare of allkinds — gas and flame attacks, Zeppelin raids, and submarineblockades; I have done this in the name of Humanity, believingthat, since war means ruin and death, we should use its mostdreadful engines at first, as well as at last, not hiding its essen-tial horror by a mask of academic rules. I believe that it wouldbe better yet to kill all wounded and prisoners in cold blood. Ido not see that it is more humane or chivalrous to drill a hole ina man with a bullet or a bayonet than to suffocate him withchlorine, blast him with flame, or drown him by torpedoing hisship.For these things I have been called “pro-German,” though intruth I have always had the best interest of England at heart, atleast as much as Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Mr. LloydTHE THIRD LIBERTY LOANGeorge, when they denounced the Boer war and the atrocitiesof the concentration camps. I have been forsaken by many of mydearest friends; I have been branded as a traitor to my country,England; I have been deprived of my fortune; my associates inmatters utterly apart from politics have been arrested on falsecharges. I have suffered ostracism, slander, and poverty; and Iam still serving my guns. I want Ireland to have the freedom ofCanada and Australia, and I want an honorable peace, with re-spect to the enemy as to a gallant foe, who shall become a loyalfriend.It is on that record that I appeal to every man and woman oflike sentiments to subscribe their last dollar to the Third Lib-erty Loan, to pinch and save in every possible way so as toinvest in this great issue, which I would rather have named theLoan of Peace with Honor.Are you still irreconcilable, my friend, in spirit and opinion?Do you think that perhaps Aleister Crowley has been bullied orbought?

Are you sosimple in your malice as to suppose that the government will inany wise be incommoded by your refusal to co-operate? TheLoan will go through triumphantly, despite you. All that willhappen is that you will be left with inferior security, with wealthin a less safe and less remunerative form.The Liberty Loans are a first mortgage on your property, onyour chattels or on the value of your labor. That is so, whetheryou like it or not. If the United States is so severe a creditor asyou say, is it not wiser to get on the credit side yourself?Is it not your own argument against the Loan that its issuewill lower the value of other securities, that they must fall sincethey will be thrown on the market by their holders to pay for thebonds? Then hadn’t you better sell yours now, before the bot-tom drops out of them?Are you a friend of Germany? Indeed. Then still you shouldput every dollar into this Loan, and yet more so! Is it not betterthat the friends of Germany and not her enemies, should holdthis First Mortgage on the wealth of the United States? You putyourself thereby into a position to influence public policy; indiscussing terms of peace, you as a financial supporter of thewar buy yourself the charter to be heard.

If she did,it would hardly be next month, would it? Hardly without thesacrifice of millions more of her brave men? Would not a peacethis year on President’s Wilson’s terms be better for Germanythan a peace next year on the Chancellor’s terms?If you should succeed in killing the loan, you infallibly ruinyourself, for the government would certainly first seize the prop-erty of any man who could not show Liberty Bonds of valueproportionate to his total wealth, as evidence of his loyalty andgood faith.If you should succeed in causing disturbance to public order,you take a long chance on your liberty and life; Liberty Bondswould be a safe-conduct in the event of riot or revolution.We are all agreed that there will be trouble and danger whenthe casualty lists begin to arrive on a large scale. Friend, let metell you this in your private ear: If this loan goes through with abang, there won’t be any casualty lists on a large scale. Therewill be an armistice, and peace to follow; the American troopswill never go into action.I hope that not one of the readers of this article will have readthe above section, with its appeal to selfishness and even tomalignancy, with any personal interest. I hope with all my heartthat every reader of mine has eagerly indorsed my efforts in“The International” and elsewhere to put Humanity First; tocompel recognition of the enemy as a sincere and noble people,loyal and united, fighting with incredible gallantry and skillagainst odds that might have daunted Caesar, believing in thejustice of their cause, and in the righteousness of the meansadopted to make it to prevail; to silence the voice of hatred; tobring about a Peace which shall do no wrong or cause humilia-tion to any nation concerned, and leave no seed of animosity,envy, or discontent to grow into the Upas-tree of yet anotherwar.My friends, my brothers, British, French, German, Austrian,Turk, Russ, I love you with an equal love. It is but accident ofbirth that divides us. Within one century each nation on that listhas been at war with most of the remaining five! This enmity isnot rooted in national antipathy; it is a hazard of time, place,political and economic conditions. Let us transcend it in thename of Man, one and indivisible, heir of the ages! Let no manturn his heart against his brother, even though for a time he turnhis sword!That time is near its end. Despite the venom of the snakes ofhate, this war is teaching men daily to understand and to lovetheir enemies. The men who stand for the view that the Allies(or the Central Powers, as the accident of birth determines) aremonsters to be exterminated are men already half discredited;the day of the moderate man is at hand.We want Peace. We do not want “Peace at any price”; wewant “Peace with Honor”; and this is the thought in the heart ofevery man on either side who is not crazed with the contagionof War-madness. And so, my friends, let us make all speed toPeace!You, too, you most especially, my pro-German friends! Youknow how impossible it is to get true news of the war, do younot? What with the “jackals of the kept press” and the censor,and the rest of it?But there is just one man who has a private wire, one manwho does know what you and I do not. That man is PresidentWilson.We may not like it, but he is the duly elected representativeof the American people, and we have got to trust him, if onlybecause there is nobody else to trust. We cannot trust the Ger-man or Austrian Chancellors, however much we may wish todo so, because (as you say yourself) the Allies are such liarsthat, for all we know, their speeches may have been forged inFleet Street or Times Square!We must trust President Wilson or nobody. And why shouldwe not trust him, the man who knows the truth, the man whofought for years to keep this country out of the war, and did sowhen any other man would have stumbled into it on the inva-sion of Belgium, or the sinking of the Lusitania?Can you not read his psychology? He is no swashbuckler. Heis not a soldier. He is not even a professional politician. He is aman who has spent his whole life as a student of history andphilosophy, in the atmosphere of the lecture room and the li-brary. Can you think for a moment that such a man would runamuck, a man of his age and with his record? It is absurd; it isagainst all nature and all reason. Psychology assures us beyonddoubt that such a man could only declare war as a last resort,when he saw that by none other means could he bring about anew political stability, an unassailable settlement, a permanent,an impregnable Peace. I say “could,” advisedly, not “would.” Itis a mental impossibility for a man of President Wilson’s habitand character to wish for war. It would be as great a miracle asfor a horse to fly. The apparatus is not there.What does he say himself? He says that he wants Peace asmuch as you and I do, but that he knows how to get it, and wedo not.As he gets his information first hand from authentic sources,while we get ours (as we complain) third hand, through censorswho select, and journalists who falsify and fabricate, he is notimprobably right.And is he not, in the ultimate, the Friend of the GermanPeople? (He will, when he thinks it over, understand, and ac-quiesce in, their loyalty and devotion to the Great Man, as theysee him, who foresaw the war, and by due preparation made itpossible for them to make head against a world in arms, whenhe was forced to fight, after maintaining peace in Europe forty"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5555years.)Is a man who has risen without selfish ambition or base in-trigue to be the Executive of this great People, a man whose lifehas been given to the study of history and of political economy,likely to be so ignorant or imbecile as to suppose that the ruin ofa good customer can benefit a shopkeeper, or the death of hisbaker make it easier for him to buy bread?President Wilson knows, none better, that the prosperity ofGermany is essential to the welfare of America. If he becamesuddenly and miraculously omnipotent, he could do no otherthan the square thing by all. “Ye are all members of One Body”— the Body of Mankind.Let us trust the President’s knowledge, his ability, his jus-tice, his good sense, and his good will, to work toward thatlasting Peace, that health and strength for every nation that re-joices in the Sun, and breathes the air of this fair world of ours,and let us be proud if we can help him!We are near that Peace already; his speech of January 7 isenough proof of that. Now is the time, then, for all good men tocome to the aid of their country! Whatever your country, what-ever your sympathies, there is one course of action, and oneonly, at this particular juncture. It is to line up solidly and stur-dily behind the President with our Irish wit and dash and cour-age and resourcefulness, or our British coolness and dogged-ness and diplomatic skill, or our German honesty and forethoughtand steadiness and capacity for hard work and team work, orour American ingenuity and adaptability and practicality, as thecase may be, according to the accident of birth, and, confidentin him with our minds, trusting him with our hearts do what heasks us alike with mind and heart and hand. Let us each do ourdamnedest! What is the task, then? What is the Way to Peace?We have all got to get to work Now. We want our peace AtOnce; we want to stop the Spring Campaign, and have an armi-stice declared before the American troops in any large numbersgo into action. The way to do this is to do what the Presidentsays, to see to it that the Third Liberty Loan is oversubscribedagain and again and again, in the very first week of the issue.We must each one subscribe to the limit of our own ability.We must see to it personally that every one in our circle sub-scribes to the limit of his ability. We must extend the limit ofour ability by denying ourselves every luxury. We must wearold clothes and hats, we must eat only what is good for us (oh,what an epidemic of good health, clean eyes, quick minds, keenenjoyment of simple pleasures, the end of the tradition of Ameri-can “nerves and indigestion”!) and we must do our work our-selves wherever possible, instead of relying on others.We must buy only those things which are absolutely essentialto life and health, so that every worker may be used in the in-dustries of this war for Peace.It is quite easy to do this. I have found it so, these three yearsthat I have been starving because I am what they miscall “pro-German.”We must do our most, not our least, to aid the Food Control.If Mr. Hoover demands one wheatless day, let us give him three.And we must obey in spirit, not only in letter.We must redouble our energies and produce more; we mustanalyze and limit our desires (we shall find them for the mostpart foolish and hurtful), and consume less.We must not visualize the power, ambition, cruelty and arro-gance of the enemy, or paint fancy pictures of our own righ-teousness, and the heroism and self-sacrifice of our defenders.We must regard the enemy as a dear friend who is acting fool-ishly, and determine to knock sense into him with a club, sothat he may live to thank us. We must walk humbly with theLord, as Lincoln wished, remembering that after all we may bewrong. Yet, as we can only rely on our own judgement, let usact on it like men, and fight the good fight with all our might!With every breath we must do all in our power, at no matterwhat cost to ourselves, to fight, or, if we cannot fight, to back upthe fighters. We must go into the war with a whole heart, withcool brain, clear sight, good temper, a sense of humor, and arealization that the enemy thinks his cause the cause of Libertyand Justice as much as we do ours.And we must save every cent, and put it into the Third Lib-erty Loan, that the enemy may realize that we are in this war tothe last man and the last grain of wheat, and pay heed to thePresident, as he asks, with a chuckle, on the success of the Loan,“Now will you be good?”ALEISTER CROWLEY.————LOVE AND LAUGHTERMy love is like a mountain streamAlive and sparkling in the sun —The tossing spray, the foam and gleam,A rainbow ray, Hilarion!But in its deeps the currents runSo strong and pure, so cool and sweet —The honied hearts of snows unwonBy oread art of faery feet!All grace, all gaiety, all gladness,The laughing face and opal fire!Mockery mingling mirth and madnessTeasing or tingling to desire!And all the while to love’s own lyreHer heart sings, tremulous and tender;Purity, passion, that respireFirmly to fashion subtler splendour!Now love shall wet the lips of laughter,And laughter brim the bowl of love.Music of mirth before and after;Envy of earth about, above!Let all the world be drunken ofThe vatted vintage of the Sun!Our Word, in Art, wing forth, the DoveFor God’s own heart, Hilarion!"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5656ON THE MARCHBy Reinhard Koester.Heavily laden we march through the damp gray morning mists,through the timidly trembling rays of the pale morning sun.We march — And the road stretches endlessly before us. Andthe knapsacks weigh us down. We bend the shoulders, roundthe back, support the load with our one free hand, throw it highconvulsively for half a second’s relief — but back it plumpsclumsy, irksome, inexorable. Our steady tread is machine-likein its regularity, carries us along almost without our cognition.And the little piper in the next row pipes indefatigably, as thoughin all eternity he could not lose his breath. He pipes us marches,folksongs, sometimes a dance in hard measure. A few of themen awkwardly attempt to caper, a few hoarse voices join thechorus. But soon everybody returns to the even, dull, heavy treadof the column. And the rhythm of that tread is the only song ofour burdened, grieving, composite soul.March — march — march — We lose our individuality inthe dull and painful drowsiness of this everlasting step-by-step.And losing one’s individuality is the only salvation. We mustnot think. We must forget. Forget the heavy knapsack, forgetthe helmet that encircles our brow with distressing pressure,forget the endlessness of the road, forget what we left behind,and most of all forget what awaits us at the goal!

But when it stops one does not notice it. . . .A few yellow flowers blossom at the front edge. Shall I pickone? I might hold it in my free hand, twirl it a bit, look at it,play with it, then throw it away —— But I would have to benddown to pick it, bend down under my heavy burden — then riseagain, rise under my heavy burden. The man before me doesnot pick a yellow flower. None of the men before me have pickedyellow flowers. I do not pick any either. . . . My throat is parched.But I do not drink. What is the use? I cannot drink as often as Iwant to, anyway. And the other men are not drinking either. . . .Without individuality, part of the masses, dull, ponderous,weary — I march and carry, and carry and march.

Galloping through icy nights,passing spectre-like villages that glare at one with hollow, dis-consolate, light-less eyes — or in the snows of some lonelymountain camp, with the silhouette of the Tatra outlined againsta star strewn midnight sky — or during the horrors of battle,WITH THE ARMIES OF MITTEL-EUROPABy various authors, translated by Helen Woljeska.when one has to lie motionless, and the heavy shells burst nearer,ever nearer —— Yes, again and again one dreamed of it. Andsuddenly it became reality . . . but so different from one’sdream.Alas, it was not the Angel of Peace who fulfilled the oftendreamed dream. A shell splinter — disconnected days and nightsin a field hospital — and finally the trip home on furlough —this is how it was brought about.The trip home began with a long drowsy ride in someGalician peasant’s wagon, and was continued in an auto whichat times had to be drawn by six horses, across plowed fieldsand emergency bridges, through rivers and ice and snow, untilone night an old, ghost-like city was reached, whose medievalwalls and gates brooded menacingly, whose narrow streetsshowed dark houses of massive walls and grated windows litby flaring candles: Krakau. From there the trip was made bytrain. And before long German words greeted the ear, Germanconductors passed through the cars, and one thrilled as oneheard the station names . . . Oppeln . . . Breslau . . . Glogau. . . Berlin!And now one is home! One sits in a richly furnished, beauti-fully heated apartment between gentle ladies in soft dressesand men in faultless evening clothes, servants glide in and out,bringing improbably delicious food — and the glistening tablelinen, the women’s shining eyes and jewels, the flowers andmusic and low voiced conversation — all seem to belong into afairy tale. One’s self no longer fits into this once accustomedmilieu. One feels like some uncouth, primeval giant among somuch daintiness, and luxury and refinement. One is surprisedthat the rococo clock still strikes the hours so regularly — sopeacefully, as though there were no war. One is surprised thatpeople sit in velvet chairs and gravely discuss matters — mat-ters — which once seemed important and essential, but sincehave shown themselves so puny, so futile, so remote! One issurprised, and listens, and wonders. . . .It is impossible to find the way back to one’s former self,one’s former interests. Too much lies between! Blazing villagesand screams of the wounded — flashing steel and the pantinghand to hand struggle — comrades shot off their horses — thecollapse of houses and bridges — the awful voice of the flyingshells — and the eyes, the wide staring eyes of the dead — allthat lies between. One cannot return. One feels as though animpenetrable armor had been forged around one’s soul, forgedin many dreadful hours when fate trembled between life anddeath. Poetry as delicate as moonlight on white roses — wordsas powerful as Michael Kramer’s death lament — they alikerebound, impotently, from that armor. For the destiny of theindividual no longer matters, when the life of nations is at stake.And a poignant longing seizes one for the wide Russian snowfields, for galloping horses and low, sharp words of command,for the grating of arms against leather straps and the savageroar of the flying shells, for danger and for death! Because sud-denly one knows beyond a doubt: this was not a home coming atall. As long as one man still rides and fights and bleeds outthere for his nation’s sake — so long one’s true and only homeis the battle field."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5757THE SUN AT THE BARRACKS’ WINDOWBy Reinhard Koester.The sun that looks in at the barracks window is not the samesun that smiles down on the shady, perfumed gardens, and ca-resses the light-colored frocks of girls and women, and paintscircles of gold across the breakfast table in our grape arbor.That beautiful, lovely sun no longer shines for me! It only shinesfor the happy men whose country is at peace. . . . To me the sunmeans white roads, and parched throats, and hopeless, joyless,endless days, and perhaps — death.I bend out of the barracks window into the glaring, pitilesssunshine. And a stony smile shapes itself on my face. I want tocry out: “Mother, give me the sun!” — cry it with cutting, pierc-ing agony. But no mother stands behind me. Only a comradewho says: “Damn, it’s hot!” or: “To-morrow we’ll have to marchin all this heat!” or: “Let’s play cards!”And I come back from the window, sullen-eyed, and I say“yes” or “no,” and blot the sun out of my existence. I play cards,smoke a cigarette, clean my gun, or lie on the mattress and puta newspaper over my face, so I won’t see it any more, the harsh,cruel sun outside . . . but may dream of that other sun whichshines for the happy men whose country is at peace.———SLEEP IN THE BARRACKSBy Reinhard Koester.We reach the barracks dusty and tired, bowed down underour burdens, with sharply drawn, red faces. Halt! Once morewe stand rigidly at attention. One short word of dismissal andthe column falls apart, all order breaks asunder, is extinguished,annihilated. . . .Like clumsy bugs the knapsacks tumble upon table and bench,guns rattle, heavy boots stamp the floor and are noisily thrownaside. We are tired — tired —— But once more energy flaresup. Everybody crowds the doors, rushes to the kitchen. In andout they go with platters and plates. Knives and forks gnashagainst tin. There are jumbled sounds of eating, talking, laugh-ing — smells of food and tobacco and sweat. Finally the clamorceases. Relieved sighs are heaved. Our stomachs are filled —the beds await! One after the other disappear in the high woodenstructures that hold the straw stuffed mattresses in tiers. Theplanks groan and squeak. Already deep breathing resounds. . . .Sleep has entered the barracks.Like dead men the soldiers lie — stretched at full length,curled upon one side, rolled over on the stomach, clutching theirhard resting place. Open mouths show yellowish teeth. Understraggly beards reverberate sucking snores. Sometimes a twitch,a groan, a murmured name — then all is still again, in death-like immobility.Heavy and dismal is sleep in the barracks. Hard as serviceand duty. And a rehearsal for death.———TROMMELFEUERBy Arthur Bagemuehl.The young lieutenant carefully raises himself out of the trench.He wants to make a few observations before it grows too light.Keenly he looks about him. But in the heavy dusk of the cloudyOctober dawn nothing seems visible but gray clouds of groundas far as the eye can travel. The whole plain appears plowed upby shells, and the neighboring trenches have completely disap-peared. The lieutenant leaps from funnel to funnel. A sweetishunmistakable odor arises from the soil which is soft as that ofa swamp. . . . The lieutenant steps lightly, not to disturb thehard won rest of those who lie below, scantily covered withground by the shell which was both executioner and gravedigger.While the lieutenant jots down a few notes the first morn-ing greetings from the French batteries arrive. Ffft-ratch! Ffft-ratch! In quick succession the little missiles follow each other.Cautiously he winds his way back to his trench. He hasscarcely reached it when a big shell, with unearthly roar,cuts its way through the heavy clouds in grandiose curve —then slowly begins its descent — slowly comes, nearer, nearer— its horrible shriek increasing from moment to moment. . . .And the lieutenant in his mudhole feels his blood freeze.Where — where is it going to strike? A terrific detonation —his every nerve reels, crumples up like the suddenly tornstrings of a harp . . . then, with superhuman effort he oncemore has regained control of the quivering things, once moreis himself.The first shell marked but the beginning. All around the trenchpandemonium soon rages. And every man realizes“Trommelfeuer!” The most harrowing of all experiences mustonce again be gone through. How long will it last? Perhaps fordays, without interruption! With set faces they accept the inevi-table. The seconds crawl along, slowly, slowly — the watchesseem to hold back their thin hands, not to betray the insane fearthat wishes to race madly, deliriously. Still the men’s nerveshold out. Still the hand, though trembling, manages to raise thewhiskey flask to the pale lips. Still the cigarettes are gleam-ing. . . . As each man awaits “his” shell. For it must come. Withcool certainty the enemy artillery fires shot after shot. There isno escape.And finally the lieutenant’s shell comes. It plows up the sodclose to his hole and an avalanche of mud buries him and threeof the men under its terrific weight. Desperately they struggleagainst the blind force that is crushing, suffocating them. Itseems vain. At last the foremost man succeeds in burrowing alittle hole. As fresh air reaches him his strength revives. Hecalls for help, although he knows that no one can hear, no onecan help. He himself is his only hope. Frantically he digs withhalf numb fingers. And he succeeds in freeing himself. Theman next to him follows almost easily. But the lieutenant! Heis tightly wedged, and half suffocated. Only his head and onearm are visible. They try to extricate him by that one arm.They pull with all their might. The joints crack — they seemto snap. But the arm holds out. The lieutenant is saved. Nowfor the fourth man. Six trembling hands dig and burrow. Andfinally he is brought to light — dead. “Leave him!” “Away —away!”Everywhere about them are the dead and dying. With theirlast strength the three creep toward the machine gun pit. At itsentrance lies the shattered form of an officer. The pit is empty.They crowd in. And then they collapse. Open-eyed they sleepthe dreadful sleep of utter exhaustion.And when later artillery draws up and the enemy guns aresilenced — they are too broken to rejoice."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5858I.SHIBA PARK.It has became my habit on way to college once a week, wheremy weakness betrays itself under the quite respectable nameof interpreter of English poets, ancient or modern, to invitemy own soul even for awhile where the shadows of pine-treesthicken along the path of breezes in Shiba Park; it makes mywandering in the holy houses of sleep of the great feudal princesthe most natural thing. I clearly remember how afraid I was inmy boyhood days, whenever I happened to pass by them, ofbeing hailed by the dark, undiscerning voice of Death. Oh, myfriends and philosophers in all lands, is it a matter of thank-fulness as to-day even to fall in love with its sweetness, and toreflect on its golden-hearted generosity and accidentally todespise Life? I say here at either the sacred house of the SixthPrince or that of the Second Prince that one cannot help lov-ing Death when he sees right before himself such an inspir-ing house of sleep of green, red, yellow, of the gold and lac-quer, of the colors unmixed and simple, soaring out of thisand that wealth of life, the colors that have reached the finalessence, and power of Nature. Although it might be a mod-ern fashion to speak of symbolism, I flatly refuse to see it inthese old temples, there is the most clear simplicity, the beautyof the last judgement. Indeed, I wish to know if there is anybetter fitting for sleep and rest than the temples in my be-loved Shiba Park. Our old artists had a strength in their jeal-ous guarding of beauty for beauty’s sake; they felt but nottheorized; therefore, in such a beauty of confusion as I lookthrough its looking-glass of confused quality on the phoe-nixes, paradise-birds, lotuses, peonies, lions, and ocean waveswhich decorate the inside of the temple, where the years ofincense and prayer have darkened and mystified the generalatmosphere.The beauty of Death is in its utter rejection of profusion; itis the desire of intensity itself which only belongs to the stead-fastness and silence of a star; oh, what a determination it de-clares! It is perfect; its epical perfection arises from the pointthat it will never return towards Life; its grandeur is in thepride that it shall never associate itself with life’s clatter. Oh,Death is triumph! It is the great aspect of Japanese romance ofthe fighting age to make the moment of death as beautiful aspossible; I can count a hundred names of heroes and fighterswhom we remember only from the account of their beautifuldeath, not of their beautiful lives, on whom stories and dra-mas have been gorgeously written. And it was the civilizationof the Tokugawa feudalism, the age of peace, to make us lookupon Death with artistic adoration and poetical respect. Weread so much in our Japanese history of the powers and worksof that Tokugawa family, which lasted with untired energy untilonly forty years ago; oh, where to-day can the strong proof ofits existence be traced? Is it not, I wonder, only a “name writ-ten on water”? But the great reverence towards Death that isencouraged will be still observed like the sun or moon in theholy temples at Nikko or Shiba Park, the creations of art itrealized during the long three hundred years. True to say, artlives longer than life and the world.COLORS OF THE JAPANESE HOUSES OF SLEEPBy YONE NOGUCHII often think how poor our Japanese life might have been ifwe had not developed, by accident or wisdom, this great rev-erence towards Death, without whose auspices many beauti-ful shapes of art, I am sure, would never have existed; thestone lantern for instance to mention a thing particularly nearmy mind when I loiter alone in the sacred ground of the Sec-ond Shogun in the wide open yard perfectly covered by pebblesin the first entrance-gate, where hundreds of large stone lan-terns stand most respectfully in rows; quite proper for the feu-dal age those lone sentinels. When the toro or stone lanternleaves the holy place of spirit for the garden, matter-of-factand plebeian, it soon assumes the front of pure art; but howcan it forget the place where it was born? We at once read itsreligious aloofness under the democratic mask. To see it squat-ting solemn and sad with the pine-tree makes me imagine anancient monk in meditation, cross-legged, not yet awakenedto the holy understanding of truth and light; is there not theattitude of a prophet crying in the wilderness in its straight,tall shape upon the large moss-carpeted lawn? I myself havenever been able to take it merely as a creation of art since mytender age when my boy’s imagination took its flicker of lightunder the depth of darkness to be a guiding lamp for my sister’sdead soul hastening towards Hades in her little steps; it was arainy night when she died in her ninth year. I cannot separatemy memory of her from the stone lantern; again, I cannot dis-associate the stone lantern with the black night and autumnalrain under whose silence the lantern sadly burned, indeed,like a spirit eternal and divine.In the first place, whenever I think of the general effect ofthe reverence of Death upon our national life I deem the loveof cleanliness the greatest of it; when I say that it really grewin the Tokugawa age, I have in my mind the thought that thereverence towards Death reached its full development then.When the custom of keeping the household shrine came strictlyto be observed, the love of cleanliness soon promulgated itselfas an important duty; and the thought of sharing the same roofwith the spirit or ghost makes you, as the next thing, wiser,not to act foolishly or talk scandalously. The appreciation ofgrayness and silence is born from that reverence of Death; asyou live with the dead souls in one house, Death ceases to befearful and menacing, and becomes beautiful and suggestivelike the whisper of a breeze or the stir of incense. Death isthen more real than life, like that incense or breeze; again sois silence more real than voice.II.NIKKO.It is difficult to take a neutral attitude towards the templesat Nikko, although indifference is said to be the “highest” ofJapanese attitudes; I mean there are only two ways — like ordislike — for their barbarous splendor in gold and red lacquerdeprived of the inspiration of the imagination and melancholy,definite to the limit. And it altogether depends on one’s mood;if a man’s large stomach is well filled (also his purse), theirdespotic wealth would not be too overwhelming, and he mighteven be disposed to sing their eternal beauty as the ultimate"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL5959achievement of human endeavor. I believe I have been some-times in such a state myself. But the pessimistic mind, criticaleven where criticism is not called for, skipping all the physi-cal expression for the spiritual communication, will find Nikkoa sad dilettantism of art, at the best a mere apology of a squan-dering mind; there is nothing more unhappy than wasteful-ness in the world of art. It is not the real Japanese mind, Ithink, to build a house for the dead, as I know that it goesstraight towards associating the dead with trees, mountains,water, winds, shadows, deer, ravens, foxes, wolves, and bears,and uses to leave them to the care of the sun and moon; indeedit was the unlettered samurai mind to build such temples as Isee at this Nikko, afraid to return to the gray elements andwishing to find a shelter even after death in materialism. Or itmight be more true to say that it originated in the completesurrender to Buddhism; and it may not be too much to say thatIndia begins right here from Nikko, in the same sense thatTokyo of the present age is spiritually a part of London orNew York. We have only a few pages in the whole Japanesehistory where we are perfectly independent.Whether it is fortunate or not, my recent evolution of mindis that I have ceased to see the fact itself, and what I am gladto indulge in is the reflection of its psychological relation withother facts; how thankful I am for the gate tower carved withphoenixes and peonies, the large pagoda in red and gold, nowloitering round the holy precincts of the Nikko temples, sincethe very fact of their existence makes through the virtue ofcontrast, the cryptomerias and mountains greener, the watersand skies bluer, and besides, the human soul intenser. I amhappy in my coming to Nikko in the month of May when thebeauty of Nature quickens itself from the pain of passingSpring, and with the sunlight that overflows from the bosomof hope; your appreciation of Nikko would not be perfect tillyou see the wealth and grandeur of Nature’s greenness; it isthe beauty of cryptomerias and waters rather than that of thetemples. And you will feel encouraged when you observe thereal fact, how even the barbarity of human work can calm downbefore Nature, and happier still how they can form a goodfriendship with one another for creating the one perfect artknown as Nikko. I am glad to see the proof of power of aJapanese landscape artist who could use his art on a large scaleas I see it here, not merely in a small city garden; my mind,which was slightly upset from the artistic confusion of thetemples belonging to Iyeyasu the Great, soon recovered itsoriginal serenity in seeing the most beautiful arrangement oftemples of Iyemitsu, the Third Shogun of Tokugawa family,with the hills and trees, quite apart from his grandfather’s;what a gentle feeling of solemnity, as old as that of a star,what a quiet and golden splendor here! The arrangement mightbe compared with the feminine beauty of gems most carefullyset. When I looked upon the temples from the Mitarashiya,or the “House where you wash your Honorable Hands,” be-low, they impressed my mind as if a house of dream built bythe Dragon Kings underneath the seas, that I and you oftensee on the Japanese fan; I looked down, when I stood by thegate tower of the Niwo gods, over that water-fountain below,where the spirits of poesy were soon floating on the sun-light; it was natural to become a passionate adorer of theNature of May here like Basho, who wrote in his seventeensyllable hokku:Ah, how sublime —The green leaves, the young leaves,In the light of the sun!I very well understand how Iyeyasu, the Supreme Highness,Lord of the East, that Great Incarnation, escaped the temple ofgold and red lacquer, and wished to sleep in a hill behind, insilence, and shadow; now I am climbing up the long and highsteps to make him my obeisance where a hundred large cryp-tomerias stand reverently as sentinels. What peace! What brokethe silence was the sudden voice of water and the sutra-read-ing of priests; a moment ago the crows in threes, twos, andfours flew away and dropped into the unseen just like the hu-man mortals who have only to stay here for a little while. Undermy feet I found a small hairy caterpillar also climbing up thestone steps like myself. Oh! tell me who art thou? And whatdifference is there between us human beings and the caterpil-lar? Are we not caterpillars who may live little longer? But Itell you that is a difference of no particular value. I met with agroup of Western tourists in the middle of the steps, who hur-ried down; they set my mind thinking on the anti-Christianterrorism of Iyeyasu and other princes, the Japanese Neroes,awful and glorious. It is not strange that they are shaking handsin sleep with the Westerners whom they hated with all theirhearts?The words of my friend when I bade farewell to him in NewYork suddenly returned to me when now the weather haschanged, and even rain has begun to fall; my friend artist whohad stayed and sketched here long ago said to me: “There weremany idols of the Jizo god, the guardian deity of children,standing by the Daiyagawa River of Nikko; I loved them, par-ticularly one called the Father or Mother, from its large size,whom I sketched most humbly. You see that Nantai Mountainappears and disappears as if mist or mirage, right behind theseidols; the place is poetical. But they seemed to be having adisagreeable time of it, all overgrown as they were with moss,and even with the dirty pieces of paper stuck by all sorts ofpilgrims as a sign of their call. Once when I hurried downfrom Chuzenji and passed by them, I caught rain and wind;alas! those kind deities were terribly wet, like myself. I pitiedthem; I cannot forget their sad sight even to-day; however, theJizi idol under the rain is a good subject of art. There are fewcountries where rain falls as in Japan. The dear idols must bewet under the rain even now while you and I talk right here.”When I reached my hotel and sat myself on the cushion, andafter a while began to smoke, my mind roamed leisurely fromthe idols under the rains to the man wet through by the rainsof failure; and now it reflected on this and that, and then itrecalled that and this. Oh, how can I forget the very words ofthat reporter of one Francisco paper who mystified, startled,and shocked me, well, by his ignorance or wisdom seven yearsago? I said to him on being asked why I returned home that Iwas going to hunt after the Nirvana; he looked up with a half-humorous smile and said, “That’s so! But let me ask you withpardon, are you not rather too late in the season for that?”It seems that it is too late now even in Japan to get theNirvana, as that San Francisco reporter said. How can I get toit, the capital-lettered Nirvana, even at Nikko, when I couldnot find it in London and New York? I laughed on my sillinessof thought that I might be able, if place were changed, to dis-cover it. Oh, my soul, I wonder when it will wiser grow?"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL6060(This article is as true to-day as when it was written eightyears ago. Times do not change, or we with them; we are thesame yesterday and to-day and for ever.)We exaggerate racial distinctions. Save for skin and clotheswe are not, any of us, far removed from the ape. Primal in-stincts in men and women are the same throughout the world,and the lure of the flesh is the same. The American college boyand the young Eskimo in his sealskin are stirred by the sameprimitive impulse. The fundamental facts of sex are identical inKalamazoo and in Pekin. But our attitudes toward sex undergovarious transformations, with changes of climate. We all havethe same appetites, but our modes of gratification vary with ourrefinement. The table manners at Sherry’s are not those ofChilds’. The desire of Lucullus for whipped oysters, and theravin of the Parisians, who stood in line for bread during thegreat revolution, were fundamentally one and the same hunger;but the mastication of the Roman was art, while the Frenchmob chewed, munched and bolted hideously. Similarly, it maybe safely affirmed, that the ways of the love-famished lad arenot those of the gourmet.Europeans are gourmets in love. They relish it as they relishtheir oysters. We are a trifle ashamed of it. But, being human,we cannot starve ourselves. We steal to love’s banquet stealth-ily, with an uncomfortable feeling of doing wrong. We sin, butwe sin against our principles. The continental youth sins onprinciple. We make the flesh indecent, a thing we despise, butfrom which, being human, we cannot divorce ourselves. Therefined European spiritualizes the flesh; he makes it beautiful;he turns its frailty into strength. Consequently, his love-life ishealthier than our own. Even when hectic desire entices himinto devious gardens of passion, vulgarity will not bespatter hisroses. We cannot be wicked without being coarse. The conscious-ness of sin dwells in our hearts like a worm. Spiritually there isnothing of the Greek in us.We may, however, speak of a renascence of the Greek spiritabroad. Euphorion has not yet sprung into life. He is about to beborn. Germany is in travail. She is laboring, painfully, slowly.Her, at times, morbid caprices in the immediate past were thoseof a woman enceinte. The trip of the Greek dance is heard againin Berlin. The subtleties of Greek sophists are echoed in Ger-man letters. Poets hark back to the Hellenic themes —Hofmannsthal’s Œdipus confronts the Sphinx. Electra wails inthe music of Strauss. Nudity, the weapon of Phryne, is raised toan art by Olga Desmond. The voice of Dionysos is heard inNietzsche. Germany’s joy in the body is not yet purely Hel-lenic. Poisonous vapors cloud the sun. But sunrise is nigh. Al-ready we hear the little laugh of Aspasia. Germany has beheldthe glorified hetaera re-encased in the flesh. Beautiful and ce-rebral, and free, she is the inspiration of sages and poets. Nothers the penalty of mortality. She is the mother of spirit-chil-dren; and Charmides is her kinsman. He is more purely spiri-tual. Docile and enthusiastic, pupil and friend, his lovely pres-ence comforts and stays in those high altitudes of the mind wherethe garlands of passion shrivel to dust.We are not yet prepared for Hellenic ideals. CharmidesADAM AND EVEBy GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKamongst us would be a dandified “high-brow,” and Aspasia,“off-color.” We would mar and crush and pervert her. And wewould certainly “cut” her. We understand physiological passion,and we understand spiritual passion, but we are intensely sus-picious where one partakes of the elements of the other. It iscurious that the greatest singer of spiritualized passion shouldhave been an American. Leaves of Grass, not Mademoiselle deMaupin, is “the Golden Book of Spirit and Sense.” PerhapsWhitman was given to us because we most needed him.We need him more than ever for the emancipation of manand the emancipation of passion. Every country, they say, hasthe government it deserves. We are governed by Woman. Wecringe before her as slaves before the master. And, like slaves,we talk evil of her behind her back. And we adore her in falseand hysterical fashion. The reason usually ascribed by foreign-ers for the truly anomalous position of woman in the UnitedStates is the scarcity of females among our early settlers. Theyhaven’t been scarce, however, for a good many years. Therehave been plenty of them as long as I can remember. I wouldblame the Pilgrim Fathers. The essential indecency of the Puri-tan mind is clearly exposed in the attitude of the American Adamtoward the American Eve.We deify woman because we bestialize passion. We placeher on a pedestal, we forget she has a body, so as not to despiseher. We worship her as a goddess, because we fear to degradeher as a mate. We protect her by preposterous laws, because wedistrust ourselves and her. We have not yet learned to love thebody purely. We fail to discriminate between passion and vice.So distorted is our vision, that sex in itself seems debasing. Butthe instinct of sex is ineradicable. The goddess topples from thealtar, if she does not descend voluntarily.Man is divine because he is human. We are ashamed of thatdivinity. Out of that shame is born the sham of our Puritan mor-als and a morbidity of which we are hardly aware. We yield totemptation surreptitiously, like bad monks. We dare not makesin beautiful. We make it ugly and coarse. And every time wereact against our own vulgar trespasses we prostrate ourselvesbefore the Good Woman who doesn’t exist, and doesn’t want toexist. We glory in groveling in the dust at her feet. We giveexpression to the unhealthy sentiment that no man is good enoughfor a woman. When a prostitute slays one of her lovers, she isbeatified in the press. We refuse to admit that a woman can bereally bad.I always thought it ungallant, if truthful, of Adam, to blame itall on the woman. But why go to the opposite extreme, andblame everything on the male? There is a strongly masochisticelement in the American attitude toward woman. The man whowheels a baby carriage for his sick wife deserves laudation —he is a hero; but the man who assumes the domestic functionsof the female unnecessarily is a specimen from Krafft-Ebing.Elinor Glyn says that American men are like brothers or eld-erly aunts. Elinor has her flashes. The maleness of the averageAmerican is certainly not so insistently felt as that of his cousinabroad. Externally, at least, there is frequently a certain femi-nine strain in the American man. He is handsomer, more grace-ful, less strongly sexed. Abroad, where men dictate theatrical"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL6161fashion, the Chorus Girl monopolizes the musical comedy stage.In an Amazon kingdom there would be only Chorus Boys. Wehave not reached that phase as yet, but undoubtedly the ChorusBoy is already in the ascendant.Our women are more self-possessed, more athletic, and, if itmust be said, more mannish than the Laura of Petrarch and theGretchen of Faust. Such modifications must already affect insome subtle manner the relations between the sexes. They giverise to cycles of problems novel in the present stage of civiliza-tion. Perhaps the balance of power is shifting. We have placedwoman in the saddle: beware lest she take the reins! Some daywe may be officially what we are already in essence, a matriar-chy, swayed by the “mother right” of primitive races. Unless aradical readjustment takes place, the world may see the spec-tacle of an American Amazon Queen ruling a henpecked nation.One hope, however, remains to the Mere Male: the EternalWoman. Yes, woman herself. For we are mistaken if we imag-ine that she looks up to the man who humiliates himself beforeher. She is much too near the earth, too human, to find pleasurein the exalted position we force upon her. Nietzsche put thecase rather strongly; too strongly, I think. It is not the whip shecraves, but the master. When an American woman has the op-portunity of meeting a foreigner, she usually marries him. Hismasterful masculinity, not his title, compels her attention. In-ternational marriages are often unfortunate, because the Ameri-can woman, nursed in selfishness, lacks the worldly wisdomand graceful resignation of her less imperious sister. Neverthe-less she is glad to slip from her pedestal unnoticed, when shetravels abroad. Accustomed to epicene adoration, she not infre-quently falls an easy victim to aggressive maleness abroad.The American Girl in Europe reminds one of a young queentraveling incognito. But that is perilous, little girl, if you don’tknow the rules of the game! The young German girl is wiserthan you in some things. She is less self-possessed, but moreself-reliant. She doesn’t expect a man to carry all her bundles.And she is not afraid to go home unaccompanied, if need be.And when she goes out with a man, she will not permit him topay for her as a rule. It isn’t reasonable that the male shouldsupport the female before they are married. The young Ameri-can is expected to pay for the mere privilege of dining with awoman. Dear ladies, who read this, do not think that I wouldnot gladly invite you to dinner. I object to the principle, not tothe custom. The young German woman generally accepts nosuch favors as a matter of course. She knows that “give andtake” is the basis of every bargain. An unfair bargain demoral-izes the gainer. She also knows that the law of the man is notthe law of the maid. What’s sauce for the gander isn’t alwayssauce for the goose.Eve abroad knows that Adam is polygamistic; and that, if wewish to preserve the institution of matrimony we must providesafety valves for the man. One half of the world, we know, be-lieves in polygamy. The other half practices it. The Koran sanc-tions, economy vetoes, a plurality of wives. Occidental nationsare monogamic in theory, not in fact.The continental woman, as a rule, overlooks the extra-mari-tal exploits of the husband. The necessity for this precaution isrecognized officially only in the Code Napoleon. But if you talkto the wives confidentially, they will make startling admissions.I know a charming couple, somewhat advanced in years, whosemarried life is an idyl. With tender solicitude they read eachother’s wishes from their eyes. I was astonished, because I hadbeen told that for many years the husband had spent half hisincome on a mistress. And the wife knew it, always. We had aheart-to-heart talk.“Where is she now?” I inquired.“She is dead,” the old lady answered. There was a trace ofrelief in her voice.“And she has had no successor?”“None. You see, he is getting older, and even before her deathhe had come back to me. He loved me all the time; the otherwoman merely appealed to his senses. I am very happy now. Ionly regret the money he squandered on that — that woman.”“Hush,” I said, “she is dead. It is only just that men should bemore lavish with their mistresses than with their wives. TheScarlet Woman is disinherited. Legally, socially, she is defense-less. The wife is privileged, fortified by the world. Surely theguerdon of sin is scant in comparison.”“Probably you are right,” she replied. “I begin to see life moresteadily every year. We never speak of her, save as one speaksof a friend. He tries hard to make me forget, as well as forgive.I let him exert himself. I accept his little favors,” she added,wistfully. “I tried hard enough to make him forget in the past,and — failed. I did not let him kiss me for many years.”“And now?”At this moment the husband came home from a late constitu-tional, bringing her flowers like some ancient Philemon to hisBaucis, and tenderly kissed her behind the ear. If she had beenan American woman, she would have dragged him to the di-vorce court years and years ago. And the late afternoon of theirlives would have been sunless and loveless.We often make a mess of marriage because we marry tooyoung. We are in indecorous haste to perpetuate the species.Marriage invariably rubs the first bloom from the rose of ro-mance. But sometimes, between sincere men and women, theflower of perfect understanding blooms more lovely in the placeof the first impetuous passion. But the soil must be prepared forits growth. The inexperienced boy-husband and his girl-wifeare too impatient. They will not wait for the soft tendrils tosprout. Leaf by leaf they pick the rose to pieces, and then, inpetulant anger, desert the garden.Europe provides, for the husband, at least, an amorous edu-cation antedating his marriage. He needs lessons in sentiment,not in sensation. Kisses, bought and loveless, are insufficient.The young German generally has what is called “a minor af-fair,” Ein kleines Verhaltniss. One might call it a miniaturemarriage. The girl, usually some shopgirl, sincerely loves him.She does not expect him to marry her. And some day, she knows,she will lose him. He brings culture beyond her station into herlife. She teaches him the lesson of loving kindness. But for her,he would learn from the gutter the lesson of vice. She is thesteward of his affection. She keeps it pure for the woman whowill take her place. When he marries there will be tears, andnot a little heartache. And then she, too, will marry, and willbring a trace of the refinement of her lover into the humblerhome of the husband. The miniature marriage is at an end. Nonethe worse for their experience, the youth and his inamorata willeach enter the major life.Do not misunderstand me. The standard of bourgeois moral-ity is the same the world over.

There is a certain poet abroad; he is very famous. I willnot mention his name. Everybody knew that he was equally inlove with his wife and with an actress of great reputation. Soci-ety respected his peculiar temperament, and invariably askedeither the wife or the mistress when he was invited. The mis-tress lived with him in town; the wife shared his country seat. Ithappened some years ago that both women about the same timewhispered the tenderest secret into his ear. That, I believe, isthe way they put it in novels. When at last the fatal day haddawned, the poet is said to have traveled hither and thither be-tween his two abodes, to comfort both women in their hour ofneed. Berlin laughed, and forgave.Margarete Beutler, a woman of distinguished poetical gifts,frankly announced in an autobiographical sketch that she wastemperamentally unfitted for permanent wedlock; and GabrieleReuter, a Hypatia of letters, boldly advertised the birth of herextra-marital child. Both women command the respect of evenrespectability abroad. Europe has accepted still stranger eroticvagaries from genius. Not because she approves of sexual ir-regularity, but because she attaches no exaggerated importanceto purely personal physiological functions. Brain counts for morethan conventional morals. Aphrodite’s reputation in Greece wasdeplorable, but she nevertheless remained a goddess. Mercurywas a thief, but divine honors were not therefore withheld. Thosein whom the divine spark glows and burns, must be forgivenmany frailties that would be unpardonable in mortals not soinspired.

Thereading committee, appalled by what I said about them in theJanuary number, hastily picked out the plays which they likedleast and gave us a corking good bill.The opening sketch, “Neighbors,” was not particularly great.There was very little plot. I have a peculiar dislike for clevernothingness. But the second offering, “The Critic’s Comedy,” bySamuel Kaplan, is quite the best and funniest sketch that I canremember; it had a real tang of true comedy, which consists (bydefinition) in making somebody sexually ridiculous. A comedywithout that is not a comedy at all. It was played most racily andwith admirable delicacy and strength by Helen Westley. It is thefirst time that I have seen her in a first-rate part; and she morethan justified the extremely high anticipations that I had formedof her from seeing her in roles less suited to the display of su-preme histrionic genius.“The Girl in the Coffin” was my first acquaintance with thework of Theodore Dreiser. I had always been inclined to discountwhat had been said of him as the only genius in America. I had afeeling that he might be a little heavy and take life too seriously.I was amazed to find in this sketch every quality of the very great-est dramatists in pure perfection, natural and harmonious, with-out the slightest touch of forcing. The restrained strength andvitality of the sketch are beyond all praise. He gives us heroismwithout bombast and pathos without slush. The play was excel-lently acted, and it is really invidious to make any selection forspecial praise, but I cannot help mentioning Kate Morgan. Herswas the most finished performance, both in appearance and man-ner, that I remember in this sort of part.The pantomime, “Yum Chapab,” was excellent of its kind,and I may say that it was a better kind than most pantomimes.The Broadway showman would have spoilt the whole thing byexaggerating each of the effects until instead of a rhythmical per-formance one had a set of vaudeville turns. It was short and seemedshorter than it was, by reason of the excellence of the taste dis-played by the people responsible for its presentation. The playran from start to finish just a little quicker than life, as a play shoulddo; as the Russian Ballet always does; the opposite (as in grandopera) always produces a wearisome feeling that the action drags.———“LORD AND LADY ALGY”THERE is something very charming about “Lord and LadyAlgy.” The play is an old one, written more than a quarter ofa century ago by that well mannered Englishman, C. S. Carton.There is absolutely nothing original in it. No single situation inthe play is unique. There are no smashing scenes. Yet both Lordand Lady Algy enchant one. The curtains are singularly effective.The end of the second act, for instance, is closed with the figureof Lady Algy standing in the doorway. As she utters the word“pickles” the curtain comes down. The effect is powerful. MaxineElliott invests the exclamation with a grandeur and dignity whichreminds one of Charlotte Cushman as Lady Macbeth. WilliamFaversham, however, captures the greater glory of the perfor-mance. No actor on the American stage to-day has developed soamazingly as he. Originally a swashbuckling matinee idol, hehas become a finished artist, capable of playing the most subtleand delicate parts. It is rumored that he intends soon to play in acycle of Bernard Shaw comedies. He would be magnificent in“Candida” as the windy preacher. And he is the ideal Caesar for“Caesar and Cleopatra,” not to mention his fitness for such partsas “Arms and the Man,” “The Doctor’s Dilemma,” “The Devil’sDisciple,” etc., provide him. As Lord Algy he authenticates arole which is essentially thin, breathing warm life into banal wordsand outworn situations. The entire cast is excellent. MacklynArbuckle is “ripping” as ever.———“THE GYPSY TRAIL”THE American theatre entered into a new phase on the daythat “Good Gracious Annabelle” was produced. Here wassomething new at last, something fine and unusual. It was notbecause of the plot, for that was not original, nor because of thesetting, but because of the strange atmosphere which ClareKummer cast like a beautiful veil over her play. Clare Kummerproved that her characters could talk the slang of the street andstill be well mannered and well bred. Since that time she haswritten three other plays and I note only progression from thefirst to the last. Of course it was a foregone conclusion that shewould presently create a school. Her most successful disciple isMr. Robert Housum, whose comedy, “The Gypsy Trail,” has madea hit in New York and is likely to run at the Plymouth for monthsyet. His play possesses a freshness of spirit and a Kummer-likeatmosphere which even the triteness of the plot cannot dissipate.For there is nothing new in the story which once more relates ayoung girl’s desire for romance and a young man’s fondness forthe same thing. But Mr. Housum has a decided talent for comedysituations and from beginning to end “The Gypsy Trail” amuses.————TO A SPARROW.By SASAKI SHIGETZ.Better not tryTo escape,My sparrow.Do we not becomeThe same groundWhen we die?White-cheeked one,Japanese sparrow,Is notOur native landThe same?My sparrow,Please show your faceJust a moment.———EMPTY NESTS.By SASAKI SHIGETZ.Empty nests,Hung upon the treetops,Swaying with the autumn windAgainst the blue sky —Oh, empty nests!"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL6464My Dear Yvonne — The debut of Max Rosen with the Phil-harmonic caused something of a disappointment, for we hadbeen led to believe from the press, for several weeks before hisarrival, that he was by far the greatest of all the violinists fromthe studio of Leopold Auer. Granting that idea for our expectingtoo much, Max Rosen’s position was a very difficult one, for wehave all been thrilled so recently by the magnificent playing ofJascha Heifetz, his brilliant contemporary, and one couldn’t re-frain from comparing these two youths. In the case of Heifetz,one thinks of him as amongst the few great violinists; whereasMax Rosen strikes one as an extraordinarily clever violinist inview of his seventeen summers, and that doubtless within thenext four or five years he will develop into a very fine artist.The boy is undoubtedly very gifted, but his intonation is faultyat times and his bowing, in several instances, showed rough-ness. Like most of the Auer stars, his tone is beautiful, smallbut of a very lovely quality, and his left hand is facile. But onefeels that it would have been wiser to postpone his debut foranother year. He possesses a quiet, simple dignity of bearing —and as the son of an East Side barber, a small boy in rags whenhis talent was first discovered, sent to Europe by the late Mr.De Coppet to study, he cuts a romantic figure — and his careerwill be followed with much interest.Ossip Gabrilowitsch gave a delightful program of Schumanand Chopin at the Aeolian on Saturday, and never has this de-lightful Russian pianist been in better form.

It seems possible that therule of Burgundy might have afforded the political stability nec-essary to the country had it not been for the jealousies excitedin the neighboring states.MUSIC OF THE MONTHIn the fifteenth century, the principle of free cities had reallybecome unworkable. It was necessary for any country whichwished to resist the encroachments of less prosperous neigh-bors to equip itself with proper military defence. The low coun-tries were the head and front of the economic movements ofEurope, but the economic movement can never flourish unlessthere is a reasonable guarantee of peace. When, however, thepower of Burgundy was broken at the death of Duke Charlesthe Rash, it was quite necessary to continue the main politicaleffect of the Burgundian rule by a reliance upon Austria. Yetthis dependence was itself unnatural. Under the immense spiri-tual force of the intellectual movement and the renaissance cul-minating in the reformation, such vital internal changes tookplace that nothing short of complete political unity and inde-pendence could really have satisfied the needs of the provinces.They, however, found themselves confronted by the relics of theold system of domination and passed into the possession of Spain.Here was a totally unnatural arrangement which was thereforebound to result immediately in every kind of unrest. The situa-tion was rather as if a university were to pass under the arbi-trary rule of a totally unenlightened foreigner. After a short time,as might have been expected, the unrest became open revoltand the real struggle for independence began. Discontent andrevolt developed into open revolution under William of Orange,and the unstable equilibrium continued until the collapse of thepower of Napoleon. By this time Europe had reached the stagewhich made the political independence of a purely industrialstate possible at least in theory. But until human nature be-comes altogether different from what it always has been it willevidently be dangerous for small, rich states without naturalfrontiers of extraordinary strength. The low countries had infact only retained any semblance of military independence ow-ing to their power of flooding the country in case of invasion,which is, after all, a somewhat suicidal means of defence. Itwas, therefore, not to be expected that the new found indepen-dence of Belgium would last long in the event of economic dis-tress elsewhere. It was impossible for Germany to feel herselfat ease while hemmed in by such trivial obstacles as Denmark,Holland and Belgium. Her method was, however, peaceful pen-etration. In Holland and Denmark she had comparatively freehand, but in Belgium the French influence was bound to act asa powerful counterpoise. There was consequently a division inBelgium itself between those who favored a close alliance withFrance and those who preferred Germany. In view of the addi-tional importance conferred upon Belgium by the reign of coaland iron, it is not surprising that Germany should make a pointof striking at her who was once the weakest and most wealthyof her neighbors. It is important for the reader to gain the pointof view so admirably brought out in these excellent volumesthat the catastrophe which has overwhelmed Belgium in thelast three years is the natural result of geographical and eco-nomical conditions. We may or may not attach blame to anygiven set of people for their action, but we shall go hopelesslywrong in political judgement if we ever lose sight of the factthat aggressions are as a rule determined by the facts of nature,not merely by the ambitions of monarchs.— A.
