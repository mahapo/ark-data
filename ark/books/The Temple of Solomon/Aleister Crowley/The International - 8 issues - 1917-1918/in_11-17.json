Beer351THE EDITOR BOOSTS THE NEXTNUMBER.THIS Christmas the readers of the Interna-tional will receive invaluable literary prizesas gifts. For the December number will contain acollection of articles, stories and poems of suchhigh quality that the editor could justly use thecelebrated adjective of Tody Hamilton in describ-ing them. But he will not do that. He will leavethat to the readers to do. All that the editor hasto say about the contents of the December issueis this:A story of African magic by Charles Beadle isreally better than any of Kipling’s African tales.That’s going some, but it is true.A Hans Heinz Ewers yarn — one of his mostfantastic and fascinating works. They are discov-ering Ewers in England now. A play of his re-cently published in the International is now run-ning in Chicago. You will never forget him afterreading the masterpiece in the December num-ber under his name.“Heart of Holy Russia” is the title of the onlyarticle published in America which actually re-veals the Russian character as it really is. A mas-terly analysis of the mystic of the Western world.For the first time the strange dreamer of Europe— the man who revolutionized modern politicalthought — is depicted as he is, with all the won-derful background of Russia palpitating in thepicture.What shall we say of the fourth Simon Iff story?The tremendous interest aroused by these storiesprove how fortunate we were in procuring them.Simon Iff is not a mere mechanical detective solv-ing uninteresting problems. He is the scientificpeer, penetrating the mind and heart of humanbeings with an unerring grasp of what is goingon in these vital organs. The complicated actionsof men and women — in crime and in ordinarylife — are comprehended by this great genius withsuch startling clarity and pity that the dullest isheld spellbound by the achievements. The De-cember Iff tale reaches an intensity of action andinterest impossible to exaggerate. Read, andthough you may run, you will remain enchanted.There are of course a great many other fine con-tributions, too numerous to mention here. Suf-fice to say we stake our literary reputation uponthe belief that you will like them.

It may be that centuries later still the learned archaeologists ofsome nation yet unguessed, excavating the ruins of Westminster Abbey, may find those bones and send them toanatomists for examination.The report of these anatomists may be something in these terms: “These are the bones of a mammal, a primate,homo sapiens. The skull is not prognathous; this person was probably a Caucasian.”In such a judgment I acquiesce with pleasure. It would be limitation to be described as “this German,” or “thisJapanese.” Man is man, and in him burns the mystic flame of Godhead. It is a blasphemy to discriminate further, toantithesize the Russian against the Turk, in any matter more serious than national belief, custom, or costume.All advanced thinkers, all men who realize the divine plan, desire and intend the solidarity of humanity; and thepatriot in the narrow and infuriated sense of that word is a traitor to the true interests of man. It may be necessary, nowand then, to defend one’s own section of mankind from aggression; but even this should always be done with themental reservation: “May this war be the nurse of a more solid peace; may this argument lead to a better understand-ing; may this division lead to a higher union.”“A man’s worst enemies are those of his own household,” and the worst foes of any nation are its petty patriots.“Patriotism is the last resort of a scoundrel.”The deliberate antagonizing of nations is the foulest of crimes. It is the Press of the warring nations that, byinflaming the passions of the ignorant, has set Europe by the ears. Had all men been educated and travelled, theywould not have listened to those harpy-shrieks. Now the mischief is done, and it is for us to repair it as best we may.This must be our motto, “Humanity first.”All persons who generalize about nations: “Germans are all murderers” — “Frenchmen are all adulterers” —“Englishmen are all snobs” — “Russians are all drunkards” — and so on, must be silenced. All persons who cling topetty interests and revenges must be silenced. We must refuse to listen to any man who does not realize that civiliza-tion itself is at stake, that even now Europe may be so weakened that it may fall a prey to the forces of atavism, thatwar may be followed by bankruptcy, revolution, and famine, and that even within our own lifetime the Tower of theAges may be fallen into unrecognizable ruins.We must refuse to listen to any man who has not resolutely put away from him all limited interests, all nationalpassion, who cannot look upon wounded humanity with the broad, clear gaze, passionless and yet compassionate, ofthe surgeon, or who is not single-minded in his determination to save the life at whatever cost of mutilation to anyparticular limb.We must listen most to the German who understands that England is a great and progressive and enlightenednation, whose welfare is necessary to the health of Europe; and to the Frenchman who sees in Germany his own bestfriend, the model of science, organization, and foresight, which alone can build up the fallen temple anew. We mustlisten to the Englishman who is willing to acquiesce in the Freedom of the Seas; and to the Russian who acknowl-edges that it is time to put a term to the tyranny of arms and the menace of intrigue.The yelping Press of every country, always keen to gather pennies from the passions of the unthinking and unknow-ing multitude, will call every such man a traitor.So be it. Let the lower interest be betrayed to the higher, the particular benefit of any given country to the Common-wealth of the whole world. Let us no more consider men, but man. Let us remember who came from heaven and wasmade flesh among the Jews, not to lead his own people to victory, not to accept that partial dominion of the earth, butto bring light and truth to all mankind.Had the Saviour of Humanity deigned to accept the patriotic mission of driving out the Romans, he would haveunited his nation, but man would not have been redeemed. Therefore, his people called him traitor, and betrayed himto their own oppressors.Let those who are willing, as He was, to accept the opprobrium, and, if need be, the Cross, come forward; let thembear the Oriflamme of the Sun for their banner, for that the Sun shineth alike upon all the nations of the earth; and letthem ever flash in the forefront of their battle this one redeeming thought: “Humanity First.”ALEISTER CROWLEY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL323323THE INTERNATIONALEDITORGEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECKASSOCIATE EDITORJOSEPH BERNARD RETHYCONTRIBUTING EDITORALEISTER CROWLEYVOL.

NOVEMBER, 1917  PRICE 15 CENTSTHE SCRUTINIES OF SIMON IFFBy EDWARD KELLYNo. 3. — Outside the Bank’s Routine“He thought he saw a banker’s clerkDescending from a bus;He looked again, and saw it wasA hippopotamus.”I.It was a sunny Saturday in April at Prince’s Golf Club atMitcham, and Macpherson, London manager of the Midlothianand Ayrshire Bank, had the honor at the seventeenth tee. Un-fortunately, he was one down. His opponent had been playingwonderful golf; and the Scotsman thought his best chance wasto scare him with an extra long drive. It came off brilliantly;the ball flew low, far, and true, up the fairway. Normally, hecalculated to outdrive his opponent twenty yards; but this timeit looked as if it might be fifty. The other stepped to the tee.“No!” he said to the caddy, “I’ll just take a cleek.” Macphersonlooked round. This was sheer insanity. What in Colonel Bogey’sname possessed the man? Was he trying to lose the game?The cleek shot lay fully eighty yards behind the drive. Theywalked after their balls, Macpherson still wondering what wasin the wind. His opponent might still have reached the greenwith a brassie for his second, though it would have been awonderful shot. Instead, he took a mashie and played a longway short. “What ails the man?” thought Macpherson. “He’sfair daft.” He came up with his ball. Should he take an iron ora spoon? “Never up, never in!” he decided at last, still won-dering at his opponent’s actions, and took the spoon. “I mustspare it,” he thought. And so well did he spare it that he toppedit badly! Thoroughly rattled, he took his iron for the third. Theball went clear over the green into a most obnoxious clump ofwhins. The other man chipped his third to the green, andMacpherson gave up the hole and the match; also a half-crownball, which hurt him.By the time they had played the bye, he had recovered histemper. “Man!” he said, “but you’re a wunner. An auld manlike ye — an’ ye keep your caird under your years, A’m think-ing.” “Yes,” said his opponent, “I’m round in eighty-one.” “It’sjuist a meeracle! Tell me noo, for why did ye tak’ your cleek tothe seventeenth?”“That’s a long story, Mr. Macpherson.”“Ye’ll tell me o’er a sup o’ the bairley bree.”They sat down on the porch of the club, and began to talk.“When we stood on that tee,” said the old man, “I didn’t watchyour ball; I watched your mind. I saw you were set on break-ing my heart with your drive; so I just let you have it your ownway, and took a cleek. As we walked, I still watched yourthinking; I saw that you were not attending to your own play,how to make sure of a four, but to mine, which didn’t concernyou at all. When it came to your second, your thoughts wereall over the place; you were in doubt about your club, took thewrong one, doubted again about how to play the shot — thenyou fluffed it. But I had won the hole before we ever left thetee.”“I see.”“If you want to win your matches, play as if it were a medalround. You have all the keenness; and the disasters don’t hurtyou, which gives confidence. But of course, if you can read aman’s psychology, there are even surer ways of winning. Onlybe sure not to let your opponent get the psychology on you, ashappened this afternoon.”“Ye’re a gran’ thinker, sir. I didn’t quite get your name; I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL324324wish ye’d dine wi’ me the nicht.”“Iff,” said the old man, “Simon Iff.”“Not much If,” muttered Macpherson, “aboot your wurrkon the green!”“But I’m afraid I’m busy to-night. Are you free Monday?Come and dine with me at the Hemlock Club. Seven thirty.Don’t dress!”Macpherson was enchanted. The Hemlock Club! He had avision of Paradise. It was the most exclusive club in London.Only one scandal marred its fame; early in the eighteenth cen-tury, a struggling painter of portraits, who had been rejectedby the Academy, was blackballed by mistake for an Archbishopof York, whom nobody wanted. They made it up to the painter,but there was no getting rid of the Archbishop. So the commit-tee of the club had dismissed all its servants, and filled theirplaces with drunken parsons who had gone to the bad; in amonth the Archbishop withdrew with what dignity remainedto him. They had then hung his portrait in the least respectedroom in the club. To consolidate their position, and arm them-selves against counter-attack, they passed a rule that no manshould be eligible for membership unless he had done some-thing “notorious and heretical,” and it had been amusing andinstructive to watch bishops attacking cardinal points of theirfaith, judges delivering sarcastic comments on the law, artistsupsetting all the conventions of the period, physicists criticisingthe doctrine of the conservation of energy, all to put them-selves right with the famous Rule Forty-Nine. Most of thesepeople had no real originality, of course, but at least it forcedthem to appear to defy convention; and this exercised a salu-tary influence on the general tone of Society.On the walls were portraits and caricatures of most of theclub worthies, with their heresies inscribed. Wellington wasthere, with his “Publish and be damned to you!” So was agreat judge with that great speech on the divorce law whichbegins, “In this country there is not one law for the rich, andanother for the poor,” and goes on to tell the applicant, a work-ing tailor, that to secure a divorce he needed only arrange tohave a private act of Parliament passed on his behalf. Geikiewas there with “I don’t believe that God has written a lie uponthe rocks”; Shelley with “I had rather be damned with Platoand Lord Bacon than go to Heaven with Paley and Malthus;”Byron with “Besides, they always smell of bread and butter,”Sir Richard Burton, with a stanza from the Kasidah; “There isno God, no man made God; a bigger, stronger, crueler man;Black phantom of our baby-fears, ere thought, the life of Life,began.” Swinburne was there too, with “Come down and re-deem us from virtue;” and a host of others. There was even amemorial room in which candles were kept constantly burn-ing. It commemorated the heretics whom the club had failedto annex. There was William Blake, with “Everything thatlives is holy;” there was James Thomson, with “If you wouldnot this poor life fulfil, then you are free to end it when youwill, without the fear of waking after death;” there was Keats,with “Beauty is Truth, Truth, Beauty;” John Davidson, with apassage from the Ballad of a true-born poet:We are the scumOf matter; fill the bowl!And scathe to him and death to himWho dreams he has a soul!”Aubrey Beardsley, Ernest Dowson, Beddoes, Crackenthorpe,were all represented. They had even Victor Neuburg, with “Sexis one; go now, be free.”There was in this room a votive tablet with the names ofthose who had been invited to join the club, and refused; nota-bly Whistler, below whose portrait of himself was his letter ofrefusal, which he had sent with it; “I could not possibly con-sent to meet people of my own kind; my friends tell me it isvery painful.”King Edward VII, also, was in this group, with the letterfrom his secretary: “His Majesty commands me to inform youthat greatly as he appreciates the good wishes and loyalty ofthe president and members of the Hemlock Club, he cannotpossibly take an oath declaring himself a Republican, or aJacobite, as he understands is necessary to comply with RuleForty-nine.”There were many other curious rules in the Club; for ex-ample, a fine of a guinea for failing to eat mustard with mut-ton; another of Five Pounds for quoting Shakespeare withinthe precincts of the Club. The wearing of a white rose or aplaid necktie was punishable with expulsion; this dated fromthe period when it was heretical to be a Jacobite but danger-ous to display it.Many other customs of the Club were similarly memorial;the Head Porter was always dressed in moleskin, in honor ofthe mole whose hill tripped the horse of William The Third;members whose Christian names happened to be George hadto pay double the usual subscription, in memory of the Club’slong hatred of the Four Georges; and at the annual banquet abowl of hemlock was passed round in the great hall, decoratedfor the occasion as a funeral chamber; for it was always claimedthat Socrates was the real founder of the Club. There was asolemn pretence, every year, of a search for the “missing ar-chives of the Club.” On November the Fifth there was a feastin honor of Guy Fawkes; and on the eleventh of the same monththe Lord Mayor of London of the year was burnt in effigy.Such is the club to which Macpherson suddenly found him-self invited. He felt that now he could marry; he would havesomething to boast of to his grandchildren!II.But, as things chanced, Macpherson nearly missed the din-ner after all. He would have called off anything else in theworld. But he couldn’t give up that! However, it was a verysorry Scotsman who appeared at the door of the Club. In keep-ing with the general eccentricity of the place, the entrance tothe Club was mean and small, almost squalid; a narrow oakendoor, studded with iron. And no sooner had he reached thegreat open space within than the Head Porter called him aside,saying in a whisper, “Excuse me, Sir, but the Hanoverian spiesare everywhere. Allow me to relieve you of your necktie!” ForMacpherson had worn the Tartan of his clan all day. He wasaccommodated with a selection of the latest neckwear. Thistrifling matter subdued him most effectively; he felt himselftransported to a new strange world. It did him good; for to thevery steps of the Club he had been obsessed by the calamity ofthe day.Simon Iff received him with affability and dignity, offeredhim a cigarette, and proceeded to show him the Club.Macpherson was intensely awed; he was in a kind of privateedition de luxe of Westminster Abbey. He resolved to put on"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL325325all his panoply of Scottish culture. At the memorial chamberhe exclaimed aloud: “And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsthe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!” He was en-chanted with the Whistler portrait. “A true Scot, Mr. Iff!” hesaid. “He was a man, take him for all in all, we shall not lookupon his like again!”“True, very true!” replied Iff, a trifle hastily. Before AubreyBeardsley the Scot grew more melancholy than ever, “For hewas likely, had he been put on, to have proved most royally,”he cried. They came to the portrait of Keats, a Severn from SirCharles Dilke’s collection. “I weep for Adonais — he is dead,”said the banker. “Thank Heaven!” murmured Iff to himself,hoping that all would now be well. But his luck was out: hebrought the next blow upon himself. “Some have doubted theautograph of Thomson here,” he said. Macpherson was deter-mined to shine. “Never fear!” he said, “that’s the man’s fist.Do we not know the sweet Roman hand?” And he added: “Iam but mad nor’ nor’ west; when the wind is southerly, I knowa hawk from a handsaw.” Iff groaned in spirit. He was gladwhen the memorial chamber was done. They came to the gal-lery of club members. Here the banker unmasked his batteriescompletely. Before Shelley he said that he, “like the base In-dian, cast away a pearl richer than all his tribe;” he recog-nized Pope with eagerness as “a fellow of infinite jest;” hesaid to Byron, “The sly slow years shall not determinate thedateless limit of thy dear exile;” he apostrophized Swinburne,“Not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes shall out-live this powerful rime;” of Burton he sighed, “A great trav-eler; mebbe the greatest, save Dave Livingstone, that we everhad; and now he’s gone to that undiscovered country fromwhose bourne no traveler returns.” Before Bishop Berkeley,he said; “That was the fellow who thought he could hold a firein his hand by thinking on the frosty Caucasus or wallow na-ked in December snow by thinking on fantastic summer’s heat.”He dismissed Wellington with an airy gesture. “Seeking thebubble reputation even in the cannon’s mouth,” he said; but,feeling the remark rather severe, hedged with the remark thathe frowned “as once he did when an angry parle he smote thesledded Polacks on the ice.” Simple Simon decided to take hisguest to dinner without further delay, to induce him to feedheartily, and to enter, himself, upon a quick-firing monologue.“I am in a light, French, effervescing mood to-night; I willdrink champagne,” he said, as they took a seat at the tablewhere, as it was darkly whispered, Junius had composed hiscelebrated letters. “We have a wonderful Pommery.” “I’m withyou,” replied the banker, “though, for my part, I need it torelieve my mind. ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy suspiration offorced breath; no, nor the fruitful river in the eye, nor the de-jected haviour of the visage together with all forms, moods,shows of grief, that can denote me truly. These indeed seem,for they are actions that a man might play; but I have thatwithin which passeth show; these but the trappings and thesuits of woe.”Some of the men at the next table — that at which Clifford,Arundel, Lauderdale, Arlington, and Buckingham had formedtheir famous Cabal — began to laugh. Simon Iff frowned themdown sternly, and pointed to the Arabic Inscription on the wall— it had been given to Richard I by Saladin — which reads intranslation, “He that receiveth a guest, entertaineth God.”“I am sorry you should be troubled on this particular night,”he said to the Scotsman; “it is the pride of the members of thisclub to make their guests happy; and if it be anything withinthe power of any one of us to amend, be sure that we shall doour best. But perhaps your misfortune is one in which humanaid is useless.”“I will not bother you with my troubles, Mr. Iff,” returnedthe banker; “on the surface, it’s a purely business matter, thougha very serious one. Yet the onus is of a personal nature. Howsharper than a serpent’s tooth it is, to have a thankless child!”“Well, if you like to tell me about it after dinner ——”“I think it would interest you, and it will comfort me toconfide in you. I do not wear my heart on my sleeve for dawsto peck at; but on the other hand, why should I sit like Pa-tience on a monument smiling at grief? But till dinner is done,away with sorrow; we will talk in maiden meditation, fancy-free, and tell black-hearted fear it lies, in spite of thunder.”“Then let me tell you something of the history of this club!”cried Simon desperately, and he began to rattle off a combina-tion of legend and fancy, mingled so happily with fact, andtouched so elegantly with illustration, that Macpherson quiteforgot his culture, and became the plain Scottish man of busi-ness, or rather the ambitious boy again as he was thirty yearsbefore, when he had first set foot on the ladder that was tolead him to one of the highest positions in the financial world.When the waiter presented the bill, Iff marked a 19 in frontof a printed item at its foot; the waiter filled in £95, and madethe addition. Iff scribbled his name. The figure caught thetrained eye of the banker. “Excuse me!” he cried; “it’s therudest thing possible, but I would like to see that bit o’ paper.I’m just that curious, where there’s money.” Iff could not refuse;he passed the bill across the table.“Nineteen Shakespeares!” exclaimed the Scot. “Ninety-fivepounds sterling! what ’ll that mean, whateffer?”“Well, I didn’t mean to tell you, Mr. Macpherson; it’s notvery charming of me, but you oblige me. There is a fine of fivepounds for every Shakespeare quotation made in this club —and of course, as your host, I’m responsible. Besides, it waswell worth the money. The men at the next table have not hadsuch a lovely time for years. Simple Simon, as they call me,won’t hear the last of it for a while!” But the Scot was stunned.He could only keep on repeating in a dazed way, “Ninety-fivepounds! Ninety-five pounds! Ninety-five pounds!”“Don’t think of it, I beg of you!” cried Iff. “I see that itdistresses you. I am a rich man, and an old one; I shall nevermiss it. Besides, the fine goes to a most worthy object; theSociety for Destroying Parliamentary Institutions.”“I never heard of it.”“Indeed! it is very powerful, I assure you. It carried throughPayment of Members; it has greatly enlarged the Franchise,and is now working to have it extended to women.”“I thought ye said Destroying Parliament.”“Just so. These measures are directed towards reducing thewhole thing to a farce. Already the power of Parliament is athing of the past; authority is concentrated in the cabinet —nay, in a Camarilla within the cabinet, and even this Camarillais very much in the hands of permanent officials whose namesthe public never hears.”“D’ye ken, I can hardly believe my ain ears.”“When the public demands a law which those in authority"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL326326don’t like, they either block it in the Commons, or throw it outin the Lords, or get the Judges to interpret it so as to meannothing at all, or the opposite of what it was intended to mean.”“Losh!”“You’re a banker. Would you submit your bank to popularmanagement, interference by people who don’t know the firstprinciples of the business?”“It wad be the shutters up in just one se’nnight!”“Nor will we intrust our country to people who know nei-ther law, nor history, nor geography, nor commerce — exceptin their own petty trade — nor foreign affairs, not so much aswhether our interests lie with those of our neighbors or clashwith them; nor any other of the arts necessary to government.”“Weel, weel, but these are strange sayings. But I doot ye’rericht.”“Let us have our coffee in the lounge, and you shall tell meall about your troubles. I feel I’ve bored you with all my talkabout the club.”They walked into the lounge and took a seat in the low win-dow which overlooks St. James Park. “See the palace!” saidSimon Iff. “The Foreign Secretary is with the King to-night.His Majesty was anxious about the Ultimatum to Russia.”“Russia! She’s our ally!”“Last night war was thought a certainty. This morning away out was found. How would it do to let that cat out of thebag, with the press howling for blood? The price of Democ-racy is eternal Hypocrisy!”Macpherson was by this time completely overwhelmed. Hefelt himself among the Powers. He thought of Paul caught upinto the seventh heaven, and hearing things not lawful for mento speak.“Now, then, your little private grief,” said Simon, when thewaiter had brought the coffee, a box of Upmanns, and twogreat Venetian glasses, milky with threads of gold, in whichwas the special club brandy from the cellars of Frederick theGreat of Prussia. “It’s a serious situation, Mr. Iff,” began thebanker, who, once on familiar ground, grew confident, lucid,and precise.III.“My bank, as you know, is situated at the corner of LondonWall and Copthall Avenue. The chief officials are three; my-self, Fraser, who came with me from Edinburgh, has workedwith me for 14 years, and Fisher, who has been with me fortwo years only. Both men are steady in every way. Fisher, forexample, though a young man, has already managed to pur-chase the house in which he lives at Tooting Bec; a charmingthough compact detached residence with a garden, which hespends most of his leisure in tending. He won a prize in the“Daily Mail” Sweet Pea competition, and his roses are won-derful. An extremely promising young man.“Next week is Easter. At this time there is a very great de-mand in Paris for English Bank-notes; this year we are send-ing no less than twelve thousand pounds in tens and fives. OnFriday, this sum arrived from the Bank of England; it waschecked, made into a special parcel ready for transmission to-day, and stored in the safe.“I had noticed some unusual commotion in Fraser duringthe whole of this past month; on Friday I asked him its cause.He replied that he was in love, having recently met MissClavering, a customer of the bank, by the way, with an aver-age monthly balance of some five to seven hundred pounds. Iwished him good luck. He was to take her to the Earl’s CourtExhibition that night, he said.“So much for Friday. On Saturday I reached the bank at aquarter before nine, as is my custom. I saw Fraser disappearinto the bank as I approached it. He did not go to his desk, butwas waiting for me to enter. He had his hand to the side of hishead. The face was decidedly swollen, and the eyes injected.‘Mr. Macpherson,’ he said, ‘I had to come down; I’ve notmissed a day since we came to London; but I’m in agony ofneuralgia; I’ve not slept all night.’ He jerked the words outwith evident difficulty. ‘Go right home!’ I said, ‘or why notrun down to Brighton for the week-end, and let the sea windblow the poison out of your system?’ ‘I will that,’ he said, andwas gone. Fisher, by the way, had entered the bank and heardthis conversation, or all but a few words.“On Saturday the bank closes at one o’clock; but several ofthe clerks stay behind to finish the week’s work. I myself leaveat noon, or a few minutes earlier, in order to attend a shortconference in connection with our American business. Thebanks concerned each send a representative. I had intended togo to a matinee last Saturday, but the brightness of the daytempted me to Mitcham, where I had the pleasure of meetingyou.“Now let me tell you what occurred after I had left the bank.A few minutes only had elapsed when Fraser appeared. ‘I’mgoing to Brighton on the one o’clock train,’ he told Fisher,who was, of course, surprised to see him; ‘but I’m worried todeath. I’ve got it into my mind that the Paris parcel was notput into the safe.’ Together they went and opened it; they couldnot have done it separately, as Fisher had the key, and Fraserthe combination. The parcel was duly found. Fraser took it up,looked at it, noted the seals, and replaced it. ‘That’s all right,’he said with relief; ‘see you Monday.’ ‘So long,’ said Fisher,and Fraser went out.“Now, sir, the story becomes bizarre and uncanny in theextreme. We’ll suppose that the Paris package has been tam-pered with, as turned out to be the case. Then you’ll imagineat least that we’d hear nothing of it until Monday; perhaps notuntil the packet reached the bank in Paris. Instead, the plotgoes off bang! Bang! like the scenario of a moving picture.“I return from golf to my rooms in Half Moon street. I findFisher waiting for me. Fraser had wired him from Brighton tobe at my place at once, and wait. The message was so urgentthat he could not disregard it. There is a telegram for me onmy hall table. From Fraser. ‘Absolutely certain Paris parcelhas been stolen. Formally request you make sure.’ Nothingfor it but to go down to the Bank. Sure enough the package isa dummy. We warn the police, public and private. By Sundaymorning evidence is tumbling in like an avalanche.“Fraser was seen at one o’clock at Euston. He bought a re-turn ticket to Edinburgh, and paid for it with one of the stolennotes. He was in no hurry, and bothered the clerk a good dealtrying to get some kind of holiday ticket that the railway didn’tissue. He talked of his old mother in Edinburgh; hadn’t seenher for two years. The clerk recognized his photograph at once;remembered him specially, because he had given him hischange a shilling short, and, discovering the error immedi-ately, sent a porter to find him; but he could not be seen. This"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL327327in itself struck the clerk as curious.“He was recognized in the luncheon room of the Old ShipHotel at Brighton, at a time so near that of the Euston incidentthat he must have jumped into a high-power car after buyingthe ticket, and broken the speed laws every yard of the way toBrighton. He is known in the hotel; besides, Murray, of theCity and Shire Bank, saw him and spoke to him. Fraser said,‘I’m going back to London. I’m sure there’s something wrongat the Bank. I dreamed it three nights running.’“At dawn on Sunday Fraser’s body, horribly mangled, wasfound at the foot of some cliffs near Ilfracombe — anotherlong drive. His letters and papers were found on the body, andabout eighty pounds of the stolen money.“I had this news about 11:30. Ten minutes later the tele-phone rang. It was Fraser’s voice, without any question. ‘I’mworried about the Paris package,’ he said. ‘I hope you don’tthink me quite mad. Do tell me you went to the bank, andfound all well.’ I was so amazed that I could not speak for amoment. Then I saw that the question was one of identity,first of all. I asked him a question which it was most unlikelythat anyone else could answer; who was paying teller at thebank when he first joined it, and where did he live? There wasno answer. Ten minutes later the bell rang again. ‘They cut usoff,’ he said, and then gave the reply correctly.“By this time I began to believe myself insane. ‘Where areyou?’ I cried, ‘I want to see you at once.’ Again the telephonewent dead. Two hours later the front door bell rang. It wasFisher. ‘Has he come?’ he cried. Fisher said that Fraser haddriven to his house in a big touring car very early that morn-ing, and called him out by honking. ‘I can’t stop,’ he had said.‘I’m on the track of the stolen money. Meet me at Macpherson’sat two.’“I forgot to tell you that inquiry at Fraser’s rooms showedthat he had left about 6 on Friday, saying that he would be outuntil late. He had not returned, so far as the landlady knew;but he had a latchkey. However, his bed had not been slept in.“I waited with Fisher until three o’clock. There was noFraser, and no further word of him. I had telephoned the po-lice to trace the calls I had received, and obtained the replythat no record had been kept. The operator fancied that it wassome exchange in South-West London; but enquiries at thoseexchanges produced no result.“About one o’clock on Monday morning two cyclist police-men, returning from the patrol of the Ewing road, heard anexplosion in front of them. Turning a corner, they came upon apowerful car, its lights out, its identification marks erased. Inthis car was the body of Fraser, the bowels torn out by a shotfrom a heavy revolver, one of the Bank revolvers. In the pock-ets were a signed photograph of Miss Clavering, a watch, ahandkerchief, six hundred pounds of the stolen money, andsome loose gold and other coins. I saw the body this morning;it was undoubtedly that of Fraser. But the doctors said he hadbeen dead since Sunday afternoon!“This was at eight o’clock; I went to the Bank at nine; amongmy mail was a telegram from Fraser. ‘Everything all right now.Consider the incident closed.’ The police brought me the origi-nal, which had been handed in by Fraser himself, apparently,at a near-by office in Cornhill; it was in his own handwriting.“There’s the case so far. Man, it defies the imagination!”“No, no!” replied Iff briskly, “it defies the conventions ofthe routine of banking business.”IV.Macpherson opened his eyes in amazement. He did not inthe least comprehend the point of view.“Let me try to make this matter clear to you.”“Clear!”“Like all mundane matters, its complexity is illusion. Letus begin at the beginning. The soul of man is free and radiant,like the sun; his mind light or dark as he happens to be illumi-nated by that soul. We call this night; but it is only that we arein the shadow of the earth itself; the sun is shining gloriously,I make no doubt, in China.”“I don’t see how this bears on the robbery and murders, Mr.Iff.”“Exactly. Which is why you are only Mr. Macpherson of theMidlothian and Ayrshire, instead of Lord Macpherson, pull-ing the financial strings of the whole world. Observe; you knowall about banking; good. But you make the mistake of not see-ing that banking is only one of the smallest fragments of knowl-edge needed by a banker. Your acquaintance with Shakespeareis a good sign — yet I feel sure that it has never occurred toyou to put that bit of your brain to work on the rest of it. Thecleverest banker I know is passionately devoted to the Rus-sian Ballet; Nijinsky pirouettes before him; he translatesNijinsky’s legs into the movements of the gold supply, and outcomes a scheme to shake the world.”The Scot shook his head. “I ken the mon ye mean; but it’sjuist an accident.”“There are no accidents in this world. There are only igno-rances of the causes of certain events.”“Oh ay! that’s true. Davie Hume said that.”“I see you’re a scholar, Mr. Macpherson. Now do let us tryto use these qualities to explain the problems which at presentbeset you. — To begin: You are puzzled by the complexity ofthe case. To me, on the other hand, the fact simplifies it atonce. I perceive that the entire drama has been staged by ahighly-colored and imaginative mind.”“Fraser’s mind was as prosaic as his own ledgers.”“Precisely. Fraser is clearly an entirely passive agent in thewhole business. Note, please, how Mr. Some One Not Fraserhas obsessed you with the name Fraser. Even when Fraser’sbody is found dead, you somehow feel that he is responsible.In other words, Mr. Some One has shouted Fraser at you tillyour ears are dinned.“Now let us look at the facts in detail. Practically every-thing you have told me is an Appearance of Fraser, like a ghoststory.“Either he is there or he writes or telephones. He’s the busi-est man in England all this week-end. He has two of his owncorpses to play with, and his wire this morning leads you tohope that he is still alive.”“I loved that lad like my own son.”“Yes, yes; but you must forget that for a moment; or rather,you must detach yourself from it, and regard it merely as oneof the facts in the case.“Now let us recapitulate the Appearances of Fraser. Checkme as I go, please.“One. At the bank at nine on Saturday. Anything suspicious?”“Well, yes, now you say so. I can imagine a personation,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL328328aided by the neuralgia. But I had no suspicion at the time. Andif it were not Fraser, why did he come?”“To prepare the minds of the others for his visit numbertwo.”“But they were surprised to see him.”“Just what he wanted, perhaps. Yet I’m not sure. He mayhave done it merely because that it was unlikely that he shoulddo it. The man’s prime intention was to confuse and bewilderyour mind.”“He did that!”“Number Two. Sure that was the real Fraser?”“No; but Fisher didn’t doubt it.”“Fisher’s mind was prepared by your recognition of himearlier in the day. Or — wait a minute. That may be merelywhat clever Mr. Some One wants us to think. Wait a moment.”There was a long pause.“If that were so,” continued Simon Iff, “it would look as ifMr. Some One were trying to make things easier for Fisher.Has Fisher acted naturally throughout?”“Perfectly. He’s an exemplary man for a subordinate posi-tion.”“Yet he grows roses. That’s a suspicious trait. Rose garden-ing is a devilish pursuit!”“Ye’re joking, man.”“Oh, a Scotsman can see a joke when there isn’t one there!However, to go on to Number Three. Vision of Fraser at Euston.Now that was certainly not Fraser.”“Why not?”“He didn’t count his change. You tell me he’s the most ac-curate man you ever had.”“Never made an error or so much as an erasure in ten years.”“You see! If that man were walking in his sleep he’d stillget his figures right. It’s part of his being.”“I think you’re right.”“Note too that he does everything, not too unusual, to getthe clerk to remember him. In fact, we might think that hetook the short change on purpose to attract notice. It wouldstrike Fraser to do such a thing. So he may have been Fraserafter all.“Number Four. Brighton. Again the identification is verydoubtful.“Number Five. Ilfracombe. Here the corpse is certainly notFraser’s; yet all pains are taken to make us think that it ishis.”“But that’s so silly, when he is going to bob up again a fewhours later.”“All done to keep you happy during the week-end!“Number Six. The first telephone call.”“That was his voice. He spoke as if in pain, as on the Satur-day.”“Still doubtful, then. Number Seven. The second telephonecall.”“It’s most improbable that anyone else could have got theinformation. He could have no idea that I would ask.”“But he might have got it from Fraser in the intervals be-tween the calls.”“And why should Fraser give it, if he’s not in the game?”“Ah!”“But I’m dead sure of his voice. On the Saturday I mighthave doubted; I was not paying attention. But this time I wasconcentrating my whole mind on the question of identity. And,ye ken, identity’s a question of constant and primary impor-tance to a banker.”“I agree with you. Number Eight. Fraser at Tooting. Herewe have only Fisher’s identification, which we suspected oncebefore, though there’s no reason to do so in either case. Yet wenote that Fraser makes an appointment which he does not keep;nor does he refer to it in his telephone call. Number Nine.Fraser’s corpse again, this time the real thing. No doubt pos-sible?”“None. The face was quite uninjured. I knew every freckleby heart.”“And no disguise possible, of course. It would have beeneasy to blow away the head; so Mr. Some One Clever wantedyou to find him. Yet the doctors say the man had been deadtwelve hours?”“Nearly that; an hour more or less.”“I wonder if Mr. Clever thought that might have been over-looked. You see, I’m sure it wasn’t suicide, though it was madeto look like it. I’m sure this last scene — for I shall dismissNumber Ten, this morning’s telegram, as an obvious fake; thewire was written out long beforehand — this last scene wasmost carefully stage-managed. And what is the significant ar-ticle, the one thing to attract our attention? The picture of MissClavering!”“I can’t see the bearing of that, on any theory.”“Luckily, I’ve got no theory, so far. Let’s boil down thesefacts. The only visions you are sure of are not visions at all.You heard Fraser on Sunday morning; but so far as you can beabsolutely certain, he has not been seen alive since Fridaynight.”“That’s so, by heaven!”“Did he ever meet Miss Clavering that night?”“No; she had made the appointment with him, as it chanced,in the bank itself, where she called on Friday morning to drawa hundred pounds. She looked ill, and I remarked on it. Shereplied that she had drawn the money for the very purpose ofresting over Easter at Ostend. But she did not go. That after-noon, shopping in Bond street, she slipped on a banana skin,and twisted her ankle. A doctor took her to her house in Johnstreet. Her servants had been given a holiday from Saturday tocorrespond with her own, and she allowed them to go as ifnothing had happened; a nurse is with her, and prepares herfood. The doctor calls twice daily. Of course she was the firstperson whom we questioned. It is extraordinary that Frasershould not have called there that evening.”“Perhaps he was prevented. No; no one has seen him, to bepositive, since the dramatic features began, later than Fridayevening, or perhaps possibly after he left the bank.”“That’s so; and there’s nae doot o’ it.“But he was seen after leaving the bank on Friday; a mananswering to his description hired the big touring car in whichhis body was found this morning, at an hour very shortly afterhe left me. Otherwise he has not been seen, as you say.”“Yet infinite pains have been taken to show you the man,dead or alive, here, there, and everywhere.”“But some of those are unreasonable. This morning, for in-stance, and the corpse at Ilfracombe.”“Yes, my poor pragmatic friend, that is the point. You wouldhave analyzed purely rational appearances; these were beyond"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL329329you. The strange atmosphere of the case bewildered your brain.It’s probably the same at Scotland Yard.“Observe how you were played on throughout. Why alarmyou so early and so elaborately? Criminals always prefer themaximum time to make their get away. This thing was plannedfrom long before — and probably, if you had refused to befrightened about the money, the whole scheme would havemiscarried. Note that Mr. Clever does not begin to alarm youuntil after Vision Number Two, when doubtless he changedthe package for the dummy. Stop! what was the size of thepackage?”“Pretty bulky; about a cubic foot.”“Then I’m an ass. Oh dear! now I must begin to think allover again.”“If he changed it before Fisher’s eyes, Fisher must be in theplot. Yet that would compromise him hopelessly. Besides, thatmust have been Fraser, now that I come to think of it. He hadthe combination.”“Oh, that doesn’t matter, as I see it. I’ve been rash and fool-ish, but I see the whole thing now, I think. Others besidesFisher would have noticed if Fraser had carried a parcel, or abag, in or out?”“Yes: I asked that. He had nothing in his hands; and hislight overcoat was buttoned tight to his very slim figure, so hecouldn’t have concealed it.”“Thank you. Everything is perfectly clear now. But I don’twant to tell you; I want to prove it to your eyes. Let me call atyour apartment at 9:30 to-morrow morning, and we will settlethis business together. Can you keep the morning free?”“Oh yes! Fisher can do all that is necessary at the bank.”V.The next morning Simon Iff was punctual to his appoint-ment. “Our first business,” he told Macpherson, “is one ofsimple good feeling and good manners. Miss Clavering mustbe in a terrible state of mind. We will call and tell her thatFraser has been cleared, and condole with her upon his loss.Would you telephone and ask for an appointment?”Macpherson did so. The answer came that Miss Claveringwas still asleep; on her waking, the message would be given.Where should she, the nurse, telephone?Macpherson gave his number. About twenty minutes laterthe nurse called him. “Could you be here at ten minutes be-fore eleven?” she said. Macpherson agreed. “Splendid!” criedIff, when he hung up the receiver; “of course, I wish she couldhave made it twelve minutes instead of ten. We may be a littlelate at the bank.” The Scot looked at him to see if his mindwere not sick; but his whole face was so radiant, his eyes soalight with mischievous intelligence, that the banker couldnot fail to divine some signal triumph. But he was none theless amazed. What information could the man have gleanedfrom the mere time of a quite commonplace appointment?Simon Iff was exceedingly punctilious in pushing the bellat Miss Clavering’s to the minute. They were admitted at once.The girl, a tall, slim, languid beauty, Spanish in type, with askin of extreme pallor, was lying on a couch. She was dressedvery simply in black; her mind seemed exhausted by the griefand pain through which she was passing. The nurse and doc-tor, kneeling at the foot of the couch, were in the act of dress-ing the injured ankle. It was probably adorable in normal times,but now it was swollen and discolored. The first considerationof Macpherson and his friend was to express sympathy. “Is ita bad sprain?” they asked the doctor. “I have a feeling that oneof the small bones is displaced; I have asked Sir Bray Clintonto step in; he should be here in a few minutes.” “Perfect, per-fect!” murmured Iff; “if the case goes ill, it will be from nolack of care.”“Everybody is charming to me,” lisped Miss Claveringfaintly.Macpherson then proceeded, as arranged, to exonerate Fraserfrom guilt; though he said that he had no idea of the real cul-prit, and it was the most bewildering case he had ever heardof.“We know the principal party concerned, though,” chirpedIff. “He is a Chinaman, we are sure of that, though we don’tknow his name; and there’s not the least chance of arrestinghim. In fact, one can hardly say that he is guilty.”Macpherson turned open-mouthed upon the mystic. “AChinaman!” he gasped.“Well, now you mention it, I don’t really know whether hewas a Chinaman after all!”Macpherson thought it best to hint that his companion wasa little fanciful. At that moment the bell rang. “That will beClinton!” said the doctor. “I’m so charmed with your calling,”sighed the girl, in evident dismissal, “and I’m so relieved thatat least Mr. Fraser died an innocent man.” She covered herface with her hands for a moment; then, mastering herself,extended them to her visitors, who leaned over them, and de-parted with the nurse. On the door-step stood Sir Bray Clinton,to whom both Iff and Macpherson extended hearty greeting.“Now,” said Iff, as they turned down the street, “that pleas-ant duty off our minds, to the bank, and prepare for sternerwork!”VI.“It is a cold morning,” said Simon Iff, taking a chair in themanagerial room, “at least, to so old a man as I. May I have afire, while we are waiting? And would you please be so goodas to ignore me for a while; I will tell you when all is ready.”Macpherson grew more bewildered every moment, for theday was very warm; but the authority of the Hemlock Clubstill weighed upon his soul. He was a snob of snobs, like allScotsmen who barter their birthright of poverty and indepen-dence for England’s sloth and luxury; and he would almosthave jumped out of the window at a request from any memberof the aristocracy. And the Hemlock Club thought no more ofsnubbing an Emperor than a child of plucking a daisy.Half an hour elapsed; Macpherson busied himself in thebank. At the end of that time Iff came out, and brought himback. “I should like,” he said, “to have a few words with Mr.Fisher.”Macpherson complied. “Shut the door, Mr. Fisher, if youplease,” said the magician, “we old men fear the cold terribly.Take a seat; take a seat. Now I only want to ask you one smallpoint connected with this case; it is one that puzzles me con-siderably.” “I’m entirely baffled myself,” returned Fisher; “butof course I’ll tell you anything I know.”“There are really two points: one you may know; the otheryou must know. We will take them in that order. First, howdid the doctor come to miss his appointment on the Ewing"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL330330Road? Second, how long ——”Fisher had gripped the arms of his chair. His face wasdeathly.“How long,” pursued the mystic, inexorably, “is it since youfell in love with Clara Clavering?” Macpherson had boundedto his feet. He compressed his Scottish mouth with all hisScottish will. Simon Iff went on imperturbably. “I think per-haps you do not realize how critical was that failure of thedoctor to materialize. Knowing the moment of Fraser’s mur-der, everything becomes clear.”“I suppose this is what you call the third degree!” sneeredFisher. “I’m not to be bluffed.”“So you won’t talk, my friend? I think you will when weapply this white-hot poker here to your bare abdomen.”Fisher faltered. “That was terrible!” It was the cry of adamned soul. “Wa s terrible, you’ll note, Mr. Macpherson,”cried Simon Iff, “not will be. Come, Mr. Fisher, you see I knowthe whole story.”“Then you had better tell it.”“I will. You’ll remember, Macpherson, I told you that I sawin this whole plot the workings of a creative mind of highcolor and phantasy; possibly on the border of madness. So Ibegan to look for such a mind. I did not need to look for clues;once I found the right kind of mind, the rest would fit. I beganto suspect Mr. Fisher here on account of his rose-growing ac-tivities; but I soon saw that he had too many alibis. Fraser,with a mind like a Babbage calculating machine, was out ofthe question from the start, although he had just fallen in love— which sometimes works some pretty fine miracles in a man!“The only other person in the circle was Miss Claveringherself, and I made an opportunity to see her. I saw, too, thatshe was not very much in the circle; she appeared accidentallyand quite naturally. I thought that such an apparent comet mightbe the Sun of the system of deception.“I was delighted when I was given an exact time, not a roundhour or half hour, for the interview; it suggested an intricacy.“I arrive at the house; I see a perfect stage picture; an unde-niable swollen ankle, which is also an undeniable alibi; and,in case any one did doubt the ankle, there was a witness aboveall suspicion, Sir Bray Clinton, on his way to see it. Could Idoubt that Miss Clavering was awake when Macpherson firsttelephoned, and used the interval to make a date with Clintonand the doctor? Only we must not be there for the interview;Clinton would ask when the accident happened. It would notdo to tell him “Friday,” when the other doctor had deliber-ately dislocated the foot, as I was sure, on Monday, after Vi-sion Number Ten of poor Fraser.“But how does it happen that Fraser writes and telephonesjust as Miss Clavering dictates? Here we touch the darkestmoment of the drama. He was evidently a puppet throughout.It is clear to me that Miss Clavering, disguised as Fraser, hiredthe big racing car; that she met him on Friday night, chloro-formed him, took him to the house of Fisher here, and kepthim in durance.“On the Saturday she and Fisher play their appointed roles.Vision Number Two is devised to make it appear that Satur-day noon is the moment of the robbery, when in reality theparcels had been exchanged long before.”“I never packed the notes,” said Fisher. “I put them away inmy bag and took them home with me on Friday night.”“Good boy! now we’re being sensible. Well, to continuewith Saturday. Miss Clavering has a corpse in her car — andthis made me suspect a medical accomplice — goes throughher tricks, and returns to Fraser’s house. They then proceed toput pressure on Fraser. He resists. Miss Clavering resorts tothe white-hot poker. How do I know? Because care was takento destroy the abdomen. Under this torture Fraser wrote thetelegram which was later handed in by Clara; then he was setto telephone to you, Macpherson, with the implement of tor-ture ready in case he should make a mistake. Yet he kicked;they had to ring off, and have a second orgie of devilmentbefore he would give the answer you required. It was uselessfor him to give a false answer; his best chance of help (as theyprobably showed him) was to convince you that it was he.“Directly this is over, Fraser is murdered. It would reallyhave been safer to wait till the last moment ——”“Of course it would. You don’t know all, though you mustbe the devil to know what you do. But Fraser had aortic regur-gitation; he died while still speaking to you. We had meanthim to say a great deal more. That was where our plan brokedown.”“Still, it was a good plan,” returned Simon Iff cordially.“And the rest is simple. The car is left on a lonely road, withFraser in it, an evident suicide. And the doctor was to drivepast; he was in waiting, after firing the shot into Fraser’s ab-domen, for the lights of the patrol or whoever should come up;and he was to certify that the shot had caused death. Whyshould anyone suspect anything else? Perhaps the doctor wouldoffer to take it away in his car, and lose time in various ways,until the hour of death was no longer certain. Now, Fisher,why didn’t he do as arranged?”“Clara was full of morphia up to the neck. She did it all,plan and execution, on morphine and hysteria. Oh, you don’tknow her! But she broke down at that moment. She was in thecar with Leslie; she had a fit of tearing off her clothes andscreaming, and he had to struggle with her for an hour. Whenshe came to, it was too late and too dangerous to do anything.When I heard it, an hour later, I knew the game was up. Iknew that Fate was hunting us, even as we had thought wewere hunting Fate! The two accidents — Fraser’s death andher insanity — were the ruin of all! God help me!”“So she took morphia!” cried Macpherson. “Then was thatwhat you meant about the Chinaman?”“Good, Macpherson! You’re beginning to bring yourShakespeare into the bank!”“But you — how did you know about it?”“I was ten years in China. I’ve smoked opium as hard asanybody. I recognized the drama from the first as a mixture ofopium-visions and sex-hysteria.”“But I still don’t see why they should play this mad anddangerous game, when it would have been so simple just tosteal the money and get away.”“Well, first, there was the love of the thing. Secondly, itwas exceedingly shrewd. The important point was to coverthe one uncoverable thing, the theft of the money. Left alone,your business routine would have worked with its usual effi-ciency. You would have traced the Paris package minute byminute. Instead of that, you never gave it one thought. Youwere out on a wild goose chase after Fraser.

I could follow her mad mind, because I havesmoked opium. You might try that, too, by the way,Macpherson, if the Russian Ballet doesn’t appeal to you!“And now, Mr. Fisher, I wish you to answer my secondquestion. I have reasons for inclining to acquit you, in part;for giving you a chance. The man I mean to hang is Dr. Leslie.He is one of a common type, the ambitious money-lovingScotsman, clever and handsome, who comes to London tomake his way. They become women’s doctors; they seducetheir patients; they make them drug-fiends; they performabortions; and to the extortionate charges for their crimesthey add a tenfold profit by blackmail. These men are thecurse of London.”“It’s true; I think he ruined Clara with morphine. I feel sureshe was a good girl once.”“Tell us of your relations with her.”“I met her a year ago. Her fascination conquered me at once.Oh, you don’t know her! She could do anything with us all!She could tantalize and she could gratify, beyond all dreams.She was a liar to the core; but so wonderful, that even at themoment when reason declared her every word to be a lie, theheart and soul believed, as a nun clings to a crucifix! I was herslave. She tortured and enraptured me by day and night. Atthis moment I would kill myself to please her whim. She hasdelighted to make me do degrading and horrible things; shehas paid me for a week of agony with a kiss or a smile;she ——”The boy gasped, almost fainted. “Are there such women?”asked Macpherson. “I thought it was a fairy-tale.”“I have known three, intimately,” returned Simon Iff: “EdithHarcourt, Jeanne Hayes, Jane Forster. What the boy says istrue. I may say that indulgence in drink or drugs tends to cre-ate such monsters out of the noblest women. Of the three Ihave mentioned, the two latter were congenitally bad; EdithHarcourt was one of the finest women that ever lived, but hermother had taught her to drink when yet a child, and in a mo-ment of stress the hidden enemy broke from ambush and de-stroyed her soul. Her personality was wholly transformed; yes,sir, on the whole, I believe in possession by the devil. Allthree women ruined the men, or some of them, with whomthey were associated. Jeanne Hayes ruined the life of her hus-band and tore the soul out of her lover before she killed her-self; Jane Forster drove a worthy lawyer to melancholy mad-ness. Of their lesser victims, mere broken hearts and so on,there is no count. Edith Harcourt made her husband’s life ahell for three years, and after her divorce broke loose alto-gether, and destroyed many others with envenomed caresses.”“You knew her intimately, you say?”“She was my wife.”Macpherson remained silent. Fisher was sitting with hishead clasped in his hands, his body broken up with sobs.“Now, Macpherson, we are going to compound felony. I’mglad there was no murder, after all. I want you to let me takeFisher away with me; I’m going to put him with a society ofwhich I am president, which specializes in such cases, with-out cant or cruelty. Its aim is merely to put a man in the condi-tions most favorable to his proper development. This was afine lad until he met the woman who destroyed him, and Iknow that such women have a more than human power.“It will be your business to put Miss Clavering in an asy-lum, if you can catch her, which I sorely doubt. But I think thatif you go warily, you may catch Leslie.”It turned out as he had said. Clara had scented mischief,with her morphine-sharpened intellect and her hysteric’s intu-ition. She had persuaded Sir Bray Clinton to send her down toa hospital of his own in the country — and on the way she hadseized the soul of the chauffeur. They disappeared together,and there was no word of her for many a day. But Leslie hadsuspected nothing in the visit, or had laughed it off, or haddecided to bluff it out; he was arrested, and sentenced to pe-nal servitude for life.Fisher justified the good opinion of Simon Iff; but his spiritwas broken by his fatal love, and he will never do more thanserve the society that saved him, with a dog’s devotion.Macpherson followed the old mystic’s advice; he is to-daythe most daring, although the soundest, financier in London.Two nights ago he dined with the magician at the HemlockClub. “I’ve brought Shakespeare into the Bank,” he said, laugh-ingly, to Simple Simon. “But I’ll keep him out of the Club,this time!”“Oh well!” said Simon, “to spend too much time in studiesis sloth; to use them too much for ornament is affectation; tomake judgement wholly by their rules is the humor of a scholar;they perfect nature, and are themselves perfected by experi-ence; crafty men condemn them, wise men use them, simplemen admire them; for they teach not their own use, but thatthere is a wisdom without them and above them won by obser-vation. It’s well worth Five Pounds!”“But,” objected Macpherson, “that’s not Shakespeare; that’sBacon!”Simon Iff did not permit himself so much as theantepenumbra of a smile. “William Shakespeare wrote theworks of Francis Bacon; that is one of the Official Beliefs ofthe Hemlock Club.”“For the Lord’s sake!” cried the Banker. “I’ll never live upto this Club. Man, it’s a marvel!”“Well,” answered the magician, sipping his wine, “Youmight try a course of William Blake.”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL332332(Concluded from the last issue.)Another important attainment is that of traveling in the “as-tral body.” This, too, I practiced hard. I was able in time tomake my presence known to a person at a distance, by a sort ofinstinct. Soon I got it so that I could be both seen and heard. Ihave not yet been able to impress inanimate objects, for I gaveup this class of work as not essential to the Great Work. Forinstance, when I was in Honolulu I had a long talk with a girl inHong Kong. I described the town, and her house and room, withaccuracy, in great detail. She, too, saw me and wrote down myremarks correctly. But I failed to knock a vase off the mantel, asI wished.The point is this. To “get into the astral body” really meansto allow the consciousness to rest in a vehicle of fine matter,and, detaching that from the gross body, to move about. But thishas its drawbacks. One is no longer at all on the material plane,but on the astral plane, and one must not expect to see materialthings. This is the blunder made by “physical clairvoyants” andthe cause of their constant errors. No; for physical clairvoyance,or for action at a distance, somewhere on the astral one mustpick up ready material as a basis for a sort of “incarnation.”Thus the girl I speak of had burnt incense specially to give me abody visible and tangible and audible. But incense is not strongenough to make a body mechanically solid. It becomes sensibleto the eye and ear of a living person, as a cloud is, but not strongenough to resist pressure.However, by offering blood one can construct a body goodenough for, say, courtship and marriage. I have done this oftenenough; it is not at all difficult when the conditions are right. Itis dangerous, though; if anything happened to the blood whenyou were using it, there would be a nasty mess, and if the bloodbe not carefully destroyed after you have finished with it, it maybe seized by some vampirish elemental or demon. I think noone below the grade of Magister Templi should use blood, un-less he be also an initiate of the IX° of O. T. O.Such have been only a few of very varied activities. I mayremark that the methods so far employed are not altogether sat-isfactory. There is too much accident, for one thing. Quite re-cently, a disciple of mine, painting that great square of letterswhich synthesizes the elemental forces of water, had a tank burstand flood his house. On another occasion, at headquarters, teach-ing astral traveling through the Tablet of Fire, we had five firesin three days, while the disciple who was being taught wenthome the third night, and found his house burning, a fire havingstarted in the coal cellar. A “natural” fire can’t start in a coalcellar, especially, as in this case in winter.For another thing, these methods are very tedious. A properevocation of a spirit to visible appearance means weeks of pre-paratory work. Again, they do not always succeed as fully asone would like. In short, I felt the need of further initiation, andthe communication of a method as safe and sane and easy asrailway traveling.I will not here detail the steps by which this came to me;enough to say that the A∴ A∴, the mightiest organization onthe planet, chose me eleven years ago to do a certain work, andrewarded me in no niggard spirit. Then, nearly six years ago,the Frater Superior of the O. T. O. came to me, and appointedme Grand Master of the Order in all English-speaking coun-tries of the Earth, and Special Delegate to America. With thisHe conferred the secret of high Magick which I wanted. Easy tooperate as a bicycle, and sure of results as a bottle of brandy, itonly needed a little intelligent study and practice to supplant allthe old methods, which became, as it were, adjutants of the realthing.It is upon this that I am still at work, for I have not yet com-pletely mastered it. There are two parts to every magical opera-tion. The ancient Alchemists expressed this in their formula“Solve et Coagula.” First, one must subtilize matter so as to beable to mould it, and then fix it again in gross matter so as toretain the desired form.The first part of this is swiftly and surely accomplished bythe method of which I write; the second part is not equally easy.The result is that one obtains always an earnest of the desiredgoal, a shadow of the reward, so to speak. But this does notalways materialize. For example, one performs an operation “tohave $20,000.” A few days later a prospect of obtaining thatexact sum suddenly arises, then fades slowly away. Exactly whatto do in such a case is a problem of which I have not yet foundTHE REVIVAL OF MAGICKby theMASTER THERIONDO WHAT THOU WILTSHALL BETHE WHOLE OF THE LAW"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL333333the perfect answer. Fortunately, it rarely happens that this troublesupervenes. In five out of six times the desired event comesnaturally to pass without further disturbance. But I confess thatI should like to make that sixth time safe, and I believe that inanother few months I shall have done so. Already matters haveimproved seventy per cent. since I first was initiated in the GreatSecret.It is no great wonder, then, that Magick has revived. When Ibegan the work of the A∴ A∴ I had over a hundred pupils inless than six months. The system of the A∴ A∴ is singular inmany respects; in none more than in this, that it is really secret.No man except the Head and His Chancellor, and HisPraemonstrator, knows more than two members; that one whoinitiated him, and the one that comes to him for initiation. Inthis way the work has spread through the world with no fuss ortrouble. Only now and again is any open work visible — whenIsis lifts her skirt enough to show her stocking!For instance, one hears of public ceremonies on A∴ A∴ linesin South Africa, in West Africa, in Vancouver, in Sydney, inParis and London and (maybe) New York. These appear spo-radic; their simultaneity is really the mark of what is passing inthe mind of the Masters of the A∴ A∴The success of the O. T. O. is even more striking to theuninitiate, because its results are more apparent.Part of the policy of this order is to buy real estate every-where, to build and furnish temples, lodges, and retreats. Hardlya month passes but I hear of some new branch already finan-cially sound, with its own headquarters, some beautiful prop-erty in the country, a fine house, large grounds, all that is neededboth for initiations, and for the practice of that life, and of thoseworks, which bring forth fruit from the seed of those initiations.And every week brings me news manifold of what is being done.There is hardly a country in the world which has not dozens ofmembers hard at work at magick, and for the most part makingprogress at a rate which almost makes me jealous, although formy generation I made advance which was a miracle of rapidityand excited the envy of all the duffers. But the work done by myMasters and (I think I may truly say) by myself also has simpli-fied the work incredibly for all. In the Equinox, 777, Konx OmPax and a few secret documents, the whole mystery has beenexplained; and, for the first time in the history of Magick, astandard Encyclopedia has been published. It is no longer nec-essary to study fifty strange tongues and wade through ten thou-sand obscure and ambiguous volumes. With three months’ studyand a year’s practice any man of moderate intelligence and suf-ficient will-power is armed, once and for all, for the battle. Onlyin the O. T. O. is some knowledge kept back, and that becausethe great secret is so easy to learn and so simple to operate thatit would be madness to entrust it to any person untested byyears of fidelity.These, then, are the principal causes of the Revival of Mag-ick. It is not possible to publish the figures, nor would it bedesirable. But I can assure the public that one has only to enterthe magick path to find on all sides and in the most unexpectedquarters, men and women whose whole life is secretly devotedto the attainment of the Royal and Sacredotal Art.Already Magick is once more a World-Power; the print of theGiant’s Thumb is already the amazement of the incredulous;and within five years it will be clear enough to all men Whobrought about the World war and why.We shall see science triumphant, philosophy revolutionized,art renewed, commercialism checkmated; and astride of the horseof the Sun we shall see the Lord come as a conqueror into HisKingdom.The Revival of Magick is the Mother of the New Aeon.And who is the Father?“Ho! for his chariot wheels that flame afar,“His hawk’s eye flashing through the Silver Star!“Upon the heights his standard shall plant,“Free, equal, passionate, pagan, dominant,“Mystic, indomitable, self-controlled,“The red Rose glowing on the Cross of Gold!”Do you wish to find Him?Herein is wisdom; let him that hath understanding count thenumber of The Beast; for it is the number of a man; and hisnumber is six hundred and three score and six.————FLOWERSBy ERNEST McGAFFEYRose of the dawn as saffron wan, lighting a gaunt grey sea,Or a red, red rose by the garden wall at the foot of a red rose tree,But or ever I wake or sleep at last, the rose of her breasts for me.Poppies that blaze in a blaze of gold, fair and more fair than fair,Yellow as ever the dull brocade that the Lords and Ladies wear,But never a gold shall time unfold like the gold of a woman’s hair.Brown, wine-brown is the wall-flower’s plume that near to thefountain lies,Brown as the sheen that jewels the wings of the hovering dragon-flies,But pale by the glow of autumn fire which lurks in a woman’seyes.Lilies?

Provide, further, against the decay of the royal facul-ties by an annual test of physical, mental, and moral fitness.— Contr. Ed. Int.)I.Reverently the King approached the flame that flickered inthe centre of the hut. It was a small round hut, built of wood,reeds, and straw; but it was called the King’s House, althoughthe King actually dwelt in a more pretentious building a fewyards away. It was in a very particular sense his house, how-ever; for in it was his power enshrined, and the life of his people.For the King was King of the Sylvii, that dwelt in the mightyforests of oak that clothed the Alban Hills, far yet from theMaremma and the Tiber and the rise of Rome. The oak was thesacred tree of the tribe, their badge, their totem, and their god.The sky was but the roof of the oak, and the thunder but itsvoice monitor or oracular.More, to these people the King was actually the oak, and thegod of the oak; and the life of the King was the life of the people.It was the office of the King to sustain the works of nature; andin particular he must provide men with fire. Thus the hearth ofblazing oak-boughs was itself bound intimately with the life ofthe King, and had the fire become inadvertently extinguished,disaster must assuredly ensue. Hence the King’s own daughterswere vowed wholly to the maintenance of the sacred flame; andno thought of man might pollute that diamond devotion.Yet since all nature renews itself every year to restore itsvigor, so must it be for the king and for the fire. Every midsum-mer the King must prove himself to be of unimpaired force, andevery spring the fire must be ceremonially extinguished andrekindled by the King himself, assisted by his eldest daughter.It was this latter rite at which he was now president. Havingapproached the flame, he placed his hands upon it, and withfirm dignity crushed it out of existence. In vain his daughterblew upon the ash; no spark was left.Assured upon this point, she went to the sacred storehousewhich contained the ancestral urns, and the magic weapons ofthe forefathers of King Sylvius. From this place she took a flatboard of soft wood, in which were a number of charred holes.This she laid upon the floor of the hut, and squatted behind it,holding it firmly with both hands and feet. The King knelt downin front of the board, and, producing a new-cut oaken stick,sharpened at one end, placed the point against the board andbegan to twirl it rapidly. Soon evidences of heat became mani-fest; the girl placed tinder around the point of contact; smokearose; she caught it in her hands, and blew the spark into a flame.Immediately she rose from the ground, and placed the burn-ing tinder in a nest of young dry twigs of oak over which shehad placed larger and larger branches; in a few minutes theflame shot in a rose-gold pyramid into the air. Meanwhile theKing had opened the door of the hut, crying jubilantly:“The child is born!” These words were taken up a great shoutby the whole people of the Sylvii, who were waiting in awe andadoration without. One by one the women came forward, eachwith her bough of oak; each entered the hut, kindled her boughfrom the great fire, and went out to bear it reverently back toher own extinguished hearth.At last all was finished. The King was once more alone withhis daughter. “Julia!” The girl stood with her hands foldedmeekly on her breast, awaiting with bowed head the paternaladmonition. “O first of the wardens of the sacred flame! O daugh-ter of the son of the fire of the oak! O thou that keeping vigilupon the holy hearth art visited by the words of Truth! Declareto me the omens!”Julia raised her head, “O king!” she cried, “O great Oak! OMaster of the Sky and of the Thunder! O son of the fire of theOak! O mighty to slay and to save, hear the word of the fire ofthe Oak!” So far was ritual; she spoke with regular intonation;now she became troubled, and it was with hesitating tonguethat she declared the omens. “The flame was fierce,” she wenton, “the tinder burned my hands. The dry twigs would not kindle;then they lit suddenly and with violence, flying in the air likestartled birds.“Then came an air from the East, and blew all into a blaze.No sooner was this blaze bright than the air blew no more, butthe flame leaped to heaven like a pyramid.”The king threw his robe over his face, and went out of thehut. She looked on him with staring eyes. “It is then terrible forhim — though I do not know the meaning of the omens.“But oh! I did not dare to tell him that which I do know. Icould not speak the words — how the flame leapt out at me likea serpent and caught me between the breasts. He loves me toomuch; how will it be when I am ashamed before all men andmust die? Oh terror of the darkness, as I lie in that cavern of theworm beneath the earth — awaiting death. Oh me!”It is a characteristic folly of clairvoyants to keep back part oftheir visions from the magicians who alone can interpret themsuccessfully.Julia was entirely at fault in this matter of the omen; she wasnot an initiate, and she relied on old wives’ tales. Such faultscarry their own doom, and the means of it; for, being sure thatsomething could go wrong, she had no more confidence thatanything would go right; and one cannot hole a six-inch puttwithout confidence.“If the sun and moon should doubt,They’d immediately go out.”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL335335But perhaps the King had some good ground for his anguish.Omens are curious things. If you sit down thirteen at a table,and die within the year, you are just as dead as if you had al-ways dined alone!II.Julia was the eldest daughter of the King, and the thronewent with her hand, according to the custom of the people.A plague of smallpox had ravaged the oak-groves ten yearsearlier when she had seen eight summers, and left her sole survi-vor of the royal family, except Claudia, a child of three yearsold. All her other sisters were therefore much younger than she;her brothers had gone afield to seek their fortune in strangeplaces. The plague had not left her wholly scatheless; she borea few small pocks on her forehead and cheek. But these tendedrather to increase the fascination of her beauty. She was litheand long, but robust and well developed for her years. Her headwas small and well-poised upon a pillar throat, the face oval,the eyes large and very lustrous, the nose long and straight, themouth beautifully curved, with a long upper lip which shonewith faint down. But her greatest beauty lay perhaps in her hair,which was extraordinarily fair, the very lightest shade imagin-able of brown, with a certain ashen tinge which made it almosttransparent to the sunlight. The length of it, and its abundance,were the wonder of the people, who saw therein a good omen ofthe vigor of the royal house.In the time of the plague, and the harsh years of building upthe community again from it, that followed, she and her fatherhad drawn very close together. He had come to rely on her al-most exclusively, for there was no one else so near that he couldtrust. On her side, too, the whole warmth of her nature went outto him. She was of fierce temper, but slow smouldering; of pur-pose inscrutable and indomitable. Often her stubbornness hadstrengthened the hands of the king, her father, when he hesi-tated; she had pushed him through doubt and through disasterto success.Her occupation as Vestal had left her utterly innocent; sheknew what god she worshipped, and she knew that she was thebride of the fire, and would one day bear children to it; but shehad formulated no connection in her mind between these factsand those of human nature. She was the daughter of God; thepeople were as far beneath her as the stones under her feet.That she should sink to their level by any acceptation of theirlimitations was to her mind unthinkable; hence the passionatehorror aroused in her soul by her misinterpretation of the omenof the flame.The impression which had been made soon faded; three weekslater the festivities of spring drove everything else from hermind. The quaint figure of the Green Man, with his wreaths ofoak and his fantastic mask, his weird and intense dances, andthe ceremony of drenching him with water, made a mark on hermind which it had never done before. So deep was it that forthree nights successively she dreamed of the dances, and oneach night she heard voices from the sacred storehouse wherethe fire-drills represented the ancestors of the royal house; itseemed that they were talking together. She caught the tone ofexcitement, but could make nothing of the words; for of coursethey were speaking in the secret language of the gods, whichonly her father, of all the Sylvii, knew.Then for a week or two things seemed to slip into the oldroutine. But now came something new and quite beyond natureinto her; she became for the first time conscious of herself. In-stead of seeing the King’s House about her, she saw herselfmoving in the house. It was not merely the fire on which shethrew the boughs; she saw herself throwing boughs on to thefire. External things became subordinate. With that, she dis-covered that she was restless; time, which had hitherto meantnothing to her, instead of flowing unperceived, became insis-tent. Unable to forget herself, she began to analyze herself. Shenoticed that she was always pacing to and fro, and wonderedwhy. Her body became an obsession.Soon she acquired the habit of lying down before the fire,and gazing into it. Here, with her head resting upon her hands,she would remain for hours, motionless save for one leg, whichshe would swing on toe and knee from side to side, now fast,now slow. The whole of her being would concentrate in themuscles of that leg; she would be conscious of nothing else, andshe would analyze the sensation in it, which would become ex-traordinarily acute and voluptuous. She delighted in feeling thedifferent rhythms of its movement. She would halt them delib-erately, torturing herself with exquisite anticipation of the mo-ment when she would begin again. It is hard to record suchsubtleties of thought. Somewhat thus, perhaps, they danced.“Fast and slow — tense and slack. How hard can I push down?How hard can I pull up? Side to side — to and fro. Circularmovements. All concentration in the foot; toe by toe extensionand contraction. Which toes can I move separately? Could I bal-ance my leg by its own weight without supporting it by stiffen-ing a muscle? — most exquisite, subtle and voluptuous prob-lem! Tap — tap — tap; that is my heel upon the floor of thathut; I understand. Now Tap tap — tap — tap — tap — tap —another rhythm, another world of music and beauty. Now slow,now fast; every rhythm has infinite capacities of modulation. Iam alive in a live world of infinite ecstasies — abyss after abyssopening at each timid step. Eternity cannot exhaust the varia-tions of delight that can play on this one muscle! What a worldto live in! Ah! Ah! Ah!” After a while this would become toooverpowering; the possibilities of pleasure would appal her bytheir multiplicity; and she would rub her thumb and forefingerslowly together with every kind of motion, watching intently,and so drinking in the wonder and splendor of life through sightas well as touch.One very curious thing she noticed. Now and again the mov-ing muscles seemed to take up an independent personality, towish to assert themselves as individual wills, and to imposethemselves upon the rest of the body by causing it to join intheir movement. She would nearly always resist this, thoughsometimes the thumb and forefinger would set the muscles ofthe arm and shoulder twitching, and sometimes the leg wouldcommunicate its swing to the whole body. But for some reason,or rather in accordance with some instinct, she resented thedomination of the other will. But the pressure constantly in-creased upon her; and one day she gave way completely. Shenever knew what happened; her memory told her nothing; butwhen she came to herself, she found that she had slept for hours;her clothes were bathed in sweat, and the dust of the floor waswetted here and there by drops of it. From the footprints, too,she divined that she must have been dancing; evidently untilexhaustion, and sleep, supervened.Of this she told her father. “Julia!” said he, “there is nothingto fear. The ancestors themselves have taught you the Sacred"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL336336Dance of the Vestals.” From that time she resisted no more; sheallowed delirium to take its course. Such crises gave her themost exquisite relief; the perfect physical fatigue was an en-chantment. Gradually, too, she mastered the possession, andknew what she was doing. But as she gained this, she lost theeffect; she failed to reach the summits of enthusiasm, and thefatigue, instead of being pleasure, was partial, a dull ache, inwhich she was too tired to dance, not tired enough to sleep. Butone thing grew upon her, the fascination of the fire. The play ofits heat upon her face tortured and delighted her. Sometimesshe would loosen her robe and thrust her breast over the glow-ing oak, rejoicing as it scorched her. Sometimes she would playwith the flame with her hands, passing them through and throughit. She imagined them as fish leaping in the water. But nowherewas satisfaction to be found. She became moody and wretched,toying fatally instead of willfully with the fire, obtaining nopleasure, yet unable to stop. One day she took a brand from theflame, and began to dance the marriage dance with it; was shenot the Bride of the Fire? Round and round the hut she leaptand whirled, thrashing herself savagely with the burning bough,until in ecstasy of pain and excitement she flung back the brandinto the flame, and fell prone upon the ashes about the fire in aswoon of utter collapse.When she awoke to life she found that she was badly burned.But the ancestors had communed with her in her trance; fromthat moment she was a changed creature. She reverted to herold quiet ways; she lost the self consciousness that had dis-turbed her; and she occupied herself with patient toil. It was acurious task that she had set herself; she took long strands ofher hair, and wove them, wove them, day and night, into a finenetwork, a glimmering veil scarcely visible for glamor, a pallorof ash like the harvest-moon, but strong with deft inlacement sothat she might have bound inextricably a young bull in its elas-tic tether.The autumn fell upon the hills; no untoward incident hadmarred the life of the tribe; at the midsummer ceremony of theFlight of the King her father had conquered easily, running lightlyfrom his palace to the hill-top where stood the twin oaks soli-tary and proud that marked the turning-point of the race, passedbetween them, and taken refuge on the hearth of Vesta, the flam-ing bough waving triumphantly in his hand before the first ofthe suitors for the kingdom had reached even the top of thelittle ridge that was the last landmark in the race. His start,which amounted to nigh a fourth of the course, was ample, savein serious debility or accident.He who was first of all the disappointed crowd was a strangerfrom a very far country. He was like a young leopard, ruddybronze, with gleaming eye and flashing teeth, long-armed, withblack hair curled upon his brows. When he saw that the kingwas safe, instead of following and joining in the banquet whichwas always ready in the palace to refresh the contestants of therace, and to celebrate the renewed life and vigor of the King, hewaved his sword, gave a great shout, and, swerving from thecourse, ran wildly through the village, and was lost to sight.Julia asked her father who he was, and why he acted thus,not in accordance with the custom. “His name is Abrasax, andhis surname Ithys, which means The Straight One, and he is ofan island called Chi in the great sea which he says reaches tothe bounds of the world. He is full of strange tales. I do notknow why he has gone.”Perhaps Julia herself knew; for on the day before her eyeshad fallen upon him as he passed, and seen in his gaze that itwas she, more than the kingdom, that he desired. Perhaps hehad gone because he would not come to her unless triumphant.And she flashed with scorn and anger that he should treat her asa woman. And that night she knew. For when all was still, anarrow with blunt point was shot into the King’s House, and inits notch was fastened a thin piece of bark on which was writtenone word — “YET.”So summer passed and fell into autumn; Julia had finishedher veil, twelve yards in length, a foot in breadth, and bound itround about her brows for a crown, a tapering cone of beautytowering from her forehead.The days drew in; Julia fell into utter listlessness and lassi-tude. She could hardly force herself to tend the sacred fire. Shesat hour by hour brooding over it; it had lost its power to kindleher; she let a brand fall on her wrist, and it only woke the fleshto pain, dull and stupid, a dark hall of melancholy and of theshadow of death. She became brutalized; only, like a dog, shesought her father constantly, taking refuge with him from herill-ease; to feel his arms about her seemed protection from —she knew not what.Yet in all the monotony of her misery there was a single pointat which all concentrated; the memory of a leap and a shout, abronze leopard body, fierce eyes, black curls, a long sword glit-tering to heaven, and an arrow shot into the holy house of Vesta.And so acute became that pang that in her heart was born adeadly hatred. He had insulted her by his proud glance; he meantall that was dangerous, all that was evil, in her life; she per-sonified the malice of all damned ghosts and sorcerers, themenace of her people, in him.This hate so grew upon her that it turned to sickness; bluelines came under her eyes; her skin was loose upon her; herlimbs were heavy; she could not eat; she spent her days squat-ting before the fire, now and then lifting a great bough withweary arms to let it drop dully on the embers. She never caredto make it blaze up brightly; so long as a live spark lay in theash, she was fulfilling all she need. Even in the bitter nights ofwinter, when the wind howled through the rude walls of thehut, and snow came through the opening in the roof to hiss uponthe fire, she preferred to sit and shiver in her robe, rather thanto heap the boughs. At last all this formulated itself in a singleconscious will. Abrasax would return at midsummer, she wassure; well, let him come. She knew how he must pass from thepalace to the hut appointed for his bestowal at night after thebanquet; she would waylay him and kill him. So now she took adagger and passed her days sharpening it on a stone, testing iton the boughs of oak; her whole soul black with bitter lust ofmurder.And then came the day of the Rekindling of the Fire. She hadregained her peace of mind, her confidence, her calm. With afirm voice she declared the omens; all were favorable. Only, asthe days drew on to midsummer, gladness grew upon her evenas the flowers upon their stems; only twelve days more — elevendays more — ten days more — before she would plunge thatsteel into the heart of the man whose image mocked and tauntedand defiled her.III.Now all things drew on apace to the conclusion. Three daysbefore the Ceremony of the Flight of the King, the strangers"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL337337began to arrive. Julia marked Abrasax among them and, with-drawing, looked to her dagger. It was sharp, deadly sharp. Herarm was strong; it sank an inch into the oaken doorpost as shelunged. She was more than human, in the glee that filled her.Her sister, Claudia, now fourteen years of age, spoke of hisstrength and beauty. Julia stopped her with one venomous word.It was the night before the race. She could hear the revelry inthe palace; it would be very dark; the moon was new, a cadentcrescent hung over the sunset. The shouts of the men at feastbecame less boisterous; now was her hour. She fed the flametill it roared high; then wrapped herself close, and stole forthinto the darkness. From the shelter of the house where she lurkedshe could watch the palace; she saw the lights die down, oneafter one; she saw man after man come through the brilliantdoorway. At last came Abrasax. She crouched, tense and eager,ready to spring. Only a moment now!But the moment drew out unfathomably; no sound of drunkensong, no stumbling footstep. He had simply vanished in the dark-ness. She set herself to wait. The minutes passed, nerve-rack-ing, hideous. She was within a few yards of the door of thehouse where he lodged; he could hardly have gone round an-other way and reached safety. Then clarity came to her; sherealized that in the open air and in the darkness his drunken-ness must have overcome him; he would be prone, perhaps notfar from the door of the palace. She would go find him. But firstshe must return; she had been perilously long away from theKing’s House; the fire must be replenished. She would throwlogs upon it, then go to her glad work!Stealthy as a tigress, she shrunk back to the hearth. She openedthe door. Only just in time; mere sparks, no flame, in the Houseof the King! She went forward.Instantly she was overthrown and nearly strangled by a leanarm that shot from the blackness. Before she could scream, hermouth was caught in the vice of gorilla jaws. The blood gushedfrom her lips. She could not move her dagger hand; her armswere pinioned. A rough knee-stroke left her bare of her lastfence; she lay at the mercy of her murderer.Then blackness devoured her as with fire; she sank far belowbeing; but the throb of her blood, bursting in her ears, was likethe universal cry of all her ancestors. She fell into a hell ofroaring flame, of blazing shouts; she died once, twice and thrice.She knew no more.Suddenly she awoke; she found herself in utter darkness; herone thought was of the fire; the fire was out. Savagely shedragged her bruised and broken body to the hearth; no sparkremained. “The fire is out,” she moaned, “and I am lost.” “Weshall rekindle it,” boomed the voice of Abrasax; “go, bring thedrill!” The blasphemy of the idea appalled her. Only the kinghimself might twirl the sacred oak. A clenched fist struck herear. She went to the storehouse, took the board, and a striker atrandom, returned, and squatted down as her custom was. Abrasaxtook the drill; under his vigorous palms a minute sufficed toheat the tinder; her breath blew it into flame. She saw his cruelface alight with laughter; blood from her mouth was splashedupon it. She threw the tinder on the hearth, caught up dry twigs,and built the fire. Instantly it leapt and crackled; the flame soaredin a pyramid of blue and rose and gold, showering out sparks ofglory, a rain of meteors.When she turned to face her assailant, he was gone.For an hour she lay motionless, as one dead, before the fire.She rose with shaken limbs; stiffened herself to fate, with ser-pent swiftness she put her hands to her hair, then, darkling,sped from the hut.She was no longer the same woman as when she had left itearlier in the night; then, her virgin will, conscious and glad,impelled her; now, it was impulse seated in some cavern of hersoul that she had never plumbed, obedience, unquestioning andblind, to the fact of an inscrutable and inexorable fate.IV.The King, a blazing brand of oak in his right hand, ran lightlyto the crest of the ridge beyond the village. There he threw itdown, as symbol of his temporary abdication, the signal for thestrangers to race after him. He ran lightly and easily as ever;only a month before he had run down a lone wolf by sheer speedand endurance. Disappearing over the crest, he was soon vis-ible again upon the slopes of that high hill where the twin oaksformed the turning point. Abrasax had gained slightly on him;the others not at all. The King turned near the top of the slope;he perceived the situation. But he was going to take no risks;now was the moment to break the heart of his pursuer. He wouldshow him his speed on the steep hill; he could increase thedistance, sprinting the few yards that lay between him and thesummit; thence he would leap down the long slope like a deerpursued by a wolf; in that critical half-mile he would finish therace, almost less by speed than by psychology.He took a deep breath, and increased his pace; he positivelyleapt up the last slopes; he reached the level; his limbs loos-ened; he opened his great chest and ran like the wind.Abrasax, laboring, followed him warily, holding in hisstrength.The King, reaching the trees, was at the top of his pace; then,in the sight of all his tribe, he stumbled and fell. The shock wastremendous; but to that wiry frame not irretrievable. He couldnot understand it; it was the first time in all his life that it hadchanced; but he had no time to reason; he must run. Down thelong slope he plunged, and was lost to sight of the Sylvii behindthe crest of the low ridge whence he had started.Julia stood at the door of the King’s House. She was clad inthe vestments of a priestess, and in her hand she bore the blaz-ing oak bough, symbol of the sovereignty of the Sylvii. Withstraining eyes she watched the crest of the ridge, and all herpeople stood about her, solemnly ranged to keep the course.When the King fell, a gasp went up to heaven, but his quickrecovery seemed to auger his safety.But the minutes hung; the King did not appear. Then on thecrest there towered the figure of Abrasax; a moment more, leap-ing, a leopard, he was at the threshold of the King’s House. Inhis right hand he held aloft his crimson sword, in his left, thebearded head of the old king. His fingers stiffened in its hair;its blood dripped on the vestal robes of Julia, who, sinking toher knees, held out the flaming branch and cried, “My Lord!My Lord! Hail, O great Oak! O Master of the Sky and of theThunder! O son of the fire of the Oak!”And all the people cried aloud, as he flung down his swordand held the bough to heaven: “Hail, O great Oak! Hail, King ofthe Sylvii!”Then he raised Julia and kissed her before all the people, sothat their acclamations rang again; echoes from the woods andfrom the hills caught up the cry; the whole of Nature seemedregenerate as the new King stood erect and cried his triumph to"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL338338the world.He laid the brand upon the hearth. It was Claudia, and notJulia, who followed him; for Julia might no more enter into thetemple. In her was the royal power, and she was vowed to thenew king. The younger girl seemed overcome with sorrow andanger; but her sister moved as a sleep-walker moves, automa-ton, entranced.Abrasax took her by the waist, and led her to the palace. Thebanquet was to be their wedding, and his confirmation in theroyal power. Julia lay like a dead woman against his breast; shewould not eat, but drank huge cups of the black terrible wine ofthe country.The ceremonies were ended; the guests departed; the headmen of the Sylvii gathered up their robes, and made their wayto their homes.Abrasax and Julia were left alone. He led her trembling to theroyal chamber, still vivid with the daily chattels of her father.“You who hate me,” said he bitterly, “shall serve me as aslave.” He clenched his fist; his blows rained upon her body.“Thus — and thus — and thus — will I teach you to serve me— and to love me!”She lay back in his arms, her hair dishevelled hanging ingreat cascades upon the floor, her face bloody with his blows,and her eyes mad with wine. But her bruised mouth droppedwords like some thick poisonous perfume from the athanor ofan alchemist. “I stretched my veil between the oaks so that myfather might fall — oh my lover!”He understood.His passion foamed over the bounds of his consciousness!Hers mastered his.The sun was up near noon when his eyes fell upon her face;she lay like a corpse upon the straw.He mused awhile; then decision came into his eyes. He roseand robed himself; the golden circlet twined with oak leavesbound his brows. He called together the head men of the Sylvii;he led them to the bridal chamber.“Fathers!” he cried, “I found this woman not a virgin; let herbe buried alive as is the custom; I will take Claudia to wife.”PAN.By Vincent Starrett.In a dim grotto of the wood, they said,Great Pan lies dead;And then they flewLaughing across the sand, but paused anew,Clad in white chastity, upon the brink —Shy fawns at drink,Half-frightened byThe murmuring treetops and the water’s sigh —Viewing the wood with half-alarmed grimaceFor a strange face.The goat-eared Pan,They said in bravado, is not a manBut a dead god; an antique legend sungTo charm the young.And then the seaRobed them in living jewels lavishly;Clasped his wet arms about them — ah, so slim! —Drew them to him.Beware, old sea!Dost thou not fear Pan’s maddened jealousy?Dost thou think, too, that Pan is dead and cold,Deep in the goldDead leaves of fall,Leaving all this to thee as seneschal?Long since thou heard the cloven hoof resoundUpon the ground;Since thy pale glassGave back his image.

He sought out his successful rival, and lenthim ten thousand dollars “without security — on his note ofhand alone.” A year later McPherson had added to that kind-ness in two ways; he had taken the other man’s wife off hishands, and had given him a steady job at fourteen dollars aweek in his office.McPherson used to charge a nominal interest on the moneyhe lent. It looked at first sight between 3 and 4 per cent. Be-sides, as he often explained, the borrower did not have to pay itat all; the burden could be shifted (by a simple transaction),from the present to the future. McPherson never took any harshsteps; all you had to do was to keep on signing scraps of paperjust so long as your capital lasted. And every time you signed anew document, McPherson would hand you out real money witha sunny smile.But a careful examination of these scraps of paper wouldreveal a singular phenomenon. What looked in the beginninglike 3!/2 per cent., and was really about 11, soon began to looklike 15, when it was really 40, and then like 35, when it wasreally 80.McPherson disapproved of the principle of usury; he sympa-thized with the hardship of the man who had to pay interest,and he always preferred to add the interest to the capital. Theonly noticeable point was that the man who began by wantingone hundred dollars on the security of ten thousand soon foundthat he wanted a thousand to discharge the same liability as thehundred once satisfied. McPherson used to say that this en-larged the man’s mind; it taught him to “think imperially.”The upshot of all these transactions was simply thatMcPherson got the money, because these were only minute trans-actions, infinitesimal incidents in a vast system of exchange. Ifwe enlarge the scope of our considerations to national finances,we shall find strong similarities, but one big difference.Suppose a small nation begins to borrow, and fails to use themoney as a means of increasing income. Here the case is paral-lel, because the transaction is still on too small a scale to upsetthe balance of wealth of the world to any serious extent. Butwhen borrowing becomes universal, conditions are altogetherdifferent.The financial transactions of the last three years have notreally been borrowing at all in any proper sense of the term.There has been nothing constructive about it. The world hasbeen squandering its capital. The lives and the labor of meneverywhere have been lost. The actual wealth of nature has beenmisapplied to purposes of pure destruction, and none of thislost wealth can ever be regained.It was all very well for Henry the Fifth to invade France andrecoup his losses by tribute and ransom. That is now impos-sible, since the enemy is bankrupt even before he is defeated.The question remains: What has happened to the borrowedmoney? The answer is plain: It has been lost. It is simple juggleryto make it appear otherwise.It will be noticed in particular how very easily we have learnedto “think imperially.” England was quite shocked by the firstloan of some dozen million dollars; a year later she is quitereconciled to the idea of spending thirty million every day. TheTHE RAKE’S PROGRESSUnited States decides to sit in the game in no piking spirit, andcalls not for seven million, or even seven hundred million, butfor seven thousand million. That, it may be remarked, is aboutfourteen years’ income of the whole British Empire.But now we see a very great difference between these trans-actions and those of my good friend, McPherson. However muchthe borrower paid him, a dollar was at least a dollar, becausethe outside exchange remained steady. Dollars are nothing butchips. The wealth of the world has been steadily squandered;the amount of goods which we are getting for our seven billiondollars could have been bought for three million three yearsago. That process will continue so long as the unproductive ex-penditure of the world’s real capital continues.The rate of interest constantly increases as the amount ofmoney borrowed increases. But how is the interest to be paid?Only in two ways; firstly by taxation; secondly, by borrowingmore money. But the second process only means increased taxa-tion later on. Nothing replaces the wealth which has been squan-dered, and nothing ever can. All attempts to get away from thatfact are mere intellectual cocaine.One may say something worse. Nations seem to get delu-sions of grandeur when they begin to think in billions, insteadof millions — it is a sort of general paralysis of the insane, andis only too likely to terminate in a similar manner.Once finance becomes unsound, a vicious circle is soon cre-ated. When a man has to pay forty dollars for what used to costtwenty, he has to get more money somehow — and what ismoney? What is a dollar? It is fine to get $35 or $40 on a $1,000Bond. But suppose that in a year or so that is the price of apacket of cigarettes?Economy is all very well, but it means nothing to that im-mense class of the community which already lives from hand tomouth. Therefore wages must go up; that further increases thecost of production, which again makes it necessary to increasewages still further. One arrives at a condition of inflation whichcan only spell the words everlasting smash.Already twenty years ago the dollar was dangerously watered.It was the price of a beefsteak both in El Paso and in Juarez; butthe El Paso dollar, as a dollar, could be exchanged for two Mexi-can dollars. At that time I already saw the danger and said, “Ifever the United States gets into war, the dollar will at once fallto fifty cents.” It would have already done so if the rest of theworld had not fallen into the soup ahead of her.The economic process is continuing, although at presentmasked by the financial expedients of the bankers. Men arebeing killed; labor is being diverted to unproductive ends; thewealth of the world is being destroyed; the land itself is beingrendered sterile. We should face the situation. We should raisethe needed money in a straightforward manner, by direct taxa-tion; not by a camouflage which represents a loss as a profit.No matter how many billion dollars we borrow, no matterhow many we steal, we do not thereby increase the productionof necessities. It is possible to do this when we are playing offone part of the world against another, when we have a surplusavailable to enable some primitive country to increase produc-tion by the introduction of machinery, for example. But whenour surplus becomes imaginary, a matter of mere bundles of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL340340waste paper, no such transactions are any longer possible.When we get down to bed-rock, the value of any securitydepends on whether or not it can earn interest. A railway whichcan pay no dividend has no value, and its stock is worthless,except so far that there is a hope that it may one day show aprofit. Now, the actual destruction caused by the war has re-duced a great number of industries to a point where they cannever show a profit again. When the show-down comes, it meanstheir annihilation. In their fall they will remove the dividend-earning capacity of many others. The whole system of industri-alism will tumble like a house of cards.It is certain to my mind that this will take place in some formor other, and I find it difficult to imagine that it can do so with-out a series of revolutions, amounting to universal anarchy. Ifone turns the edge of a sword, the sword will still work more orless, and it is fairly easy to whet it on a convenient stone. But avery small obstruction in a complicated piece of machinery mayput the whole thing out of commission for good and all. Ourcivilization is so delicate and complex, each part so dependenton each other, that the collapse of a single, and apparently in-significant unit, may destroy the entire structure.Russia exhibits this process before our eyes. We hear merelythat the transport system is near breakdown; but what must wesuppose is happening to the rest of the production? A factorywhich cannot get its raw material or send out its finished prod-uct is not likely to be prosperous!The transport system in America is already beginning to showsigns of strain, although there is no invasion, no active internaldissention, no overt financial difficulty. Yet even a small per-centage of its capacity being diverted to munitions, the farmerscannot obtain transport for their products. They will, therefore,produce less and ask more. This again will make the railroadsincrease their freight charges, and this further increases the priceto the consumer, who, being a wage-earner, must demand morewages. That throws further stress on the employers of labor, thefarmers and the railroads, and again we have the vicious circlein full swing.Apply this same principle to municipal or to Federal affairs.We find the same cause produces the same effect. We are wast-ing life, we are wasting labor, we are wasting natural resources;and we can only do that so long as we keep within the verysmall margin of surplus.If our natural profit from the bounty of life and nature amountsto 25 per cent, we dare not waste more than that amount. Themoment we do so we come to absolute grief. Our accumulatedwealth is of no use to us if we cannot afford to use it.Our shoe factories have got to shut down just as soon as peoplecannot afford to buy shoes and decide to go barefooted. Themen employed in the shoe factories are then thrown on the mar-ket, with the result of reducing wages, and forcing further econo-mies on the part of those very men who have just decided thatthey cannot afford shoes!One ruin involves another. The closing of the factories im-plies the death of the cities, and our civilization ends where itbegan, in the self-supporting agricultural unit.I have a vision not unlike that of Anatole France in “L’Ile desPingouins,” but I do not need an anarchist as my God from themachine to destroy civilization. I see the machine itself crumbleas the result of its own brainlessness.A. C.THE PHILOSOPHY OF MILITARISMBy GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK(Written before the distinction was drawn between militarism and universal military service in defense of Democracy.)SOMEWHERE in Germany there is a warrant sworn outfor my apprehension. Somewhere the Public Prosecu-tor peers across the sea with a spy-glass. The German Em-pire, strangely enough, regards me still as her subject. Sheclings to me with the tenacity of a woman. I think sheaccuses me of desertion. A uniform, spick and span, andwith brass buttons, is waiting for me. But I don’t want it.I’d rather wear my blue serge suit. And, of course, it’s alla mistake. I have politely informed Madame that I am anAmerican citizen, and that she can not, can really not, countupon me.It isn’t surprising that she carries my name on her list.It seems I was born between 1884 and 1885 in the city ofMunich. The event is said to have occurred on New Year’sEve. So, in a way, I have fallen between two stools. Fu-ture historians will have small difficulty in proving that Iwasn’t born at all. I don’t want to be too definite about it.The lives of poets should be delightfully vague. The great-est poets are shrouded in mystery. The author ofShakespeare’s plays, it seems, never existed. And sevencities vie for the honor of having given birth to a personnamed Homer, who is alleged to have written the Iliad.Let two continents wrestle for me.Henceforth shall I shun the detective camera. Liked’Annunzio, I shall sleep in the daytime. I shall endeavorto become a mythical figure like Bernard Shaw. All theelect know Bernard Shaw doesn’t exist. It is horribly in-discreet of me to say so, but he is really a hoax. He in-vented himself. That is one of the reasons why he persis-tently refuses to startle the United States with his enig-matical presence. All the world loves a bluffer — at leastin America. We have raised humbug to a fine art. But weare quick to discern it. Shaw is afraid we’d find out thathe is merely a resuscitated epigram of the late Oscar Wilde,dropped by mistake in a volume of Marx.Already an aura of myths surrounds my head with a nebu-lous halo. I shall be a legendary figure before I die. Thatis the reason why I have deliberately courted a bad repu-tation. It is a valuable asset for a poet of passion. WhenSwinburne lost it by moving to Putney Hill with Mr. WattsDunton, the savor went out of his song. I am convinced Ishall never lose my evil glamor. I have builded too wellfor that. And an hundred hands are stretched out to helpme. Even if I weary, my friends, I feel sure, will persist in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL341341supporting the tottering structure.I need not dwell here upon the now historical fact thatmy mother is a native of California. Years before my na-tivity my father made a lecture tour through the country.The date of my first appearance here I have never beenable to verify with precision. Who’s Who places it at theage of eleven. And through all the elapsing years someGerman magistrate’s scribe has conscientiously traced myfootprints. Surely the mills of the Government grind ex-ceedingly small!One night I was dined at the house of one of the BigWigs of the German War Ministry. My host, cultured andgenial, like all German officers, talked interestingly of thearmy. I asked him whether he knew of any general philo-sophic exposition of militarism. He gave me some bookson the subject, which I subsequently pondered with care. Iknow now how to marshal an army, and how to buildbridges across a river, besides various strategic devices.But my knowledge is theoretical, like a young poet’sknowledge of sin. And I nowhere discovered the theory ofmilitarism, the philosophic defense of the thing. After all,nothing that exists needs a defense. Pope was right aboutthat.Of course, it seems preposterous that people should bedrilled to riddle each other with bullets. I, for one, don’tbelieve in it. Life to me is a sacred thing. Besides, I’d beafraid to handle a gun. I’d rather have a broken heart thana toothache. Still, Good, like Evil, inheres in all things. Iagree with the Persians who divided the cosmos equallybetween God and the Devil. We must accept both, and thenestablish our personal equilibrium. That, it seems to me,is the art of living. Militarism is not wholly the work ofthe Devil. I cannot picture the Goddess of Peace without asword. The olive branch of the dove should really be atorpedo. To the German mind no such justification isneeded. It is as natural to the German to serve in the armyas it is to be born; and those who do not serve might aswell never have been born.One year’s compulsory military service is a salutary ex-perience. Most of us are neglectful of exercise. We de-velop certain sets of muscles, but there is little generaltraining even among college athletes. Systematic and rig-orous physical training at a critical age is worth more thanmillions. The Emperor’s service, moreover, keeps theyoung male, if not out of mischief, at least out of mar-riage, until the white fires of adolescence sober into thesteady warmth of connubial affection. “But,” you say, “timeis money.” Twelve vital months canceled from your ac-counts! Yet I should hardly consider them a loss, but aprofitable investment, bearing an interest of one thousandper cent. Medical authorities have carefully calculated thatcompulsory military service lengthens the German aver-age of life by ten years.F. Anstey, in one of his yarns, tells of a Time SavingsBank, where futile hours may be deposited, to be drawnupon when necessity or delight prompts us to lengthen theday. I have vainly searched in financial directories for thisunique institution. Even J. P. Morgan, master of destiniesand of millions, cannot purchase a single minute from Fa-ther Time. No Wall Street operator can corner this mar-ket. Military service is the only practical Time SavingsBank in existence. After the first substantial deposit, thedirectors exact small periodic payments when militarymaneuvers mimic the ire of Mars. Soon expenditures ceasealtogether, but at the end of your life — or what wouldhave been the end — you can live on the interest.IT HAS been said that the Prussian schoolmaster wonthe battles of Frederick the Great. The German armyto-day is a national school. Every company is a school class,with recruits as pupils, and officers as instructors. Theofficers, in turn, receive instruction from their superiors,and the War Academy in Berlin furnishes, so to speak,special post-graduate courses in warfare. Military serviceis said to increase the efficiency of the young German bytwenty-five per cent. Rustic swains return to their homeswith new ideas. They learn to apply themselves system-atically. They learn manners, respect for their intellectualbetters. And, incidentally, also, the use of soap.The young soldier is a powerful factor in German aes-thetics. He is a splash of color on the gray face of theworld. His glittering uniform and his bluish cloak, artisti-cally lined with red, are an eloquent plea against insipidcivilian Fashion, which has banished gaiety in masculineattire to the comic opera stage. There is nobility in hiscarriage. His eyes flash fire. He is handsome, beinghealthy, young, and, in the beginning at least, clean-shaven.There is something distinctly animal in bearded faces.Perhaps that is the reason why some women succumb totheir spell. The beast in the female responds to the simianreminiscence — atavistic, no doubt — in the male. To me,a bearded man suggests the ancient Assyrian. The dust ofthe ages seems to nestle in the hirsute projection. I wouldnot be at all surprised if a scarabæus, startled at a touch,were to creep from its somber recesses. Young men shouldshave clean. Later, when sin and sorrow have dug holes intheir cheeks, and the years have distorted their lips, it isperhaps well that they should hide their wasted lovelinessunder a growth of hair.I have no æsthetic objection to flowing beards in oldmen, and to a mustache in a father. I couldn’t imagine myown father without one. The well developed mustache mayepitomize masculine maturity and completeness. But thefragmentary, tooth-brush-like growth many young Germansaffect on their upper lip is perfectly hideous. A young Ger-man teacher confided to me that he had grown a beard inorder to impress his pupils with a sense of his dignity. Hehas the face of a cherub, yet he makes himself look like agoat!Soldiers are garrisoned, as a rule, far from their homes.Regiments are frequently shifted. The soldier thus comesin touch with various parts of the country. Everywhere heacquires new knowledge. He learns to see his own commu-nity in its proper perspective. The oneness of the Father-land dawns upon him. It is an object-lesson in patriotism.In the past, at least, maneuvers were held alternately invarious spots of the country with unavowed ethnic inten-tions. Some villages, far from the high road, were degen-erating. Inter-marriages between relatives were the rule.Hydrocephalous children were not infrequent. The pres-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL342342ence of the soldiers injected new blood into the shriveledveins of the hamlet. The stork followed frequently. Mar-riages sometimes. “Nice” people won’t approve of this.But it is defensible from the viewpoint of racial ethics.Nature isn’t moral, and she has a trick of not waiting formagisterial permits.The modern railway has largely supplanted the neces-sity for this system, but it is still a factor in racial devel-opment. Remember that all able-bodied young men arepressed into service, and that they are scattered all overthe country. The glad blood leaps in their veins. Court-ships are spun everywhere. Many return to wed where theywooed. It is fascinating to reflect how the administrativeprocess that carries young manhood from province to prov-ince furnishes a striking parallel to the function of thewind, love-courier from garden to garden in the vegetabledomain.In the ranks of the officers, aristocratic titles prevail. Insome regiments only blue blood is accepted at par. Thegrowing power of the bourgeoisie, however, is shatteringthis feudal barrier. I am not democratic, and I cannot saythat I hail the change with delight. There is much to besaid for blue blood, and old titles, and families with tradi-tions. We estimate a horse by its pedigree, and we valuethe family tree of a puppy-dog. The same laws of heredityand evolution surely apply to humans. Nobility is the pil-lar of state and throne. What I have said of the institutionof monarchy applies with equal force to the noble. Hissubsistence to-day in incongruous. But life itself is preg-nant with contradictions.THE aristocrat, no doubt, frequently falls short of hisstandards. But his standards are fine. Not long ago, acousin of mine, a young lieutenant, scion of one of theoldest families in the country, committed suicide becausehis superior officer had censured him for some trivial mis-understanding. His sense of honor was so acutely devel-oped that a word of disapprobation was a death-warrant.Foolish, perhaps. The boy was high-strung, unbalanced.Recently an American officer was tried before a court-martial for a flagrantly dishonorable act. The sentencepassed upon him, being absurdly light, was subsequentlyoverturned by the commander-in-chief. A mistaken senseof esprit de corps seems to have blinded his judges. What-ever their motives, whose code of honor was higher, theirsor the dead lad’s? To whom would we rather entrust thesafety of a country?The incident, presumably, is not symptomatic. Our of-ficers, I am convinced, are as honorable as any. In Ger-many, however, certain canons of honor are establishedimmutably. The duel is partly responsible for the Germanrigor, barbarous at times, in matters relating to honor. Itis not a purely military institution, but a practice sanc-tioned by academic tradition. Insult is not passed overlightly among Germans. We freely hurl, at least in print,insulting epithets at each other. We may not blacken aperson’s eye, but we blacken his reputation. Yet every timewe call a public servant a thief or a liar, the moral stan-dard is lowered. If the president is a liar and the governora thief, crime seems innocuous. Through constant reitera-tion, first the word, then the thing itself, impresses us morelightly. Our libel laws are inefficient. The use of the fistis unsatisfactory, especially as moral heroes are apt to beundersized. A sword scratch is wildly romantic; a bloodynose isn’t.THE army, in spite of the preference given in some regi-ments to titled officers, is a republican institution. Itis more democratic than Bebel. There is nothing moredemocratic. Military service, being incumbent upon all,temporarily levels distinctions of caste. Once they wear“the Emperor’s coat,” prince and peasant are equals. Evenprinces of the blood are not spared the tribulations of thepoorest lieutenant. Any tendency to uppishness is promptlysuppressed.Where officers and privates belong to the same class,cordial relations are irreconcilable with etiquette. The Ger-man officer can afford to make himself democratic, be-cause he is not, so to speak, one of the common people.He cannot lose caste socially by mixing with them as com-rades. I remember walking down Unter den Linden withmy military friend. Every time a common soldier saluted,and it happened with embarrassing frequency, he courte-ously returned the salute. He had instructed his subordi-nate officers to be equally attentive. And every salute wasa renewed assertion of the unity of the grandiose machin-ery in which general and private, each in his own way, areof equal importance.I am an individualist. Yet there are moments when it issweet to grow out of the shell of self. There is, perhaps,dangerous intoxication in crowds; to be swayed by the com-mon impulse when the mysterious force psychologists call“mass suggestion” sweeps through the channels of thebrain, breaking the flood-gates of mental reserve. Suchmust be the soldier’s experience in war or some greatmaneuver. Think of a million young souls swearing fealtyto one flag, made one by the ties of comradeship and obe-dience, and a new sense of brotherhood born of commonexperience!All the vitality of the nation is there. Passion and youth,brawn and brain, are enthralled by one dominant purpose.How irresistible is this phalanx! What an immense force!What strange hysteria! Only Walt Whitman could depictsuch emotions, cosmic and sensuous. Even the most con-firmed egotist forgets his subjective existence. His heartfor the nonce beats in unison with the world’s. He is onewith the race and the earth. Earth-emotions, Titanic andterrifying, throb in his veins. He can perform miracles ofendurance and valor.Henceforth, if his country calls, he will blindly followher summons. He will love the Fatherland with a love in-tensely personal, as one loves a woman. He has experi-enced an emotion deeper than patriotism, fiercer than lust.Future and past have met in one glance. A subtle changeis wrought within his being. He is the citizen transfig-ured. Never again will he be quite what he has been —like a child who, having strayed in the wold, has had con-verse with fairies. Like the lover to whom passion has re-vealed its ultimate secret. Like the prophet who has seenGod in a bush."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL343343SHAKESPEARE: REBEL, ARISTOCRAT AND PESSIMISTBy LOUIS WILKINSONThe rebel will last as long as the human race.

Shakespeare knew better than they, Shakespeare who sawthat Man himself, under Fate, is the eternal scourge of Man,Shakespeare who rebelled against refusals and restraints and injus-tices recognized as of eternal recurrence, Shakespeare who morethan any English poet has shown that the supreme emotional as-pect of humanity is this aspect of revolt against its own essentialair, against all that ministers to and sways it: that the sublimestthing in the world is the explosion of humanity’s irremediableanguish. For no end of “betterment”; not with the possible wishto reform, but with the impossible wish to overthrow.“It is so and it was so, and Heaven be cursed that it should be so!”Or, in words familiar even to the “newest constructive thinkers”:“Ah, Love! could you and I with Him conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would we not shatter it to bits — and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!”Shakespeare and all great figures of revolt are a part of thisdestructive spirit; a spirit which well includes reformers in itsannihilating aim — for what are reformers, even when they seemto achieve, but the grease on the wheel which is to be smashed?It is obvious, then, why the modern “Progressive” hatesShakespeare. We understand this moral indignation of Mr. Ber-nard Shaw as he points out the impotently clenched fist matedwith Lear’s cry of revolt in despair:“As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,They kill us for their sport.”The essential cruelties of life, Shakespeare knew, cannot betouched by reform:* “The world is out of joint.” “The pity of it,the pity of it!”Reformers in their shallow optimism believe that a jugglingwith systems of government will so far cure human ills as tomake existence generally tolerable or even generally pleasant.Their revolt is against tyranny of a monarch or tyranny of aristo-crats or tyranny of rich men. “Take power from these,” they cry,“and give it to the People. Then all will be well!” How muchdeeper Shakespeare’s rebellion goes! He did not believe in De-mocracy, that pedantic chimera. He was, in fact, — let us grantthis to his critics — a “snob” who mistrusted the people, and wasprofoundly convinced of the truth that should be well enoughproven to our generation, the truth that the tyranny of the massesis the worst tyranny of all. Brutus, lover of the people, is shownas a noble but misguided prig: Caius Marcius, despiser of thepeople, “chief enemy of the people,” is portrayed with unstintedadmiration. In Julius Caesar the conduct of the mob in the Forumjustifies to the hilt all the contemptuous diatribes of Coriolanus.“He that trusts you,———* The recurrence of familiar quotations must be pardoned, because timehas selected for emphasis those passages in which Shakespeare most au-thentically speaks.Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,Or hailstone in the sun.”Shakespeare rebels in derision against a proletariat rule whichresults in the conferring of an unstable authority upon delegatesof the capricious mob. Such delegates, he knows — and we havebetter reason to know it than he — are hypocrites, liars, basemen, most of all enemies to the good life. Shakespeare rebels,indeed, against all delegated authority; his rebellion is especiallyagainst the kind of government from which men chiefly suffer:for what are the tyrannies of kings or oligarchs compared withthe tyrannies of officials, who“Dressed in a little brief authorityPlay such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep”?Political “freedom” is powerless to destroy such oppressions;it abundantly creates them. We may as well, then, forbear withShakespeare to rail against kings and aristocrats, and smite ratherwhere he smote, against the instructive unreason and brutality ofthe human race. This dull cruelty seizes upon authority as anexcuse for its self-expense, with equal avidity now as inShakespeare’s day; only its opportunities for the deflowering anddiscoloration of life are greater now that rulers are multipliedthroughout the length and breadth of our democratic lands.The people cast votes — sound their “voices” — for their owntorment. As Coriolanus told them:“Your affections areA sick man’s appetite, who desires most thatWhich would increase his evil.”Well? In democratic America, in this country where every manhas a vote, and no man more than one, what is gained but libertyof the masses to afflict themselves? Liberty to be overworked, tobe sold adulterated food and villainously “doped” whiskey, lib-erty to be housed in loathsome tenements, liberty to enjoy mon-strous labor for their children. Shakespeare, who regarded thateverlasting tragic panorama of the suffering populace with eyesat least as humane as those of any reformer, wished better for themasses than that they should be governed by themselves.“Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you areThat bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your loop and window’d raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these? O, I have ta’enToo little care of this! Take physic, pomp;Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel;That thou may’st shake the superflux to themAnd show the heavens more just.”It is a king who speaks, not an official elected by the people;and he indicates the only possible palliation of poverty, by be-nevolent alms bestowed in protest against a universal and inher-ent injustice. The only possible palliation — yes! — until menwax strong enough to “shatter the sorry Scheme to bits.”For human nature, in the main, is evil; the world, in the main,is bad: we live under “the weight of inauspicious stars,” — this isthe Shakespearian doctrine. This is why Shakespeare’s rebellion"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL344344(Continued on page 352.)leads him into protests that seem to reformers “impotent” be-cause they are not coupled with a declaration of impotent rem-edies: this is why Shakespeare cannot believe in multiplying thesinister impacts of human nature upon the individual life by ex-tending authority upon the individual life to the people. He knowshow “the mutable rank-scented many” persecute artists: he knowshow cruelly the greatest and noblest suffer from the envious gnaw-ings at their flesh by the “common cry of curs”: he knows that“plebeian malignity,” as Doctor Johnson called it, the malignitythat is most of all malign when confronted by genius.“Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate” is an observa-tion justly to be addressed to the populace of all ages as yet known.In America, where all the spleenful devils of bourgeoisie andcanaille have freest play, where the commonplace and the undis-tinguished impose inexorable tyranny, we shall do well to re-member it.In what other country, however “reactionary” or “tyrannical”its government, would such “Suppressors of Vice” and “Censors”as exist so verminously here, be tolerated? Imagine, in Germanyor the old Russia, a publisher being impudently “summoned toappear” for having published an obscene book in Homo Sapiens;or Carmen’s embrace of her lover being cut in a Moving Pictureto stipulated moral length; or the excision, on burgess compul-sion, of the ecstatic abandon of a faun in a Ballet. Grotesquepruriencies of this kind could be multiplied literally ad nauseam,for there is at least emetic value in the spectacle of sewer-ratsspilling their own filth on works of art and then licking it up. Weknow what the author of Measure for Measure, A Winter’s Tale,Lucrece, and Venus and Adonis would have thought.“What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,That rubbing the poor itch of your opinionMake yourselves scabs?”We know, too, what the creator of Jack Falstaff — no less thanthat other creator who turned water into wine, and wine into hisown blood — would have thought of Prohibition and its prophets— these horrible “evangelists” who make of “sweet religion” “amockery of vows.” He would scarcely have sided with a democ-racy that realizes such tyrannies; he knew the ends of a rebellionspecialized to the narrow directions of rule of kings and rule ofpeers. At least his age would have given short shrift to thesevulgarian preachers and their “messages,” short shrift to “vice-suppressors,” short shrift to most of the things that make life heremore acutely disagreeable to sensitive people than it is anywherein Europe, even in the trenches.Yes, Democracy represents only an unsuccessful effort to es-cape, an effort resulting in worse entanglements in the life-netthat vexes us still more than it vexed Shakespeare. There is nohelp. In the Sonnets, where Shakespeare speaks not as a drama-tist, but in his own person, is he optimistic about the nature or theissues of this “mortal coil”?“No longer mourn for me when I am dead,Than you shall hear the surly sullen bellGive warning to the world that I am fledFrom this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell.”Does he not in this poem, this great personal utterance, takehis place with Hamlet, Lear and Macbeth, rather than with thevillain optimist Edmund, who scoffs at the power of Fate anddeclares it an evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish dis-position to the charge of a star? And what are Hamlet and Learand Macbeth — what are all Shakespeare’s tragic figures — butrebels? Not myopic rebels against little superficial details of in-justice, but rebels on the grand scale, in the grand style, againstthe whole scheme of human existence.“Duncan is in his grave.After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.”“To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrowCreeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time,And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is seen no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.”In Jacques’s famous speech there is the same sense of the futil-ity of life. From “the infant mewling and puking in his nurse’sarms” to “the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,” all are stages in avain progression, “signifying nothing.” A recurring mood ofShakespeare speaks in Jacques’s phrase “the foul body of thisinfected world,” and in Hamlet’s “an unweeded garden that growsto seed.” Again, in Hamlet:“Every man hath business or desire,Such as it is.”“What to me is this quintessence of dust? Man delights notme, nor woman neither.”“Get thee to a nunnery. Why would’st thou be a breeder ofsinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse meof such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. . . . .To a nunnery go, and quickly, too.”Here is a revolt against the sex instinct which causes life, arevolt as bitter as that of Schopenhauer who exclaims upon lov-ers as conspirators against the peace of the world, which withoutthem — without their romantic droops of eyelashes, their half-withdrawals and their half-surrenders, and all their little ways —would mercifully sink into oblivion for ever!Then we have the arraignment of things as they are, in the “Tobe or not to be” soliloquy, and the pessimistic reflections, in theGravediggers scene, on mortality, — that mortality of which Lear’shand smelt.Lear himself, shocked by anguish from kingship to anarchy, isthe rebel supreme among them all.“When we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools.”Lear’s destructive fury is terrific, far more terrific than that ofthe elements which he “taxed not with unkindness,” knowingMan crueller than Nature, as did those Arden exiles who sang:“Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind as Man’singratitude.” The aged Lear, his illusions of a lifetime strippedfrom him with sudden fearful violence, seeks a remedy in a re-turn, by way of devastation, to the bedrock of existence. Let ustake all these cursed accretions of ours — these hideous graftingson — let us smash them to a thousand shivers, and so only willour rebellion yield its fruit! — “Off, off, you lendings, come,unbutton here!” In his savage intent to reduce all to its elementshe tears his clothes from him as a symbolic act, and the echo ofthat eternal laughter follows: “Prythee, nuncle, be contented; thisis a naughty night to swim in.”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL345345(Continued on page 352.)I have always been opposed to the receiving of money foranything which has in any way to do with the occult sciences.Because they are so important and so sacred, one ought to beparticularly on one’s honor with regard to them. As the Scrip-ture says: “Avoid the appearance of evil.” The more serious oneis about the subject, the more careful one should be to do noth-ing which can make any one justified in calling you a humbug.The laws of the State of New York are supposed to prohibitfortune-telling, and they are, indeed, applied with great sever-ity so far as the little fish are concerned. But the big fish, themost conscienceless swindlers of all, seem to dodge the police.A lot of bluff has been put up about “scientific” astrology. Ipropose to show how the game is really worked.Let us pay a visit to one of the best known of them. We findan expensive apartment in one of the best parts of the city. Weare not very much impressed by the furniture. There is a gooddeal of muddle, a good deal of junk, a complete absence oftaste. The spider of this web is a grey-haired old woman ofexceedingly shrewd expression. She explains to us by pamphletsand by word that she is a really “scientific” investigator. In set-ting up a horoscope, for example, she is very careful to calcu-late the places of the planets, not only to degrees but to minutesand seconds. That sounds wonderfully accurate, doesn’t it?However, when it comes to making the real calculations uponwhich astrology is based, an error of ten or twelve degrees is ofno account at all. Which is rather like announcing that a mantook two hours, 33 minutes and 14 2-5 seconds to run severalmiles. The alleged accuracy is quite meaningless. It is only asham to impress the client. It is also to be observed that owingto the pressure of business she has these calculations made byher chauffeur! This, I suppose, is a point of war economy.She is grotesquely ignorant of the first principles of astronomy.She has no conception, for example, of the Solar System as aDisk, but imagines that the planets are all over the place, likethe raisins in a plum-pudding. She calls her country house theZodiac — and doesn’t know what the Zodiac is!One word more on the “scientific accuracy” business. If as-trology is to be done at all, if there is any sense in it whatever,which I do not for one moment deny, the calculations dependupon a fairly close approximation of the hour and minute ofbirth. For example, the Seventh house, the place of the settingsun, refers to marriage, so that if a person is born with an unfor-tunate planet like Saturn setting, he may expect an unfortunatemarriage. It is obviously of vital importance for the inquirer toknow whether Saturn was setting or not. There is a certainamount of latitude, from about one to two hours, for Saturnwould remain in that house for about that period. But where thebirth hour is not known within about an hour the horoscopebecomes worthless. If the time were six hours earlier, Saturnwould be in the mid-heaven and bring misfortune in business orreputation rather than in marriage. However, to the fashionableastrologer this must not matter. She has to get the dollars fromthe people who do not know in the least at what hour of the dayor night they were born. She has the impudence to assure themthat it doesn’t matter, all the time insisting upon her wonderfulscientific accuracy.HOW HOROSCOPES ARE FAKEDBy COR SCORPIONISThere is no need to cast any doubt upon the sincerity of thebelief of the woman. She talks astrology day and night. Shedreams of it. She sets up a horoscope for her vast family of catsand dogs, and is scared out of her life when some planet threat-ens her horoscope.But the people who deceive themselves most effectually arealso those who deceive others most effectually. Whether it isknavery or folly does not matter very much. What I want to do isto explain to the people who are paying five dollars that theyare not getting genuine astrology at all. It may be said that ahoroscope (granting for a moment the genuineness of the sci-ence) is a complete map of the life and character of the native.To read one properly would mean at least a week’s continuouswork. But the demand is for $5 and $10 horoscopes; and obvi-ously no more than a few minutes can be given to each one ifthe lady is to clear her forty or fifty thousand a year. It is alsonecessary to give a good deal of apparent value for the money.There are only 12 signs and only 9 planets to be considered. Forthe influence of the rising sign, therefore, one only needs 12multigraphed pages. As each planet can be in any sign we shallneed 9 times 12 multigraph pages to cover the action of theplanets. Each planet can be, roughly speaking, in fortunate orunfortunate aspect, and 162 more pages will be needed. Thesepages need not be prepared right away. A new one can be dic-tated as each aspect turns up in practice. These pages are allpigeon-holed, and by means of a chart the astrologer can tellher secretary which paper to pick out for any horoscope thatcomes along. The secretary can then pick them out and pin themtogether in a very few minutes, and there is your horoscope.The objection to this proceeding is fairly obvious. In practi-cally all horoscopes there are indications which clash with eachother. To judge such a horoscope properly, the whole thing shouldbe taken into individual consideration, and a reconcilementobtained. With the “reach-me-down” method all this is neces-sarily ignored, and the client may be surprised to find on pagetwo of the horoscope, that she is kind and considerate, and onpage 4, that she is selfish and inconsiderate. There is further agreat theoretical objection; which is that a horoscope, to be ahoroscope at all, must be a live thing. To get them out in thismechanical fashion is to offer a corpse instead.It is true that the astrologer sometimes condescends to lookupon the horoscope as a whole, and dictate one or two pages atthe end, but this is not always done. There is no guarantee thatit will be done.It is probably difficult to take legal exception to this branchof the business, but it is only a very small branch. It is the thinend of the wedge. The fortune telling, pure and simple, comesafterwards. The astrologer issues a series of so-called monthlyforecasts which explain how the actual position of the planetsin the heavens at the time should react upon any given horo-scope. Another set of multigraphed pages is of course requiredfor this. These pages are carefully examined by a lawyer, for weare now getting into the danger zone.The phraseology is very carefully chosen, for nothing must"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL346346August 22, 1917.My Dear Master: —The rejection of a manuscript from your hand is an event of greaterliterary importance than the publication of no matter what by anyother American author. To-day, then, I make history.You are aware that no severer critic than myself exists, that I takecruel pleasure in nailing a Noyes to my barn door, or in flagellatingthe fatuities of a Frost; let me further assure you that Cato himselfwas not less accessible to influence, or Brutus to the claims of friend-ship than your admirer and your friend who addresses these wordsto you.Put therefore from your mind, I pray you, any suggestion that Iwished to flatter you in my exordium. In all matters of art I yield noprecedence to Rhadamanthus.To prove it, let me say that I hold your style in abhorrence andyour judgement in contempt, whenever you set yourself to praise.You have made Charles Hanson Towne ridiculous by hailing him a“Prince of Love” and preferring his barley-water to the ripe wine ofPetrarch; your opinions have lost value in the very measure in whichthey have unveiled the radiant virginity of your nature. I can butbow my head as I think that nigh half a century of life on such aplanet as ours has not abated your innocence. Integer vitae scelerisquepurus Non eget Mauri jaculis, neque arcu; Nec venenatis gravidasagittis, Fusce, pharetra. I, bearing such weapons and having usedthem, may now lay them aside, and return to my rejection of yourmanuscript.You know in part what writings I have already published, andyou will not suppose that I fear the noxiousness of a Sumner; ratherI might incline to err by seeking an opportunity to stamp out suchcockroaches from the kitchen, instead of paying strict attention tothe preparation of the banquet.Nor is my action based upon any failure to appreciate yourmastercraft. In such stories as “The Toe,” “The Moustache,” “MissDix” and many another you have shown yourself the Elisha on whomthe mantle of Edgar Allan Poe has fallen. Ethereal as he was, youhave spread wings in an Empyrean beyond his furthest flight.AN ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCEBy ALEXANDER HARVEYIn compensation, you have no such grip of earth as he had whenhe swooped down upon it.It is but rarely that you strike home to humanity. That tale inwhich the husband arises from his coffin and in which a wife is wonby flagellation are your strongest, and Poe has twenty stories to sur-pass them in that quality. You remember the Albatross of Baudelaire?“Ses ailes de géant l’empêchent de marcher.” That is your case.I know of no writer who uses the English language as you do. Atyour touch words take wings and fly. There is no story in your story;there is not even atmosphere. There is a faint and elusive impact onone’s sensibility which is nowise linked with memory or even withimagination. You produce somewhat of the effect of a presentiment.It is impossible to publish a presentiment!Your style defies the scalpel; you write as simply as deMaupassant, and in as mundane terms; but your characters have aquality similar to that which I have observed in the Hyperion of Keats,in Homer, in Ossian, and in the Prophetic Books of Blake. In eachperson of the drama we find what I must call “giganticism.” We arenot told, as by the crude method of Dante, that Thel is so many cu-bits high; his story is simple as a villager’s; yet we are somehowaware that he is colossal, a being huge as heaven itself. There is noroom in the universe for any figures but those actively present in thedrama.Your characters have not these Titan thews, this starry stature.You write of commonplace people such as we meet every day. Butyou have the gift of endowing them with most mysterious impor-tance. The subtlety of your satire, the delicacy of your humor, arebut the gossamer at whose center lurks the spider of your art moststrange, remote and fascinating, a soul bizarre and sinister. It is adoom intangible as invisible, and by all paths as ineluctable as death.The expressed and comprehensible horror of Poe or of Hans HeinzEwers holds no such terror. . . .I perceive that I must borrow the lady’s privilege, and publish thestory. . . . at least, another one!With homage and devotion, my dear master, I offer the assuranceof my impregnable esteem.ALEISTER CROWLEY.Nothing in this miserable room of mine that I could pawnfor bread! Twice within the week had my landlady re-minded me that the trivial sum I owed for rent was over-due.I lifted a worn and tattered volume on the subject ofanatomy from the crazy table on which my little medicallibrary reposed. A despairing inspection of its shabby stateconfirmed me in my fear. The maddest and most romanticJew in Elizabethan drama would never have risked his far-thing upon my entire treasure. Within the week I hoped topass the examination that was to win me the precious privi-lege of practicing as a physician in New York. It seemednow that I must die of hunger in the streets meanwhile.As I placed my poor book among its poorer companionsand fell into a mood of pity for the fate that made themmine, a knocking knuckle sounded at the door. I ignored italtogether. I could not pay the rent. The hour of my doomhad struck. I would yield it no welcome.“Oh! You are in.”My landlady had not awaited my summons. She stoodbefore me in her tall severity, a black-browed symbol ofthe last of all things. I smiled at her. Odd as it seemed tome then, I could smile into that grave face of hers.“I have no money.”I said this with a sigh, although I had no longing for herpity. I thought I heard a sigh upon her own lips as shesank upon that rickety chair beside the table.“But I have not come for the rent.”I fixed my gaze intently upon the head of dark hair thatmet my eye as her head drooped. She looked up at mesuddenly.“I have had to take refuge here,” she explained, “fromthat man.”“Your husband?”She bowed her head and for an interval there was si-lence. I had never taken too seriously the complaints thislandlady perpetually made against him to whom she lovedto refer as her brute of a husband. My landlord did notappear to me in the least brutal.

I would be reminded of therent.Before the words escaped her lips the door was flungwide open. My landlord stood upon the threshold.“Will you give me that money?”I thought at first this question must be meant for me.The landlord, however, was gazing steadily at his wife.He did not heed my presence in the least. The woman stoodup to confront him and they eyed one another defiantly.“That money!” She stepped back a pace. “It’s mine.”“I say it’s mine!”“You shan’t have it!”He seized her by the wrist, and I saw him give her arma wrench. Her struggles to be free brought the masses ofher hair in confusion about her shoulders. She strove tobite him. His persistent twisting of the arm he held drewfrom her at last a cry of anguish. A crumpled greenbanknote fell from her hand to the floor. He fled with itfrom the room.“Brute!” The door had slammed behind her husband, butshe screamed so loudly that he must have heard her. “Ihate you!”When she sank once more upon the rickety chair andmade a cushion for her head with an arm, I emerged fromthe spell wrought by this scene of violence. My movementmust have been a very slight one, yet her ear detected it. Ifound her suddenly looking up at me through the massesof that hair.“Coward!”She did not hiss the word. She did not hurl it at me asshe might have hurled a curse. She smiled. That smilewas to me a whip of which I felt the sting on my cheek.“But,” I protested feebly and with a most humiliatingsense of the feebleness with which I protested, “what wouldyou have had me do?”“Kill him!”I marveled at the music in her voice. It had a cruel em-phasis and yet a power that subdued my spirit. She under-stood me at that moment far better than I understood my-self.“Kill him!” She stood up at this repetition of her be-hest, speaking in that slow and thrilling tone. “Be a man!”Never until then did it occur to me that she was beauti-ful. I observed the liquid quality of her eyes, and strove toavert mine from them. I could not. Her face was very whiteand she pushed those coils of hair away from it with ges-tures of a miraculous seduction.“Here!” Her voice revealed how thoroughly she real-ized the conquest she had made of me. “Use this.”It was a carving knife. She thrust it into my hand beforeI could reply to her. The suasion with which she urged meto the door was not gentle.“There is no one in the house but ourselves.”She addressed me in a whisper as I hesitated on the edgeof the stairs outside. I glanced at the long, keen knife inmy hand. I turned once more to gaze into the eyes of thewoman. Then I stole down, step by step, the woman peer-ing over the railings all the time.Not until I reached the kitchen in the basement did Icome upon the man. By this time I had thrust the knifeinto my belt and there it was hidden underneath the coat Iwore. My landlord was making a frugal meal of bread andcheese at a little deal table in the corner beside a washtub.“Aha!” He seemed disconcerted at beholding me. “Didyou pay the rent?”“I will pay your wife in full,” I assured him as I drewnear, “this very night.”“Aha!” This must have been his favorite oath. “Has mywife sent you here to murder me? Every time we get atenant he comes to me with that intention. Where’s thecarving knife?”These revelations left me motionless and staring. Hetook advantage of my great surprise to hurl himself uponme. I did not dodge in time, but as he seized my arm I gota good grasp upon his shoulder. Our turnings and circlingsabout the kitchen so disarranged my clothing that he couldsee the knife at my belt easily. The sight inspired him tomake a demand in tones that reached the roof for a surren-der of this trophy. I merely seized the empty bottle on thetable as the pair of us described fantastic angles all aboutit. A purpose to hit my landlord on the head was in myown mind, and this had been anticipated by himself. Hesnatched the bottle as I poised it menacingly in the air,and then he brought it down upon my head. I stood dazed.He had that knife out of my belt in a flash.“Aha!” He cried aloud triumphantly. “Don’t be afraid.”I had taken refuge in the cupboard, shutting the doorupon myself quickly and completely. My landlord madeno further effort to pursue me. I could hear him movingabout the kitchen. At last I heard the sound of that knife.It seemed to undergo a process of sharpening. I heard itscraping.“I tell you again I’m not going to hurt you.”A note of such perfect sincerity informed the voice ofmy landlord that I ventured to set the cupboard door ajar.He knelt at present in front of the stove. I observed himclosely as he moved that knife back and forth. No look offerocity inflamed that face of his.“What do you mean to do?”He replied to my question almost as soon as I had askedit by making a thrust at his breast. I managed to leap uponhim in a fashion sufficiently agile to avert a fatality, al-though I could see that he had cut himself. I clutched thehand that held the knife. He tried to free himself, but I didnot let go.“Let me die, I tell you! I cannot trouble her then.”Once more the pair of us described fantastic circles. Weknocked the table over. We fell into that tub. We broke allthe dishes in the place. He called his wife the vilest names.He said that I might have her, but he added that my fate ifI took her must be as dreadful as his own.

MILLS.Professor Bugsby was an old man at fifty! Externally noth-ing much was the matter with him; his cheeks were rosy, andhis dreamy blue eye was soft and kindly as ever; but his ner-vous system, and especially his will, had broken down underthe strain of his long fight with Plunks the banker. Bugsbyhad started out with all the gaiety of youth; he had thought itsimple enough to win the fight; he had merely to prove thewickedness of Plunks, and the folly of mankind in allowinghim to rob them, and they would rise and end not only Plunkshimself, but the system that made Plunks possible. Alas! heonly found himself in a welter of intrigue. He was forced tofight fire with fire, to scheme, to agitate, to cabal — and itwas all in vain. Time and again he had been on the brink ofsuccess at least partial. It was all arranged for him to be-come President of his University; from this vantage he couldbombard Plunks more easily; but at the last moment the longarm of the billionaire had moved a pawn, and blocked thecheck.So we find poor Bugsby in Chicago in January, 1917. Hehad attempted to form a triple entente of Chinese laundry-men, drug store clerks, and sundial adjusters, which wouldfrustrate the enormous shipping combine which Plunks wassupposed by the Sunday newspapers to be meditating.But the Milkless Milk Company (a mere alias for Plunks,as Bugsby knew only too well!) had stepped in, and by aseries of adroit manoeuvres had alienated the laundrymenfrom the movement.Bugsby, his life’s work ruined, turned into the Blackstone.Wrong was triumphant — so be it, then! He would have alast dinner, write a last paper of protest, and seal his witnesswith his blood.But, as he reached the lobby, who should he see but Plunkshimself! By his side was his confidential secretary, Grahame,a villain only slightly less abandoned than his master. A sin-ister grin of open triumph was on the face of the billionaire.The monster had thrown off the mask! Bugsby had neverbefore seen him in the flesh. He jumped at his opportunity.Walking straight up to the plutocrat, he began, without a wordof preface, his harangue.“Vampire!” he cried, “at last I confront you! Liar, thief,murderer, for twenty years we have wrestled in a death-grip.To-day it seems as if you had won! Railroad wrecker, WallStreet gambler, cornerer of wheat and oil and copper, steam-ship pirate, land grabber, lobbyist and grafter, in all you havesucceeded — so it seems! Seems! Seems! To the philosopheryou are but a doomed man. Had you my Weltanschauung,you would know it too. The economic forces which I lead,invisible though they may be, are rising to unseat you. Theexchange system is tottering; the financial oligarchy crumbles;my Distanzliebe is as lebendig as yourPattvereiningdungingen is starr!!!” The professor paused forbreath. “Forgive me,” said the anarch. “You have the advan-tage of me. I know your name perfectly well, of course, but Ican’t remember your face.”“Tremble not!” replied the professor, “tremble not, al-though my words sear your corrupt brain as with a white-hotshaft of steel. Tremble not! you triumph over me, for I ambeaten. Behold in me your sworn, your life-long enemy! I amthe man whom you have fought these twenty years, whomyou have kept from the presidency of my university; it is myworks that your subsidized publishers have turned down; Iam the man whose courage and address have time and againcome nigh to hauling you from your bloodstained throne — Iam Professor Bugsby of the University of Muttville!”Plunks interrogated his secretary with a glance. A slightshake of the head was the reply.“Bugsby!” said the billionaire, kindly; “of course, of course!Upon my word, my dear fellow, this is very distressing. Ihadn’t the least idea of all this. Why on earth didn’t youcome to me direct? Well, well; never too late, you know; I’llfound a university for you, and make you president, and we’llget out all your books for you, and you shall knock me ashard as you can for the rest of your natural life. (Just put thatthrough to-morrow morning, will you, Grahame?) Then you’llcome and lunch with me here, won’t you, my dear Bugsby, atone sharp, and we’ll sign the papers. Where are you staying?I’ll send a car for you.” “I’m staying right here,” said theprofessor.And when he had brought his grip over, and dined luxuri-ously, and retired for the night, his dreamy blue eye soughtinspiration from the mirror as he adjusted his nightcap. “Iwonder what frightened him,” said the professor, meditatively."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL349349Mr. Marshall: Are you very happy?Julia: I am very happy.Mr. Marshall: And you have no regrets whatsoever?Julia: Absolutely none.Mr. Marshall: You are too positive, Julia.

That is what is thematter with you, Julia.Julia: And how disappointed! Not so much in you, DonJuan, as in my own self. I was never so foolish as to imag-ine that you could make me as supremely happy as you prom-ised. But I really did think that it was in me. Now I see it isnot. But I am happy because I see things finally as theyreally are. I wonder if you can understand that, clever manthat you are?Mr. Marshall: (Brightening up.) Julia, you please me.Now for the first time I am firmly convinced of your inno-cence. For innocent you are. You imagine this morning thatyou are separated from yesterday morning by the wisdomof the ages. You imagine that the events of a few hours agohave revealed the secrets of life to you. Most women inyour place would plead for more love and yet more loveand always more. They would demand a pledge of eternalallegiance. But you, you demand freedom. That is some-thing new. In all my career such a thing has not happened.You hate me. You have discovered that love is quite com-monplace. That the great flame is only a feeble pallid light.That the yellow sunbeams have put out that light altogether.Sitting here at breakfast with me you see how pitifully poorthe reality is compared to the tremendous radiance you ex-pected. And you say to yourself — with this valueless, un-necessary, bagatelle I can dispense completely.Julia: You are right. Bagatelle is the word for it. In alittle while I shall leave you.

You speak so well that although I do notlove you, I love to listen to you.Mr. Marshall: (With great earnestness.) Julia, a man whopicks up the violin for the first time is bound to be disap-pointed in the instrument. It may be a golden Stradivarius.But in his clumsy fingers it can only give forth a few dis-cordant and hideous sounds. The selfsame instrument inthe hands of a Kreisler becomes a divine organ of melodyand passion. All that is beautiful and voluptuous speakswith a candor and graciousness that words could not, evenif they would, utter. You are like the man who cannot play.But you will learn. Last night for the first time you liftedup the lyre of love. Unable to strike harmony from its stringsyou threw it away in disgust. But you will pick it up again.I know you will. You will be driven to master it. Then willcome the day when you will understand how to compel it toproduce the most wonderful nuances, the most delicatephrases, the most powerful chords. And you will smile tothink that once you scorned this priceless gift. Why do Ispeak so enthusiastically? Because I am a master. I am aveteran. Therefore, the lyre of love can never bore me. Onlydilettantes and amateurs are wearied of its song. Only theweak fly from it.Julia: If what you say is true then indeed I am accursed.Then indeed I should be unhappy.Mr. Marshall: No! No! No! Ten thousand times no! Youshould be happy. Believe me, Julia, knowledge is not onlypower. It also spells happiness. Why am I the most enviedof men on earth? Because the ignorant, the innocent, theweak know that I am happy. So do the wise. And so youshall be happy, too, if you discover the one great secret oflife.Julia: What is that secret?Mr. Marshall: The secret of life is this: If you can standalone you have conquered the world. If you can stand alone,men and women will flock to your side. Wealth will be lav-ished upon you. All that is wonderful and rare will be yoursfor the asking. If you can stand alone, Julia, you will havemastered life. Then from the lyre of love you will evokeimperishable melody. But you must stand alone.Julia: (Who has listened, deeply moved.) But I cannotstand alone, Don Juan. (With intense passion.) I love you. Ilove you madly. Kiss me again and again and again. Let meswoon in your arms.

Several of the most successfulplays, including “Maytime,” “The Tailor-Made Man,” “TheRiviera Girl” and “The Deluge,” are the handiwork of Germanand Austrian authors, although their names do not appear onthe program and the origin of the plays is carefully concealedfrom the audience.Judging by the instantaneous success of the“Dreimaederlhaus,” produced by Rudolph Christians at theGerman Theatre in New York, another German-made play willshortly be seized upon by American producers. The“Dreimaederlhaus” is a charming operetta based upon an inci-dent in the life of Schubert, the great composer. The music isskilfully chosen from Schubert’s own music. The play is full ofcharm and it is admirably presented.It is surprising how, in spite of many limitations, DirectorChristians is able to achieve such remarkable scenic effects.His playhouse has some of the artistic qualities of a little the-atre conducted entirely for connoisseurs and of a popular play-house. His actors appear one day in a tragedy of Schnitzler andthe next day we see them dancing and singing to some tunefulditty in a musical comedy.The fact that the German Theatre in New York continueswithout disturbance is an excellent testimony to the fact thatthe metropolis has grasped the meaning of President Wilson’smessage that we are not waging war against the German people.Neither, it follows as a necessary corollary, are we waging waron German art. Of course, the German Theatre studiously avoidsproducing any play that could give the slightest offense. Mr.Christians’ productions are always interesting and we are gladA GLIMPSE INTO THE THEATRESto note that the English-speaking press is giving serious atten-tion to them.———It is difficult to teach an old dog new tricks. But remember,as Alexander Harvey suggests, how many tricks an old dog re-ally knows! This is apropos of a criticism recently pronouncedagainst Bernard Shaw by a writer who maintains that the greatIrish dramatist is beginning to repeat himself, that he has noth-ing new to offer us. The production of “Misalliance” at the newBroadhurst Theatre is the incident which caused this gentle-man to deliver his judgement. After reading his remarks wewitnessed the performance and were never so agreeably disap-pointed. For “Misalliance,” so tedious in book form, sparklesdelightfully on the stage. All the tricks of a dramaturgic masterare employed by Shaw to interest his audience in a discussionof parents and the duty they owe their children. Shaw, like Os-car Wilde, is never so happy as when his characters are com-fortably seated and talking. And in this play the amount of talk-ing is prodigal. To get his dialogue over Shaw uses and usesexpertly every device of the conventional theatre. Shaw’s direc-tions call for one long act for the entire production, but WilliamFaversham, who produced the piece, wisely split it into threesections. Although everybody in “Misalliance” talks tremen-dously on every conceivable subject one is constantly interested.It is amazing the way in which this play grips. The audiencelistens spellbound as though it were witnessing one of JackScribner’s burlesque shows on the Bowery. Mr. Faversham isto be congratulated on the good work he is doing. “GettingMarried” last year and “Misalliance” this year prove that it paysto put on plays the public likes.J. B. R.My dear Yvonne:Don’t you feel relieved that the concert season is about to burstits glories upon us — and we can lose ourselves in its beauties —and so forget the horrors of the war for brief and beautiful inter-vals? And that reminds me of the lamentable attitude of our friendCampanini — who casts such an insult upon American musiclovers by his decision to eliminate German operas during theChicago Opera Season. Why should Wagner be held responsiblefor torpedoes and poisonous gases — Zeppelin raids, etc.? Thenagain if that attitude of mind be allowed to run riot — why notblame Bach and Beethoven also? The elimination of all the greatGerman operas and symphonies has nothing to do with makingthe world safe for democracy. Surely art is universal. Then whythis imbecility? Shame on Signor Campanini. Doesn’t he knowthat “Maryland, My Maryland” is sung to an old German air —why not suppress it also? This is not fighting Germany — it ismaking ourselves ridiculous. Would Mr. Campanini also debarus from hearing the Jupiter Symphony? — the Eroica, the Unfin-ished? — the violin concert of Mendelssohn? The second Sym-phony of Brahms? — all of them absolutely created in the enemyzone? “Even fair minded Americans cannot be expected to listenwith equanimity to music created in the enemy country.”Surely the drummer of a jazz band in a fifth rate café couldn’tbe more stupid!One thinks with gratitude of Frederick Fischer — who isdoing such excellent work in St. Louis — and achieved suchsplendid success at the recent open air music festival in thatcity, where he conducted French classics with equal interest tothose of his own country. The next two weeks will bring us tothe splendid orchestral concerts offered by Mr. Walter Damroschwith his New York Symphony, and the Philharmonic under Mr.Stransky. Many important recitals by old favorites are sched-uled — and amongst the younger players, Wynne Pyle, the bril-liant Texas pianist, who made such a great success here withthe Philharmonic and St. Louis and Minneapolis orchestras lastyear will make several important appearances. Also DorisBarnett, the finest pianist Australia has produced up till now —a favorite pupil of Leopold Godowsky, who created a furore inVienna and London — will make her first appearance beforeNew York music lovers.Isolde Menges — undoubtedly the greatest girl violinist of theday — who created such a sensation here last winter and hasbeen delighting thousands of enthusiasts in Canada, will givetwo recitals in New York before leaving for London and Paris toMUSIC"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE INTERNATIONAL351351fill her engagements there.One hears with great regret of the absence of Ugo Ara, themagnificent Viola of the Flonzaley Quartet — who has gone intoactive service in Italy and will be greatly missed here.One is glad to know Percy Grainger will continue his recitals,and the Red Cross will benefit greatly by the receipts generouslyturned over to them by this popular young Australian.

Y.The Gate of Knowledge.“The Golden Verses of Pythagoras with anEssay on the Essence and Form of Poetry,”by Fabre d’Olivet. Translated by Nayan LouiseRedfield. (Putnam & Son.)This translation of these famous essays is inall respects excellent. The prose is sonorous andwell measured, and the translator has well seizedthe sense of the original. The only blemishes areoccasional idiomatic lapses where Miss Redfield,as it appears to us, imitates the French usage toofaithfully. The edition is finely produced, andshould form a most valuable addition to anyphilosophical library.There is here no space for an extended criti-cism of Pythagoras or of this interpretation of him.A volume of nearly equal size would be requiredto do justice in such a manner. We will thereforenot dwell upon what appears to be the failure totranscend dualism, beyond remarking that thereis only one solution to the problem of evil. Thatsolution is given in the “Book of the Law.” Theuniverse has two phases. One delights in creationand the other in destruction, and the cyclic pro-cess serves each in turn. But it is most pertinentto remark that Fabre d’Olivet announces a doc-trine which in its essence is singularly harmoni-ous with that of Blavatsky regarding perfectibil-ity. It is indeed the doctrine of the adepts which ishere foreshadowed. Fortified by this tradition, thisauthor has managed to do good work in the mat-ter of Eastern religion, despite the dreadful igno-rance and misapprehension which prevailed inhis time with regard to the purport of orientaldoctrines. Those minds in which Truth exists asan inheritance can never be upset by the discov-ery of new facts; on the contrary, such discover-ies confirm them in their Truth. — Therion.“The Duality of the Bible,” by Sidney C.Tapp.The mystery is out. We owe our readers a sortof apology for the tone of voice which we usedlast month in reviewing Mr. Tapp’s other volume.We ought to have known that so unwholesome amind might imply an unhealthy body. In thispresent volume Mr. Tapp explains that he suf-fered when young from certain diseases of theear, necessitating operations which were evidentlypartial failures; for we find that he could not writehis book with his own hand, owing to a spine in-jured by these operations.Mr. Tapp’s views on sex are therefore those ofan unfortunate rather than of a wicked person.(It may be philosophically doubted whether thesetwo things are not one.) However, the point isthat for Mr. Tapp to lay down the law on sex islike an oyster lecturing on the disadvantages ofbeing vertebrate. We are extremely sorry for thiswreck of humanity, but we shall not take it forour guide, any more than we should listen to thecrew of reformed drunkards who tell us that wecannot drink a glass of wine without being dip-somaniacs.

Y.Shakespeare’s Rebel.(Continued from page 344.)Lear, in frantic ecstasy, hails “poor mad Tom,”the naked outcast, as his “learned Theban,” his“noble philosopher.” “Thou art the thing itself;unaccommodated man is no more but such apoor bare forked animal as thou art.”The “great image of authority” shakes andfalls before the tremendous onslaughts of thisking turned anarchist:“A man may see how this world goes, withno eyes. Look with thine ears; see how yon’ jus-tice rails upon yon’ simple thief. Hark, in thineear; change places; and, handy-dandy, which isthe justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen afarmer’s dog bark at a beggar? . . . And the crea-ture run from the cur? There thou might’st be-hold the great image of authority; a dog’s obeyedin office.”“None does offend, none, I say none!”Well believed in as reason — can we doubtit? — by Shakespeare the perpetual satirist oflittle men in authority, Shakespeare, who hadbeen tried by Sir Thomas Lucy, did not forgetthe inanities of the Law and its pillars when hecame to Justice Shallow, to Dogberry andVerges.“Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand:Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thineown back.. . . The usurer hangs the cozener.Through tatter’d clothes small vices do appear;Robes, and furr’d gowns, hide all. Plate sinwith gold,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;Arm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw doth pierceit.”An excellent inscription for any Court ofLaw; but more pleasing to the prisoners than tothe judges.The contempt of Shakespeare for the hypoc-risy of the professed virtues — the Purity Leagu-ers of our day — is constant; but we are stirredmore deeply by Lear’s outburst than even bythe portraiture of Angelo:“I pardon that man’s life; what was thy cause?Adultery.Thou shalt not die; die for adultery! No;The wren goes to’t, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight . . .Behold yon’ simpering dameWhose face between her forks presagethsnow;That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure’s name;The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to’tWith a more riotous appetite.”As it is now, so it was then. The changelessspirit of revolt had no less scope for action inShakespeare’s age than it has in our own, norwill it have in ages to come. Rebellion will endwhen an end is made of all we know; then andnot before will this one of Shakespeare’s spiritswander in waste air. Then shall be the destinedfinal touch, the touch of conclusion in Neces-sity, that touch whose ultimate noiseless crum-bling of all things Shakespeare, in his last Play,foresaw. There, in the furthest coign of the fur-thest figure of the Future, stands that Momentwhen:“Like the baseless fabric of this vision,These cloud-capp’d towers, these gorgeouspalaces,These solemn temples, the great earth itself,Yea, all that it inherits, shall dissolve;And like this insubstantial pageant faded,Leave not a wrack behind.”There only, in that consummate dissolution,shall Rebellion be brought to silence.Fake Horoscopes.(Continued from page 345.)be said which would be indictable as a prediction.Thus, instead of saying, “you will be lucky inspeculation during the first week of October,” thephrase is “financial conditions seem to be operat-ing favorably during the first week in October.”These monthly forecasts are received at $24 a year,and as they require a good deal of trouble in prepa-ration, it is evident that the cheapness has some-thing behind it. These forecasts are what you maycall bait, and the fish to be caught is the “personalconsultation.”Suppose I am told in my forecasts that finan-cial conditions are favorable for a certain period, Iam going to ask for more. I want to know exactlyhow to make the best use of the opportunity; so Iring up the lady and get an appointment. This ap-pointment may ostensibly be a $5 or $10 one; butin reality I may have to pay much more for it. Imay have to let the lady in on a percentage of prof-its on the gamble in “war babies.” Similarly, if Iam an actress, or other easily exploitable person, Imay have to pay a great deal extra. Once the fly isin the web, the spider can dictate its own terms.Women are particularly foolish with astrologers.They tell all their love affairs. Again, even cau-tious Mrs. A. will tell one side of a story; prudentMiss B. next day, the other side. The astrologerbecomes mistress of these women, body and soul.Perhaps she does not blackmail them; but she is ina position to do so if she wishes. At the very least,the victims realize their own position, and are care-ful to do anything the astrologer may ask.Then, again, there is the matrimonial agencygraft; and the highly profitable business ofentremetteuse. (We do not assert that, in the par-ticular case we are discussing, these things aredone, but they could be done. It is immoral to per-mit the existence of a secret power of this kind.)It is all done under the cloak of astrology. Mr.C., calls and looks for a soul-mate; the astrologersoon finds some woman, “whose Venus is on hisSun,” and arranges a little dinner-party. All in thesacred cause of astrology — scientific astrology;the old lady would be genuinely shocked if youcalled her by her real name. But she takes her com-mission all the same, and superstition is so extraor-dinarily strong that when faith is established thereis no limit to the amount of which the victim canbe fleeced. This being the really dangerous part ofthe work, the astrologer is extraordinarily carefulabout making appointments. One has to have verygood introductions. Word quickly goes round asto what the police are doing. For example, a fewmonths ago it was rumored that a red-haired de-tective had been engaged, and all women with redhair, unless previously known, had to pass the 33rddegree before they reached the center of the web.There is no doubt in the mind of the astrologerthat she is breaking the law. She lives in continualterror of the police. She knows well enough that itwas only a fluke that she was not convicted at herprevious prosecutions. However, she boasts openlyof her “pull” with certain society leaders who canprotect her from the police. Properly managed,evidence is easy to obtain. Will not Mrs. IsabelGoodwin look to it?"}]
