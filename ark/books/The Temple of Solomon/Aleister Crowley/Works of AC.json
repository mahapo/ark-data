The task has been no easy one. His numerous references to the obscurer bypaths of classical mythology, and his not less frequent allusions to the works of Qabalistic writers, have demanded much elucidation. In making the explanatory notes, I have endeavoured to strike a golden mean between the attitude of Browning, when he pub-lished \"Sordello,\" and that of Huxley, who took it for granted that his readers were entirely ignorant : and only such passages or phrases have been annotated as were thought likely to present any difficulty to the student of ordinary intelligence. It is no part of the duty of an editor to assume the role of critic. But I must explain that I am conscious of Crowley's weaknesses. They are in the main the outcome of his astonish-ing perversity; nowhere more strikingly demonstrated than in \"The Poem,\" throughout which there is a struggle for the supre-macy between his sense of the ridiculous and his sense of the sublime. I am also aware that his views on religious matters will be found unpalatable in some quarters. But it should be re-membered that these writings represent the ideas of a man of an unconventional mind brought up in conventional surround-ings. When he came to man's estate he not unnaturally revolted : and the result has been, as in many such cases, that his search for the truth has 1ed him to investigate the religious beliefs of many nations; nor have those investigations tended to lessen the gulf which separates him from the orthodox point of view. The edition is authorised, and, as such, complete : therein are contained all the important works of Aleister Crowley. I. B.

All day I loitered in the little streets Of black worn houses tottering, like the fate That hangs above my head even now, and meets Prayer and defiance as not hearing it. They lean, these old black streets ! a little sky Peeps through the gap, the rough stone path is lit Just for a little by the sun, and I Watch his red face pass over, fade away To other streets, and other passengers, See him take pleasure where the heathen pray, See him relieve the hunter of his furs, All the wide world awaiting him, all folk Glad at his coming, only I must weep: Rise he or sink, my weary eyes invoke Only the respite of a little sleep ; Sleep, just a little space of sleep, to rest The fevered head and cool the aching eyes; Sleep for a space, to fall upon the breast Of the dear God, that He may sympathise. Long has the day drawn out; a bitter frost Sparkles along the streets ; the shipping heaves With the slow murmur of the sea, half Jost In the last rustle of forgotten leaves. Over the bridges pass the throngs ; the sound, Deep and insistent, penetrates the mist-I hear it not, I contemplate the wound Stabbed in the flanks of my dear silver Christ. He hangs in anguish there ; the: crown of thorns Pierces that palest brow ; the nails drip blood; There is the wound ; no Mary by Him mourns, There is no John beside the cruel wood ; I am alone to kiss the silver lips ; I rend my clothing for the temple veil ; My heart's black night must act the sun's eclipse; My groans must play the earthquake, till I quail At my own dark imagining; and now The wind is bitterer ; the air breeds snow ; I put my Christ away ; I turn my brow Towards the south stedfastly ; my feet must go Some journey of despair. I dare not turn To meet the sun ; I will not follow him : Better to pass where sand and sulphur burn, And days are hazed with heat, and nights are dim With some malarial poison. Better lie Far and forgotten on some desert isle, Where I may watch the silent ships go by, And let them share my burden for awhile. Let me pass out beyond the city gate Where I may wander by the water still, And see the faint few stars immaculate Watch their own beauty in its depth, and chill Their own desire within its icy stream. Let me move on with vacant eyes, as one Lost in the labyrinth of some ill dream, Move and move on, and never see the sun Lap all the mist with orange and red gold, Throw some lank windmill into iron shade, And stir the chill canal with manifold Rays of clear morning ; never grow afraid When he dips down beyond the far flat land, Know never more the day and night apart, Know not where frost has laid his iron hand Save only that it fastens on my heart; Save only that it grips with icy fire These veins no fire of hell could satiate ; Save ouly that it quenches this desire.

AMONG the lilies of the sacred stream The sun looked on them and their leaves were glad; Only the purple blossom there, that had No kindred by the stream, let fall a tear, Half wishing for the autumn of the year. But when the summer came, the violet guessed By some slow dream that thrilled her gentle breast, That some sweet thing might come to her ; she thought Through the long days of how her dream was wrought: She guessed il woven of the spider's thread, And coloured like the river's changing bed Where polished pebbles shine ; she guessed it frail And perfect, with pure wings, like silver pale. So there, behind the leaves and stems, her lids Grew deep with veins of love, and Bassarids 1 Racing the dim woods through, beheld her face, \\Vhispered together, and desired the place. The grey was blushing in the Eastern sky When there drew near a child of poesy With full lips very tender, and grave eyes Where deep thoughts dwelt in some delicious wise. He looked upon the lilies, and a tear Dropped on their blossom ; but a little fear Came to the bosom of the violet Lest he see not, or see her, and forget. But he did see her, and drew close, and said: 1'here grew a violet, like a maiden's dream, And when the wind passed over them, it \" O perfect passion of my soul, 0 dead Living desire, 0 sweet unspoken sin, Leave thou the lilies ; they are not thy kin. stirred Their white soft petals with its quiet word. 1 Votaries of Bacchus, s<? called from the Bassara, or long mantle, which they wore."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE FAREWELL OF PARACELSUS TO APRILE 39 \"·within my heart one slow sweet whisper stole Consuming and destroying all my soul Lest, if the pure cold mind should conquer it, I might not know, although it still were sweet. \" l\\T y pure desires arose and cast out love That flew away, most like a wounded doye, Only the drops were mine its bosom bled. :Now the last time it hovers by my head: \"Now the last Lime I turn and go to her.\" Tbe violet smile(! at him ; his fingers fair !'lucked the sweet blossom to his breast; his eyes l\\Iused like delight, and like desire were wise.

He kissed the blossom, and bent very low, And put it to her lips--and even so His lips were set on them ; the flower sighed For deep delight, and in the long kiss died. Years Jled and faded, yet a Hower was seen Gracious and comely in its nest of green, And Lender hands would water it and say: \" 0 happy sister, she that went away ! \"For she brought back my lover to rny heart, And knew her work was perfect, and her part l\\Iost perfect when she died between the breath, And in the bridal kisses kissed to death.\" So grew the newer blossom and was glad : Sweet little hopes her faint fair forehead had That one day such a death might crown her days.

Though death be the stain on our roses, The roses of heaven are white; Though day on the world of us closes The stars only dream of the night As of music that roars and reposes and dies in delight. Dead stars in the season of sighing, Lost wori<ls of unspeakable pain, White winds in the winter-tide <lying, Or pestilence risen from rain ; So thoughts are that perish for lying and rise not again. Blue waves in the summer uncrested, New homes for the fair and the free, Bright breezes in forest-leaves nested, Sweet birds in the flowering tree ; So thoughts that by truth have been tested sing down to the sea. But weak as the flowers of summer Are the flowe.rs that float on my stream ; My song-birds to others are dumber Than voices half heard in a dream ; i\\Iy muse, louder gods overcome her, the eyes of them gleam. The sorrow that woke me to singing Is deeper than songs that I sing ; The birds that fresh music are bringing No chords for my memory bring; Thc•se lips like a soul that are clinging most silently cling.

In the blazoned hall Shadows, more mute than at a funeral True mourners, waited, waited in the gloom; Waited to hear what child was in the womb Of his high thoughts.

He did not spare Our fear-he spake not yet a little space. 1 This poem has no foundation in tradition. 2 Here and in several other passages intense energy of will, or importance of situation, is represented as producing an actual condition of strain in the air or the ether.

The desert leagues may keep Some other secret-some profounder deep Than this one echoed fear : the desert shows Its ghastly triumph-silence. There they sleep. \" There, brave and pure, there, true and strong, they stay Bleached in the desert, till the solemn day Of God's revenge -none knoweth them: they rest Unburied, unremembered, unconfessed. What names of strength, of majesty, had they? What suns are these gone down into the West? \"Even I myself-my youth within me said : Go, seek this folly ; fear not for the dead, And God is with thine arm !

PREFACE. As, after long obsen·ation and careful study, the biologist sees that what at first seemed isolated and arbitrary acts are really part of a series of regular changes, and presently has the life-history of the being that he is examining clear from Alpha to Omega in his mind ; as, during a battle, the relative importance of its various incidents is lost, the more so owing to the excitement and activity of the combatant, and to the fact that he is himself involved in the vicissitudes which he may have set himself to ohserve; while even for the commander, though the smoke-pall may lift now and again to show some brilliant charge or desperate hand-to-hand struggle, he may fail to grasp its significance in his dispositions; or indeed find it to be quite unexpected and foreign to his calculatiom; yet a few years or months later the same battle may be lucidly, tersely, and connectedly described, so that a child is able to follow its varying fortunes with delight and comprehension: just so has my own observation of a life-history more subtle, a battle more terrible, been at last co-ordi-nated : I can view the long struggle from a standpoint altogether complete, calm, and philosophica I ; and the result of this review is the present story of Tannhauser, just as the isolated and often apparently contra-dictory incidents of the fight were recorded in that jungle of chaotic emotions which I printed under the title of \"The Soul of Osiris,\" 1 calling it a history so that my readers might discover for themselves (if they chose to take the trouble} the real continuity in the apparent disjointedness. The history of any man who seriously and desperately dares to force a passage into the penetralia 2 of nature; not with the calm philosophy of the scientist, but with the burning conviction that his immortal destiny is at stake; must be a strange one: to me at least strangely attractive. The constant illusions; the many disappointments; the bitter earnestness of the man amid the grim humour, or more often sheer cacchination of his surroundings; all the bestial mockery of the haffling fiends; the still more hideous mockery in which the Powers of Good them-selves seem to indulge; doubt of the reality of that which he seeks; doubt even of the seeker; the irony of the whole strife: are fascinating to me as they are, I make no doubt, to the majority of mankind. This is the subtler form of that mental bewilderment which the Greek Tragedians were so fond of depicting : as subtle in effect, yet grosser in its determining factors. For we are thus changed from the times of Sophocles and Euripides ; that the fixed ideas of morality and 'religion which they employed as the motives of pathos or of horror are now shattered. Ibsen, otherwise in spirit and style purely Greek, and dealing as the Greeks did with the emotions of the soul, has realised the changed and infinitely more complex conditions of life; our self-appointed spiritual guicles notwithstanding, or, rather, withstanding in vain. Conse-quently it is impos,ible any more to divine whether virtue or vice (as understood of old) 1 Now \"The Temple of the Holy Ghost:\" 2 Hidden places."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"TANNHAUSER will cause the irreparable catastrophe which is the one element of drama which we may still (in the work of a modern dramatist) await with any degree of confidence. I trust that I may be forgiven for adopting the idea that Tannhauser was one of those mysterious Germans whose reputed existence so perturbed the Middle Ages; in short, a Rosicrucian.1 Some people may be surprised that a Member of that illustrious but unhappy fraternity should take cognizance of what my friend Bhikku Ananda Maitriya calls \"hog-nosed Egyptian deities,\" still more that he should show reverence to symbols like the B. V. M. and the Holy Grail. But the most learned and profound students of the Mysteries of the Rosy Cross assure me that it was the special excellence of these mystics that they declined to be bound down by any particular system in their sublime search for the Eternal and the Real. Under these circumstances I have not scrupled to subvert anything that appeared to me to need subverting in the interests, always identical, of beauty and of truth. Anachronism may be found piled upon anachronism, and symbolism mixed with symbolism. In one direction I have restrained myself. Nowhere does Tannhiiuser refer to the Vedas and Shastras 2 or to the Dhamma 3 of that blameless hypochondriac, Gotama Buddha. I take all the blame for so important an omission, not without a shrewd suspicion that the commination will take the form of \"For this relief much thanks ! \" The particular object that I have in view in speaking both in Hebrew and Egypto-Christian symbolism is that hy this means I may familiarise my readers with the one thing of any importance that life, travel, and study have taught ll)e, to wit : the Origin of Religions. I take it that there have always, or nearly always, been on the earth those whom Councillor von Eckartshausen,4 the Svami Vivekananda r, and their like, call 1 See their original documents, fairly enough translated in \" Real History of the Rosicru-cians,\" by A.

Yoga.\" \"great spiritual giants\" (can there be any etymological link between ''yogi\" 1 and \" ogre\"?) and that such persons, themselves perceiving Truth, have tried to \"diminish the message to the dog\" 2 for the benefit of less exalted minds, and hidden that Truth (which, unveiled, would but blind men with its glory) in a mass of symbols often perverted or grotesque, yet to the proper man transparent; a \"bait of falsehood to catch the carp of truth.\" Now, regarded in this light, all religions, qua religions, are equally contemptible. The Hindu Gnanis 3 say \"That which can he thought is not true.\" As machineries for the exercise of spiritual and intellectual powers innate or developed, certain sets of symbols may be more or less convenient to a special trend of mind, reason, or imagination; no more: I deny to any one religion the possession of any essential truth which is not also formulated (though in a different language) in every other. To this rule Buddhism appears a solitary exception. Whether it is truly so I have hardly yet decided: the answer depends upon certain recondite mathe-matical considerations, to discus~ which would be foreign to the scope of my present pur-pose, but which I hope to advance in a subsequent volume. 4 If you do not accept my conclusion that all religions are the expression of truth under different aspects, facets of the same intoler-able gem, you are forced back on the con-clusions of those unpleasing persons the Phallicists. But should you travel to the East, and tell a Lingam-worshipping Sivite that his is a phallic worship he will not be pleased with you. Compare on this point Arnold, \"India Revisited,\" 1886, p. IIZ. So much for the symbolology of this, I fear, much-mangled drama. Drama indeed is an altogether misleading term ; monodrarna is perhaps better. It is really a series of in· trospective studies ; not necessarily a series in time, but in psychology, and that rather the morbid psychology of the Adept than the gross mentality of the ordinary man. It may help some of my readers if I say that my Tannhauser is nearly identical in 1 11 Yogi .. is \"one who seeks union,\" i.e. with the Supreme. 2 Browning, \"Mr. Sludge the Medium.\" :1 Philosophers. 4 Berashith, q.v. infra, vol. ii,"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"PREFACE 22., scheme with the \" Pilgrim's Progress.\" Literary and spiritual experts will however readily detect minor differences in the treat-ment. It will be sufficient if I state that \"the Unknown,\" whether minstrel, pilgrim, or Egyptian sage, represents Tannhauser in his true Self, -the '' Only Being in an Abyss of Light ! \" The Tannhauser who talks is the \"Only Being in an Abyss of Darkness,\" the natural man ignorant of his identity with the Supreme Being. The various other characters are all little parts of Tannhauser's own consciousness and not real persons at all : whether good or bad, all alike hinder and help (and there is not one whose function is not thus double) the realisation of his true unity with all life. This circumstance serves to explain, though perhaps not to excuse, the lack of dramatic action in the story. Love being throughout the symbol of his method, as Beauty of its object, it is through Love, refined into Pity, that he at last attains the Supreme Know-ledge, or at least sufficient of it to put the last straw on the back of his corporeal camel, and bring the story to a fitting end. To pass to more mundane affairs. I may mention for the benefit of those who may not be read in certain classes of literature, and so think me original when I am hardly even paraphrasing, that Tannhauser's songs in Act IV. are partly adapted from the so-called \" Oracles of Zoroaster,\" partly from the mysterious utterances of the great angel Ave,1 perhaps equally spurious. Of course Bertram's song is merely a rather free adaptation of the two principal frag-ments of Sappho, which so many people have failed to translate that one can feel no shame in making yet another attempt. There may be one or two conscious plagiar-isms besides, for which I do not apologise. For any unconscious ones which may have crept in owing to my prolonged absence from civilised parts, and the con.sequent lack of opportunity for reference and comparison, I emphatically do. One word to the reviewers. It must not be taken as ungracious if I so speak. From nearly all I have received the utmost justice, kindness, and consideration : two or three only seem to take delight in deliberately perverting the sense of my remarks: and to them, for their own sake, I now address 1 In \" Dr. Dee.\" VOL, I, these words of elementary instruction. You are perfectly welcome to do with my work in its entirety what Laertes did with his allegiance and his vows : but do not pick out and gloat over a few isolated pasi.ages from the Venusberg scenes and call me a sensualist, nor from the Fourth Act and groan \" Mysticism ! \" ; do not quote \" Two is by shape the Coptic Aspirate\" as a sample of my utmost in lyrics; do not take the song of Wolfram as my best work in either senti-ment or melody. As a quid pro quo I give you all full permission to .conclude your re-view of this book by quoting from Act III. \" Forget this nightmare ! \" I must express my great sense of gratitude to Oscar Eckenstein, 1 Gerald Kelly, and Allan MacGregor, who have severally helped me in the work of revision, which has ex-tended over more than a year of time and nearly twenty thousand miles of space. Some few of the very best lines were partially or wholly suggested by themselves, and I have not scrupled to incorporate these : if the book be but a Book, the actual authorship seems to me immaterial. I have written this preface in lighter vein, but I hope that ·no one will be led to suppose that my purpose is anything but deadly serious. This poem bas been written in the blood of slain faith and hope ; each foolish utterance of Tannhauser stings me with. shame and memory of old agony; each Ignis Fatuus that he so readily pursues, reminds me of my own delusions. But, these follies and delusions being the common property of mankind, I have thought them of sufficient interest, dramatic and philo-sophical, to form the basis of a poem. Let no man dare to reproach me with posing as the hero of my tale. I fall back on the last utterance of Tannhauser himself: \"I say, then, 'I': and yet it is not ' I' Distinct, but ' I' incorporate in All.\" Above all, pray understand that I do not pose as a teacher. I am but an asker of questions, such as may be found confronting those who have indeed freed their minds from the con-ventional common places of the platitudinous, but have not yet dared to uproot the mass uf their convictions, and to examine the whole question of religion from its most fundamental source in the consciousness of mankind.

Only, more wise,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"APPENDIX QABALISTIC DOGMA [This short explanatory article has been specially contributed by an Adept, revered alike for his intellectual gifts and his spiritual attainments by the few to whom he permits himself to be known. Thanks to him would be impos5ible, but the Editor wishes to exr.ress his gratitude to the student who kindly obtained for him the introduction. No liberties have been taken with the MS., even to the retention of the capitals. but the spelling of some Eastern names has been assimilated to the universal alphabet-e.g. Qabalah for Kabbala-with the permission of the author.] THE Evolution of Things is thus described by the Qabalists. First is Nothing, or the Absence of Things, )'N, which does not and cannot mean -Negatively Existing (if such an Idea can be said to mean anything), as S. Liddell Macgregor Mathers, who misread the Text and stultified the Commentary by he Light of his own Ignorance of Hebrew and Philosophy, pretends in his Transla-tion of v. Rosenroth. Second is Without Limit l:)U::> )'N, i.e., Infinite Space. This is the primal Dualism of Infinity; the infinitely small and the infinitely great. The Clash of these produces a finite positive Idea which happens (see n1i:,i.:i::i, infra, vol. ii., for a more careful study, though I must not be understood to indorse every Word in our Poet-Philosopher's Thesis) to be Light, int This word i,N is most important. It symbolises the Universe immediately after Chaos, the Confusion or Clash of the infinite Opposites. N is the Egg of Matter ; , is ti, the Bull, or Energy-Motion; and 1 is the Sun, or organised and moving System of Orbs. The three Letters of i,N thus repeat the three Ideas. The Nature of i,N is thus analysed, under the figure of the ten Numbers and the 22 Letters which together compose what the Rosicrucians have diagrammatised· under the name of Minutum Mundum. (See Table of Correspondences.) It will be noticed that every Number and Letter has its \" Correspondence\" in Ideas of every Sort ; so that any given Object can be analysed in Terms of the 32. If I see a blue Star, I should regard it as a Manifestation of Chesed, Water, the Moon, Salt the Alchemical Principle, Sagittarius or What not, in respect of its Blueness-one would have to decide which from other Data-and refer it to the XVII th Key of the Taro in Respect of its Starriness. The Use of these Attributions is lengthy and various: I cannot dwell upon it: but I will give one Example. If I wish to visit the Sphere of Geburah, I use the Colours and Forces appro-priate : I go there : if the Objects which then appear to my spiritual Vision are harmonious therewith, it is one Test of their Truth. So also, to construct a Talisman, or to invoke a Spirit. The methods of discovering Dogma from sacred Words are also numerous and important : I may mention :-(a) The Doctrine of Sympathies: drawn from the total Numeration of a Word, 265"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"266 APPENDIX when identical with, or a Multiple or Subn,ultiple of, or a Metathesis of. that of another Word. (b) The Method of finding the Least Numher of a Word, by adding (and re-adding) the Digits of its total Number, and taking the corresponding Key of the Taro as a Key to the Meaning of the Word. (c) The Method of Analogies drawn from the Shape of the Letters. (d) The Method of Deductions drawn from the Meanings and Correspondences of the Letters. (e) The Method of Acrostics drawn from the Letters. This Mode is only valid for Adepts of the highest Grades, and then under quite exceptional and rare Conditions. (/) The Method of Transpositions and Transmutations of the Letters, which suggest Analogies, even when they fail to explain in direct Fashion. All these and their Varieties and Combinations, with some other more abstruse or less important Methods, may be used to unlock the Secret of a Word. Of course with Powers so wide it is easy for the Partisan to find his favourite Meaning in any Word. Even the formal Proof o = I = 2 = 3 = 4 = 5 = . . . . . . . = n is possible. But the Adept who worked out this Theorem, with the very Intent to discredit the Qabalistic Mode of Research, was suddenly dumbfounded by the Fact that he had actually stumbled upon the Qabalistic Proof of Pantheism or Monism. What really happens is that the Adept sits down and performs many useless Tricks with the Figures, without Result. Suddenly the Lux dawns, and the Problem is solved. The Rationalist explains this by Inspiration, the superstitious Man by Mathe-matics. I give an Example of the Way in which one works. Let us take IAO, one of the \"Barbarous Names of Evocation,\" of which those who have wished to conceal their own Glory by adopting the Authority of.Zarathustra have said that in the holy Ceremonies it has an ineffable Power. But what Kind of Power? By the Qabalah we can find out the Force of the Name IAO. We can spell it in Hebrew ,tt' or 31~'. The Qahalah will even tell us which is the true Way. Let us however suppose that it is spelt ,tt•. This adds up to 17. But first of all it strikes us that I, A, and O are the three Letters associated with the three Letters i1 in the great Name of Six Letters, mn•i1tt, which combines i1'i11iot and mi1', Macroprosopus and Microprosopus. Now these feminine Letters i1 conceal the \" Three Mothers\" of the Alphabet, N, 0, and ti. Replace these, and we get NU~'~N, which adds up to 358, the Number alike of tin), the Serpent of Genesis, and the Messiah. We thus look for redeeming Power in IAO, and for the Masculine Aspect of that Power. Now we will see how that Power works. We have a curious Dictionary, which was made by a very learned Man, in which the Numbers from 1 to 10,000 fill the left hand Column, in Order, and opposite them are written all the sacred or important Words which add up to each Number. We take this Book, and look at 17. We find that 17 is the number of Squares in the Swastika, which is the Whirling Disc or Thunderbolt. Also there"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"APPENDIX is )m, a Circle or Orbit; 1)l, to seethe or boil; and some other Words, which we will neglect in this Example, though we should not dare to do so if we were really trying to fin<l out a Thing we none of us knew. To help our Deduction about Redemption, too, we find i11n, tu brighten or make glad. We also work in another Way. I is the Straight Line or Central Pillar of the Temple of Life; also it stands for Unity, and for the Generative Force. A is the Pentagram, which means the \\,Vill of Man working Redemption. 0 is the Circle from which everything came, also Nothingness, and the Female, who absorbs the Male. The Progress of the Name shows then the Way from Life to Nin·ana by means of the \\Vill : and is a Hieroglyph of the Great Work. Look at all our Meanings! Every one shows that the Name, if it has any Power at all, and that we must try. has the Power to redeem us from the Love of Life which is the Cause of Life, by its masculine Whirlings, and to gladden us and to bring us to the Bosom of the Great Mother, Death. Before what is known as the Equinox of the Gods, a little while ago, there was an initiated Formula which expressed these Ideas to the Wise. As these Formulas are done with, it is of no Consequence if I reveal them. Truth is not eternal, any more than God ; and it would be but a poor God that could not and did not alter his Ways at his Pleasure. This Formula was used to open the Vault of the l\\1ystic Mountain of Abiegnus, within which lay (so the Ceremony of Initiation supposed) the Body of our Father Christian Rosen Creutz, to be discovered by the Brethren with the Postulant as said in the Book called Fama Fraternitatis. There are three Officers, and they repeat the Analysis of the 'Word as follows:-Chief. Let us analyse the Key Word-I. 2nd. N. 3rd. R. All. I. Chief. Ynd. ' 2nd. Nun. J 3rd. Resh. \"\\ All. Yod.'

With erect Herid, raises his Arms to form a V (but really to form the triple Tongue of Flame, the Spirit), and says:-The Sign of Apophis and Typhon."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"268 APPENDIX 3rd. Bows his Head and crosses his Arms on his Breast (to form the Penta-gram). The Sign of Osiris risen. All give the Sign of the Cross, and say:-L.V.X. Then the Sign of Osiris risen, and say:-Lux, the Light of the Cross. This Formula, on which one may meditate for Years without exhausting its wonderful Harmonies, gives an excellent Idea of the Way in which Qabalistic Analysis is conducted. First, the Letters have been written in Hebrew Characters. Then the Attributions of them to the Zodiac and to Planets are substituted, and the Names of Egyptian Gods belonging to these are invoked. The Christian Idea of I.N.R.I. is confirmed by these, while their Initials form the sacred Word of the Gnostics. That is, IAO. From the Character of the Deities and their Functions are deduced their Signs, and these are found to signal (as it were) the Word Lux (iU(), which itself is contained in the Cross. A careful Study of these Ideas, and of the Table of Correspondences, which one of our English Brethren is making, will enable him to discover a very great Deal of Matter for Thought in these Poems which an untutored Person would pass by. To return to the general Dogma of the Qabalists. The Figure of Minutum Mundum will show how they suppose one Quality to proceed from the last, first in the pure God-World Atziluth, then in the Angel-World Briah, and so on down to the Demon-Worlds, which are however not thus organised. They are rather Material that was shed off in the Course of Evolution, like the Sloughs of a Serpent, from which comes their Name of Shells, or Husks. . Apart from silly Questions as to whether the Order of the Emanations· is con-firmed by Palreontology, a Question it is qujte incompetent to discuss, there is no Doubt the Sephiroth are types of Evolution as opposed to Catastrophe and Creation. The great Charge against this Philosophy is founded on its alleged Affinities with Scholastic Realism. But the Charge is not very true. No Doubt but they did suppose vast Storehouses of \"Things of one Kind\" f(om which, pure or mingled, all other Things did proceed. Since ), a Camel, refers to the Moon, they did say that a Camel and the Moon were sympathetic, and came, that Part of them, from a common Principle: and that a Camel being yellow brown, it partook of the Earth Nature, to which that Colour is given. Thence they said that by taking all the Natures involved, and by blending them in the just Proportions, one might have a Camel. But this is no more than is said by the Upholders of the Atomic Theory. They have their Storehouses of Carbon, Oxygen, and such (not in one Place, but no more is Geburah in one Place), and what is Organic Chemistry but the Production of useful Compounds whose Nature is deduced absolutely from theoretical Considera-tions long before it is ever produced in the Laboratory ?"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 269 The difference, you will say, is that the Qahalists maintain a Mind of each Kind behind each Class of Things of one Kind ; but so did Berkeley, and his Argument in that Respect is, as the great Huxley showed, irrefragable. For by the Universe I mean the Sensible; any other is Not to be Known ; and the Sensible is dependent upon l\\'lind. Nay, though the Sensible i, said to be an Argument of an Universe Insensible, the latter becomes sensible to Mind as soon as the Argument is accepted, and disappears with its Rejection. Nor is the Qabalah dependent upon its Realism, and its Application to the Works magical--but I am defending a Philosophy which I was asked to describe, and this is not lawful. A great Deal may be learned from the Translation of the Zohar by S. Liddell Macgregor Mathers, and his Introduction thereto, though for those who have Latin and some acquaintance with Hebrew it is better to study the Kabbala Denudata of Knorr von Rosenroth, in Despite of the heavy Price ; for the Translator has distorted the Text and its Comment to suit his belief in a supreme Personal God, and in that degraded Form of the Doctrine of Feminism which is so popular with the Emasculate. The Sephiroth are grouped in various Ways. There is a Superior Triad or Trinity; a Hexad ; and Malkuth : the Crown, the Father, and the Mother; the Son or King ; and the Bride. Also, a Division into seven Palaces, seven Planes, three Pillars or Columns : and the like. The Flashing Sword follows the Course of the Numbers and the Serpent Nechushtan or of Wisdom crawls up the Paths which join them upon the Tree of Life, namely the Letters. It is important to explain the Position of Daath or Knowledge upon the Tree. It is called the Child of Chokmah and Binah, but it hath no Place. But it is really the Apex of a Pyramid of which the three first Numbers form the Base. Now the Tree, or Minutum Mundum, is a Figure in a Plane of a solid Universe. Daath, being above the Plane, is therefore a Figure of a Force in four Dimensions, and thus it is the Object of the Magnum Opus. The three Paths which connect it with the First Trinity are the three lost Letters or Fathers of the Hebrew Alphabet. In Daath is said to be the Head of the great Serpent Nechesh or Leviathan, called Evil to conceal its Holiness. (!Vn) = 358 = n•ivr.i, the :\\1:essiah or Redeemer, and 1M'l~=496=Ml::i~r.,, the Bride.) It is identical with the Kundalini of the Hindu Philosophy, the Kwan-se-on of the Mongolian Peoples, and means the magical Force in Man, which is the sexual Force applied to the Brain, Heart, and other Organs, and redeemeth him. The gradual Disclosure of these magical Secrets to the Poet may be traced in these Volumes, which it has been my Privilege to be asked to explain. It has been impossible to do more than place in the Hands of any intelligent Person the Keys which will permit him to unlock the many Beautiful Chambers of Holiness in these Palaces and Gardens of Beauty and Pleasure."}]
