Let me instantly launch the Boat ofDiscourse on the Sea of Religious Speculation, in danger of the Rocks ofAuthority and the Quicksands of Private Interpretation, Scylla and Charybdis.Here is the strait; what God shall save us from shipwreck? If we choose tounderstand the Christian (or any other) religion literally, we are at onceoverwhelmed by its inherent impossibility. Our credulity is outraged, ourmoral sense shocked, the holiest foundations of our inmost selves assailed byno ardent warrior in triple steel, but by a loathly and disgusting worm. Thatthis is so, the apologists for the religion in question, whichever it may be,sufficiently indicate (as a rule) by the very method of their apology. Thealternative is to take the religion symbolically, esoterically; but to move onestep in this direction is to start on a journey whose end cannot be determined.The religion, ceasing to be a tangible thing, an object uniform for all saneeyes, becomes rather that mist whereon the sun of the soul casts up, likeBrocken spectre, certain vast and vague images of the beholder himself, with or"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5without a glory encompassing them. The function of the facts is then quitepassive: it matters little or nothing whether the cloud be the red mist ofChristianity, or the glimmering silver-white of Celtic Paganism; the hard greydim-gilded of Buddhism, the fleecy opacity of Islam, or the mysterious mediumof those ancient faiths which come up in as many colours as their investigatorhas moods.<<\"In order to get over the ethical difficulties presented by thenaive naturalism of many parts of those Scriptures, in the divine authority ofwhich he firmly believed, Philo borrowed from the Stoics (who had been in likestraits in respect of Greek mythology) that great Excalibur which they hadforged with infinite pains and skill -- the method of allegoricalinterpretation. This mighty 'two-handed engine at the door' of the theologianis warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectualdifficulty, by showing that, taken allegorically, or, as it is otherwise said,'poetically' or 'in a spiritual sense,' the plainest words mean whatever apious interpreter desires they should mean\" (Huxley, \"Evolution of Theology\").-- A. C.>> {141B} If the student has advances spiritually so that he caninternally, infallibly perceive what is Truth, he will find it equally wellsymbolised in most external faiths. It is curious that Browning never turns his wonderful faculty of analysisupon the fundamental problems of religion, as it were an axe laid to the rootof the Tree of Life. It seems quite clear that he knew what would result if hedid so. We cannot help fancying that he was unwilling to do this. The proofof his knowledge I find in the following lines: -- \"I have read much, thought much, experienced much, Yet would die rather than avow my fear The Naples' liquefaction may be false . . . I hear you recommend, I might at least Eliminate, decrassify my faith Since I adopt it: keeping what I must And leaving what I can; such points as this . . . Still, when you bid me purify the same, To such a process I discern no end . . . First cut the liquefaction, what comes last But Fichte's clever cut at God himself? . . . I trust nor hand, nor eye, nor heart, nor brain To stop betimes: they all get drunk alike. The first step, I am master not to take.\" This is surely the apotheosis of wilful ignorance! We may think, perhaps,that Browning is \"hedging\" when, in the last paragraph, he says: \"For Blougram,he believed, say, half he spoke,\"<<Probably a record for a bishop. -- A. C.>>and hints at some deeper ground. It is useless to say, \"This is Blougram andnot Browning.\" Browning could hardly have described the dilemma without seeingit. What he really believes is, perhaps, a mystery."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 That Browning, however, believes in universal salvation, though he nowhere(so far as I know) gives his reasons, save as they are summarised in the lastlines of the below-quoted stanza of \"Apparent Failure,\" and from his finalpronouncement of the Pope on Guido, represented in Browning's masterpiece as aJudas without the decency to hang himself. \"So (\"ie.\" by suddenness of fate) may the truth be flashed out by one blow, And Guido see one instant and be saved. Else I avert my face nor follow him Into that sad obscure sequestered state Where God unmakes but to remake the soul He else made first in vain: which must not be.\" {142A} This may be purgatory, but is sounds not unlike reincarnation. It is at least a denial of the doctrine of eternal punishment. As for myself, I took the first step years ago, quite in ignorance of whatthe last would lead to. God is indeed cut away -- a cancer from the breast oftruth. Of those philosophers, who from unassailable premisses draw by righteousdeduction a conclusion against God, and then for His sake overturn their wholestructure by an act of will, like a child breaking an ingenious toy, I takeMansel as my type.<<As represented by his Encyclopaedia article; not in suchworks as \"Limits of Religious Thought.\" -- A.C.>> Now, however, let us consider the esoteric idea-mongers of Christianity,Swedenborg, Anna Kingsford, Deussen and the like, of whom I have taken Caird asmy example. I wish to unmask these people: I perfectly agree with nearlyeverything they say, but their claim to be Christians is utterly confusing, andlends a lustre to Christianity which is quite foreign. Deussen, for example,coolly discards nearly all the Old Testament, and, picking a few New Testamentpassages, often out of their context, claims his system as Christianity.Luther discards James. Kingsford calls Paul the Arch Heretic. My friend the\"Christian Clergyman\" accepted Mark and Acts -- until pushed. Yet Deussen ishonest enough to admit that Vedanta teaching is identical, but clearer! and hequite clearly and sensibly defines Faith -- surely the most essential qualityfor the adherent to Christian dogma -- as \"being convinced on insufficientevidence.\" Similarly the dying-to-live idea of Hegel (and Schopenhauer)claimed by Caird as the central spirit of Christianity is far older, in theOsiris Myth of the Egyptians. These ideas are all right, but they have no moreto do with Christianity than the Metric System with the Great Pyramid. But seePiazzi Smyth!<<An astronomer whose brain gave way. He prophesied the end ofthe world in 1881, from measurements made in the Great Pyramid.>> Henry Morleyhas even the audacity to claim Shelley -- Shelley! -- as a Christian \"inspirit.\" Talking of Shelley: -- With regard to my open denial of the personalChristian God, may it not be laid to my charge that I have dared to voice in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7bald language what Shelley {142B} sang in words of surpassing beauty: for ofcourse the thought in one or two passages of this poem is practically identicalwith that in certain parts of \"Queen Mab\" and \"Prometheus Unbound.\" But thevery beauty of these poems (especially the latter) is its weakness: it ispossible that the mind of the reader, lost in the sensuous, nay! even in themoral beauty of the words, may fail to be impressed by their most importantmeaning. Shelley himself recognised this later: hence the direct and simplevigour of the \"Masque of Anarchy.\" It has often puzzled athiests how a man of Milton's genius could have writtenas he did of Christianity. But we must not forget that Milton livedimmediately after the most important Revolution in Religion and Politics ofmodern times: Shelley on the brink of such another Political upheaval.Shakespeare alone sat enthroned above it all like a god, and is not lost in themire of controversy.<<So it is usually supposed. Maybe I shall one day findwords to combat, perhaps to overthrow, this position. \"P.S.\" As, for example,page 185. As a promise-keeper I am the original eleven stone three Peacherine.-- A.C.>> This also, though \"I'm no Shakespeare, as too probable,\" I haveendeavoured to avoid: yet I cannot but express the hope that my own enquiriesinto religion may be the reflection of the spirit of the age; and that plungedas we are in the midst of jingoism and religious revival, we may be standing onthe edge of some gigantic precipice, over which we may cast all our impedimentaof lies and trickeries, political, social, moral, and religious, and(ourselves) take wings and fly. The comparison between myself and the mastersof English thought I have named is unintentional, though perhaps unavoidable;and though the presumption is, of course, absurd, yet a straw will show whichway the wind blows as well as the most beautiful and elaborate vane: and inthis sense it is my most eager hope that I may not unjustly draw a comparisonbetween myself and the great reformers of eighty years ago. {143A} I must apologise (perhaps) for the new note of frivolity in my work: duedoubtless to the frivolity of my subject: these poems being written when I wasan Advaitist and could not see why -- everything being an illusion -- thereshould be any particular object in doing or thinking anything. How I havefound the answer will be evident from my essay on this subject.<<\"Vide infra,\"\"Berashith.\">> I must indeed apologise to the illustrious Shade of RobertBrowning for my audacious parody in title, style, and matter of his \"ChristmasEve and Easter Day.\" The more I read it the eventual anticlimax of thatwonderful poem irritated me only the more. But there is hardly any poet livingor dead who so commands alike my personal affection and moral admiration. Mydesire to find the Truth will be my pardon with him, whose whole life was spentin admiration of Truth, though he never turned its formidable engines againstthe Citadel of the Almighty. If I be appealed of blasphemy or irreverence in my treatment of thesesubjects, I will take refuge in Browning's own apology, from the very poem I amattacking: \"I have done: and if any blames me,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Thinking that merely to touch in brevity The topics I dwell on were unlawful -- Or worse, that I trench with undue levity On the bounds of the holy and the awful -- I praise the heart and pity the head of him And refer myself to Thee, instead of him, Who head and heart alike discernest, Looking below light speech we utter Where frothy spume and frequent splutter Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!\" But I have after all little fear that I am seriously wrong. That I show tomy critics the open door of the above city of refuge may be taken as merelyanother gesture of contemptuous pity, the last insult which may lead myantagonists to that surrender which is the truest victory.{full page follows}  PEACE TO ALL BEINGS.{143B}{Column format is abandoned for the next full page sections; resumed after asnoted.

AN APPRECIATION  BY ALEISTER CROWLEY.<<1>><<1. The lamented decease of the above gentleman forbids all hope (save throughthe courtesy of Sir Oliver Lodge) of the appearance of the companion article. -- A.C.>>IT is a lamentable circumstance that so many colossal brains (W. H. Mallock,&c.) have been hitherto thrown away in attacking what is after all a problem ofmere academic interest, the authorship of the plays our fathers accepted asthose of Shakespeare. To me it seems of immediate and vital importance to dofor Shakespeare what Verrall has done so ably for Euripides. The thirdtabernacle must be filled; Shaw and \"the Human\" must have their Superhumancompanion. (This is not a scale: pithecanthropoid innuendo is to deprecated.)"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 Till now -- as I write the sun bursts forth suddenly from a cloud, as ifheralding the literary somersault of the twentieth century -- we have beencontent to accept Shakespeare as orthodox, with common sense; moral to a fault,with certain Rabelaisian leanings: a healthy tone (we say) pervades his work.Never believe it! The sex problem is his Speciality; a morbid decadence (so-called) is hidden i' th' heart o' th' rose. In other words, the divine Williamis the morning star to Ibsen's dawn, and Bernard Shaw's effulgence. The superficial, the cynical, the misanthropic will demand proof of such astatement. Let it be our contemptuous indulgence to afford them what they ask. May I premise that, mentally obsessed, monomaniac indeed, as we must nowconsider Shakespeare to have been on these points, he was yet artful enough tohave concealed his {185A} advanced views -- an imperative necessity, if weconsider the political situation, and the virginal mask under which Queen Besshid the grotesque and hideous features of a Messaline. Clearly so, since butfor this concealment even our Shakespearian scholars would have discovered sopatent a fact. In some plays, too, of course, the poet deals with lessdangerous topics. These are truly conventional, no doubt; we may pass them by;they are foreign to our purpose; but we will take that stupendous example ofliterary subterfuge -- \"King Lear.\"<<WEH NOTE: All this is very well, and fun;but Crowley overlooks the obvious fact that Shakespeare wrote this play aspropaganda. So effective was this \"take\" on the War of the Roses that itplayed in very earnest later under the Stuarts with Cromwell!>> Let me digress to the history of my own conversion. Syllogistically, -- All great men (\"e.g.\" Shaw) are agnostics and subvertersof morals. Shakespeare was a great man. Therefore Shakespeare was an agnosticand a subverter of morals. \"A priori\" this is then certain. But -- Who killed Rousseau? I, said Huxley (Like Robinson Crusoe), With arguments true, -- so I killed Rousseau! Beware of \"a priori!\" Let us find our facts, guided in the search by \"apriori\" methods, no doubt; but the result will this time justify us. Where would a man naturally hide his greatest treasure? In his most perfecttreasure-house. Where shall we look for the truest thought of a great poet? In his greatestpoem. What is Shakespeare's greatest play? \"King Lear.\" In \"King Lear,\" then, we may expect the final statement of the poet's mind.The passage that first put me on the track of the amazing discovery for whichthe world has to thank me is to be found in Act I. Sc. iii. II. 132-149: -- \"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick infortune, -- often the surfeit of our own behaviour, -- we make guilty {185B} of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains bynecessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers byspherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforcedobedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divinethrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatishdisposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother underthe dragon's tail, and my nativity was under \"ursa major;\" so that it follows Iam rough and lecherous. 'Sfoot! I should have been that I am had themaidenliest star in the firmament twinkeled on my bastardizing.\" If there is one sound philosophical dictum in the play, it is this. (I amnot going to argue with astrologers in the twentieth century.) It is one we can test. On questions of morality and religion opinions veer;but if Shakespeare was a leader of thought, he saw through the humbug of thestar-gazers; if not, he was a credulous fool; not the one man of his time, nota \"debauched genius\" (for Sir R. Burton in this phrase has in a senseanticipated me discovery) but a mere Elizabethan. This the greatest poet of all time? Then we must believe that Gloucesterwas right, and that eclipses caused the fall of Lear! Observe that before thisShakespeare has had a sly dig or two at magic. In \"King John,\" \"My lord, theysay five moons were seen to-night\" -- but there is no eyewitness. So in\"Macbeth.\" In a host of spiritual suggestion there is always the rationalsober explanation alongside to discredit the folly of the supernatural. Shakespeare is like his own touchstone; he uses his folly as a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit. Here, however, the mask is thrown off for any but the utterly besotted;Edmund's speech stands up in the face of all time as truth; it challenges theacclamation of the centuries. Edmund is then the hero; more, he is Shakespeare's own portrait of himself;his ways are dark -- (and, alas! his tricks are vain!) -- for why? For thefear of the conventional world about him. He is illegitimate: Shakespeare is no true child of that age, but born indefiance of it and its prejudices. Having taken this important step, let us slew round the rest of the play tofit it. If it fits, the law of probability comes to our aid; every coincidencemultiplies the chance of our correctness in ever increasing proportion. Weshall see -- and you may look up your Proctor -- that if the stars are placedjust so by chance not law, then also it may be possible that Shakespeare wasthe wool-combing, knock-kneed, camel-backed, church-going, plaster-of-Paris,{186A} stick-in-the-mud our scholars have always made him. Edmund being the hero, Regan and Goneril must be the heroines. So nearlyequal are their virtues and beauties that our poet cannot make up his mindwhich shall possess him -- besides which, he wishes to drive home his argumentsin favour of polygamy. But the great theme of the play is of course filial duty; on this everythingwill turn. Here is a test:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 \"Whenever this question is discussed, let us see who speaks the language ofsense, and who that of draggle-tailed emotionalism and tepid melodrama.\" In the first scene the heroines, who do not care for the old fool theirfather -- as how could any sane women? Remember Shakespeare is here about toshow the folly of filal love as such -- feel compelled, by an act of graciousgenerosity to a man they despise, yet pity, to say what they think will pleasethe dotard's vanity. Also no doubt the sound commercial instinct was touchedby Lear's promise to make acres vary as words, and they determined to make afinal effort to get some parsnips buttered after all. Shakespeare (it is our English boast) was no long-haired squiggle self-yclept bard; but a business man -- see Bishop Blougram's appreciation of him assuch. Shall we suppose him to have deliberately blackguarded in another his ownbest qualities? Note, too, the simple honesty of the divine sisters! Others, more subtle,would have suspected a trap, arguing that such idiocy as Lear's could not begenuine -- Cordelia, the Madame Humbert of the play, does so; her over-cleverness leaves her stranded: yet by a certain sliminess of dissimulation,the oilness of frankness, the pride that apes humility, she \"does\" catch thebest king going. Yet it avails her little. She is hanged like the foul Vivienshe is.<<I use the word Vivien provisionally, pending the appearance of anessay to prove that Lord Tennyson was in secret an ardent reformer of our laxmodern morals. No doubt, there is room for this. Vivien was perfectly rightabout the \"cycle of strumpets and scoundrels whom Mr. Tennyson has setrevolving round the figure of his central wittol,\" and she was the only onewith the courage to say so, and the brains to strip off the barbarous glitterfrom an idiotic and phantom chivalry.>> Cordelia's farewell to her sisters shows up the characters of the three instrong relief. Cordelia -- without a scrap of evidence to go on -- accusesher sisters of hypocrisy and cruelty. (This could not have previously existed,or Lear would not have been deceived.) Regan gravely rebukes her; recommends, as it were, a course of Six EasyLessons in Minding {186B} Her Own Business; and surely it was unparalleledinsolence of the part of a dismissed girl to lecture her more favoured sisteron the very point for which she herself was at that moment being punished. Itis the spite of baffled dissimulation against triumphant honesty. Goneril addsa word of positive advice. \"You,\" she says in effect, \"who prate of duty thus,see you show it to him unto whom you owe it.\" That this advice is wasted is clear from Act V. Sc. iii., where the King ofFrance takes the first trivial opportunity<<He leaves her in charge of MarshalLe Fer, whom alone he could trust to be impervious to her wiles, he beingdevoted to another; for, as an invaluable contemporary MS. has it, \"Seccotinecolle meme Le Fer.\">> to be free of the vile creature he had so foolishlymarried. Cordelia goes, and the sisters talk together. Theirs is the language ofquiet sorrow for an old man's failing mind; yet a most righteous determination"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51not to allow the happiness of the English people to depend upon his whims. Badwomen would have rejoiced in the banishment of Kent, whom they already knew tobe their enemy; these truly good women regret it. \"Such unconstant starts arewe like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment\" (Act I. Sc. i, ll 304-5). In Scene ii. Edmund is shown; he feels himself a man, more than Edgar: aclear-headed, brave, honourable man; but with no maggots. The injustice of hissituation strikes him; he determines not to submit.<<This may be, but I thinkshould not be, used as an argument to prove the poet an illegitimate son ofQueen Elizabeth.>> This is the attitude of a strong man, and a righteous one. Primogeniture iswrong enough; the other shame, no fault of his, would make the blood of anyfree man boil. Gloucester enters, and exhibits himself as a prize fool by shouting indisjointed phrases what everybody knew. Great news it is, of course, and ondiscovering Edmund, he can think of nothing more sensible than to ask for more!\"Kent banished thus! And France in choler parted! And the king gone to-night!subscrib'd his power! Confin'd to exhibition! All this done upon the gad!Edmund, how now! what news?\" (Act I. Sc. ii. ll. 23-26). Edmund \"forces a card\" by the simple device of a prodigious hurry to hideit. Gloucester gives vent to his astrological futilities, and falls toanxiomania in its crudest form, -- \"We have seen the best of our time:machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders, follow usdisquietly to our graves\" (Sc. ii. ll. 125-127). Edmund, once rid of him, gives us the {187A} plainest sense we are likely tohear for the rest of our lives; then, with the prettiest humour in the worldtakes the cue of his father's absurdity, and actually plays it on his enemy.Edgar's leg is not so easily pulled -- (\"How long have you been a sectaryastronomical?\" ll. 169, 170) -- and the bastard hero, taking alarm gets rightdown to business. In Scene iii. we find Lear's senile dementia taking the peculiarly loathsomeforms familiar to alienists -- this part of my subject is so unpleasant that Imust skim over it; I only mention it to show how anxious Shakespeare is to showhis hidden meaning, otherwise his naturally delicate mind would have avoidedthe depiction of such phenomena. All this prepares us for Scene iv., in which we get a glimpse of the wayLear's attendants habitually behave. Oswald, who treats Lear throughout withperfect respect, and only shows honest independence in refusing to obey a manwho is not his master, is insulted in language worthier of a bargee than aking; and when he remonstrates in dignified and temperate language is set uponby the ruffanly Kent. Are decent English people to complain when Goneril insists that this ofthing shall not occur in a royal house? She does so, in language noblyindignant, yet restrained: Lear, in the hideous, impotent rage of senility,calls her -- his own daughter -- a bastard (no insult to her, but to himselfor his wife, mark ye well!). Albany enters -- a simple, orderly-minded man; he"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52must not be confused with Cornwall, he is at the last Lear's dog; yet even hein decent measured speech sides with his wife. Is Lear quieted? No! Heutters the most horrible curse, not excepting that of Count Cenci, that afather ever pronounced. Incoherent threats succeed to the boilings-over of thehideous malice of a beastly mind; but a hundred knights are a hundred knights,and a threat is a threat. Goneril had not fulfilled her duty to herself, toher people, had she allowed this monster of mania to go on. I appeal to the medical profession; of one doctor will answer me that a manusing Lear's language should be allowed control of a hundred armed ruffians [inthe face of Kent's behaviour we know what weight to attach to Lear's defence:\"Detested kite! thou liest\" (I. iv. l. 286)], should ever be allowed outside aregularly appointed madhouse, I will cede the point, and retire myself into anasylum. In fact, Lear is going mad; the tottering intellect, at no time strong (\"tisthe infirmity of age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself,\" I. i. ll.296-7), is utterly cast down by drink and debauchery: he even sees it himself,and with a pointless bestiality from the Fool, fit companion for the -- king --and in that word {187B} we see all the concentrated loathing of the trueShakespeare for a despotism, massed in one lurid flame, phantasmagoric horror,the grim First Act rolls down.  II. Act II. Sc. i. adds little new to our thesis, save that in line 80 we seeGloucester (ignorant of his own son's handwriting!) accept the forged letter asgenuine, as final proof, with not even the intervention of a Bertillon toexcuse so palpable a folly, so egregious a crime. What father of to-day woulddisinherit, would hunt down to death, a beloved son, on such evidence? Or arewe to take it that the eclipse gave proof unshakable of a phenomenon soportentous? In Scene ii. we have another taste of Kent's gentlemanly demeanour; let ourconventionalist interpreters defend this unwarrantable bullying if they dare!Another might be so gross, so cowardly; but not our greatest poet! A goodportion of this play, as will be shown later, is devoted to a bitter assaultupon the essentially English notion that the pugilist is the supreme device ofthe Creator for furthering human happiness. (See \"Cashel Byron's Profession\"for a similar, though more logical and better-worded, attack.) Coarse andviolent language continues to disgrace Lear's follower; only Gloucester, theunconscionable ass and villain of Scene i., has a word to say in his defence. In Scene iii. we have a taste of Edgar's quality. Had this despicable youththe consciousness of innocence, or even common courage, he had surely stood tohis trial. Not he! He plays the coward's part -- and his disguise is not evendecent. In Scene iv. we are shown the heroic sisters in their painful task ofrestraining, always with the utmost gentleness of word and demeanour, theheadstrong passions of the miserable king. Lear, at first quiet in stating his"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53fancied wrongs \"Reg.\" 'I am glad to see your highness.' \"Lear.\" 'Regan, Ithink you are; I know what reason I have to think so: if thou shouldst not beglad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, Sepulchring an adult'ress.(\"to Kent\"). O! are you free? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, Thysister's naught: O Regan! she hath tied Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like avulture, here: (\"Points to his heart\"). I can scarce speak to thee; thou'ltnot believe with how deprav'd a quality -- O Regan!' \"Reg.\" 'I pray you, sir,take patience. I have hope!'\") (ll. 130-139), an excusable speech, at thefirst hint that he is not to have it all his own way, falls a-cursing againlike the veriest drab or scullion Hamlet ever heard. Here is a man, deprived on just cause of {188A} half a useless company ofretainers. Is this wrong (even were it wrong) such as to justify the horriblecurses of ll. 164-168. \"All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall On heringrateful top! Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness! Younimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes!\" Withthis he makes his age contemptible by the drivel-pathos of ll. 156-158, \"Deardaughter, I confess that I am old; Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg('Keeling') That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food,\" begging what noneever thought to deny him. Yet such is the patience of Goneril that even when goaded by all thisinfamous Billingsgate into speech, her rebuke is the temperate and modest ll.198-200. \"Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended? All's not offencethat indiscretion finds And dotage terms so.\" If we ask a parallel for suchmeekness under insult, calumny, and foul abuse, we must seek it not in a humanstory, but a divine. The heroines see that no half measures will do, and Lear is stripped of allthe murderous retinue -- what scum they are is shown by the fact that not oneof them draws sword for him, or even follows him into the storm -- for him inspite of all his loathsomeness, his hatred, his revengefulness -- is Regan'sgentle and loving, \"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly.\"  III. In Act III. we have another illustration of the morality that passed currentwith the Tudors, and which only a Shakespeare had the courage to attack. Kentdoes not stick at treachery -- he makes one gulp of treason -- straining at thegnat of discipline, he swallows the camel of civil war. It was then, and is even now, the practice of some -- for example, theemigres of the French Revolution -- to invite foreign invasion as a means ofsecuring domestic reaction. The blackguardism implied is beyond language:Shakespeare was perhaps thinking of the proposal, in Mary's reign, to react toRomanism by the aid of Spanish troops. But he will go further than this, willour greatest poet; it were ill that the life of even one child should atone formere indignity or discomfort to another, were he the greatest in the realm.To-day, we all agree; we smile or sneer if any one should differ."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 \"King Lear got caught in the rain -- let us go and kill a million men!\" isan argument not much understood of Radical Clubs, and even Jingos would pause,did they but take the precaution of indulging in a mild aperient beforerecording their opinions. {188B} In Scenes iii., vi., and vii., Edmund, disguised beyond all measure withGloucester's infamies, honourably and patriotically denounces him. The other scenes depict the miseries which follow the foolish and theunjust; and Nemesis falls upon the ill-minded Gloucester. Yet Shakespeare isso appreciative of the virtue of compassion (for Shakespeare was, as I shallhope to prove one day, a Buddhist) that Cornwall, the somewhat cruel instrumentof eternal Justice, is killed by his servant. Regan avenges her husbandpromptly, and I have little doubt that this act of excessive courtesy towards aman she did not live is the moral cause of her unhappy end. I would note that we should not attempt to draw any opinions as to theauthor's design from the conversation of the vulgar; even had we not Cariolanusto show us what he thought.  IV. Act IV. develops the plot and is little germaine to our mater, save that wecatch a glimpse of the unspeakably vile Cordelia, with no pity for her father'sserious condition (though no doubt he deserved all he got, he was now harmless,and should have inspired compassion), hanging to him in the hope that he wouldnow reverse his banishment and make her (after a bloody victory) sole heiressof great England. And were any doubt left in our minds as to who really was the hero of theplay, the partizanship of France should settle it. Shakespeare has never anyword but ridicule for the French; never aught but praise of England and lovefor her: are we to suppose that in his best play he is to stultify all hisother work and insult the English for the benefit of the ridiculed and hatedFrenchman? Moreover, Cordelia reckons without her host. The British bulldogs makeshort work of the invaders and rebels, doubtless with the connivance of theKing of France, who, with great and praiseworthy acuteness, foresees thatCordelia will be hanged, thus liberating him from his \"most filthy bargain\":there is but one alarum, and the whole set of scoundrels surrender. Note thiswell; it is not by brute force that the battle is won; for even if we exoneratethe King of France, we may easily believe that the moral strength of thesisters cowed the French. This is the more evident, since in Act V. Shakespeare strikes his final blowat the absurdity of the duel, when Edmund is dishonestly slain by the beastEdgar. Yet the poet's faith is still strong: wound up as his muse is totragedy, he retains in Edmund the sublime heroism, the simple honesty, of the{189A} true Christian; at the death of his beloved mistress he cries, \"I was contracted to them both: all three Now marry in an instant -- \""},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 At the moment of death his great nature (self-accusatory, as the finest sooften are) asserts itself, and he forgives even the vilest of the human race, -- \"I pant for life: some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.<<Thismay merely mean \"despite the fact that I am dying -- though I am almost tooweak to speak.\" If so, the one phrase in the play which seems to refute ourtheory is disposed of. Execution of such criminals would be a matter ofroutine at the period of the play.>> Quickly send, Be brief in it, to thecastle; for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. Nay, send in time\"(ll. 245-249). And in that last supreme hour of agony he claims Regan as his wife, as if byaccident; it is not the passionate assertion of a thing doubtful, but thenatural reference to a thing well known and indisputable. And in the moment of his despair; confronted with the dead bodies of thesplendid sisters, the catafalque of all his hopes, he can exclaim in spiritualtriumph over material disaster -- the victory of a true man's spirit over Fate-- \"Yet Edmund was beloved.\" Edgar is left alive with Albany, alone of all that crew; and if remorsecould touch their brutal and callous souls (for the degeneration of theweakling, well-meaning Albany, is a minor tragedy), what hell could be morehorrible than the dragging out of a cancerous existence in the bestial world ofhate their hideous hearts had made, now, even for better men, for ever dark andgloomy, robbed of the glory of the glowing Goneril, the royal Regan, and onlypartially redeemed by the absence of the harlot Cordelia and the monster Lear.  V. It may possibly be objected by the censorious, by the effete parasites of agrim conventionalism, that I have proved too much. Even by conventionalstandards Edmund, Goneril, and Regan appear angels. Even on the moral point,the sisters, instead of settling down to an enlightened and by no meansovercrowded polygamy, prefer to employ poison. This is perhaps true, ofGoneril at least; Regan is, if one may distinguish between star and star,somewhat the finer character. This criticism is perhaps true in part; but I will not insult theintelligence of my readers. I will leave it to them to take the obvious stepand work backwards to the re-exaltation of Lear, Cordelia, Edgar and company,to the heroic fields of their putty Elysium (putty, not {189B} Putney) in theirnewly-demonstrated capacity as \"unnatural\" sons, daughters, fathers, and so on.

If the Buddha spokescientifically, not popularly, not rhetorically, then his precepts are not his.We must reject them or we must interpret them. We must inquire: Are they meantto be obeyed?

I shall show that this is so.Let me consider them \"precept upon precept,\" if the introduction of the Hebrewvisionary is not too strong meat for the Little Mary<<A catch word for thestomach, from J.

Go! sift the sands beyond a starless sea!\" Let us consider what the words can mean. The \"Taking of Life\" can only meanthe reduction of living protoplasm to dead matter: or, in a truer and morepsychological sense, the destruction of personality. Now, in the chemical changes involved in Buddha's speaking this command,living protoplasm was changed into dead matter. Or, on the other horn, thefact (insisted upon most strongly by the Buddha himself, the central andcardinal point of his doctrine, the shrine of that Metaphysic which isolates itabsolutely from all other religious metaphysic, which allies it with AgnosticMetaphysic) that the Buddha who had spoken this command was not the same as theBuddha before he had spoken it, lies the proof that the Buddha, by speakingthis command, violated it. More, not only did he slay himself; he breathed inmillions of living organisms and slew them. He could nor eat nor drink norbreathe without murder implicit in each act. Huxley cites the \"pitilessmicroscopist\" who showed a drop of water to the Brahmin who boasted himself\"Ahimsa\" -- harmless. So among the \"rights\" of a Bhikkhu is medicine. He whotakes quinine does so with the deliberate intention of destroying innumerableliving beings; whether this is done by stimulating the phagocytes, or directly,is morally indifferent. How such a fiend incarnate, my dear brother Ananda Maitriya, can call him\"cruel and cowardly\" who only kills a tiger, is a study in the philosophy ofthe mote and the beam!<<The argument that the \"animals are our brothers\" ismerely intended to mislead one who has never been in a Buddhist country.

By no means; in all these ways we bring suffering and death toothers, as to ourselves. But since these are inevitable acts, since suicidewould be a still more cruel alternative (especially in case something shouldsubsist below mere Rupa), the command is not to achieve {192B} the impossible,the already violated in the act of commanding, but a bitter commentary on thefoul evil of this aimless, hopeless universe, this compact of misery, meanness,and cruelty. Let us pass on."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 THE SECOND PRECEPT. The Second Precept is directed against theft. Theft is the appropriation toone's own use of that to which another has a right. Let us see thereforewhether or no the Buddha was a thief. The answer of course is in theaffirmative. For to issue a command is to attempt to deprive another of hismost precious possession -- the right to do as he will; that is, unless, withthe predestinarians, we hold that action is determined absolutely, in whichcase, of course, a command is as absurd as it is unavoidable. Excluding thisfolly, therefore, we may conclude that if the command be obeyed -- and those ofBuddha have gained a far larger share of obedience than those of any otherteacher -- the Enlightened One was not only a potential but an actual thief.Further, all voluntary action limits in some degree, however minute, thevolition of others. If I breathe, I diminish the stock of oxygen available onthe planet. In those far distant ages when Earth shall be as dead as the moonis to-day, my breathing now will have robbed some being then living of thedearest necessity of life. That the theft is minute, incalculably trifling, is no answer to themoralist, to whom degree is not known; nor to the scientist, who sees the chainof nature miss no link. If, on the other hand, the store of energy in the universe be indeedconstant (whether infinite or no), if personality be indeed delusion, thentheft becomes impossible, and to forbid it is absurd. We may argue that evenso temporary theft may exist; and that this is so is to my mind no doubt thecase. All theft is temporary, since even a millionaire must die; also it isuniversal, since even a Buddha must breathe. THE THIRD PRECEPT. This precept, against adultery, I shall touch but lightly. Not that Iconsider the subject unpleasant -- far from it! -- but since the Englishsection of my readers, having unclean minds, will otherwise find a fulcrumtherein for their favourite game of slander. Let it suffice if I say that theBuddha -- in spite of the ridiculous membrane legend,<<Membrum virile illius inmembrana inclusum esse aiunt, ne copulare posset.>> one of those foul follieswhich idiot devotees invent only too freely -- was a confirmed and habitualadulterer. It {193A} would be easy to argue with Hegel-Huxley that he whothinks of an act commits it (\"cf.\" Jesus also in this connection, though heonly knows the creative value of desire), and that since A and not-A aremutually limiting, therefore interdependent, therefore identical, he whoforbids an act commits it; but I feel that this is no place for metaphysicalhair-splitting; let us prove what we have to prove in the plainest way. I would premise in the first place that to commit adultery in the divorceCourt sense is not here in question."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 It assumes too much proprietary right of a man over a woman, that root ofall abomination! -- the whole machinery of inheritance, property, and all thelabyrinth of law. We may more readily suppose that the Buddha was (apparently at least)condemning incontinence. We know that Buddha had abandoned his home; true, but Nature has to bereckoned with. Volition is no necessary condition of offence. \"I didn't meanto\" is a poor excuse for an officer failing to obey an order. Enough of this -- in any case a minor question; since even on the lowestmoral grounds -- and we, I trust, soar higher! -- the error in question may beresolved into a mixture of murder, theft, and intoxication. (We consider thelast under the Fifth Precept.) THE FOURTH PRECEPT. Here we come to what in a way is the fundamental joke of these precepts. Acommand is not a lie, of course; possibly cannot be; yet surely an allegoricalorder is one in essence, and I have no longer a shadow of a doubt that theseso-called \"precepts\" are a species of savage practical joke. Apart from this there can hardly be much doubt, when critical exegesis hasdone its damnedest on the Logia of our Lord, that Buddha did at some timecommit himself to some statement. \"(Something called) Consciousness exists\"is, said Huxley, the irreducible minimum of the pseudo-syllogism, false evenfor an enthymeme, \"Cogito, ergo sum!\" This proposition he bolsters up bystating that whoso should pretend to doubt it, would thereby but confirm it.Yet might it not be said \"(something called) Consciousness appears to itself toexist,\" since Consciousness is itself the only witness to that confirmation?Not that even now we can deny some kind of existence to consciousness, but thatit should be a more real existence than that of a reflection is doubtful,incredible, even inconceivable. If by consciousness we mean the normalconsciousness, it is definitely untrue, since the {193B} Dhyanic consciousnessincludes it and denies it. No doubt \"something called\" acts as a kind ofcaveat to the would-be sceptic, though the phrase is bad, implying a \"calling.\"But we can guess what Huxley means. No doubt Buddha's scepticism does not openly go quite as far as mine -- itmust be remembered that \"scepticism\" is merely the indication of a possibleattitude, not a belief, as so many good fool folk think; but Buiddha not onlydenies \"Cogito, ergo sum\"; but \"Cogito, ergo non sum.\" See \"Sabbasava Sutta.\"par. 10.<<Quoted below, \"Science and Buddhism,\" note.>> At any rate Sakkyaditthi, the delusion of personality, is in the veryforefront of his doctrines; and it is this delusion that is constantly andinevitably affirmed in all normal consciousness.

L'Alcool est un poison!and Buvez de l'Alcool! L'Alccol est un aliment!We know now that alcohol is a food up to a certain amount; the precept, goodenough for a rough rule as it stands, will not bear close inspection. WhatBuddha really commands, with that grim humour of his, is: Avoid Intoxication. But what is intoxication? unless it be the loss of power to use perfectly atruth-telling set of faculties. If I walk unsteadily it is owing to nervouslies -- and so for all the phenomena of drunkenness. But a lie involves theassumption {194A} of some true standard, and this can nowhere be found. Adoctor would tell you, moreover, that all food intoxicates: all, here as in allthe universe, of every subject and in every predicate, is a matter of degree. Our faculties never tell us true; our eyes say flat when our fingers sayround; our tongue sends a set of impression to our brain which our hearingdeclares non-existent -- and so on. What is this delusion of personality but a profound and centrally-seatedintoxication of the consciousness? I am intoxicated as I address these words;you are drunk -- beastly drunk! -- as you read them; Buddha was as drunk as aBritish officer when he uttered his besotted command. There, my dear children,is the conclusion to which we are brought if you insist that he was serious! I answer No! Alone among men then living, the Buddha was sober, and sawTruth.

To a collection of MSS. illustrating the \"Psychopathia Sexualis\" of vonKraft-Ebling. The names of the parties have been changed.>> In the fevered days and nights under the Empire that perished in thestruggle of 1870, {195A} that whirling tumult of pleasure, scheming, success,and despair, the minds of men had a trying ordeal to pass through. In Zola's\"La Curee\" we see how such ordinary and natural characters as those of Saccard,Maxime, and the incestuous heroine, were twisted and distorted from theirnormal sanity, and sent whirling into the jaws of a hell far more affryant thanthe mere cheap and nasty brimstone Sheol which is the Shibboleth for thedissenter, and with which all classes of religious humbug, from the Pope to theSalvation ranter, from the Mormon and the Jesuit to that mongrel mixture of theworst features of both, the Plymouth Brother, have scared their illiterate,since hypocrisy was born, with Abel, and spiritual tyranny, with Jehovah!Society, in the long run, is eminently sane and practical; under the SecondEmpire it ran mad. If these things are done in the green tree of Society, whatshall be done in the dry tree of Bohemianism? Art always has a suspicion tofight against; always some poor mad Max Nordau is handy to call everythingoutside the kitchen the asylum. Here, however, there is a substratum of truth.Consider the intolerable long roll of names, all tainted with glorious madness.Baudelaire the diabolist, debauchee of sadism, whose dreams are nightmares, andwhose waking hours delirium; Rollinat the necrophile, the poet of phthisis, theanxiomaniac; Peladan, the high priest -- of nonsense; Medes, frivolous andscoffing sensualist; besides a host of others, most alike in this, that, belowthe cloak of madness and depravity, the true heart of genius burns. No moreterrible period than this is to be found in literature; so many great minds, ofwhich hardly one comes to fruition; such seeds of genius, such a harvest of --whirlwind! Even a barren waste of sea is less saddening that one strewn withwreckage. In England such wild song found few followers of any worth or melody.Swinburne stands on his solitary pedestal above the vulgar crowds of priapisticplagiarists; he alone caught the fierce frenzy of Baudelaire's brandiedshrieks, and his First Series of Poems and Ballads was the legitimate echo of"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66that not fierier note. But English Art as a whole was unmoved, at any rate notstirred to any depth, by this wave of debauchery. The great thinkersmaintained the even keel, and the windy waters lay not for their frailer barksto cross. There is one exception of note, till this day unsuspected, in theperson of George Archibald Bishop. In a corner of Paris this young poet (forin his nature the flower of poesy did spring, did even take root and give somepromise of a brighter bloom, till stricken and blasted in later years by thelightning of his own sins) was steadily writing day after day, night after{195B} night, often working forty hours at a time, work which he destined toentrance the world. All England should ring with his praises; by-and-by thewhole world should know his name. Of these works none of the longer and moreambitious remains. How they were lost, and how those fragments we possess weresaved, is best told by relating the romantic and almost incredible story of hislife. The known facts of this life are few, vague, and unsatisfactory; the moredefinite statements lack corroboration, and almost the only source at thedisposal of the biographer is the letters of Mathilde Doriac to Mdme. J. S.,who has kindly placed her portfolio at my service. A letter dated October 15,1866, indicates that our author was born on the 23rd of that month. The fatherand mother of George were, at least on the surface, of an extraordinaryreligious turn of mind. Mathilde's version of the story, which has its sourcein our friend himself, agrees almost word for word with a letter of the Rev.Edw. Turle to Mrs. Cope, recommending the child to her care. The substance ofthe story is as follows. The parents of George carried their religious ideas to the point of neverconsummating their marriage!<<Will it be believed that a clergyman (turnedPlymouth Brother and schoolmaster) actually made an identical confession to aboy of ten years old?>> This arrangement does not seem to have been greatlyappreciated by the wife; at least one fine morning she was found to beenceinte. The foolish father never thought of the hypothesis which commendsitself most readily to a man of the world, not to say a man of science, andadopted that of a second Messiah! He took the utmost pains to conceal thebirth of the child, treated everybody who came to the house as an emissary ofHerod, and finally made up his mind to flee into Egypt! Like most religiousmaniacs, he never had an idea of his own, but distorted the beautiful andedifying events of the Bible into insane and ridiculous ones, which heproceeded to plagiarise. On the voyage out the virgin mother became enamoured, as was her wont, ofthe nearest male, in this case a fellow-traveller. He, being well able tosupport her in the luxury which she desired, easily persuaded her to leave theboat with him by stealth. A small sailing vessel conveyed them to Malta, wherethey disappeared. The only trace left in the books of earth records that thisfascinating character was accused, four years later, in Vienna, of poisoningher paramour, but thanks to the wealth and influence of her newer lover, sheescaped."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 The legal father, left by himself with a squalling child to amuse, toappease in his tantrums, {196A} and to bring up in the nurture and admonitionof the Lord, was not a little perplexed by the sudden disappearance of hiswife. At first he supposed that she had been translated, but, finding that shehad not left the traditional mantle behind her, he abandoned this suppositionin favour of quite a different, and indeed a more plausible one. He nowbelieved her to be the scarlet woman in the Apocalypse, with variations. Onarrival in Egypt he hired an old native nurse, and sailed for Odessa. Once inRussia he could find Gog and Magog, and present to them the child asAntichrist. For he was now persuaded that he himself was the First Beast, andwould ask the sceptic to count his seven heads and ten horns. The heads,however, rarely totted up accurately! At this point the accounts of Mr. Turle and Mathilde diverge slightly. Thecleric affirms that he was induced by a Tartar lady, of an honourable andancient profession, to accompany her to Tibet \"to be initiated into themysteries.\" He was, of course, robbed and murdered with due punctuality, inthe town of Kiev. Mathilde's story is that he travelled to Kiev on theoriginal quest, and died of typhoid or cholera. In any case, he died at Kievin 1839. This fixes the date of the child's birth at 1837. His faithful nurseconveyed him safely to England, where his relatives provided for hismaintenance and education. With the close of this romantic chapter in his early history we lose allreliable traces for some years. One flash alone illumines the darkness of hisboyhood; in 1853, after being prepared for confirmation, he cried out in fullassembly, instead of kneeling to receive the blessing of the officiatingbishop, \"I renounce for ever this idolatrous church;\" and was quietly removed. He told Mathilde Doriac that he had been to Eton and Cambridge -- neitherinstitution, however, preserves any record of such admission. The imaginationof George, indeed, is tremendously fertile with regard to events in his ownlife. His own story is that he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1856,and was sent down two years later for an article which he had contributed tosome University or College Magazine. No confirmation of any sort is to befound anywhere with regard to these or any other statements of our author.There is however, no doubt that in 1861 he quarrelled with his family; wentover to Paris, where he settled down, at first, like every tufthead, somewherein the Quarter Latin; later, with Mathilde Doriac, the noble woman who becamehis mistress and held to him through all the terrible tragedy of his moral,mental, and physical life, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere. At his housethere the rightful scene {196B} of '68 took place, and it was there too that hewas apprehended after the murders which he describes so faithfully in\"Abysmos.\" He had just finished this poem with a shriek of triumph, and hadread it through to the appalled Mathilde \"avec des yeux de flamme et de gestesincoherentes,\" when foaming at the mouth, and \"hurlant de blasphemesindicibles,\" he fell upon her with extraordinary violence of passion; the dooropened, officers appeared, the arrest was effected. He was committed to anasylum, for there could be no longer any doubt of his complete insanity; for"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68three weeks he had been raving with absinthe and satyriasis. He survived hisconfinement no long time; the burning of the asylum with its inmates was one ofthe most terrible events of the war of 1870. So died one of the most talentedEnglishmen of his century, a man who for wide knowledge of men and things wastruly to be envied, yet one who sold his birthright for a mess of bestlierpottage than ever Esau guzzled, who sold soul and body to Satan for sheer loveof sin, whose mere lust of perversion is so intense that it seems to absorbevery other emotion and interest. Never since God woke light from chaos hassuch a tragedy been unrolled before men, step after step toward the lake ofFire! At his house all his writings were seized, and, it is believed, destroyed.The single most fortunate exception is that of a superbly jewelled writing-case, now in the possession of the present editor, in which were found the MSS.which are here published. Mathilde, who knew how he treasured its contents,preserved it by saying to the officer, \"But, sir, that is mine.\" On openingthis it was found to contain, besides these MSS., his literary will. All MSS.were to be published thirty years after his death, not before. He would gainno spurious popularity as a reflection of the age he lived in. \"Tennyson,\" hesays, \"will die before sixty years are gone by: if I am to be beloved of men,it shall be because my work is for all times and all men, because it is greaterthan all the gods of chance and change, because it has the heart of the humanrace beating in every line.\" This is a patch of magenta to mauve, undoubtedly;but -- ! The present collection of verses will hardly be popular; if the lostworks turn up, of course it may be that there may be found \"shelter for songsthat recede.\" Still, even here, one is, on the whole, more attracted thanrepelled; the author has enormous power, and he never scruples to use it, todrive us half mad with horror, or, as in his earlier most exquisite works, tomove us to the noblest thoughts and deeds. True, his debt to contemporarywriters is a little obvious here and there; but these {197A} are smallblemishes on a series of poems whose originality is always striking, and oftendreadful, in its broader features. We cannot leave George Bishop without a word of inquiry as to what became ofthe heroic figure of Mathilde Doriac. It is a bitter task to have to write incold blood the dreadful truth about her death. She had the misfortune tocontract, in the last few days of her life with him, the same terrible diseasewhich he describes in the last poem of his collection. This shock, coming sosoon after, and, as it were, as an unholy perpetual reminder of the madness andsequestration of her lover, no less than of his infidelity, unhinged her mind,and she shot herself on July 5, 1869. Her last letter to Madame J-- S-- is oneof the tenderest and most pathetic ever written. She seems to have been reallyloved by George, in his wild, infidel fashion: \"All Night\" and \"Victory,\" amongothers, are obviously inspired by her beauty; and her devotion to him, theabasement of soul, the prostitution of body, she underwent for and with him, isone of the noblest stories life has known. She seems to have dived with him,yet ever trying to raise his soul from the quagmire; if God is just at all, she"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69shall stand more near to His right hand than the vaunted virgins who would soilno hem of vesture to save their brother from the worm that dieth not!

The \"raison d'etre,\" though, oftheir publication, is worthy of especial notice. I refer to theirpsychological sequence, which agrees with their chronological order. His life-history, as well as his literary remains, gives us an idea of the progressionof diabolism as it really is; not as it is painted. Note also, (1) theincrease of selfishness in pleasure, (2) the diminution of his sensibility tophysical charms. Pure and sane is his early work; then he is carried into theouter current of the great vortex of Sin, and whirls lazily through the sleepywaters of mere sensualism; the pace quickens, he grows fierce in the mysteriesof Sapphism and the cult of Venus Aversa with women; later of the same forms ofvice with men, all mingled with wild talk of religious dogma and a generalexaltation of Priapism at the expense, in particular, of Christianity, in whichreligion, however, he is undoubtedly a believer till the last (the pious willquote James ii. 19, and the infidel will observe that he died in an asylum);then the full swing of the tide catches him, the mysteries of death become moreand more an obsession, and he is flung headlong into Sadism, Necrophilia,{197B} all the maddest, fiercest vices that the mind of fiends ever brought upfrom the pit. But always to the very end his power is unexhausted, immense,terrible. His delirium does not amuse; it appals! A man who could conceive ashe did must himself have had some glorious chord in his heart vibrating to theeternal principle of Boundless Love. That this love was wrecked is for me, insome sort a relative of his, a real and bitter sorrow. He might have been sogreat! He missed Heaven!

The design of an elaborate parody on {200B} Browning tobe called \"Ascension Day and Pentecost\" was conceived (and resolved upon) onFriday, November 15, 1901. On that day I left Ceylon, where I had been forseveral months, practising Hindu meditations, and exposing the dishonesty ofthe Missionaries, in the intervals of big game shooting. The following day Iwrote \"Ascension Day,\" and \"Pentecost\" on the Sunday, sitting outside the dak-bangla at Madura. These original drafts were small as compared to the presentpoems. Ascension Day consisted of: -- p. 144, I flung ... p. 146, Pray do ... p. 147, \"But who ... p. 149, Here's just ... p. 151, I will ... to p. 160, ... but in Hell! ... p. 161, You see ..."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 to end. Pentecost consisted of: -- p. 164, To-day ... p. 168, How very hard ... to p. 170, \"Proceed!\" ... p. 171, My wandering thoughts ... to p. 172, All-wickedness ... p. 172, Nor lull my soul ... to p. 174, ... and the vision. p. 176, How easy ... to end. \"Berashith\" was written at Delhi, March 20 and 21, 1902. Its original titlewas \"Crowleymas Day.\" It was issued privately in Paris in January 1903. Itand \"Science and Buddhism\" are added to complete the logical sequence from 1898till now. All, however, has been repeatedly revised. Wherever there seemed alacuna in the argument an insertion was made, till all appeared a perfectchrysolite. Most of this was done, while the weary hours of the summer (savethe mark!) of 1902 rolled over Camp Misery and Camp Despair on the Chogo RiGlacier, in those rare intervals when one's preoccupation with lice, tinnedfood, malaria, insoaking water, general soreness, mental misery, and theeverlasting snowstorm gave place to a momentary glimmer of any higher form ofintelligence than that ever necessarily concentrated on the actual business ofcamp life. The rest, and the final revision, occupied a good deal of my timeduring the winter of 1902-1903. The MS. was accepted by the S. P. R.

It took a long time, too, for the missionaries (and TommyAtkins) to discover that \"Budd\" was not a \"great Gawd.\" But then they did notwant to, and in any case sympathy and intelligence are not precisely the mostsalient qualities in either soldiers or missionaries. But nothing is moreabsurd than to compare men like Sir W. Jones, Sir R. Burton, Von Hammer-Purgstall, Sir E. Arnold, Prof. Max Muller, Me, Prof. Rhys Davids, Lane, andthe rest of our illustrious Orientalists to the poor {201B} and ignorant Hinduswhose letters occasionally delight the readers of the \"Sporting Times,\" suchletters being usually written by public scribes for a few pice in the nativebazaar. As to \"Babus\" (Babu, I may mention, is the equivalent to our \"Mister,\"and not the name of a savage tribe), Mr. Chesterton, from his BrixtonBrahmaloka, may look forth and see that the \"Babu\" cannot understand Westernideas; but a distinguished civil servant in the Madras Presidency, secondwrangler in a very good year, assured me that he had met a native whosemathematical knowledge was superior to that of the average senior wrangler, andthat he had met several others who approached that standard. His specificattack on Madame Blavatsky is equally unjust, as many natives, nottheosophists, have spoken to me of her in the highest terms. \"Honest Hindus\"cannot be expected to think as Mr. Chrsterton deems likely, as he isunfortunately himself a Western, and in the same quagmire of misapprehension asProf. Max. Muller and the rest. Madame Blavatsky's work was to remind theHindus of the excellence of their own shastras,<<Sacred Books.>> to show thatsome Westerns held identical ideas, and thus to countermine the dishonestrepresentations of the missionaries. I am sufficiently well known as a bitteropponent of \"Theosophy\" to risk nothing in making these remarks."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79 I trust that the sense of public duty which inspires these strictures willnot be taken as incompatible with the gratitude I owe to him for hisexceedingly sympathetic and dispassionate review of my \"Soul of Osiris.\" I would counsel him, however, to leave alone the Brixton Chapel, and to\"work up from his appreciation of the 'Soul of Osiris' to that loftier andwider work of the human imagination, the appreciation of the 'Sporting Times!'\" ----- Mr. Chesterton thinks it funny that I should call upon \"Shu.\" Has heforgotten that the Christian God may be most suitably invoked by the name\"Yah\"? I should be sorry if God were to mistake his religious enthusiasms forthe derisive ribaldry of the London \"gamin.\" Similar remarks apply to \"El\" andother Hebrai-christian deities. This note is hardly intelligible without the review referred to. Itherefore reprint the {202A} portion thereof which is germane to my matter fromthe \"Daily News,\" June 18, 1901: -- To the side of a mind concerned with idle merriment (\"sic!\") there iscertainly something a little funny in Mr. Crowley's passionate devotion todeities who bear such names as Mout and Nuit, and Ra and Shu, and Hormakhou.They do not seem to the English mind to lend themselves to pious exhilaration.Mr. Crowley says in the same poem: The burden is too hard to bear, I took too adamant a cross; This sackcloth rends my soul to wear, My self-denial is as dross. O, Shu, that holdest up the sky, Hold up thy servant, lest he die!We have all possible respect for Mr. Crowley's religious symbols, and we do notobject to his calling upon Shu at any hour of the night. Only it would beunreasonable of him to complain if his religious exercises were generallymistaken for an effort to drive away cats. ----- Moreover, the poets of Mr. Crowley's school have, among all their merits,some genuine intellectual dangers from this tendency to import religious, thisfree trade in gods. That all creeds are significant and all gods divine wewillingly agree. But this is rather a reason for being content with our ownthan for attempting to steal other people's. The affectation in many modernmystics of adopting an Oriental civilisation and mode of thought must causemuch harmless merriment among the actual Orientals. The notion that a turbanand a few vows will make an Englishman a Hindu is quite on a par with the idea"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80that a black hat and an Oxford degree will make a Hindu an Englishman. Wewonder whether our Buddhistic philosophers have ever read a florid letter inBaboo English. We suspect that the said type of document is in realityexceedingly like the philosophic essays written by Englishmen about thesplendour of Eastern thought. Sometimes European mystics deserve somethingworse than mere laughter at the hands (\"sic!\") of Orientals. If ever was oneperson whom honest Hindus would have been justified in tearing to pieces it wasMadame Blavatsky.  ----- That our world-worn men of art should believe for a moment that moralsalvation is possible and supremely important is an unmixed benefit. But tobelieve for a moment that it is to be found by going to particular places orreading particular books or joining particular societies is to make for thethousandth time the mistake that is at once materialism and superstition. IfMr. Crowley and the new mystics think for one moment that an Egyptian desert ismore mystic than an English meadow, that a palm tree is more peetic than aSussex beech, that a broken temple of Osiris is more supernatural than aBaptist chapel in Brixton, then they {202B} are sectarians, and only sectariansof no more value to humanity that those who think that the English soil is theonly soil worth defending, and the Baptist chapel the only chapel worthy ofworship (\"sic\"). But Mr. Crowley is a strong and genuine poet, and we havelittle doubt that he will work up from his appreciation of the Temple of Osiristo that loftier and wider work of the human imagination, the appreciation ofthe Brixton chapel.

Truly, since our childhoodhas ingrained into us not only literal belief in the Bible, but alsosubstantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah,<<\"A Thousand and One Nights,commonly called \"Arabian Nights.\">> and only adolescence can cure us, we areonly too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughlyand rashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, asinteresting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and asnothing more. Even when we learn that the Bible, by a {203A} profound and minute study ofthe text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope andimportance, we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to thecompanion volume, even if we are the lucky holders of Burton's veritableedition. To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its properplace once more."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all \"magical\" phenomena;if they are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts ofdaily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of\"some\" cause.<<This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess,pushed to its extreme, against the Advaitist theories. -- A.C.>> Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing aspirit in the triangle of Art? Every smatterer, ever expert in psychology, will answer: \"That cause lies inyour brain.\" English children are taught (\"pace\" the Education Act) that the Universelies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is the same thing. Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that thephenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studyingunder Hindu Gurus, are {203B} told, that by Akasa is meant the Chitakasa. TheChitakasa is situated in the \"Third Eye,\" \"i.e.,\" in the brain. By assuminghigher dimensions of space, we can assimilate this fact to Realism; but we haveno need to take so much trouble. This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions aredependent on changes in the brain,<<Thought is a secretion of the brain(Weissmann). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley). -- A.C.>> wemust include illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as\"realities\" are, in the class of \"phenomena dependent on brain-changes.\" Magical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class, since they arewilled, and their cause is the series of \"real\" phenomena called the operationsof ceremonial Magic. These consist of (1) Sight. The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, implements, etc. (2) Sound. The invocations. (3) Smell. The perfumes. (4) Taste. The Sacraments. (5) Touch. As under (1). (6) Mind. The combination of all these and reflection on their significance. These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence theirsummary (6) is of unusual kind.

But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained,and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances? Say youso? I can, and will. The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's {204A} projected cube)methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye). The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: (\"a\") General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions relative tothe subtle world.) (\"b\") Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.) (\"c\") Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend tocontrol a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of thealphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit's name. I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; theintelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. If, then, I say, with Solomon: \"The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,\" what I mean is: \"Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may bestimulated and developed by following out the processes called 'The invocationof Cimieries.'\" And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent ofany objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science canonly suspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical investigation of thefacts alleged. Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1)obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices ofnature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these fivepowers at random; considerations of space forbid me to explain all. (1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. (2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrastbetween the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals.

Insidious cuckoo! Ungrateful Banyan! My shame drives me to Semiticanalogy, and I sadly reflect that if I had been Balaam, I should not haveneeded an ass other than myself to tell me to do the precise contrary of whatis expected of me. For this is my position; while the postulates of Agnosticism are in onesense eternal, I believe that the conclusions of Agnosticism are daily to bepushed back. We know our ignorance; with that fact we are twitted by those whodo not know enough to understand {206B} even what we mean when we say so; butthe limits of knowledge, slowly receding, yet never so far as to permit us tounveil the awful and impenetrable adytum of consciousness, or that of matter,must one day be suddenly widened by the forging of a new weapon. Huxley and Tyndall have prophesied this before I was born; sometimes invague language, once or twice clearly enough; to me it is a source of theutmost concern that their successors should not always see eye to eye with themin this respect. Professor Ray Lankester, in crushing the unhappy theists of the recent\"Times\" controversy, does not hesitate to say that Science \"can never\" throwany light on certain mysteries. Even the theist is justified in retorting that Science, if this be so, mayas well be discarded; for these are problems which must ever intrude upon thehuman mind -- upon the mind of the scientist most of all. To dismiss them by an act of will is at once heroic and puerile: courage isas necessary to progress as any quality that we possess; and as courage is ineither case required, the courage of ignorance (necessarily sterile, thoughwanted badly enough while our garden was choked by theological weeds) is lessdesirable than the courage which embarks on the always desperate philosophicalproblem. Time and again, in the history of Science, a period has arrived when, gorgedwith facts, she has sunk into a lethargy of reflection accompanied by appallingnightmares in the shape of impossible theories. Such a nightmare now rides us;once again philosophy has said its last word, and arrived at a deadlock.Aristotle, in reducing to the fundamental contradictions-in-terms which theyinvolved the figments of the Pythagoreans, the Eleatics, the Platonists, thePyrrhonists; Kant, in his \"reductio at absurdum\" of the Thomists, the Scotists,the Wolffians, -- all the warring brood, alike only in the inability toreconcile the ultimate antinomies of a cosmogony only grosser for its pinchbeckspirituality; have, I take it, found their modern parallel in the ghastlylaughter of Herbert Spencer, as fleshed upon the corpses of Berkeley and theIdealists from Fichte and Hartmann to Lotze and Trendelenburg he drives thereeking fangs of his imagination into the palpitating vitals of his own grimmasterpiece of reconcilement, self-deluded and yet self-conscious of its owndelusion. History affirms that such a deadlock is invariably the prelude to a newenglightenment: by such steps we have advanced, by such we shall advance. The\"horror of great darkness\" which is scepticism must ever by broken by someheroic master-soul, intolerant of the cosmic agony. {207A}"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 We than await his dawn. May I go one step further, and lift up my voice and prophesy? I wouldindicate the direction in which this darkness must break. Evolutionists willremember that nature cannot rest. Nor can society. Still less the brain ofman. \"Audax omnia perpeti Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.\"<<Horace, \"Odes,\" I. 3.>> We have destroyed the meaning of vetitum nefas and are in no fear of animaginary cohort of ills and terrors. Having perfected one weapon, reason, andfound it destructive to all falsehood, we have been (some of us) a little aptto go out to fight with no other weapon. \"FitzJames's blade was sword andshield,\"<<Scott, \"The Lady of the Lake.\">> and that served him against themurderous bludgeon-sword of the ruffianly Highlander he happened to meet; buthe would have fared ill had he called a Western Sheriff a liar, or gone offBoer-sticking on Spion Kop. Reason has done its utmost; theory has glutted us, and the motion of theship is a little trying; mixed metaphor -- excellent in a short essay like this-- is no panacea for all mental infirmities; we must seek another guide. Allthe facts science has so busily collected, varied as they seem to be, are inreality all of the same kind. If we are to have one salient fact, a fact for areal advance, it must be a fact of a different \"order.\" Have we such a fact to hand? We have. First, what do we mean by a fact of a different order? Let me take anexample; the most impossible being the best for our purpose. TheSpiritualists, let us suppose, go mad and begin to talk sense. (I can onlyimagine that such would be the result.) All their \"facts\" are proved. Weprove a world of spirits, the existence of God, the immortality of the soul,etc. But, with all that, we are not really one step advanced into the heart ofthe inquiry which lies at the heart of philosophy, \"What 'is' anything?\" I see a cat. Dr. Johnson says it is a cat. Berkeley says it is a group of sensations. Cankaracharya says it is an illusion, an incarnation, or God, according tothe hat he has got on, and is talking through. Spencer says it is a mode of the unknowable. But none of them seriously doubt the fact that I exist; that a cat exists;that one sees the other. All -- bar Johnson -- hint -- but oh! how dimly! --at what I now know to be -- \"true!\" -- no, not necessarily true, but \"nearerthe truth.\" Huxley goes deeper in his demolition of Descartes. With him, \"Isee a cat,\" proves \"something {207B} called consciousness exists.\" He deniesthe assertion of duality; he has no datum to assert the denial of duality. Ihave. Consciousness, as we know it, has one essential quality: the opposition ofsubject and object. Reason has attacked this and secured that complete and andbarren victory of convincing without producing conviction.<<Hume, and Kant inthe \"Prolegomena,\" discuss this phenomenon unsatisfactorily. -- A.C.>> It has"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90one quality apparently not essential, that of exceeding impermanence. If weexamine what we call steady thought, we shall find that its rate of change isin reality inconceivably swift. To consider it, to watch it, is bewildering,and to some people becomes intensely terrifying. It is as if the solid earthwere suddenly swept away from under one, and there were some dread awakening inouter space amid the rush of incessant meteors -- lost in the void. All this is old knowledge; but who has taken steps to alter it? The answeris forbidding: truth compels me to say, the mystics of all lands. Their endeavour has been to slow the rate of change; their methods perfectquietude of body and mind, produced in varied and too often vicious ways.Regularisation of the breathing is the best known formula. Their results arecontemptible, we must admit; but only so because empirical. An unwarrantedreverence has overlaid the watchfulness which science would have enjoined, andthe result is muck and misery, the wreck of a noble study. But what is the one fact on which all agree? The one fact whose knowledgehas been since religion began the all-sufficient passport to their doubtfully-desirable company? This: that \"I see a cat\" is not only an unwarrantable assumption but a lie;that the duality of consciousness ceases suddenly, once the rate of change hasbeen sufficiently slowed down, so that, even for a few seconds, the relation ofsubject and object remains impregnable. It is a circumstance of little interest to the present essayist that thisannihilation of duality is associated with intense and passionless peace anddelight; the fact has been a bribe to the unwary, a bait for the charlatan, ahindrance to the philosopher; let us discard it.<<It is this rapture which hasever been the bond between mystics of all shades; and the obstacle to anyaccurate observation of the phenomenon, its true causes, and so on. This mustalways be a stumbling-block to more impressionable minds; but there is no doubtas to the fact -- it \"is\" a fact -- and its present isolation is to be utterlydeplored. May I entreat men of Science to conquer the prejudices natural tothem when the justly despised ideas of mysticism are mentioned, and to attackthe problem \"ab initio\" on the severely critical and austerely arduous lineswhich have distinguished their labours in other fields? -- A.

But that a field for research is opened up no sane man may doubt. Nor mayone question that the very first fact is of a nature disruptive of difficultyphilosophical and reasonable; since the phenomenon does not invoke the assentof the reasoning faculty. The arguments which reason may bring to bear againstit are self-destructive; reason has given consciousness the lie, butconsciousness survives and smiles.

Know or doubt! is thealternative of highwayman Huxley! \"Believe\" is not to be admitted; this isfundamental; in this agnosticism can never change; this must ever command ourmoral as our intellectual assent. But I assert my strong conviction that ere long we shall have done enough ofwhat is after all the schoolmaster work of correcting the inky and ill- spentexercises of the theological dunces in that great class-room, the world; andfound a little peace -- while they play -- in the intimate solitude of thelaboratory and the passionless rapture of research -- research into those verymysteries which our dunces have solved by rule of thumb; determining the natureof a bee by stamping on it, and shouting \"bee\"; while we patiently set to workwith microscopes, and say nothing till we know, nor more than need be when wedo.

Are thesemiracles less or greater than those of the Gospels?

But I knew not that it was theLord. In Australia they were praying for rain in the churches. The \"SydneyBulletin\" very sensibly pointed out how much more reverent and practical itwould be, if, instead of constantly worrying the Almighty about trifles, theywould pray once and for all for a big range of mountains in Central Australia,which would of course supply rain automatically. No new act of creation wouldbe necessary; faith, we are expressly told, can remove mountains, and there isice and snow and especially moraine on and about the Baltoro Glacier to build avery fine range; we could well have spared it this last summer. 579. \"So much for this absurd affair.\"{#52} -- \"About Lieutenant-ColonelFlare.\" -- Gilbert, \"Bab Ballads.\" 636. \"Auto-hypnosis.{#53} -- The scientific adversary has more sense than totalk of autohypnosis.

But if the Alpine Club should seek To follow him on pass or peak -- (Their cowardice, their mental rot, Are balanced nicely -- they will not.) -- I see the Alpine Journal's border Of black grow broader, broader, broader, Until the Editor himself Falls from some broad and easy shelf, And in his death the Journal dies. Ah! bombast, footle, simple lies! Where would you then appear in type?The Poet \"retires up.\" His attitude undignified, his pleasure momentary, the after result quite disproportionate. He contemplates his end.\" Therefore poor Crowley lights his pipe, Maintains: \"The small-shot kills the snipe, But spares the tiger;\" goes on joking, And goes on smirking, on invoking, On climbing, meditating, -- failing to think of a suitable rhyme at a critical juncture, Ah! -- goes on working, goes on smoking, Until he goes right on to Woking."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 637. \"No one suppose me a Saint.\"{#54} -- On inquiry, however, I find thatsome do. 638. \"Amrita.\"{#55} -- The Elixir of Life: the Dew of Immortality. {210B} 688. \"Christ.\"{#56} -- See Shri Parananda, \"Commentaries on Matthew andJohn.\" 695. \"Direction x.\"{#57} -- \"Vide supra,\" \"Ascension Day.\" 710. \"Steel-tired.\"{#58} -- For Dunlop<<WEHNOTE: Maker of automobile rubber tires and inner-tubes.>> people did not know Those nineteen hundred years ago. 723. \"Super-consciousness.\"{#59} -- The Christians also claim an ecstasy.But they all admit, and indeed boast, that it is the result of long periods ofworry and anxiety about the safety of their precious souls: therefore theirecstasy is clearly a diseased process. The Yogic ecstasy requires absolutecalm and health of mind and body. It is useless and dangerous under otherconditions even to begin the most elementary practices. 742. \"My Eastern friend.\"{#69} -- Abdul Hamid, of the Fort, Colombo, on whombe peace. {211A} 755. \"Heart.\"{#61} -- Heart is a trifling misquotation: This poem is for publication. 810. \"Mind the dark doorway there!\"{#62} -- This, like so many other(perhaps all) lines in these poems, is pregnant with a host of hidden meanings.Not only is it physical, of saying good-bye to a friend: but mental, of thedarkness of metaphysics; occult, of the mystical darkness of the Threshold ofInitiation; and physiological, containing allusions to a whole group ofphenomena, which those who have begun meditation will rocognise. Similarly, a single word may be a mnemonic key to an entire line ofphilosophical argument. If the reader chooses, in short, he will find the entire mass of InitiatedWisdom between the covers of this unpretending volume. {211B}"}]
