I like that word `moot'. But, as we shall see later, Sir Roger himself was notof prime importance, even to himself; for he was not himself. Hush! I'll explain it all later. I mustbegin like this if I'm to be properly mysterious, which, as I am Custos of the Illuminati, the Deviland Adam Weishaupt know I ought to be.

He was born in rebel Cork, and his firstcry was interpreted by his father as ``To hell with the bloody English!'' It's a durthy lie; he wasborn in the very centre of England, just over the way from Stratford, at a Spa on the Leam. Hismother was a Bishop, which is a corruption of Episkopos, for she traced her ancestry to a Greek,who had come to Cornwall with the Phoenicians to get tin; and that Greek was of Egyptian stock.I think Pythagoras had a thumb in the pie somewhere, for Episkopos is a corruption of Hapi-Sebek, so that there was honest crocodile blood and Nile water in the family. And the Nile is thedaughter of the Mountains by the Moon; and both these are Chinese, for their names are given byFohi in his trigrams; so that was where Sir Roger got his Mongolian appearance. The motherbloodwas very strong in that race; the boy looked just as much a girl as any colleen, and had thefascinating ways of a wench from his cradle.As to the Bloxam side of the family, it was Greek also. Bloxam is plainly Floxam from Phlogs, aflame; whence, oh my lissome ones, we know that his great ancestor was the Sun. I have no timeto tell you about fulgur, and flagellum; for I must whisper just one word of woe: Bloxam was nothis name at all. Not his name, at all, at all, at all. No, sir! It is only the echo of the name of hisname. His real name is a terrible secret, gay, porcine, choral, charitable, stiff, brilliant, dancing,horrific, ghrshu, ghrshoi (as Rabindranath Tagore would say) a brush name, a name like ahedgehog, a bristling name, a starry name, the secret title of the Master of all the Druids, a nameso stupendous, tremendous, venerable and reverend, so unspeakable, unutterable, ineffable,incommunicable, indicible and aphasic that I have written it all over this book in characters solarge that I hope it may escape observation. By the hand of Fatma, what a chapter! Butgenealogies are always the devil; even Saint Paul found it made trouble for the early Christians.However, be done with it! On to the Characteristic Incidents of Infancy. I can't do these; for onething, I can't remember. But I'll steal all the Dionysus and Hercules thunder, and that of any otherFamous Infants; and I'll fake the chapter somehow to look respectable enough.

But it may not be! Our hero -- even our echo-hero, Sir Roger Bloxam -- must be made sympathetic, interesting, vital. And he does not evenexist so far; at least I've never let the reader get a glimpse of him. Yet it is he that makes memerry; and God help the men and women that cross the path of Astarte Lulu Panthea Crowley,beginning in about 1935, Era Vulgari. The truth is this; it is a very serious matter to get your heroon to the stage; for you have to do that for him; once there he'll start like a fighting-cock, if he'sof the right stuff; but who'll break the champagne over the bows of my battleship? There's theD'Artagnan way of coming on, me father's sword, letter to the Captain of the Guard, no money;then a thwacking of a duel or two, and it's perfectly natural to be saving the queen's honour, andnever riding at less than thirty miles an hour with sixteen bullets to the cubic inch of you.And there's the Hamlet way of preparing the scene, and then flipping him on; and that way,which is Shakespeare's invariable way, makes the man natural from the beginning. Ibsen doesthe same; it is clearly right; one must not make one's man incredible from the moment of hisappearance.But what of the fantastics? Maitre Alcofribas Nasier cares for none of these things.

Time made her bold, and she was gayand gracious, so that it pleased her perversion to wager with herself that she should enjoy a lovereven in the bed with her goodman. Which device she prepared, bidding Sir Paramour enter softlythrough the unlatched door of the flat. But even as the other disciple did outrun Peter, so a citizentook the honor of that laggard lover. And this man was well bedrunken. A German-Americanwas he, and well bedrunken, verily. So this one came upon the bed; the girl stirred not forcaution, save to slip the sheet from off her body, and he knew not of her. ``Nay!'' quoth he tohimself, ``all men are equal; I will prove it heartily, and ease my nature.'' So with a blast andfanfare of great trumpets, he stated clearly, and proved with mighty measure, and great weight,the proposition of democracy. Then Jeanne, that wanton wife and wise in Havelockellisry thegentle sport, divined her lover for a fantastic, and lay still. But ere he fled he seized what to himseemed a lever appropriate to that throne whereon he squatted touchwise and pulled thereonrepeatedly, so that the lumpish cuckoldly lubberly lout of a husband, waking, bethought him ofthat word of James the apostle ``Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter against them'' andput his hand upon her knee. ``Shut up! old satyr'' she cried loud, ``I never shall understand sex.Oh mother, save me!

But when he came upon them privily, lo! then Sir Roger looked up frank and smiling, hiseyes trembling with great joy and sweetness of child- holiness. Quoth 'a to the angrypaedagogue: Nay, sir, 'tis natural error, and I pardon thee with my whole heart. For this myfriend was stricken (by Heaven's will) with sudden pain-cramp of a limb. I therefore, crying onAesculapius, did put my lips to it, sucking and soothing, lipping and licking, rolling my tongueabout, nibbling it gently with my teeth to induce a proper flow of blood to the disordered place,all as my instinct of Healer-of-Men did direct me. So presently by the favour of God came reliefby spasm and -- may it not have been the bursting of some internal abscess? -- the ejaculation ofsome humor -- salty, 'Od wot, and ostreosian, or methought so, and may Nature grant it benutritious. Now by the Virtue of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost, Three and One, towhom be praise and worship eternally, is my friend rid of his cramp. Amen!But that young master, skilled in physick, knew in himself that this was no true cure, but a cureby sympathy and transference; for lo! himself was attaint of that same plague. Which Sir Rogerspying i' th' tail of his eye, the boy cries quickly to him: Good sir, God save you; will you not restthe inflamed limb between these cushion? Ay! warmth and softness, there's the rub! Move, an' itease you! Stay, let me massage the swollen limb with that elastic, that electric Prometheus-reedo'mine. Do you feel nothing better? The fever flushes face and eyes; dear master, cry but uponGod! Come, come, dear master, but say a prayer, and it may be that God will bless my feebleefforts. Feeble! cried he; preserve me from the strong, an' that be so. Ye're to massage, lad, back'er, not to break. A prayer!

Also, Sir Roger was so slenderand delicate and his feature so fine that -- in short, masters and comrades called him alike by thename of `Duodecimo Jesus'.CHAPTER FIFTEENOF THE LOGOS THAT SPAKE NEVER, AND OF HIS WITNESSES.Now, by God wake up, if you have dozed!

And so when I've most bitter need of colour and size and light, I'm likea ghost i' the church yard, a scraped turnip with a candle, and a flapping sheet upon a pole.Yet who should tell how gay Sir Roger met with God's vicar but I? Alack -- I may not tell. But ofhis meeting with the herald? Amen, that will I.He was aware, Sir Roger Bloxam, of that pompous dwarf, fighting mad, the bantam soul of himafire, craning, straining, strutting stiff before him, the brave little fellow, a bare yard high, game,cocky, impudent, mocking, with his monk's hood drawn back from his bare poll, and -- since hewas the Herald of God's vicar -- saying Nothing. Only he leapt and preened himself, and hisfollowers swelled with pride. For he had attachis, this goodly cardinal ambassador, SignorCoglio the Florentine and brave Don Cojone of Logorno, stout and subtle they, secreting inthemselves continually the mysteries of the Creation. No fear o' treachery there, by Zeus and histhunder! 'Twas their young sister Porphyria Poppoea, that with wantonness proclaimed herself,swinging her thurible whether ye would or no. Foul wench! What words are these? Art notashamed? What heard I then? ``Asquith.'' Fie then! Sir Roger, canst thou not silence her? What'sthis mephitic borborygmus, this belch o' beastliness -- in a woman's mouth too? No Englishmanwithin 3000 miles of me needs guess more than once what this word is -- God help him -- andme! There -- all our stomachs turn as the stench strikes our noses.

For when Sir Roger saw that monk, in 's cardinal hat and Tyrian frock,confound him, he was shaken like a teak sampan in a typhoon, like a man in love with anAustralian woman, like a flapper at the first sight of a matine;'e hero, or like an Americangrandmother introduced to a new Tango lizard. He felt like a neuraesthenic who finds a GilaMonster in bed with him. Yet there was something in him that was not shaken, after all: Dai-Butsu was glad at heart when the earthquake tumbled the ruins of his temple about him atKamakura, though I hope no harm came to the Iris gardens.And so, cried Sir Roger, you are Cardinal Mentula di Caracco? Was there no law of praemunireto abate your insolence? You undercover before me, 'tis some grace in you, but your carriage isproud as Lucifer's, Sir Prelate!At this the churchman uttered no word, but smote Sir Roger in the abdomen, like a goat butting.Enough! I'll not endure it! The knight was but a boy, but 'a was angered, 'Od wot. He loved notpriests and their ogling, intriguing, domineering, subtle, persistent, pushing, pulling, alluring,menacing, ways -- now Attila, now Caesar, now Machiavelli, now Cleopatra -- and all so deftthat it needs a sharp eye to see them. 'Sbodikins! do ye not know that your own thoughts are hisbefore ye think them?So good Sir Roger, boiling with wrath, tried courtesy. ``Pray rest awhile, good sir, kind sir,reverend sir, most venerable sir! Be at ease, sir, I pray you! Bid your followers loosen their coats,i' God's name, and for the love o' Christian charity, for 'tis plaguy hot,'' quoth he.But to all this the cardinal answered not a word. For he had The Word, and would speak noneother, and the moment was not come to send it forth. Ah! would ye had that Word, my darlings --all that live -- for it is Silence, and a Seed that, falling into the Earth, is presently clothed aboutwith leaf and flower and fruit.

I know her name was langourous and lovely; but only the devil her masterknows what it was; I shall probably remember it if I live to be eighty; but whether it's worthwhile to go through another forty years or so of European war in order to recall this detail is amatter rather for my readers than myself.

She was as pretty as a picture of Spring, for 'twasthat which had got into her blood -- the good Sun grant it gets into mine this night, and staysthere! So she was restless, so she walked up and down by the Sea, feeling the Sea's mood hers. Ithink she walked till moonset, but I'm not writing by the calendar, thank the Lord! We call itmoonset; we declare moonset trumps. Good. Then she wandered on the face of the cliff for awhile, and sought to tire her limbs. At last she came to a meadow; and there she called upon theEarth, lying upon the cool grass, and plucking out great handfuls. The daisies stared at her withgreat golden eyes, like Balzac's `Fille'. And so she dreamed that she was Earth itself, and adaughter of Earth, Titan, a giantess in the prime o' the planet.

For the boy was tired o' skating. He knew nobody in Stockholm but the stuffy old Britishminister, and his cappy shawly spouse; and he couldn't speak a word of Swedish, and he didn'tlike Punch. So as you all know, after about three hours trying the Inside Back Loop and Rockerfor the love of the thing, you wish you had never seen a skate in your life. Sir Roger Bloxam wastired and cold and hungry. Cardinal Mentula and his little suite were with him, to be sure, but toall intents and purposes they had retired to their apartments.

The Swede wasunder the influence of the prudish Queen, I suppose; for all he said was this ``Come, come! Aboy of your age ought to be in bed at this time of night!'' Sir Roger realized the good sense of hisadviser; he acted at once on the word; and incidentally, he introduced the Count to PorphyriaPoppoea. The Delight was mutual; the soldier waxed so enthusiastic that there was nothing for itbut he must make a luncheon party for his brother officers the very next day; and Sir Roger madea hit indeed with his charming manners and his delicate boyish beauty and his sly wit.

The oldColonel sucked all this up with avidity, like a cat lapping cream; and when the good Cardinal,with a fierce spasm of eloquence, made that inimitable gesture of Saint Paul ``Let me spend andbe spent for you'' the soldier bethought him that rarely if ever in all his life had he been sooverwhelmed with the passionate torrent of that life-giving fervour which jets from the inmostbeing of the soul.

(Curse all Armenians, anyhow!) But I'd take no heedto the pack of 'em had I but a story to tell, and I've none; I'm setting down plain truth, as I see it,for the God of Things as they Ought to Be.

Let him that did take another drink, and a long one, praising me, andhimself, and the sweet God of Truth that did make such understanding between us!) But I wasbetter off before, in New Orleans, not a doubt of it, Edward or no Edward; for there in DauphineStreet there was no need of getting up or going to bed. I knew nobody, and nobody knew me; myloves were casual and lonely as my lunches. This is the proper life for the pure poet who wouldcommune evermore with Beauty, enjoy the Beatific Vision, pace the sapphire pavement of theThrone of God, and compose hymns in praise of Apis over the Filet de Boeuf Robespierre atAntoine's, or of Pitma over Sister Green, the smooth, muscular, black-purple glory of her bodywas like the stone of that many-breasted beauty Diana in Neapolis. (Poor U.S.A.! as PorphyriaPoppoea would Morse-Code if Sir Roger Bloxam ate some horrible bad food, ``in England we'vea New Forest, date before 1100; and in Italy a New City, date before their fabled Jesus.'') Whichmakes me wonder whether Jesus was not an American. Joseph and Mary are both commonnames here (`here', hell, hell, hell, that I must still write `here'!) There are several people in NewYork who at least look like Jews, talk like Jews, think like Jews, smell like Jews. The parents ofJesus may well have been Americans touring in Palestine. It is very American of Jesus that attwelve years old he should have been teaching all the most learned men their business, and thathe should have `frozen out' the crowd in the Temple, which appears to have been the Wall Streetof Jerusalem. The sublime ignorance of Jesus, his comic beliefs in the flood and other idioticfables, his imbecile Puritanism, his determination to make God damn every one who disagreedwith him, though he was himself too proud to fight, his servility to the Romans, his poor bluffabout the `twelve legions of angels' which impressed Pilate as much as the existing bluffimpresses Germany -- ``a million men between sunset and dawn'' Bryan, Wm. Jennings of thatilk ( -- oh well, they made good; but no matter!) -- all these things speak Jesus an American.Methinks I'll quit me novel awhile, and write this up for the Sunday papers, and get me some oftheir gods. N.B. There had better be plenty; this chapter has hardly been `jolly' up to now as thetitle did so loudly promise.

I've got to get up; so that's the end of the chapter.CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEHOW SIR ROGER COMPORTED HIMSELF IN THE DEBATE WITH THE C.U.N.T.S.This book is getting along very slowly; so I shall skip a century of chapters to encourage myselfwith the Illusion of Progress.To illustrate the remarkable precocity of Sir Roger Bloxam, it may here be stated that he said, atthe early age of nine, that Women can never be any good, just as if he were grown up and knewall about it. Well rebuked he the pudding-faced, sausage-bodied, flabbinesses of feminism, didhe, the saucy youngster. ``Look you, thing'', quoth he courteously (all things considered) to theCambridge University New Testament Society and the Cincinatti Uplift New Thought Society,and other such, ``look you, a woman must either be a mother or not a mother.'' And all they cried``Ay'', assenting. ``Well then'', he went on ``what is a mother? The most animal of all traits ismotherhood. The nearer a mother is to the cow, the better mother she! What is her life? Amenstruation, a befutterment, a gestation, a parturition, a suckling -- and so it goes. She cannotmix in society; her duties as well as her vanity forbid it. She must perforce leave dinner halftasted -- the baby's hungry! Oh God! I nauseate to contemplate the revolting details -- the filthyrags, the hideous sicknesses, the deformed belly, the foulness of childbirth, the cow-udders thatappease the brat's yell -- oh God! How can she do aught human, when she is dragged down tobeastliness for half her life? No, say what you will, a mother is but a sow, a wallowing sow.'' Butone spake, saying: ``But all this does not apply to the woman who is not a mother. What of her?''``Pah!'' snorted Sir Roger, ``she is simply a bitch.'' But his opponent, staggering, struck his lastblow. ``I'll grant you that'', say he ``but what of the woman who, having been a mother, is now sono more?'' ``Past bearing'' began the child -- but he fell to the floor in a fit, and was awarded thefight on a foul."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"By the coccyx of good Saint Antony of Padua, how I vomit at them!

Be sure to have this chapter illustrated by Charles Dana Gibson andMr. Harrison Fisher.)CHAPTER CXXVISIR ROGER GOES TO SWITZERLAND.It has been said, I think by Andre;' Tridon, that it is such a pity that God has no Christian name --for if He had, what anecdotes could not Frank Harris tell about Him?But I cannot see that this has anything to do with the subject of our chapter, and though I couldlead on to it -- quis dubi -- tat? -- why should I? Art cannot be forced. Audax omnia perpeti genshumana ruit per vetitum nefas -- libellum! So I might call the chapter De amicitiis FrancisciHarris, tell the scandal about the Holy Ghost, and call God Walter Pater.CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENSIR ROGER REALLY DOES GO TO SWITZERLAND.This adding on a hundred doesn't work at all; I am merely in despair that after so many chapters Iam so little advanced with Our Story. (Yes, Our Story, Lionel, sweet boy! never forget; this isOur Story.)You may well ask why this insistence on Sir Roger's visit to Switzerland. As you point out, hehad been there already, and to France too, as a mere boy; and he had been all over Wales andScotland even to Skye -- and what they did tell him in Glasgie, I'd be ashamed to tell you -- andin the English Lakes, and climbed all the mountains, and broke all the records -- Direct Climb ofMickledoor, first solitary Descent of the North Face of the Pillar Rock, first solitary ascent ofKenn Knotts Chimney, Twyll-Du, and dozens of other; yet I never said a word about it.(Well, never mind that, says you: let's hear about the Glasgow business.)Well, it came indirectly only on Sir Roger; the foot of the trouble was Cardinal Mentula. For thatmost learned and most subtle prelate had not yet found how to spend his evenings. When he gotup every morning, he was still content to leave himself (in a manner of speaking) in the hollowof Sir Roger's hand as far as amusement was concerned. Happy indeed were the hours that hespent! But 'o nights, no! He was of the secret service, may be; he loved to seek out things usuallyhidden -- the Good, the Beautiful, and the Trou, as he never wittily observed. For he never spoke-- 'twas against his vow of silence -- though paradoxically, he was easily brought to con-fesses. (Iabhor these Ente;'nte puns, don't you?) So in Glasgow his idea was to relieve the necessities of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the poor, and he would go out slumming with Sir Roger and the rest of the gang. I can see themnow, the good knight as almoner with two shillings extracted from an indulgent mother and hispurse full to bursting (that reads funnily, but it's quite all right), the Cardinal leaping and dancingand thumping before him all down the street, brave Coglio and gay Cojone as eager as you wish,and Porphyria Poppoea following discontentedly in the background, sulking, hidden in hercushions, and probably muttering to herself. Damn it! she was right always, that girl! If SirRoger had only taken her advice all through, this would not have been so tragic a story. She wasa good friend, if ever a man had one! But that pugnacious little devil of a dwarf, he was for evergetting his ward into trouble. His only idea seems to have been to spend, and spend, and spend;bad for him, and worse for Sir Roger, who lost wealth and health in humouring his caprices, andhad nothing much but a hell of a good time to show for it. Well, down Sauciehall Street they go,the crowd of them, and the devil patron Saint of Glasgow) knows where else. And the result isthat poor God-damned Cardinal Mentula -- wished. What did poor God- damned CardinalMentula wish? Poor God-damned Cardinal Mentula wished that he could say with Saint Peterthat he had toiled all night and had caught nothing. Oh yes! He was converted to the doctrine ofHeraclitus PANTA 'PEI. When somebody said ``Das Ewig Weibliche zieht uns hinan'' hisunspoken comment was ``More German Schrecklichkeit!'' He would deliberately mistranslate``Ab ovo usque ad mala'' and ``Mulier desinit in piscem''. To him ``Nemo sapit omnibus horis''seemed like an Accusing Voice. Every morning he awoke to the battle-cry of Sursum Chordee(have I got that Latin right?) and if he was a dwarf before, he was now twisted and deformed toexcite the pity of a pirate or an evangelical clergyman. By the Fallopian Tubes of Saint Theresa,God bless her, the dainty little mystic! I tell you honestly as man to man, he could hardly read apoem without feeling that the bard was laughing at him. ``Men may come and men may go, But Iflow on for ever'' sounded like sarcasm. He hated the very name of Rupert Brooke. You see thewhole catastrophe came on him like a thunder clap; and bless my psyche! if I haven't forgotten totell you what it was. (Loud applause.)CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTNOTHING PARTICULAR HAPPENS TO SIR ROGER BLOXAM IN SWITZERLAND; SOWHY WORRY?If two and a half years in -- that word Porphyria Poppoea uses after too much dinner too unwise -- doesn't destroy a man's sense of humour, it is probably time for him to die. When poison has"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"has merely the effect of laughing gas, there msut be something radically wrong with the gassed.To proceed: Sir Roger Bloxam enjoyed himself thoroughly in Switzerland. The Cardinal neverbothered him in such places. He doesn't know to this day why he doesn't like the Swiss, whowere always perfectly charming to him. I refuse to describe glaciers, and all that sort of thing; Ishall not tell of Sir Roger's adventures on the mountains. The whole subject bores me utterly; I'msorry I ever brought it in. He wasn't consumptive; he never met a Maiden; he never had anaccident; what in the name of the Master of any College, and of my beloved Umfraville, whopantamorphopsychonosophilographer that he is, writes a complete novel without introducing asingle incident of any kind -- I refer to The Buffoon -- what, I say, is the use of going on? This isworse than Clayhanger and Hilda Lessways and that third pole-axe sequel -- God knows I neverknew its name -- bound in one ghastly volume.Praise God, from whom all blessings flowSir Roger Bloxam had to go.His safe return be now my boast:Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!AmenCHAPTER TWENTY-NINESIR ROGER BLOXAM AT CAMBRIDGE, AMSTERDAM, AND BIRMINGHAM. ANADVENTURE OF PORPHYRIA POPPOEA.. THIS TIME WE MEAN BUSINESS.(CHAPTER CCCXXXIII. How Sir Roger Bloxam put to shame the vulgarity of a famous Wit. Itwas on the good ship Campania that the darling of our dreams returned from Jew York. See himupon the poop (yes, poop! poop! poop!) his eyes flooded with tears of joy as the city fell away onthe horizon. In this most religious exercise he was joined by the world-famous wit AleisterCrowley. They sobbed with gladness in each others' arms. A Yank approached them. ``Waal,boys, what do you think of God's country?'' Crowley looked at him with a tinge of sadness in hisglance, and smiled softly ``Pox et preterea nihil.'' But Sir Roger liked it not; his mother hadtaught him to avoid the obvious. He made a darling little mone at the Nooyarker. ``Oh, sir, yournational motto nearly serves us; why not Et pluribus prunum?'')I would I were Philomena for this one hour, to wound my breast upon this thorn, or Hyacinth tostain this one flower-page from my heart's heart. Pray, think not so ill of my Porphyria Poppoea;for in all her loves she had one love, and that for all her life. He was a man with golden hair so"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"fine and pale, yet, glowing, that one thought of Sun-rays incarnate in gossamer; and his face waslike the harvest moon. He came up to his University every year; and there he met Sir RogerBloxam at a club called the Knights of the Round Table. I must not tell his name: besides, wouldit sound sweet in your ears also? When he divined the presence of Porphyria Poppoea, he fellinstant in love with her, and dared not speak, because he feared to offend Sir Roger Bloxam!'Twas in a week of revelry, and this man played and danced for a dramatic club. Will God notgive me a name for him? Some name of angel strength and sweetness? Surely Porphyria yearnedfor him as Phoedra for Hippolytus -- let that, then, serve! Well, the week parted and we did notsee Sir Roger again. But when he left, he left a book, the Legendes des Sexes of Edouardd'Haraucourt, the Sieur de Chamblay, and in it he wrote five words. These words mean nothing:a chess-player might have used them in the beginning to enumerate his pieces; but when SirRoger Bloxam read them, Porphyria Poppoea divined that Hippolytus loved her. She was anymph of excellent modesty, and impudence unmatched -- o paradox sublime of God'sinvention! She lusted nobly for all love, and gave herself utterly and shamelessly; yet, despiteherself, she acted in true Panic fear at the approach of her god. Thus, urgently desiring Sir Rogerto take her to the Lake where Hippolytus had his palace, she forced the good knight to fly withher to Amsterdam; thence only she dictated letters so fiercely burning that her whole soul waslost in them. Safe, she became bold. Yet, by his letters, mocking and provoking, yet eager ashers, he drew her to him. Oh but she must turn to him, heliotrope! Thus she came back toEngland. And Sir Roger must perforce meet Hippolytus at the Queen's Hotel in Birmingham.``What a place for a romance! You jest!'' Oh love knows not of time and space -- Always thetime and place and the loved one all together! Sir Roger registered in the hotel book; at thatmoment Hippolytus walked in. ``Hullo, monkey tricks!'' cried he; and Porphyria Poppoea's soulwent into shuddering blackness; for in his manner was no hint of all he had written. She was notloved! And after dinner he sat talking in his room with Sir Roger -- endlessly! Ot was the lastday of the Old Year -- the last hour -- Heaven and Hell in her heart. Sir Roger went to bed early,thank the Gods. And she -- she could not sleep. But ere the midnight car of Helios crossed thenadir Hippolytus had come into the room where she was, and possessed her.Of all her happiness I am quite unable to write; but pray you, weep with me, for now cometh anend. Alas! Alas! I will not speak of their joy by English lakes, of their passionate delight amongthe fells, of the terms they spent in Cambridge; for 'tis one monotone of honied music. But may"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Sir Roger Bloxam be forgiven that he slew this loveliness! When he came of age, he wished tobe rid of guardian and of handmaid; he thought them tyrants -- and then Porphyria Poppoea --eternally chaste even in her wildest wantonness, resigned her lover. She made Sir Roger carryher to Switzerland. Yet in the Gare de Lyon she bade him write ``Did I say `Always'?'' thinkingthat Hippolytus would understand that she still loved him, and -- may be -- follow her. Did heever get the letter? Did he interpret it amiss? False friends had crept into their intimacy -- andalso fear. I do not know how it was; but Porphyria Poppoea never renewed those hours -- thatlove -- that infinite passion of Hippolytus. Sir Roger Bloxam learned later that he, musing deeplyas was his wont when walking, had passed Hippolytus in Bond Street, and that Hippolytusthrough that he had cut him purposely. Also, Porphyria Poppoea, fearful of a repulse, neverfollowed up on her letter from the Gare de Lyon. Seven times the Father of all Light whirledEarth about him through the Zodiac -- and she knew surely that he was her true lover for all timeand all eternity. So, weeping, she caused a great monument to be set up, with an inscription inthe Persian language. And now and again she sent him messages; but his great heart was broken -- even as hers. Many a lover has possessed her since Hippolytus; but she has scorned them evenwhile she abandons herself to their caresses. She loves Hippolytus. Hippolytus!CHAPTER THIRTYA SHORT CHAPTER AND A GAY ONE.Come, let us be merry! This is the very devil, to moan and mope over the miseries of a morbidmaid -- mistress -- misanthrope -- melomaniac -- moll! Come, consider rather how fine theweather is in June -- sometimes! Let us rejoice together over the fact that the interior angles ofevery triangle are together equal to the two right angles, barring the non-Euclidian geometries!Let us recall the fact that once upon a time we had Hope. It seemed possible to our blind sensethat we might do constructive work, that we might help humanity, enrich the world with beautyand with music, with high thought and ecstasy of holiness. We wished to proclaim Will, andLove. And lo! the world has slipped over Niagara; it is smashed upon the rocks, its wreckagevoided through the whirlpools of destruction. How shall I write poetry for the cave-man, aboutme? Here's Kipling, who wrote `Recessional' not long ago; he says ``Time shall count from thedate when the English began to hate.'' It seems instane to build amid the roar of earthquake -- andI'm fitted for no other work.

I loathe German manners, German methods,German brutality; and I think it mere bad taste in Mark Twain to try to be amusing about the``awful German language'' as I should resent a joke about the toothache if I had it. But I don't seewhy I should go insane in order to fight Germans; I think to keep a cool head were better policy.Baresark fury is out of date, some centuries. So I'll not deny plain facts; I'll not play into Germanhands by bringing false accusations and giving them a genuine grievance.But what does it all matter? Civilisation has broken down; we must begin again, if any one of thewhite races survive, on fundamentals. New principles of morality, of politic, of economics.

This breathless interest, this clamour to hear more of Our Story,dog-gone it, is parlous flattening, mighty perlite, but, by the shade of my first governess, unladylike. You must not grab the chocolate creams. You must not ask for a second helping of ricepudding, or encore a poem by W. B. Yeats. Wait, therefore, with hands folded, while I recountmine adventures of this day! 'Twas in a studio, and, while I snoozed, that lousy old lollipop,Leila, was being painted psychochromatically, by the hybrid host of mine, that Irish FrenchCanadian Dutch Jew, that semi-sexual saphead, with his fish-belly face, his negroid hair, hisslimoplastically deSemitized probiscis, his jaw like an old toothless hag's, his egotism bearingthe same ratio to his personality, as his vanity to his good looks, and that's about the trillionthpower of the factorial of the number of electrons in the universe to one poor lemon-pip.

So there in the woodland they played many a pageant: the mystery of St. George, theComedy of Pan, the Morality of the Wild Beast, the Argument of the Flood, a thousand merryand joyous rites of Saturn and Flora, of Dionysus and of Paphian Aphrodite, of her that reigns inPanormus, of him that guards great Lampsacus in his reverberating splendour.

In his second year he had taken the Chancellor's medal with a poem on`Gehenna' -- not Ravenna, Mr Clever, of course,, you think you know everything. Ravenna wasby Wilde and won the Newdigate, which rather gives Oxford away. No, Gehenna was a hell of apoem, and he ruined it quite correctly with `senna'. But hje beat this hollow in a month. Yes: ofcourse I mean to give the chapter and verse; I told you before I would never bluff. Here's theopening chorus. ``From life hath death the power to bar souls? Are souls immortal? Are souls?Are souls?'' He goes on ``Are souls of boys with glamour gilded? Shall not love right the wrongthe pill did?'' referring, apparently, to the bitter pill of punishment for sin. Cf. Milton ParadiseLost: a much duller poem. The yearning earnestness of this poem won him many a friend. Theexordium is truly superb.Are souls divine? Those crimson pilesBear witness, while the sun-god smiles.Reared in the desert -- blood and wineAnswer our sob ``Are souls divine?''Is that last Angel's trumpet-boomNot puissant on the mortal's tomb?Are souls divine? Yes, cries the heart;By the strong argument -- of art!''"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Porphyria Poppoea was indeed his Egeria -- that's the cliche;', isn't it? -- in philosophy.

For he was never able to behold her face to face, butin a glass, darklyl; and love must come to him from another, and that other one like unto himself,id est, God. As he spent many an hour, his fingers coyly straying in her wine-dark hair, while hervoice, like perfume, declared the glory and the goodness of God. I wish you could see her rosylips pursed up and puckered with merry impudence -- yet utter holiness. See them part softly tothe pressure of a gentle sigh! Hullo! what's this? what golden god comes flaming from the portal,his disk cloud-capped like a volcano?

Surely thisis the place to insert Sir Roger Bloxam's views on Death, regarded as an art, a science, and asocial pleasure.CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENOF FROU-FROU, AND FRISSON, AND DEATH.There is no frisson possible without the element of surprise, that is, of ignorance. AS oneassimilates all books, all pictures, all things beautiful, enjoyment increases, but frisson becomesrare. To be blase;' is not to be impotent. But after loving say 1500 women it is unlikely that onewill often discover a `new sensation'. A man may be most potent when he does find the rightwoman; which was not so at eighteen, when the rustle of every skirt produced its fullphysiological effect. Sir Roger Bloxam had many a year of this early stage. It was not only KittyWilliams; it was every landlady's daughter, every skivey, every barmaid. But 'twas all butterflylove once, twice, and thrice, and a new flower caught his fancy. Indeed, he was short with them;a quick-firing gun was he, by Gosh. He grew into a 16-inch gun, a 42-centimetre howitzer. Ittakes more to load such a gun -- but 'tis not smaller and impotent because you cannot fire it 600times a minute! Don't be afraid of being blase;', darling; you're nearer `death', it's true; but that'sbecause you've finished life, mastered it, put it in your breeches pocket. You've made yourselfready for a higher life by your familiarity with the lower. How dreadful to be always 15 or 25 or"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"35 or 45! You'd get more bored every day; suicide would soon seem the one way out. Surely by35 the earnest man who had had all opportunities and lived every minute ofhis time has becomeone with all possible beauty. Is he likely to discover a new Beethoven at 40? No: he has taken alllife in; if he is an artist, he can go on to give it out to others; bar that, his life may be pleasant, butit must be nigh stagnation, as regards new impressions. He must work on his material if grow hewould. Once his creative force is spent, he is ready for death; and I cannot see but that death is alogical continuation of life. Not by man's logic, but by nature's, whatever that may be; but besure, 'tis right, when we understand it. So as the poet says ``Give me passion, give me death!''For the two are one; and death shall be the orgasm wherein the true ego escapes the man, -- tospend -- given a suitable menstruum -- in energy in recreating body and mind, like a wanton Godadorning himself with flowers and laurels. ``What a serious chapter! And you haven't mentionedthe one great consolation to the dying, that we have no evidence of the continued existence ofAustralia beyond the grave.''CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTHOW SIR ROGER BLOXAM BETHOUGHT HIM OF CHOOSING A CAREER.A sapper, in sinking a well-shaft,Was stricken by death with his fell-shaftBut Hindenburg said:``He's much better dead --``Kadaververwertungsgesellschaft!''This is a very important passage, dear children, in the life of any man, when he decides to whathe shall devote his life. For all courses are just equally vain and idle. This world is so obviously arotten practical joke that a wise man is disgusted with it by the time he is twenty-five or so. Theeverlasting guffaw of God at his horseplay irritates the nerves. Only the artist who eschews theLearned Professions, and sticks to Beauty, is likely to enjoy life.

And so Religion toowears thin, since Love under Will is the law. What's left but art? What's art but St. Paul's `faith,'the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen? Then art should be able tomove mountains: oh if one could only dump the Central Asiatic Plateau on to this infernalcountry! It's a curious thing, perhaps even a little morbid, the way in which hatred of Americaeats up all one's other passions. It's omnipresent. It's not pure hatred; it's loathing and disgust.And it certainly does interfere with the writing of a novelissim; for I'd more easily write sonnetswhen I'm seasick.Now, upon what God shall I call? It's a far cry to Lochawe! There are no gods on the long-distance telephone. The most disreputable outcast of Olympus would hide this shame elsewhere -- so long as there was a latrine or a cicada outside America he would not haunt their pinchbackpalaces. I fear me I must call on their own deity, the dollar; and use him to get out.CHAPTER MVHERIOC RESOLUTION OF THE NOVELISSIMIST.No, by the anvil of lame Vulcan, I'll not budge. I'll dree my weird. I'll take it out in art. Brickswithout straw, by the Phoenix Wand of Cheops, and by the Crowns of the Upper and the LowerNile! A puritan community can never breed artists, for they feed on beauty; and in America onehas to go for beauty to the caterpillar. Yes, there are some pretty decent insects here, I mustadmit. Thus comforted, let us return to those enthralling vicissitudes in the career of Sir RogerBloxam which were interrupted about a month ago, something suddenly, by my taking over TheInternational."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"You'll remember that Cardinal Mentula was absorbed in Browning. (The reader is requested notto attempt to parse Browning.) What's the object? cried Sir Roger. The Cardinal handed him acopy of Tristam Shandy. ``How are you working?'' Mentula passed him a Gulliver's Travels. ``Isit hard?'' Down came a copy of The Channings. ``What's the colour of his hair?'' He produced theElegy in a Country Churchyard. ``And how do you feel?'' The busy churchman pointed to Judethe Obscure. ``Hot work, eh?'' The Cardinal laughingly opened a Tam-o Shanter. ``Who is he?''An Erewhon was immediately indicated. ``What's the best part of him?'' Cardinal Mentula gotout a volume of sermons by Dean Hole. ``How do you know?'' Evangeline was on the table in aninstant....I could go on for an hour; but I do hate all this bloody cleverness.CHAPTER FORTY-NINEOF THE HALT CAUSED BY THE ABSENCE OF A NOVELISSIMATRIX; AND HOW THELORD TOOK PITY UPON THE INNOCENCE OF FATHER BROWN.I am perfectly well aware, thank you, darling, that a month has slipped by, without my doing aline of the novelissim. You see, I hadn't time; for I had just taken up the work of TheInternational. But I would have found time if I had had the One Thing Needful. And what's that,say you, Ambrosia? Natuer-lich -- a novelissimatrix. Gewiss. I'm really rather grateful to dearMaitland. He sent me to the Murray Hill Baths, where, by the Missing Section of Osiris, I met aPopular Movie Writer in the flesh. He calls hils films ``Shades and Shadows,'' ``Right orWrong?'' and sich, and he talks as he writes. He spends a night of drunken orgie with a lady, and,on leaving, thanks her for a very pleasant evening. I didn't know that these things were! ThenMaitland also told me of a Cingalese Joing, where I could get a really truly curry. And of courseI ran right into my beloved Catherine. She was sitting in a little inner room, by the window, inthe twilight. I could not see her clearly. But her magnetism drew me over to her. She was in acoarse white dress, smoking endless cigarettes, and drinking many an unfathomable seidel ofbeer. She looks a little like Soror Hilarion, and, a little like Frank Harris, and altogether likesome kind of Chinese dog -- a barbarian brigand kind from beyond the Wall. So I shall call herTchao, and that will be all right, won't it? I can lie about on the bed in our little room on CentralPark West, while she wraps up the laundry in copies of the Evening Telegram, and write my nicenovelissim. And, praise the pigs, I didn't have to appeal to the dollar; it was Father himself thatgave me this dog. I'm telling you; it's a most amazing thing; the dear old boy is there with the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"goods from noon to noon. ``Everybody works but Father'' is no song for our little me;'nage, byWilkins! I'm a member of the Upper citcles, by Aaron's rod that budded! This is the Inner Life,all right, my dear old H. P. B.! She's a Pennsylvania Dutch girl, this Tchao, no Frankfurter abouther; but she's the Original Hot Dog. Also, b'gosh, one of Nature's children; she has no acquiredtechnique; it's all talent ab ovo. But what talent! No: it's pure genius; she doesn't know how, andshe doesn't know why; but she gets there. She inscribes me among the lyric poets, and the restfollow as Horace once indicated. A Week-end in this house needs the very opposite kind; bythave no fear! In fact, your only dread be this, that I cannot find time to write Our Story.CHAPTER MVIIREFLEXIONS UPON FREE WILL AND DESTINY: CALCULATED TO ELUCIDATE THECOMPLEX OF THE CAREER OF SIR ROGER BLOXAM.My labour, most ambiguous Henri, will indeed have been waste matter, a very newspaper, if Ihave failed to bring into assimilation with your Vinnam the F.A.C.T. that whatever Sir Rogerwas, he was, and be damned to you! How could he have been otherwise? If he could, he would.And as otherwise I should have drawn him. But he being himself (poor devil!) he was just that.See you not how even our dreams, our wishes, all that we are, dates back to hidden ancestor-work? Only the Freudians go not far enough; the glowing seed that made my mind so brillianthad its orgin in the Father of all brilliance, Our Lord the Sun. Thus once again, by yet anotherpath, we reach the brave ``There is no part of me which is not of the Gods.'' Rejoice, o brothers,we are altogether of the divine substance. We neither think, nor feel, nor perceive, nor are, anyother thing than that all-bounteous, all-beautiful One, that Lord in his spendour and his ecstasythat cometh and goeth in his chariot upon high, giving light and praise, yet neither moveth noruttereth any Voice! For there is nothing in the Universe that is not of that Unity -- rejoice!rejoice! All paths are spectra, in the prism of consciousness, of that One Light; so that it matterednot to Sir Roger whether he were tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, gentleman, apothecary, ploughboy,thief. Nor does it matter to you, does it, what I do with him? Little ones, it seems to me enough,maybe too much, that I should do aught at all. Very good, then: Sir Roger entered the DiplomaticService. That finishes that, and I can take Tchao for a stroll in the Park.CHAPTER MVIIIOF THE VICISSITUDES OF NOVELISSIMAKING, AN EXAMPLE."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Observe!
