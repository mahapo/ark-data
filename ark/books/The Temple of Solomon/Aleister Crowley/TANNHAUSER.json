PREFACEAS, after long observation and careful study, the biologist sees that what atfirst seemed isolated and arbitrary acts are really part of a series ofregular changes, and presently has the life-history of the being that he isexamining clear from Alpha to Omega in his mind; as, during a battle, therelative importance of its various incidents is lost, the more so owing tothe excitement and activity of the combatant, and to the fact that he ishimself involved in the vicissitudes which he may have set himself toobserve; while even for the commander, thought the smoke-pall may lift nowand again to show some brilliant charge or desperate hand-to-hand struggle,he may fail to grasp its significance in his dispositions; or indeed find itto be quite unexpected and foreign to his calculations; yet a few years ormonths {223A} later the same battle may be lucidly, tersely, and connectedlydescribed, so that a child is able to follow its varying fortunes withdelight and comprehension: just so has my own observation of a life-historymore subtle, a battle more terrible, been at last co-ordinated: I can viewthe long struggle from a standpoint altogether complete, calm, andphilosophical; and the result of this review is the present story of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Tannhauser, just as the isolated and often apparently contradictory incidentsof the fight were recorded in that jungle of chaotic emotions which I printedunder the title of \"The Soul of Osiris,\"<<Now \"The Temple of the HolyGhost.\">> calling it a history so that my readers might discover forthemselves (if they chose to take the trouble) the real continuity in theapparent disjointedness. The history of any man who seriously and desperately dares to force apassage into the penetralia<<Hidden places.>> of nature; not with the calmphilosophy of the scientist, but with the burning conviction that hisimmortal destiny is at stake; must be a strange one: to me at least strangelyattractive. The constant illusions; the many disappointments; the bitterearnestness of the man amid the grim humour, or more often sheer cacchinationof his surroundings; all the bestial mockery of the baffling fiends; thestill more hideous mockery in which the Powers of Good themselves seem toindulge; doubt of the reality of that which he seeks; doubt even of theseeker; the irony of the whole strife: are fascinating to me as they are, Imake no doubt, to the majority of mankind. This is the subtler form of that mental bewilderment which the GreekTragedians were so fond of depicting: as subtle in effect, yet grosser in itsdetermining factors. For we are thus changed from the times of Sohpocles andEuripides; that the fixed ideas of morality and religion which they employedas the motives of pathos or of horror are now shattered. Ibsen, otherwise inspirit and style purely Greek, and dealing as the Greeks did with theemotions of the soul, has realised the changed and infinitely more complexconditions of life; our self-appointed spiritual guides notwithstanding, or,rather, withstanding in vain. Consequently it is impossible any more todivine whether virtue or vice (as understood of old) {223B} will cause theirreparable catastrophe which is the one element of drama which we may still(in the work of a modern dramatist) await with any degree of confidence. I trust that I may be forgiven for adopting the idea that Tannhauser wasone of those mysterious Germans whose reputed existence so perturbed theMiddle Ages; in short, a Rosicrucian.<<See their original documents, fairlyenough translated in \"Real History of the Rosicrucians,\" by A. E. Waite.>>Some people may be surprised that a Member of that illustrious but unhappyfraternity should take cognizance of what my friend Bhikku Ananda Maitriyacalls \"hog-nosed Egyptian deities,\" still more that he should show reverenceto symbols like the B. V. M. and the holy Grail. But the most learned andprofound students of the Mysteries of the Rosy Cross assure me that it wasthe special excellence of these mystics that the declined to be bound down byany particular system in their sublime search for the Eternal and the Real. Under these circumstances I have not scrupled to subvert anything thatappeared to me to need subverting in the interests, always identical, ofbeauty and of truth. Anachronism may be found piled upon anachronism, andsymbolism mixed with symbolism. In one direction I have restrained myself. Nowhere does Tannhauser referto the Vedas and Shastras<<Hindu sacred books.>> or to the Dhamma<<The law.>>"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of that blameless hypochondriac, Gotama Buddha. I take all the blame for soimportant an omission, not without a shrewd suspicion that the comminationwill take the form of \"For this relief much thanks!\" The particular object that I have in view in speaking both in Hebrew andEgypto-Christian symbolism is that by this means I may familiarise my readerswith the one thing of any importance that life, travel, and study have taughtme, to wit: the Origin of Religions. I take it that there have always, or nearly always, been on the earththose whom Councillor von Eckartshausen,<<Author of the \"Cloud upon theSanctuary,\" a profound mystical treatise.>> the Svami Vivekananda<<A well-known Indian mystic, author of \"Raja Yoga.\">> and their like, call {224A}\"great spiritual giants\" (can there be any etymological link between\"yogi\"<<\"Yogi\" is \"one who seeks union,\" \"i.e.\" with the Supreme.>> and\"ogre\"?) and that such persons, themselves perceiving Truth, have tried to\"diminish the message to the dog\"<<Browning, \"Mr. Sludge the Medium.\">> forthe benefit of less exalted minds, and hidden that Truth (which, unveiled,would but blind men with its glory) in a mass of symbols often perverted orgrotesque, yet to the proper man transparent; a \"bait of falsehood to catchthe carp of truth.\" Now, regarded in this light, all religions, quareligions, are equally contemptible. The Hindu Gnanis<<Philosophers.>> say\"That which can be thought is not true.\" As machineries for the exercise ofspiritual and intellectual powers innate or developed, certain sets ofsymbols may be more or less convenient to a special trend of mind, reason, orimagination; no more: I deny to any one religion the possession of anyessential truth which is not also formulated (though in a different language)in every other. To this rule Buddhism appears a solitary exception. Whetherit is truly so I have hardly yet decided: the answer depends upon certainrecondite mathematical considerations, to discuss which would be foreign tothe scope of my present purpose, but which I hope to advance in a subsequentvolume.<<Berashith, \"q.v. infra,\" vol. ii.>> If you do not accept my conclusion that all religions are the expressionof truth under different aspects, facets of the same intolerable gem, you areforced back on the conclusions of those unpleasing persons the Phallicists.But should you travel to the East, and tell a Lingam-worshipping Sivite thathis is a phallic worship he will not be please with you. Compare on thispoint Arnold, \"India Revisited,\" 1886, p. 112. So much for the symbolology of this, I fear, much-mangled drama. Dramaindeed is an altogether misleading term; monodrama is perhaps better. It isreally as series of introspective studies; not necessarily a series in time,but in psychology, and that rather the morbid psychology of the Adept thanthe gross mentality of the ordinary man. It may help some of my readers if I say that my Tannhauser is nearlyidentical in {224B} scheme with the \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" Literary andspiritual experts will however readily detect minor differences in thetreatment. It will be sufficient if I state that \"the Unknown,\" whetherminstrel, pilgrim, or Egyptian sage, represents Tannhauser in his true Self,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"-- the \"Only Being in an Abyss of Light!\" The Tannhauser who talks is the\"Only Being in an Abyss of Darkness,\" the natural man ignorant of hisidentity with the Supreme Being. The various other characters are all littleparts of Tannhauser's own consciousness and not real persons at all: whethergood or bad, all alike hinder and help (and there is not one whose functionis not thus double) the realsation of his true unity with all life. Thiscircumstance serves to explain, though perhaps not to excuse, the lack ofdramatic action in the story. Love being throughout the symbol of hismethod, as Beauty of its object, it is through Love, refined into Pity, thathe at last attains the Supreme Knowledge, or at least sufficient of it to putthe last straw on the back of his corporeal camel, and bring the story to afitting end. To pass to more mundane affairs. I may mention for the benefit of thosewho may not be read in certain classes of literature, and so think meoriginal when I am hardly even paraphrasing, that Tannhauser's songs in ActIV. are partly adapted from the so-called \"Oracles of Zoroaster,\" partly fromthe mysterious utterances of the great angel Ave,<<In \"Dr. Dee.\">> perhapsequally spurious. Of course Bertram's song is merely a rather freeadaptation of the two principal fragments of Sappho, which so many peoplehave failed to translate that one can feel no shame in making yet anotherattempt. There may be one or two conscious plagiarisms besides, for which Ido not apologise. For any unconscious ones which may have crept in owing tomy prolonged absence from civilised parts, and the consequent lack ofopportunity for reference and comparison, I emphatically do. One word to the reviewers. It must not be taken as ungracious if I sospeak. From nearly all I have received the utmost justice, kindness, andconsideration: two or three only seem to take delight in deliberatelyperverting the sense of my remarks: and to them, for their own sake, I nowaddress {225A} these words of elementary instruction. You are perfectlywelcome to do with my work in its entirety what Laertes did with hisallegiance and his vows: but do not pick out and gloat over a few isolatedpassages from the Venusberg scenes and call me a sensualist, nor from theFourth Act and groan \"Mysticism!\"; do not quote \"Two is by shape the CopticAspirate\" as a sample of my utmost in lyrics; do not take the song of Wolframas my best work in either sentiment or melody. As a \"quid pro quo\" I giveyou all full permission to conclude your review of this book by quoting fromAct III. \"Forget this nightmare!\" I must express my great sense of gratitude to Oscar Eckenstein,<<Thefamous mountaineer.>> Gerald Kelly, and Allan MacGregor, who have severallyhelped me in the work of revision, which has extended over more than a yearof time and nearly twenty thousand miles of space. Some few of the very bestlines were partially or wholly suggested by themselves, and I have notscrupled to incorporate these: if the book be but a Book, the actualauthorship seems to me immaterial. I have written this preface in a lighter vein, but I hope that no one willbe led to suppose that my purpose is anything but deadly serious. This poem"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"has been written in the blood of slain faith and hope; each foolish utteranceof Tannhauser stings me with shame and memory of old agony; each Ignis Fatuusthat he so readily pursues, reminds me of my own delusions. But, thesefollies and delusions being the common property of mankind, I have thoughtthem of sufficient interest, dramatic and philosophical, to form the basis ofa poem. Let no man dare to reproach me with posing as the hero of my tale.I fall back on the last utterance of Tannhauser himself: \"I say, then 'I':and yet it is not 'I' Distinct, but 'I' incorporate in All.\" Above all, prayunderstand that I do not pose as a teacher. I am but an asker of questions,such as may be found confronting those who have indeed freed their minds fromthe conventional commonplaces of the platitudinous, but have not year daredto uproot the mass of their convictions, and to examine the whole questionof religion from its most fundamental source in the consciousness of mankind.Such persons may find the reasoning {225B} of Tannhauser useful, if only tobrace them to a more courageous attempt to understand the \"Great Arcanum,\"and to attain at last, no matter at what cost, to \"true Wisdom and perfectHappiness.\" So may all happen!
