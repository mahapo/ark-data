With characteristic cunning I have not included anypoems published later than the Third Volume of my Collected Works.The selection has been made by a committee of seven compe-tent persons, sitting separately.Only those poems have been included which obtained amajority vote. This volume, thus almost ostentatiously de-mocratic, is there-fgore now submitted to the British Public with the fullent confidencethat it will be received with exactly the same amount of acclamationas that to which I have become accustomed.
