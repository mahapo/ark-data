Second, while Crowley ad-mired the German people he was first and foremost an Englishman and apatriot. When war broke out he volunteered his services, but his offer wasrefused. Finally he saw an opportunity to serve his country by doing some-thing he was very good at: writing and leg pulling.In his own words from pages 751 to 753 of his “autohagiography,” TheConfessions of Aleister Crowley (Hill and Wang, 1969 E. V.) A. C. explained:“I decided on a course of action, which seemed to me the only one pos-sible in a situation which I regarded as immensely serious. I would writefor The Fatherland. By doing so, I should cut myself off temporarily fromall my friends, from all sources of income, I should apparently dishonour aname which I considered it my destiny to make immortal, and I shouldhave to associate on terms of friendship with people whose very physicalappearance came near to reproducing in me the possibly beneficial resultsof crossing the Channel with a choppy sea.“But the German propaganda was being done as well as the British pro-paganda ill. With a little more ascendancy over Viereck, I could spoil hisgame completely by doing as much mischief to Germany as the PatriotBottomley and the other hoarse-throated fishwives of Fleet Street weredoing to England. I met with more success than I had hoped.“. . .“I must explain here that I had more than one string to my bow. It wasreally a minor part of my programme to wreck the German propaganda onthe proof of reductio as absurdum. I had hoped to gain the full confidenceof the conspirators whom I had identified and deal with them as somebodywhose name I forget dealt with Cataline; and Lord Mount Eagle or who-ever it was, with Guy Faux. But nobody in British Intelligence had suffi-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"66cient of that quality to notice me.“I have always been unduly optimistic about England. I know such a lotof people who are far from being fools. But war seems to deaden percep-tion. Men who are in ordinary times quite acute become ready to assumethat anyone who is waving a Union Jack and singing ‘Britannia Rules theWaves’ must be an Admiral of the Fleet. Everybody assumed that the irri-tating balderdash I wrote for The Fatherland must be the stark treason thatthe Germans were stupid enough to think it was.”In short, Crowley’s crime was not treason, but rather it was that he toooften expected more intelligence from society than perhaps he should have.His crime was that he underestimated the stupidity and lack of perception,heightened in times of war, of which people are capable.Aleister Crowley loved his homeland, and if he from time to time chastisedEngland it was only because he loved her. And if his actions during the war,so misunderstood, were perhaps unwise or in the end of dubious value, canhe be blamed for this when he wanted to serve his country and his countryrefused his service? He did the best that he could and served his country inwhat seemed like the only way made possible by circumstances and the stu-pidity of others. Crowley knew that the absurd things he was writing wouldbe taken seriously by the overblown ego of the German elite, but he neverdreamt that such absurdities would be taken seriously by his own people.It seemed to be Crowley’s curse.When he was absolutely serious the majority scoffed at him and failed topay attention to what he was saying, yet when he was so obviously pullingthe collective leg of society his words were taken with a deadly serious atti-tude. Some of us who study Aleister Crowley’s writings with objectivity areamazed over this phenomenon, for the fault does not seem to be his.The fault lies in the collective consciousness of our society.Love is the law, love under will.G.

V.Anno XCII, 1 in dINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"77EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDA GREAT IRISH POET’SINDORSEMENT OF THE FATHERLANDI AM an essentially moderate man. I refuse to take sides in any controversy.I observe dispassionately, sit in judgement. My own Fatherland is the Sun,and while I am traveling on this planet I never forget it. Any weight whichmy utterances may ever have depends upon this fact. In normal circumstancesI should have found myself out of sympathy with a journal like THE FA-THERLAND. But when I find that in this country one has only to say “Ithink sense is admirable” or “I uphold order” or “I approve foresight” to behowled at by a mob of drunken fools as a pro-German, the situation alters. Iam not pro-German. I am pro-human. I have tried to save England from herfate by pointing out the elements of rottenness in her, so that she may set herhouse in order (a little late after she has gone out and hanged herself! butafter all, I have been doing it for twenty years), and I have tried to saveGermany by combatting the scurrilous press campaign against her, and bybringing out the truth about the war. I have seen THE FATHERLAND strug-gling indomitably and almost single-handed against the most venomous andcorrupt press that ever fouled paper; and even if I hated Germany and theGermans as well as I love them — for they are human — I should still cheeron THE FATHERLAND in its plucky fight.THE FATHERLAND, with no subsidies and precious little capital, withnothing but the brains and courage of its editor and his staff, has swept backthis flood of sewer-slush so effectively that the victory is almost won. WhenI landed here in November last, most responsible people whom I met wereviolently “pro-Allies”; to-day those same people are asking for moderationin counsel, fairness in speech, equal publicity for news from both sides, andare looking forward to a reasonable settlement and an honorable peace. Inshort, they are pro-German.Even President Wilson has not been uninfluenced by reason. It was only inthe Evening Telegram that he kept on declaring war. In reality, he delayeddeliberately the diplomatic correspondence so that the temperature of thesaloon politician might revert to normal. And, planting the first seeds of acourage which may soon lead him to place an embargo on the exportation ofarms, he warned England on July 17th that America had rights. It is evidentthat he not only reads THE FATHERLAND, but looks to it for light.ALEISTER CROWLEY."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"88THE FUTURE OF THE SUBMARINE“OLD England had a nafy;Dey had de fifteen-inch,So many und so long dey vasDey tink dey hav a cinch.De pootiest shells in all de vurld.Dey vayed ’pout two tausend pound;Und efery time dat Vinston shpeakHe make der vurld resound.Old England had a nafy;I dells you it cost her dear;Dey plewed in more ash dvendy-vifeOff millions efery year;Und vhenefer dey launch anofer shipDe English gifes a cheer,I dinks dot so vine a nafyNefer sailed dis erdlich sphere.Old England had a nafy;Dey haf vun ‘Victory,’Vun ‘Driumph,’ vun ‘Invincible,’Dot sailed upon der sea.Dey haf two hoondred ‘Dreadnought,’Und super-Dreadnoughts ash vell;But de bride of all der navyVos der prave ‘Unsinkable.’Old England had a nafy;Like fans der men vos rooty,Ven out of Luxhafen der comeVun klein’ Unterseeboote.Und ven der nafy see him comeDey dink of der Chudgment Day.And ash qvick as dey can vot vos left of demVos sguttling out of der vay.Old England had a nafy.Vhere ish dot navy now?Vhere ish de lofely brazen cloudDot vos on Vinston’s prow?Vhere ish de Mishtress of de seasDot kept dem bottled tight?All goned away mit de torpedo —Avay in de evigkeit!”Hans Breitman in 1915."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"99EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDIUntil the war broke out, nobody was sure as to whether there was any valuein the submarine. In England we enjoyed, even more than we were edifiedby, the spectacle of British Admirals quarrelling like schoolboys, saucingeach other like lydies on the lush, and intriguing against each other likeMexican Generals, on account of the divergence of their views. For all suchviews were academic and speculative. The lessons of manœuvres taught noth-ing but the theories of the umpire. It was all guesswork.There is a snake in Burma called Russell’s Viper. It is the only animalwhich makes the Buddhist violate his first principle of not taking life. For itis a gamble; if you see it first, you kill it; if it sees you first, it kills you. Thesubmarine is the Russell’s Viper of the water, and the practical question was“Would it see you first?” This could not be tested until the war. Old gentle-men in Pall Mall Clubs wrote elaborately to the Times the most convincingarguments; but nobody knew, as we know now.IIIn this fog of doubt, the Admiralties could only go half speed ahead. Theymight be throwing their money into the sea. The frequent accidents to sub-marines acted as a further check on the development of the arm. If Germanydevoted more time and money and thought to it, the reason was plain. It wasa desperate throw. She could not beat England on the water, so she might aswell try the U boats. If they failed, they failed. (“But screw your courage tothe sticking-point; and we’ll not fail.”) Similar considerations made themspend enormous sums on Zeppelins. However, even Germany did not devoteherself exclusively or even sufficiently to these new means of warfare. Theconservative school had great influence, and the prestige of England was allagainst the innovation.Now it is to be remembered that the present submarine is no more a fixedand perfect machine of its type than were the old high bicycle and the Wrightaeroplane. The submarine of 1913 was a very ramshackle contraption. Theproblems had by no means been worked out, and there was no money to testnew inventions. (It is not generally known that models which work perfectlymay fail altogether when enlarged to full size; so that even the production ofa new invention in miniature is not necessarily a good argument for taking itup.) The inventor was accordingly discouraged; he spent his time on thingsthat promised more or less immediate return for his brains and capital. Aman had to be a bit of a crank to spend his life at the solution of abstrusetheoretical problems which never actualize when motor-cars and aeroplanes"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1010were all in the public eye. Everything conspired accordingly to retard thedevelopment of the submarine.IIIBefore war had broken out a month, the Hague, Cressy and Aboukir weresunk in twenty minutes by a single submarine. Naval theory sank with them.The U had come to stay — even the little, slow, limited, dangerous bad oldU! Such a coup paid for fifty failures.The Germans recognized the fact immediately, and appraised it at its propervalue. When England blusteringly swore to starve Germany out, the replywas simple — the proclamation of a Reign of Terror. Jack Tar has lost hiscourage. Under the White Ensign or the Blue, he has neurasthenia. (Perhapswe had better design him a “Yellow Ensign” for the future.) The British navyskulks in lonely harbors behind steel nets; it hardly dares the patrol of theNorth Sea. The Blue Water School and the Blue Funk School have amalgam-ated.In this new circumstance, that no ship is safe from sudden disaster, theadvantage is wholly with the continental power. It is easy to foresee thatEngland will be crushed, if only that advantage be pressed home.IVThe first and most obvious duty of Grand Admiral von Tirpitz is to perfectthe U boat as a weapon of destruction. Its primary function was for coast andharbor defense against warships; but its already enlarged cruising powershave enabled it to extend the definition of the word “coast” in a degree alto-gether unexpected.Now comes the question: is there any limit to the possibilities of its im-provement in this respect? I should not care to fix it. Now that every scien-tific or engineering brain can devote itself to the problem with every prospectof a reward like that of Wellington, be sure that surprises are in store.I see a submarine with a cruising radius of 5,000 miles, and enough torpe-does to blow every ship in the British navy out of the water.I see also a “mother submarine,” unarmed, slow-moving, but protectedwith double netting against hostile U’s, and loaded with relays of oil andtorpedoes, putting to sea with careless courage in the face of any number ofdreadnoughts, surrounded at a distance of many miles by her venomous broodof U boats.I see also a boat fitted for fighting at long range, armed perhaps with asingle 15-inch gun, gliding à fleur de l’eau, and so affording no reasonablyTHE FUTURE OF THE SUBMARINE"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"1111EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDvisible mark to the battleships which she attacks.I see also submarine transports, flat-bottomed craft, somewhat resemblingthose giant ferry-boats which carry trains in their bellies, each capable ofcarrying a thousand men. If they could make only five knots an hour, a fleetof them could still successfully invade England.And of course I see, as everybody else sees, that it is only necessary tomultiply the U boat of even the existing type by say a hundredfold in order tostarve England into submission in a single month.VIf I have troubled to make these forecasts, which are hardly beyond theimagination of even an Englishman, it is to emphasize the fact that the day ofisland empires is over. If this is not so, it must be because Science is still notbankrupt, and will find a way to detect and destroy the U boat. But even ifthis happened, there are yet further possibilities. A ship of any kind is alwaysa risk; this is the nature of things; it depends on the fact, which even Scienceis not likely to upset, that men cannot breathe as fish do. Thus the nationwhich depends on ships for its food supply is in a dangerous situation.Presumably the power of offense will always be superior to that of defense,in this respect, just as a man with a basket of eggs is in peril of total loss, evenif he win his fight with a man not so encumbered. The end of the matter mustbe that all ships will be driven from the sea, as soon as a war starts; and thismeans death to England.The remedy is, however, simple. England must abandon her career of pi-racy and plunder. She must return to the good old days when she could feedherself and clothe herself; and she must learn to live in peace with all men.She has always persecuted her men of science in the name of the parody ofreligion with which she cloaks her infamies; and they have their revenge.Let her restore the old worship; let her resume the pastoral and agricul-tural life; let her patriarchs execute justice and mercy; well and good. But nomore industrialism-slavery; no more swindling oligarchy; no more smile-and-dagger diplomacy; no more gentleman-burglar world-power.The Unterseeboot has changed all that."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1212SKELETONS IN THE CABINETBy an EnglishmanMR.

Theinterest begins on one’s arrival.The France one knew of old is not so changed until one approachesParis, except for the immense numbers of English raw recruits. The govern-ment has very sensibly turned over empty barracks to the British militaryauthorities. There everything is in order — not lodging only, but parade-grounds and all other necessaries; in addition many non-commissioned of-ficers of the French army past fighting age are being used to instruct theyoung English officers in their duties. There are also many bilingual Englishcivilians employed in various capacities. The new Tommy Atkins is beingtaught a fair amount of elementary French, and especially the principles oftheir drill. He is also learning to know the general characteristics of the coun-tryside. Evidently the British expect to be fighting on French soil for the nextyear or two. This being granted, one must admit that the arrangement isintelligent. I was told that when these troops are comparatively in shape,they are drafted back to England for regimentation, equipment and draftingto various points. With the exception of the few old sergeants, of whom men-tion is made above, there are practically no French troops visible in any ofthe country through which I passed, and even the unfit have been called up,unless actually disabled, and are being employed on work of secondary im-portance such as guarding railroads and bridges.The feeling among the people of all classes is distinctly good. There is, ofcourse the most intense hatred for the enemy — which in England hardlyexists, as will be explained later — but with it goes a certain smiling confi-dence, like a prize-fighter in the 19th round of a winning mill. Their headsare bloody, but unbowed, as Henley might have said. Every one believes thatthe undoubted fact of the check on the charming instance of the Gallic spirit.Père Boncier, who had kept a “gargotte” for forty years, just off the FaubourgMontmartre, was sent a piece of German war bread by his son. There musthave been enchantment in the loaf; the old man had the idea of his life. Hebundled off to the Government and contracted for the whole supply of Ger-man bread that might be captured. Now “tout Paris” goes to feed at the hor-rible little restaurant in order to gloat over the misery of the wicked Bosche!It is very childish and very Parisian.I only remained in Paris long enough to see a few old friends, and inquire"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1515EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDhow fate was treating them and theirs. My real goal was England; the contra-dictory accounts of the spirit of the people, and of what had actually hap-pened in the Zeppelin raids, had excited my curiosity to the highest point.So I took the long odds, and went over to London. As luck would have it, Imissed a big raid by twenty-four hours. The moment was ideal; every onewas full of the subject. British insularity, by the way, is completely abrogated;one talks to one’s fellow-passenger in a railroad car as if he were one’s long-lost brother. Everyone is madly eager for every scrap of news, false or true; itis one of several unexpected results of the censorship. Nobody knows what ishappening; official reports may or may not be true; they are certainly doc-tored. When one thinks of the great outcry that was made in the beginning ofthe war against Wolff’s Bureau, which was supposed to be disseminatingfalse news, the joke is apparent. The Germans have acquired a reputation fortruth-telling, if for nothing else. All their claims have proved true in the longrun. And though even now the average Englishman will not admit it exceptin his most secret chamber, he has a subconscious feeling that it is so, whichmanifests itself in intense disquiet and distrust.The Londoner is not really so concerned with the results of the raids onLondon as he might reasonably be. He is haunted by the fear of somethingworse which he does not know. He is afraid about the Navy. For all he knows,the big dockyards may have been destroyed, and half the ships put out ofaction.However, the damage in London itself is bad enough. Liverpool StreetStation was wrecked in one raid; an attempt on Ludgate Hill Station resultedin the gutting of a block just south of St. Paul’s and one high explosive bombmissed the station by a few yards only, and destroyed dozens of small shops.The attack on Charing Cross was not very successful; indeed, a bomb missedBernard Shaw’s house by about fifty yards; too cruel had they hit it! But theworst damage was in the Hoxton district. I did not see it myself, but mysecretary happens to live quite close, and had been up all night watching theassault and the resulting fires when she came to meet me. There appears tohave been a high wind blowing; the houses — it is a district of mean streets— caught fire and the brigade was unable to cope with the conflagration.There is a gutted patch of London five or six blocks wide, and the best part ofhalf a mile in length. Hundreds, probably thousands, must have perished. Itis not clear why this district should have been selected for attack; it seemsprobable that the Zeppelins had lost their bearings.The effect on London was not great; Hoxton was a place which it was thetruest kindness to destroy!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1616Part IIFOR some reason or other in their last Zeppelin raid on London the Ger-mans appear to have decided to make the damage as widespread as pos-sible, instead of concentrating it in one quarter. A house close to my lawyer’soffice in Chancery Lane was entirely destroyed, and the Morning Post Build-ing and several banks were seriously damaged. There is good hope that acertain building was destroyed which contains the only evidence of my ow-ing somebody 5,000 pounds. Further afield there was a great deal of damageto the docks, and still more to Woolwich Arsenal. Owing to the capital im-portance of the position the greatest secrecy was observed about it. I tookspecial pains to inquire on this point, and though, of course, it was impos-sible to gain access to the arsenal itself, the immense amount of mourning inthe districts where the workmen live indicated that many men must havebeen killed. An anti-aircraft battery at Enfield was destroyed, and it wasrumored that the small arms factory there had been hit. A great deal of dam-age was done at Croydon, especially at its suburb Addiscombe, where myaunt lives. Unfortunately, her house was not hit; otherwise I should not haveto trouble to write this article. Count Zeppelin is respectfully requested to tryagain. The exact address is Eton Lodge, Outram Road.Much more important than any material damage is the general effect of thewar upon the morale of the people. As a professional psychologist I regardedit as my special task to investigate this. I am compelled to say that I found agood deal of difficulty in dealing with my friends, who completely failed tounderstand my attitude in the war. It will hardly be believed, but I was actu-ally called upon to prove that I was the only patriotic Englishman alive. I hadto quote the Bible to them, “Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.” If I hadbeen at the Foreign Office, as I ought to have been, there would have been nowar at all. England would have stayed out, and insisted on France stayingout. Germany would have been left a free hand to deal with Russia. Thispolicy would have been in accord with that of every English statesman since1830. England backed the wrong horse. Similarly, most of my subsequentremarks, which have excited such disapproval, were said (subsequently, butnot so well) by Lloyd George and other responsible people. Strongly, how-ever, as I urged these points, I cannot pretend that I convinced my friends. Itis the stupidity of England which is losing this war for her. However, theywere too busy hating the government to care much what I said. I do not thinkthat I have ever seen such intensity of black, impotent, speechless rage, asBEHIND THE FRONT"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1717EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDone and all displayed. There was a subconscious feeling that the whole thingwas a ghastly blunder, and that the details matched the ensemble. None ofthe known politicians was trusted; such hope as existed was based on outsid-ers like Lord Derby. The eternal squabbles of the cabinet and the press arousedinfinite disgust. During the whole of my visit the Daily Mail was attackingthe government with an animus which went altogether beyond the bounds ofcriticism. It was evidently based on personal hatred and ambition. Every onefelt this, loathed the situation, and was reduced to a nervous wreck by thefeeling that it was impossible to do anything.There was also a terrible quarrel about the recruiting. Furious campaignswere being waged about the sex problem: “Should married men be calledout?”There was also a deadly fear that the impossible would happen, that En-gland was really being beaten. Unless one has lived in England for a longtime, it is impossible to realize how the conviction that England is invincibleis part of the national consciousness. It is for this reason that the alarmistshave never obtained a hearing. Even people like Lord Roberts, who wererespected as experts on every other point, and who would have been listenedto attentively if they had laid down the law in any other fashion, were reviledand contemned in the most decided manner whenever they suggested thatEngland might be in danger. The Boer war itself was always thought of as alittle war. The issue was never doubtful in the mind of any one in England.Even now, such confidence as exists is largely due to the systematic way inwhich disasters have been minimized. Mons, Antwerp, Loos, Neuve Chapelle,the Dardanelles even, are looked upon with the same sort of annoyance aswould occur in America, if the trusted third baseman of the Red Sox droppeda catch. It is still not conceivable that England may really be smashed. Andyet, there lurks in the mind of every man the unspoken fear that “der Tag”may really have arrived. There is something of Belshazzar’s Feast about ev-ery dinner party.I think the slow-riding dogged courage of the English was sapped byvictorianism. It exists, but only in certain limited classes. Too many peopleare living on their nerves. There is a sort of nightmare effect very largelydistributed. The military situation will be discussed, until it is almost dis-cussed away; but just as complacency begins, the thought suddenly arrives:But what about the government? What about the workingman? And the scaf-foldings are knocked away from under the optimist. Victorianism had madeevery one so discontented, so miserable that there does not seem so much tofight for. No doubt the greatest errors were made in the original advertising"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1818campaign, with its wheedling and its insults. It rubbed the Englishman up inexactly the wrong way. Advertising is a tradesman’s dodge; and Englandbeing a nation of shopkeepers, every one knew that it was cheating. Hadthere been a government in the country at the beginning of the war to seizethe reigns of power, declare conscription immediately, and shoot downunhesitatingly any one who objected, there would have been no trouble. Ev-ery one would have said: This is the spirit of Cromwell and of Wellington.But all the people in power were temporizers, men of words, vote-catchers,nearly all of them lawyers by profession. In any crisis the only man who cando anything is some rough, practical personality. The very qualities whichbring a man to the front in ordinary times are those which make him uselessin an emergency. The history of every nation is full of such examples, and, ofcourse, from the nature of the case, it is impossible in times of peace toarrange for a supply of such men to be on tap.As to the trading classes, they express the utmost patriotism, but it is of arather peculiar kind. It has struck them that the war is doing them immenseharm, and they know full well that a peace concluded now would completetheir ruin. So they are unanimous for a fight to a finish. They would gothemselves if they were not so busy; in the meanwhile, they are volubly in-dignant with the working classes for not going. In point of fact, the need isno longer men or money or munitions; it is morale. The British Tommy willonly follow a gentleman; and most of these have been used up, or belong tothe stage-door class. The soldiers’ trade has been too long despised in En-gland; it has been fine to be an officer, but to know anything about soldieringhas been disgraceful. Those who took their profession seriously have beenhazed in the messes. Result: plenty to follow, and none to lead. You can makea very fair private in six months; but a non-com. or a subaltern cannot beturned out in two years, especially with no elder men to instruct them. So thenew armies are composed of keen eager men, muddled over until they areperfectly sick of the incompetence of their superiors. They are also disgustedto death at the utter hopelessness of the strategists. The Flanders’ proposi-tion was intelligible; but the Dardanelles’ folly has made much discontent.Wounded men are full of gristly tales of that disaster; no food, no ammuni-tion, no shelter, no hospitals, “no ruddy nothing,” as one Sergeant told me.They were flung out, like shooting so much rubbish, on the shore. Further,they are annoyed at the limitations of the fleet. The average man seems tohave thought that the whole peninsula could be blown away by a few hours’bombardment.The working classes as a whole are far more really patriotic than the bour-BEHIND THE FRONT"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1919EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDgeois. But socialism and self-interest have rotted them far more than in Ger-many, where the party is on paper far stronger. The murmur of the Englishslave is silent. I talked with many of the revolution. All would welcome anychange, but none had any idea of constructive revolt. And at heart I thinknobody cared. They were too dull with suffering.

But there is nowhere a particle of real enthusiasm inthe soul; how can there be, when poverty and puritanism have whittled awaythe soul for three generations? Can you imagine a British workman going tothe Nibelung-ring, as the German does in his millions?And the wretched treatment that he has been getting all these years ofpeace and “prosperity” is only accentuated by the war.

The reason of it is variously given as treachery resulting in the shootingof two French generals, failure to receive orders, and various other causes.But the feeling remains that the French did fail to support them, however itmay have happened. And as the British expedition was pretty well wiped out,one can understand the soreness of the feeling. On the French side is thedeep-seated, inherited distrust of “perfidious Albion.” Every Frenchman knowsinstinctively that if a moment should ever arrive when it would be to England’sinterest to quit or change sides, she would not hesitate for a moment.There is also infinite jealousy between British and Colonial troops. TheColonials are contemptuous of discipline and “boiled collars,” and each manfancies himself a hero. The British retaliate by contempt of the provincial-isms of the Colonials. But worse than all this is the absolute conviction ofScotch, Irish and Welsh troops, as well as of all the Colonial troops, that theyare deliberately sacrificed in battle, in order to spare the English regiments.History, of course, abounds in instances where this has been done. In somecases Celtic regiments have been deliberately shelled by their own artillery.You cannot expect men to fight if they suspect this sort of thing. The feelingin South Wales among the miners against conscription is almost entirely dueto the idea that the Government would be very pleased if their numbers werereduced by 50 per cent. or so. The feeling in Ireland is, of course, well known.It is this absence of solidarity in the nation, or rather nations, which has beenthe eternal stumbling-block. This more than any other is the reason thatconscription has become necessary.Another reason for the unpopularity of the service was the complete in-competence and even carelessness shown by the Government in the earlydays of the war, with regard to providing creature comforts for the men. Theusual red tape has also been employed to a devastating extent in the drawingof allowances. Women who can hardly read and write have been bombardedwith forms which would puzzle a college professor, and expected to fill themout satisfactorily.

Every one was anxious to know the realattitude of the American public toward the war. I explained that the nationalcharacteristics had not in any way been altered by the Atlantic. The Anglo-Saxon was all volubility, sentimentality, and slop. Snobbishness, hypocrisy,and money-bags were the three persons in his trinity. The Irish were jubilant,feeling that the hour of revenge for their long martyrdom had struck at last;but were content to wait and work in the dark for a little longer. The Teutons(I continued) said little. If one judged from the volumes of talk one wouldimagine that nine Americans in ten hated Germany. But the Teuton, realiz-ing that acrimonious conversation does no particular damage, keeps his breathto cool his porridge. I said I regarded it as certain that America could notopenly enter the war without political disruption, possibly of a very violentcharacter. The more thoughtful of those who discussed the matter with meseemed to regard these considerations as an excuse for President Wilson.There was also the argument that America was helping the Allies more bystaying out, than she could do by going in. But everywhere I met the sameingrained assumption that there were no two sides to the question; and thosewho, being incapable of anything but the most superficial thought, reactedsimply to facts without consideration of what they might imply, merely over-flowed with vulgar abuse.I found one man, however, who appeared fairly well acquainted with thereal situation in America. “The whole affair,” he said to me, “is evidentlypolitics and graft. Wilson does not mean to get into trouble at any price,because he knows that it would mean his political ruin. He sends these idioticnotes to us and the Germans, merely in the hope of catching votes. The fatu-ity of his whole proceeding is obvious. Neither we nor Germany are foolishenough to take any notice of him. The old dog has no teeth; and if he had, hewould not dare bite. Why do not the Teutons avoid these tedious diplomaticexchanges by painting their torpedoes in plain letters: ‘Peace on Earth, Good-will towards Men,’ ‘I should hate to be misunderstood,’ ‘With the compli-ments of the season,’ ‘To show our affection for America,’ and re-christenthe U-boats ‘Oscar III,’ ‘IV,’ and so on?

In any case, that is theonly natural state for them. They have lost all idea of liberty. Look at theirBlue Laws and their Lizzie Laws. Look at how they permit themselves to beexploited by people with no moral or social superiority, but merely greaterskill in robbery. Look at the way in which they endure our impudence, whichis far greater than any Germany has given them. Trust me, we’ll make an-other India of the U. S.

Evidently the war has been too muchfor his poor mind.I had only been about ten days in London when my psychological studieswere definitely interrupted in a manner wholly unexpected. I asked an oldfriend named Carruthers to join me in a chop at the Club, and we had reachedthe coffee (fortunately) before the waiter appeared and informed me that agentleman was waiting to see me on business. I guessed that the blow hadfallen, and went out as a sheep to slaughter. I was right. A very polite indi-vidual introduced himself as Inspector Simpson; but instead of placing gyvesupon my wrists, he merely hoped that I was well, and could he have thepleasure of a few minutes’ conversation with me? I was, of course, only toodelighted. He then said that the Government was not at all angry with me;they did not wish to prosecute me, oh dear, no, far from us be any suchthought! I realized for the fifteen-hundred-and-forty-first time in my life theinestimable value of family connections and close friends in high places. Itold him, however, as in duty bound, that I should glory in suffering for thetruth. He reminded me that this was England, and that the truth would neverappear. I had no further remarks to make. Well, I said, “What can I do foryou? If you don’t want to prosecute me — what is it? Do you want to makeme Foreign Secretary? You might do worse. I would have the boys out of thetrenches by Easter. It only needs a little give and take, a little common-sense.”No, he said, the position was this: Averse as they were to any public scandal,the press would certainly get wind of my presence in London, and embarrassthe Government by insisting upon making a fuss.

His paws retracted for a moment, exhibiting the clawsbeneath, still in a half hidden way. He was very sorry, he said, but his orderswere formal. He was sure that I would not put him to the inconvenience ofgetting them changed. There was such a lot of red tape about these trifles. . . .I knew what he meant, and agreed. So I excused myself to my guest, took ataxi down to my lawyer’s home in the country, and spent the night settling upmy business. In the morning Simpson took me down to Tilbury in his car,and put me on to a transport, one of six. There must have been fifteen totwenty thousand men aboard. Our little flotilla steamed out of the Thames,and the following morning I was put off on to a fishing smack which took meinto Flushing. I was terribly puzzled at the time, to know what on earth theseships were doing sailing north. But the mystery is now clear, from informa-tion received. It appears that there are still so many spies in such places asCalais and Dover, that they do not care to send transports through the Chan-nel, as their presence is sure to be reported to the enemy; they therefore sendthem around the north of Scotland into the Atlantic where their destinationcould not be spied upon.As for me, I went to stay with a good friend of mine near Amsterdam,where I was joined by someone from Berlin who had a special desire to hearmy news, and communicate his own. A small and selected part of the veryinteresting conversation which I had with him may form the subject of an-other paper. He went back after three days, and as for me, once more I con-cealed myself and sailed for the Land of the Free by the Ryndam, where myknowledge of English was increased by the personal instruction of FatherNeptune as to the meaning of the term seasickness."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"2424DELENDA EST BRITANNIA(Being a prologue and epilogue to “The Vampire of the Continent”)(In previous issues of THE FATHERLAND we have commented upon Count Ernst zu Reventlow’smasterpiece, “The Vampire of the Continent.” Our comments represented the opinion of Americanson this remarkable work. We herewith publish Aleister Crowley’s analysis of the book. Mr. Crowleyis an Irishman, a member of Cambridge University and a poet of fine distinction. Frederic Harrison,Editor of the “English Review,” stated some time ago that Mr. Crowley was the first metrical artist inthe English language since Swinburne.)COUNT ERNST ZU REVENTLOW’S extraordinarily lucid and cogentwork on historic English policy has one fault from the point of view ofthe philosopher — he does not begin his history early enough, or derive thepiracy of England from necessity. Will the distinguished publicist pardon usif we attempt to fill the gap?It is notorious that mountaineers are necessarily brigands. In their rockyfastnesses wheat will not grow, sheep will not grow fat. They are condemnedto rough cereals like oats, to small and stringy sheep and goats. The dwellersof the plain care nothing for the products of the mountain, and will not sur-render their goods except by force. The highlander consequently becomes acateran or brigand. The mountain districts of every country in the world —Scotland, Spain, India, China, or America — prove the correctness of thetheory.A similar proposition may be made with regard to islanders, as opposed tocontinental powers. The natural first industry of islands is fishing, in itself apiratical occupation. Just as mountaineers become hardy and desperate throughthe necessity of battling with the elemental forces of nature, so do fishermen.And when continental settlements begin to ship their merchandise by sea,they soon excite the envy of the fishermen, whose hardihood and desperatepoverty emboldens them to become pirates.IN course of time the continental powers find it necessary to build a navy,to wreck these nests of pirates in self-protection, and the usual result is,that the island is annexed to the continent, and its people properly policed,become tranquil, they may even be turned into excellent citizens, since theypossess the material of courage and energy in that degree which originallystarted them on their piratical career.But where the island, while retaining in the full its insular characteristics,is large enough and strong enough to develop into a sovereign state, thesporadic piracies of its aborigines become incorporated in the policy of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2525EXCERPTS FROM THE FATHERLANDnation. A nucleus is formed, usually upon the banks of some great river, andthe central authority is not slow to perceive that the welfare of its increasingpopulation depends upon sea-power. The history of all island nations illus-trates this view. Islands form the natural stronghold of every lawless race.However extended a sea coast may be, it may yet be turned; if a hinterlandexists, the pirates can be suppressed by overland attack. Thus we see that theVikings soon lost their power, the Danish ships of war were ultimately con-quered, not upon the sea, but by attacks upon their base. Venice was de-stroyed from the rear. The sea power of Holland fell, not so much because ofBritish victories on the North Sea, but because the country itself was unableto resist internal pressure. We know how easily England herself was turnedout of France; and to this day she has never been able to make good herfooting in any country requiring an army to defend it. India is practically anisland, owing to the impossibility of invasion from the north. Yet India hasalways been understood by England as her weak point. Egypt, by reason ofdeserts, is almost an island, yet there again is a weak point. Canada is politi-cally an island, owing to the inveterate pacificism of the inhabitants of theUnited States. Gibraltar is only joined to the main land by a bare and narrowneck, which can easily be swept by the gunfire from the rocks. But since therange of modern artillery has increased so greatly that Gibraltar can be shelledfrom the hills beyond Algeciras, it has been recognized by military authori-ties that the fortress is indefensible, and proposals have actually been madeto abandon it. We can see England’s new fear of Spain in her policy towardsthat country, in her haste to place an English princess in the arms of thesuccessor of Charles V. Further east we find Malta, an island — Aden, insu-lated by many miles of the most inhospitable desert in the world — Ceylon,the navel base of India, an island — Penang, an island — Singapore, anisland — Hongkong, an island. When England obtained possession of Wei-hai-wei she was compelled to abandon it without a struggle after a few years.Similarly the English outposts in the Pacific and in the West Indies are allislands. British Honduras can hardly be called a British colony at all, theconditions there are very exceptional.TO turn to other island powers, history shows us the same picture. Allsuccessful Corsairs have been invulnerable by land. The islands of theMediterranean have always been strongholds of pirates. The situation of Ja-pan in the east is singularly like that of England in the west. Rome only beatCarthage after the destruction of her sea-power, by dint of using her com-mand of the Mediterranean to land an army in Africa and attack Carthage byland. The power of Spain was not destroyed by the dispersion of the Armada,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2626but by her disasters in the Netherlands.From all this we perceive easily that England is not at all to be blamed forher piracies. Her situation compelled it. We must further remember that notonly were the original inhabitants of Great Britain of a predatory disposition,but the invaders who conquered England in part and mingled with the in-habitants were all sea-rovers: the Norsemen, the Danes, the so-called Sax-ons, and the Normans, were all brigands who were being pushed off thecontinent because their ravages had become intolerable to civilized people. Itis therefore criminally unthinking in us to blame England for her policy ofpiracy. She is of necessity a pirate, by situation and by heredity. It would beequally absurd to blame the crocodile or the tiger. Even England’s hypocrisymust not shock us. It must be regarded in the light of a tribute paid to conti-nental virtue. . . . Perhaps we might even be optimistic enough to suggestthat it represents the beginning of a conscience. This much being conceded,we must no longer regard England with detestation and contempt. To do so isunreasonable, and therefore immoral. We must not shed crocodile tears overthe crocodile. But on the other hand, we cannot tolerate the crocodile. Weneed to cross the river, in the pursuit of our peaceful avocations, and we mustfind the weak spot in the armor of the crocodile and give him to our hand-maidens for a play! This weak spot is evidently to be found in Ireland. WhenIreland becomes a sovereign, independent state, a good deal will have beendone. But this is not nearly enough.THOSE politicians who are so soft-hearted, or soft-headed, that theytalk of peace with England must be utterly blind to the lessons of his-tory and geography. “Britannia est delenda” should be the one motto of everycontinental politician. Does not France understand that the strangle hold of1814 has only become the embrace of 1914 that it may turn again into astrangle hold in 2014? Count zu Reventlow is admirable beyond words in hisdemonstration that England has never been bound by blood or sentiment orhonor, but only by business considerations. England is already consideringat this moment whether it would not be better to throw over France and cometo an agreement with Germany. The only thing that restrains her is her fearof the German fleet. Such political insight as I am proud to share with Countzu Reventlow declares that any peace concluded between England and anyother nation is a Judas kiss.There is only one solution to the problem of English piracy: the sover-eignty of England must be destroyed once and for all. England herself hasunderstood this with admirable, if devilish, clarity.

She must be made to swallow a dose of her ownmedicine. England must be divided up between the continental powers. Shemust be a mere province, or, better still, colony of her neighbors, France andGermany.Peace with England, at this time would be a crime against humanity. TheBritish fleet is unassailable; in spite of German valor it has remained practi-cally intact. While this is so, England, at any moment, without giving anyother reason but moral indignation (which is her principal industry and neverlikely to run short), can throttle the whole world. Those who talk of peace atthis time must therefore be unhesitatingly suppressed. No matter what maybe our sufferings and sacrifices, we must go on to the end. We must die, thathumanity may live.NOW, there is only one way to destroy the power of England: the coun-try must be conquered. And before it is conquered it must be invaded,or starved into surrender, such surrender to involve the destruction, or hand-ing over, of her whole fleet. Now, before England can either be starved orinvaded, her fleet must be either destroyed or rendered impotent. There isonly one way to do this: it is by ruthless prosecution of submarine warfare.While England’s fleet exists, trade with America could always be stopped,when it suited British policy to do so. The only thing for Germany to do is toconcentrate the whole of her intelligence and power upon the building andmanning of submarines, in such numbers, and of such excellence, that En-gland is starved, and her fleet destroyed. If it takes ten years — or a hundredyears — it must be done. From the broadest standpoint of humanity, nothingelse is really worth doing.Let Germany make peace with France and Russia — if we must talk peace.Let her give up, if necessary, the territory which it has cost so much bloodand treasure to take and hold. Let her do this, that she may be able to concen-trate her whole power against the vampire.Count zu Reventlow has found the word of the situation: that word “vam-pire.” Let him look therefore to tradition. It is not enough to kill a vampire inthe ordinary way. Holy water must be used, and holy herbs. It must be sev-ered, limb from limb, its heart torn out, and a charred stake thrust through it.If one precaution is omitted, the vampire lives again, to prey upon the inno-cent and the just.

For its refrain was that theEnglishman was the most devilishly clever diplomat in the world. He wasthe Mephistopheles of politics. If the continent had had the Anglo-Saxontrick of following its opponents in fiction, the British spy would have been toit what the German spy, the Japanese spy, the Mexican spy are to our modernmovie fans.This estimate was a good one. England, with minuscule resources, hasalways managed to outmaneuver the cleverest enemies, against incredibleodds. The policies of Elizabeth, of Cromwell, of Pitt stood as the David-Goliath victories of all time. There is no parallel in history. Greece resistedPersia by superior valour; Rome grew by conquest and assimilation; England’sEmpire, alone, is the creation of sheer statecraft.But just as Herod in his pride was doomed to be slain by the smallest of allGod’s creatures, so England. Infernally clever as she is in all other respects,in one point she is more stupid than one could think possible. That nation isIreland. It is not a story of one foolish minister; it is a tale of seven hundredyears of consistent imbecility. King after king broke his shins by stumblingagainst the Irish bog-oak; Richard II. lost his crown, and plunged Englandinto a century of civil war, over his Irish wars. Statesman after statesman losthis reputation and his head, over Ireland; general after general buried hisfame there. The Stuarts foundered there, even they; but for Strafford and theIrish tangle, Charles I. would have been “Beloved”; and Cromwell, astuteand unscrupulous as he was, could do nothing in the Green Isle but massa-cre.

Vigorously pro-Ally as I am in the present juncture, I cannot place the whole blame of therecent revolution in Ireland upon the Irish.ON July 3, 1915, I proclaimed the Independence of Ireland at the footof the Statue of Liberty. But I did not intend to interpret that “inde-pendence” as “dependence on Germany!” The German temperament is surelythe one thing more antagonistic to the Irish than the English temperament.There is no sense of what a German would call order in the Irish mind; allIrishmen have genius in its worst form! Hence it was utterly ridiculous of theEnglish to try to prove that the martyrs of last Easter were “bribed by theGermans.” For one thing, you can’t bribe people whose action, if successful,gives them control of the wealth of a whole country, whose failure doomsthem to the gallows. But British stupidity never hesitated. While all America,even violently pro-Ally America, was vomiting with horror and disgust atthe murders of Pearse, Conolly, Skeffington and the rest, she calmly pro-ceeded to vilify her victims. She did not even have the sense to see that themere date of the Revolution — Holy Week — would inevitably link Pearse inthe Catholic mind with the hero of the “World’s Tragedy,” and so make hisname a rallying-cry of anti-English sentiment for the lifetime of Christianity.Not content with hanging Casement in cold blood, though every one evenin England knew him for a harmless idealist with a touch of the crank inhim, she branded him by secret slander — not daring to publish the allegedevidence against him — as “immoral” in a particular sense which to allinformed memories merely recalled the theft of the Crown Jewels of DublinCastle by the servants of the crown.TO attribute what the French call “le vice anglais” to Casement was toofunny.
