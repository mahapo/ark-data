[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"London CallingFreed at last from what he saw as “the crazy, petty atmosphere of army life”,1Julian left thedepot at Southend on the morning of Monday 9 August 1943, which he thought of as“Release Day”.2He then made his way to the station and boarded the London train. Itshypnotic rhythm soon lulled him to sleep, his slumber apparently animated by anexhilarating dream in which the entire plot of The Hunted Manreeled through his head.Scene after scene was visualised with the clarity of a movie. All that remained now was tocapture the whole thing on paper. As planned, he moved into the flat he’d found. To celebrate his emancipation hetreated himself to an extravagant shopping spree, unwittingly reprising his father’syouthful improvidence. Of the money Jonathan Cape had paid him, he spent most of it ona flashy new wardrobe. Reacting against such a prolonged period of being confined todrab army uniforms, he kitted himself out with a crimson jacket and cream suit, both incorduroy, plus a black astrakhan-collared coat, a maroon cummerbund, a mustard-yellowwaistcoat, and a silk Schiaperelli tie with a bold pattern of French newspaper headlines onit. He also acquired a pair of sunglasses, a rare accoutrement then, rendered doublyunusual by their American aviator-style frames. He took to wearing these most of the time,even when he was groping through the blackout, his unwillingness to remove themprovoking wearyingly repetitive enquiries as to whether he was blind, or disfigured, orwore them “to hide behind because of a psychological need.”3The desired gangsterishconnotations were diluted by the rest of his outfit, the cream suit more evocative of theRiviera, the malacca cane more redolent of the fin-de-sièclefoppishness he’d embraced asa teenager. In an era of uniformity, of wartime austerity, his appearance ensured that hewas as conspicuous as a Technicolor interloper in a monochrome movie. And it arousedinevitable suspicion that he was, in the parlance of the day, queer. Proudly attired in his latest get-up, his coat habitually draped round his shoulders inthe style of a smooth but sinister Hollywood hoodlum, he passed the long summerevenings reacquainting himself with the riotous wartime Soho pub scene. Sometimes hewent to the huge, high-ceilinged Swiss Tavern on Old Compton Street, its subduedlighting lending it a murky intimacy. Normally abbreviated to “the Swiss”, it had a raffishambience that made it popular with painters and writers – Julian’s old acquaintance MulkRaj Anand among them – who didn’t mind the tarnished walls and the barman’s dirt-soiled white mess jacket. Unable to afford pricey bottles of black market booze, he had torely on the normal quota of, at most, two pints of beer each night. Drinking there oneevening, Julian got into conversation with the wiry, lean-featured conscientious objector,would-be writer, and fellow Graham Greene aficionado, Stephen Fothergill, who made themistake of telling him the story of how he’d been banned from a nearby pub “on account117"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of his staggering.”4From that moment onwards Julian, quick to reduce people to thestatus of eccentric supporting characters in his personal drama, called him “StaggeringStephen”.5Onanother night there, soon after his arrival in the capital, Julian was buttonholed bythe flamboyant, ruthlessly egotistical Tamil editor of Poetry London, Jim Tambimuttu. Slimand somewhat pale-skinned with sinuous black hair, his appearance made even moredistinctive by his battered calf-length blue overcoat, buttoned to the chin against the cold,its velvet collar turned up, “Tambi” – as he liked to be known – was then at the height ofhis renown as a literary impresario. Appropriately enough for the man who claimed tohave coined the term Fitzrovia, Tambi squandered the majority of his time in pubs andcafés, seldom without a flock of awestruck hangers-on, captivated by his bohemianglamour, his courteous, disarmingly relaxed and cordial manner, not to mention his deepand melodious voice, the vowel sounds elongated, the confiding phrase “y’know”peppering his speech. Within a few minutes Julian too had been swept along on one of hisnightly pub crawls, theirdeparture supposedlyprefaced by Tambi’ssolemn warning againstthe danger of contracting“Sohoitis”,6of “stay[ing]there always day and nightand get[ting] no workdone ever.”7It was not to the Swissbut to Soho’s northernannexe that Julian moreoften gravitated. Sincehe’d first got to know thearea, the Fitzroy Tavernhad remained physicallyunaltered, yet it had lost its bohemian cachet, its decline hastened by the annoyingnumber of gawping sightseers who converged on it. Indeed, it was well on the way tobecoming more famous as a homosexual pick-up joint, mainly frequented by sailors. Thereputation of the place, sufficient for it to be declared out of bounds for army personnel atone stage, was confirmed by the presence of Paul, the bearded, kilt-wearing pianist – earsadorned with little gold earrings, wrists sheathed by bangles – who played stride pianoand sang bawdy songs in a camp, high-pitched voice. Conscious of the Fitzroy’sassociations Julian preferred the Wheatsheaf. In the run-up to 6.00pm, he’d be waitingoutside the front door. When opening time at last arrived, he’d breeze through the PublicBar and into the Saloon Bar, always making a beeline for the extreme lefthand end of thecounter, where it was easiest to get served. One elbow propped on the back of the tall118THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSSJ.M. Tambimuttu (right) giving a talk about T.S. Eliot, 1942 (© BBC Photo Library)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"settle to his right, he would stand there, casting an ironic, surprisingly observant eye overthe noisy, jostling throng, his upright posture emphasising his height, his already preciseand inhibited gestures constricted by the paucity of space. Neither the faint smell of foodfiltering down from the upstairs billiard-cum-dining room, nor the plangent wail of air-raidsirens, nor the dull thud of exploding bombs and the accompanying stutter of anti-aircraftfire could dislodge him from the Saloon Bar, its reassuringly cosy atmosphere enhancedby the tight-fitting blackout boards over the windows. Periodically, though, he had torelinquish his spot, wriggle through the crowd and up the packed stairs to the gents’. If hereturned to discover that his place at the bar had been usurped, he would slowly butinexorably shoulder aside the intruder. Finding himself in the company of devoted drinkers, nursing their precious pints, hebegan to increase his alcohol intake. Most of the time he drank acidic, suspiciously wateryScotch Ale, served by an ill-assorted trio of bar staff. The landlady was a short, plumpspinster named Mona Glendenning, who ran the place with her similarly rotund brother,Redvers, and his wife, Frances, a spindly woman in a tweed suit and pince nez. Except onSundays when he wore a battered-looking suit, Redvers – “Red” for short – favouredshirtsleeves and braces, his stomach spilling over the waistband of his trousers. Inrecognition of Julian’s growing value as a customer, Red started providing him with extrabeer and the odd additional measure of strictly rationed White Horse whisky. Unlike the Fitzroy, the clientele of the Wheatsheaf tended to be a less boisterous, morediverse group. The predominantly middle and upper middle-class artistic and literarytypes, whose appearances tended to coincide with when they were on leave from themilitary, coexisted but seldom interacted with a fluid blend of businessmen, civil servants,black marketeers, criminals, deserters, elderly locals, and the occasional whore. While thepubs in the southern sector of Soho were overrun by foreign soldiers, sailors and airmenas well as male and female prostitutes taking a breather from servicing the servicemen, theWheatsheaf’s comparative distance from the West End meant that few of the foreigners orthe whores found their way there. An exception was the demure-looking prostitutenicknamed “Sister Ann”. Outside the evening rush hour when she stood on TottenhamCourt Road, snagging prospective clients as they walked towards the tube, she was oftento be seen loitering in the corridor between the two bars, her subdued appearance givingno indication of her trade. Two of the Wheatsheaf’s most loyal customers were Wilf, an ancient member of theHome Guard, a line of medals arrayed across his chest, some of which dated from the ZuluWars; and a tiny, cantankerous octogenarian named Mrs Stewart, rumoured to have been abeautiful streetwalker in her youth. Always neatly clad in an anachronistic black dress, shewould, like Julian, arrive punctually at opening time and head for the Saloon Bar. In avoice so garbled she was barely intelligible, she’d buy herself a bottle of Guinness and siton the settle directly behind him, a newspaper spread out across the table, timing herselfwith an alarm clock as she ploughed through a crossword puzzle. As Julian — a self-confessed crossword addict — was to discover, she’d take umbrage if anyone tried to help119LONDONCALLING"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"her with a tricky clue. She could also be offhand with well-meaning people whovolunteered to stand her a drink. But Julian was so solicitous of her welfare, his attitudetowards her chivalrous if a shade condescending, she soon accepted him, along with thedrinks he bought her. In the course of his visits to the Saloon Bar, he came across all its other stalwarts.There was the strapping, overtly lesbian novelist, Kaye Dick, emphasising the aptness ofher surname with mannish clothes. There was Charles Wrey Gardiner, the amiable,bespectacled, formally attired proprietor of the Grey Walls Press, which Julian dubbed“the Grey Balls Press”.8There was the venerable, floppy-hatted Augustus John, sitting atthe other end of the bar, eavesdropping on whatever was going on around him. Therewere the two Roberts, Colquhoun and MacBryde, very different painters from AugustusJohn, both Scots, both belligerent and caustic yet as inseparable as the most devotedyoung married couple. There was the drug-addicted, homosexual John Booth-Palmer,secretary to the theatre critic James Agate. There was the charismatic, long-faced youngartist John Minton, “boyishly diffident”9in “the blue reefer jersey he usually wore.”10There was the sardonic hack James Graham-Murray (better known by the sobriquet,“James the Shit”), respectable-looking were it not for three or four missing front teeth,the legacy of a misjudged quip. And there was the exhibitionistic, sexuallyundiscriminating painter Nina Hamnett. Then in her late fifties, her face mottled andpuffy, her teeth decayed, her figure concealed beneath fetid and shapeless secondhandclothes, her helmet-like hairstyle topped by a beret she never seemed to remove, shecarried herself with panache, undaunted by her miserable circumstances or meagrefinances, greeting friends and acquaintances with a jaunty “Hullo, ducks!” Every so oftenshe’d go round rattling the tin where she kept her money, soliciting donations with thewell-worn phrases, “Got any mun, dear?” or “You couldn’t buy me a drink, could you,love?” For the price of a beer, she would tell oft-repeated anecdotes about heroutrageous and happy-go-lucky existence in 1920s Montparnasse, about modelling forGaudier-Brzeska, hobnobbing with Picasso, dancing naked for Van Dongen, meetingJames Joyce, and chalking up affairs with Rodin and Modigliani. “Modi said I had the besttits in Europe,” she was fond of remarking. At the faintest provocation, she’d peel backher pullover to reveal breasts far better preserved than the rest of her. “You feel them,”she’d say. “They’re as good as new.”11Other intermittent patrons of the Saloon Bar included the abstemious, thirty-something Quentin Crisp, dressed in the functional uniform of wartime women, a jacketworn over a blouse, trousers and medium-heeled lace-up shoes, hair meticulously coiffedand hennaed, fingernails glossy with lacquer, face subtly made up. Equally irregularvisitors were Toni del Renzio, spewing tall stories about being related to the Romanoffsand having inherited the Italian title, “Count del Renzio”; Stephen Spender and JohnLehmann, both radiating a palpable sense of unease in such flamboyant company; GeorgeOrwell, taciturn and watchful, pausing just long enough for a quick half; the ageingaesthete, Norman Douglas, sheltering in England for the duration; as well as the notorious120THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Aleister Crowley, now overweight and seedy, his speech hesitant and doped. Aside fromdel Renzio and Crowley, the latter of whom claimed to have set fire to the lining of Julian’scoat by putting a spell on it, Julian came to be on good terms with all these part-timeWheatsheaf-ites.Whereas most of the regulars affected a heavily stubbled, self-consciously rumpledlook, Julian was always scrupulously clean-shaven and fastidiously turned out. To go withhis cigarette holder, cane, and furled gloves, he took to wearing a fresh pink carnation inhis buttonhole and dispensing pinches of snuff to his acolytes. All part of the persona of“Julian the Writer”12which he’d created. Such was his aura of impending literary stardom,of someone possessing a privileged insight into the world, a huddle of admirers, many ofthem girls, attracted by his poise and good looks, would indulge him. They’d buy himdrinks, play Spoof with him (which earned him yet more free drinks), and challenge himto name the characters and publication details of obscure novels. His memory was soexceptional, his reading so phenomenal, spanning nineteenth and twentieth-centuryEnglish, French, and American fiction, he’d invariably meet the challenge.The group clustered round Julian also provided a convenient audience for hiswaggishly outrageous pronouncements and interminable monologues, punctuated bylong drags on his cigarette holder. Brushing aside any attempts at small talk, he’d holdforth about the books and films he admired, quoting passages or acting out scenes with noeffort to distinguish the characters by modifying his voice or gestures. He’d talk about themechanics of publishing. He would, assuming there were no women within earshot, tellsmutty stories and brag about his sexual exploits – something he’d never been prone to121LONDONCALLINGAnnie Allchild (right) working in the Saloon Bar of the Fitzroy Tavern, c.1943 (© Sally Fiber)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"do in the past. He’d eulogise the suave villainy, the scene-stealing brio of the Hollywoodactors Sydney Greenstreet and Eduardo Cianelli. He’d discourse knowledgably on thecareers of infamous murderers such as Henrik de Jong and Eugen Weidmann. And he’dproclaim the books, plays, and filmscripts he planned to write, Weidmann forming arecurrent subject. At other times he’d recite anecdotes, culled from his experience, their cast oftenrecruited from among his fellow drinkers. Each anecdote would be told again and again,every retelling accruing embellishments and carrying it further from its source. Bit by bit, itwould gain authority as well, the drama becoming more distilled, the dialogue terser andmore incisive. Eventually it would reach a point where it stopped evolving, at which it wasready to be transcribed in his obsessively neat handwriting and then submitted to the editorof a magazine, the story’s title as carefully considered and well-tested as the tale itself. His ostentatious bearing and seemingly impenetrable forcefield of affectation alienatednumerous Wheatsheaf-ites, who restricted their dealings with him to distant nods andmimed hullos. Yet he could be “genuinely kind and approachable”.13When he wasintroduced to the young aspiring writer Derek Stanford, who had published what,Stanford himself conceded, was a “bogus”14essay on Wyndham Lewis in the FortuneAnthology, he could have made some sneering comment. Instead, he congratulatedStanford “in the most genial fashion.”15Apart from the way his normally unobtrusive eyelids lowered as the hours drifted by,Julian was capable of consuming any available alcohol with no tangible effect. He was soinordinately proud of this that he often used to boast about it. Slowly but steadily soakingup the booze, he’d cling tenaciously to his spot at the bar until closing time approached.Or until the supply of beer ran out – a common occurrence on particularly busy nights inmost wartime pubs, where chalked signs declaring NO DRINK would spring up. Once last orders had been called just before 10.30pm, the familiar cry of “timegentlemen, please” cutting across the hubbub, Julian would take advantage of a fortuitousdiscrepancy in the licensing laws. Due to the different regulations operated by the twoboroughs of Holborn and Marylebone, the boundary of which ran right down the middleof Charlotte Street, the pubs on the opposite side of the street from the Wheatsheaf closedhalf an hour later. As did those on the other side of Oxford Street, the main section ofSoho falling under the aegis of the City of Westminster. Picking his way past the fights thatraged most nights in the street outside, past the swaying drunks who shouted slurredinsults in his direction or launched unprovoked attacks, his trusty cane coming in handyas a means of defending himself, Julian would sometimes simply transfer to the Marquis ofGranby or the Duke of York. Unless, of course, they had run out of drink already. Positioned at the tip of the diagonal intersection between Rathbone Place andRathbone Street, the Marquis had a well-deserved reputation for rowdiness. Its sleazyclientele mostly comprised small-time gangsters, bookies, guardsmen, and homosexualson the lookout for rough trade, their amorous advances often precipitating punch-ups. IfJulian wasn’t in the mood to brave the hurly-burly of the Marquis, he’d navigate his way122THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"through the blackout – fragments of shrapnel crunching underfoot – to the other end ofRathbone Street, where the Duke of York offered a less hectic alternative. While its PublicBar tended to be packed with the bearded, heavy-fringed, proto-beatniks whom Juliantermed “Bums”,16the posher Saloon Bar was occupied by the literary crowd. Behind thecounter, staffed by the irascible “Mad Major” – Major Alf Klein – and his wife Blanche, anorthodox Jew who insisted on the pub closing during religious holidays, there was a largeplacard proclaiming the landlord “The Prince of Good Fellows”. Not that he displayedmuch fellowship towards some of his bohemian customers, his high-handed attitudetowards them earning Julian’s dislike. Alternatively Julian would join the column of laughing, shouting, shrieking revellerslurching southwards into Soho proper. Beyond the funereal Black Horse, on the finalstretch of Rathbone Place, its narrow frontage giving no indication of its roomy, unalluringinterior, he and his drinking buddies would turn rightonto Oxford Street, then left down Dean Street,arriving at the vibrant, scruffy Highlander just in time,if they were lucky, to squeeze in an extra pint. When the two Roberts weren’t in the Wheatsheaf,they were usually to be seen amid the perspiringcrowd that jammed into the Highlander’s pair of tiny,smoky bars. It was there that Julian first nervedhimself to speak to “the wolfishly lean and sullen”17Robert Colquhoun. Having seen the latest exhibitionof his paintings that afternoon, Julian went up toColquhoun to congratulate him, only to be branded aphoney by the “gloweringly offensive”,18Glaswegian-accented painter. After the Highlander closed, Julian would moveon to one of a plethora of cheap, handily placed cafésand restaurants. Occasionally he ventured down StGiles High Street, its pavements dotted withpredatory homosexuals loitering near a French-stylepissoir. Signposted by the obligatory heterosexualcouple enjoying a quick knee-trembler against thewall, there was an unpromising doorway leading tothe spacious, seedy basement that housed thestrangely-titled Coffee An’. There you could get coffee an’ something else, though itsimpoverished clientele tended to miss the point, assuming instead that it was really called“the Café Anne”. Its brusque and swarthy staff, renowned for their readiness to threatenunruly customers with knives, served nothing more sophisticated than horsemeat steaksand salami sandwiches. These were eaten at long refectory tables, a couple of scrawnyalsatians loping hungrily round them. Against the backdrop of a large, crudely executed123LONDONCALLINGCount Potocki of Montalk, c.1940"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"mural depicting a contemporary reinterpretation of the crucifixion, the Roman soldiersportrayed as jackbooted Nazis with swastiki armbands, their faces concealed behindsinister gas masks, writers and artists sat side by side with crooks and deserters, drawn toSoho because they could survive there without a ration book by purchasing unrestrictedfoods like salami, horsemeat, pigeon, and even sparrow.On his visits to the Coffee An’, Julian would have seen the New Zealand-born CountPotocki of Montalk, who was there most nights, gorging himself on what was reputedto be the cheapest food in Soho. Not content with asserting that he was the rightfulheir to the throne of Poland, Count Potocki also claimed to be the Grand Duke ofLithuania, Hospidar of Moldavia, and High Priest of the Sun. His waist-length hairplaited and tied with a girlish bow, he wore sandals, a billowing scarlet medieval robewith a silver star emblazoned on the front, and a heavy-looking gold chain round hisneck with an ornate medallion on the end, the whole risible ensemble topped by eithera crown or a velvet cap. He always carried with him a small stack of The Right Review,the hand-printed magazine that he hawked round the West End streets, its pages filledwith a bizarre combination of decorous woodcuts, poems by writers such as LawrenceDurrell, mad anti-semitic tirades, and convoluted genealogical justifications for hiswide-ranging titular claims. Anyone prepared to pay for the Count’s meal would begranted a knighthood, the recipient forced to kneel down while the ritual wasperformed. Only a few months earlier, the Count had been lambasted by the nationalpress for ennobling a deserter.As a rule, Julian tended to make for three of the fractionally more upmarket eateries inthe environs of the Wheatsheaf. One of these, at 91 Charlotte Street, was Tony’s, anunsalubrious ground floor café and cramped cellar restaurant where black market steakand eggs were served. Mainly patronised by spivs, huddled together in furtiveconversation, plus pimps and their heavily made-up girls, each clutching a cheap handbag,“it was a place of ‘deals’ settled by a nod”19and “money exchanged at the exact moment aparcel slipped surreptitiously under the table.”20Downstairs, braving the reek of friedonions and dry rot, Julian and a lot of writers, artists and misfits, notably Quentin Crisp,would sit at dirty white tables, eating and chatting. His other favourite post-pubdestinations were a small Greek restaurant on Rathbone Place, and the rough and ready,sparsely furnished Scala, on Charlotte Street, where nothing cost more than about half-a-crown. The Scala’s speciality was the misleadingly titled Vienna Steak, in truth aparticularly unedifying form of rissole. As a satisfying epilogue to his night’s drinking andsocialising, he’d order goose pilaf from the Greek restaurant, Welsh Rarebit from Tony’s,or spaghetti bolognese from the Scala, washed down by a carafe of cheap, astringent redwine, and a cup of strong black coffee.Considering how he’d come to detest service life, it is ironic that Julian’s first publicationafter his discharge was a comic tale called I Like It In The Army, featured in the secondissue of the hardback anthology Bugle Blast. From his stockpile of army stories, he also124THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"sold two more to Kaye Webb, editor of Lilliput. Besides which, he succeeded in placingMandrake, an appealing piece about his childhood in the south of France, with JohnO’London’s Weekly, the literary tabloid newspaper. Despite racking up all these sales he was soon running short of cash. In pursuit of ascreenwriting job, he made use of his existing connection with the Films Division of theMinistry of Information. He arranged to meet the bulky, floppy-haired Arthur Calder-Marshall and his radiant wife Ara straight after they’d finished work one evening. Thevenue was the Horseshoe Tavern, a huge, spartan hotel-turned-pub next to the Dominioncinema, right on the junction between Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. Onhearing that Julian wanted to take up the earlier offer to find him work at the Ministry,where he had set his sights on a screenwriting job, the Calder-Marshalls whisked him fromthere to the Highlander, intent on helping him to make some useful but unspecifiedcontact. In its sedate early evening incarnation, the appetising aroma of sausage rolls andother hot snacks permeating both bars, the Highlander was scarcely recognisable. Itsproximity to the offices of the many small documentary film companies, now flourishingunder the patronage of the Ministry, ensured a high proportion of young film industryemployees among the drinkers. The majority of these were earnest recent graduateswhom Julian referred to as “Slithy Toves”,21“the girls in white blouses and slacks withshoulder-slung bags”,22the boys in “tweed jackets with leather inserts in the elbows”,23their university scarves coiled round their necks. While her husband was ordering their drinks, Ara introduced Julian to someone he’dnever met before, though they were more or less the same age and inhabited the samealcohol fuelled bohemian milieu. His new acquaintance, who had a “narrow white paperyclown’s face of despairing gaiety”24and thick glasses that gave his eyes a lunatic intensity,was the pipe-smoking Scots poet Ruthven (pronounced “Riven”) Todd. Ara’s husky voicemade it sound as if she had introduced Julian to the “Reverend Todd”. There was, in anycase, something clerical about Ruthven’s demeanour. In “a characteristic Ruthven conversational ploy”,25he said that he was responsible forJulian’s discovery as a writer, having persuaded Cyril Connolly to publish him. Juliandidn’t believe Ruthven, yet he may have been telling the truth. Ruthven was, after all,helping out at Horizonat just the time Julian submitted A Bit of a Smash in Madras.Intriguing as Julian found him, Ruthven’s competing talents as a monologuist weredestined to prevent them from translating mutual curiosity into friendship.Clearly awaiting someone’s arrival, the Calder-Marshalls kept watch over the opendoor of the pub. Their vigilance was rewarded by the entry of a thickset man in his earlythirties. Arthur Calder-Marshall guided him over to where Julian and Ara were standing.The newcomer was Donald Taylor, the blandly personable Managing Director of theStrand Film Company.By securing a contract with the Ministry of Information, Strand had established itselfas Britain’s leading producer of documentaries, their morale-raising message imbuedwith a socialist vision of a more equitable future. Through his meeting with Donald,125LONDONCALLING"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"who made a habit of recruiting talented writers irrespective of whether they had anyscreenwriting experience, Julian was offered the job he needed.For a healthy salary of about £10 a week, payable every Friday, he started work at Strandtowards the end of August. The company had a clutch of upstairs offices at 1 GoldenSquare, wedged right in the corner of a large, verdant park near the southern fringe ofSoho. There, amid the clacking and chiming of typewriters, he became part of atriumvirate of screenwriters. His colleagues comprised Dylan Thomas and Phil Lindsay, theheavy-drinking Australian novelist, who was collaborating with Donald on a feature filmscript about the murderous Dr Crippen. Julian’s new boss paired him off with the short, tubby figure of Dylan, assigned them ashared office, and set them to work on a screenplay about the Home Guard. He and Dylanskirted one another warily at first, only establishing a rapport when they went drinking thatevening. From the office they adjourned to the conveniently positioned Café Royal. Arevolving door at the back of the building was screened by some heavy velvet blackoutcurtains. Fumbling through these in the darkness, they’d have found themselves at the footof a shallow, dazzlingly lit flight of stairs. These led up tothe smoky, red plush-upholstered Back Bar, wherebohemians rubbed shoulders with American servicemenand their giggling girlfriends. Julian and his new colleagueplundered the Back Bar’s abundant supply of Irish whisky,its availability a perk of Ireland’s neutrality. After a fewdrinks there, they headed off to the Wheatsheaf, pausing fora glass or two in their favourite Soho pubs, Julian graduallycoming to appreciate Dylan’s exuberance, his charm, hisribald sense of humour, his relish for the lurid and macabre.Except at weekends when Dylan frequently went off toWales, where his wife Caitlin and their baby daughter weresheltering from the bombing, he and Julian now tended tospend their evenings together in the Wheatsheaf.Incompatible as they were in so many ways, not least intheir potentially conflicting predilection for monopolisingconversations and their constant need for admirers from whom to cadge money, theyformed an unlikely alliance. With their loud voices and even louder clothing, Dylanaffecting the style of check suit and matching cap favoured by illegal off-course bookies,they dominated the Saloon Bar. Often they’d discuss their screenwriting work. Or elseDylan would reminisce fondly about Fred Farr, his mentor on The Swansea Evening Post.It was probably through Dylan that Julian got to know his friend and near-contemporary, the critic John Davenport. A broad-shouldered, chubby former wrestler andpoet manqué, he was customarily to be seen with a cowlick of thick black hair droopingover his forehead and a cigarette protruding from his pneumatic lips. Davenport had a126THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSSPhil Lindsay, late 1930s (© Cressida Lindsay)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"well-earned reputation for being bellicose, embittered, tactless, and tetchy. Nevertheless,he struck up another unexpected friendship with Julian, whose narcissism he foundendearingly absurd, whose essential generosity and tolerance excused his “didacticarrogance”,26whose “independence of mind”,27critical acuity and literary gifts Davenportconsidered worthy of respect.But Julian didn’t take to Dylan’s other chum, the equally corpulent Gilbert Wood, whoworked as a scene painter on film sets. Timid when sober but acerbic when drunk, he hadwhat Julian felt was an undeserved reputation as a trenchant wit. Together with Julian,Dylan and Davenport, he formed part of the core of a sizeable Spoof-playing contingent.This was also made up of the cheerful, beer-bellied Welsh poet Keidrych Rhys and hissmartly clothed wife Lynette, her face often haloed by a big black hat; the pudgy-featuredPhil Lindsay; and the habitually tousled, unshaven Canadian-born, English-educated PaulPotts, inveterate scrounger, fervent left-winger and self-styled “People’s Poet From TheCanadian Prairies”. Like Julian and Keidrych, Paul had been ignominiously dischargedfrom the army, though he still dressed in a tatty army-issue greatcoat which flapped opento reveal a stained red shirt, worn with sandals and black corduroy trousers. Two other integral members of the clique were Tambi and his Tamil sidekick AlaguSubramaniam, always abbreviated to “Subra”. The antithesis of Tambi in most respects,Subra was dumpy, indolent, equable, and so reticent he seldom mentioned the shortstories he wrote. Whatever the weather, a long red scarf dangled from his stubby neck. Alawyer-turned-loafer, Subra supported himself by working in a bookshop on SouthamptonRow, where he told people he was the General Manager. In reality he was no more than adogsbody, his income supplemented by stealing books on request. Via Tambi, Julian also met the abstract-expressionist painter Gerald Wilde. Tambiwould sometimes sweep into the pub, trailing Gerald behind him like some faithful butbadly fed mongrel, a startled expression on his prematurely grisled countenance, hisattenuated face wreathed by twin fronds of shaggy ginger hair, his clothes so dirty theylooked as if they belonged to a tramp. Requisitioning a hat from someone, which served asa begging bowl, Tambi would work his way round the pub. His double-jointed fingerspointing in the direction of Gerald, whose unkempt appearance spoke eloquently ofbohemian penury, he’d solicit contributions for “a poor but brilliant artist [...] wholacked not only food but also the materials to express his genius.”28The contents of thehat would then be decanted into Tambi’s pocket, the hat returned to its owner, and around of drinks purchased. If Gerald was lucky, Tambi might treat him to a pint of bitterand a Scotch egg from the restaurant upstairs. Every so often Julian and his entourage were joined by Walter Allen, now living inLondon. Adept at straight-faced teasing, Julian convinced the gullible Walter – who foundhim amusing company – that his cane was really a swordstick he carried in case JohnDavenport attacked him. Moreover, in a casual display of what he referred to as his“absolutely photographic memory”,29he dumbfounded Walter by reciting the entireconcluding chapter of Walter’s prewar novel, Blind Man’s Ditch.127LONDONCALLING"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Two other intermittent members of the group, their appearances restricted towhenever they were on leave from the military, were Mac and a tall, debonair young navalofficer, Oxford cricket blue, and poet by the name of Alan Ross. For him, Julian offered awelcome respite from months of stultifying naval conversation, though the fascinationpalled once Julian had exhausted his extensive repertoire of anecdotes and started torepeat himself. His repertoire included a story about his first day in the army. Thisdescribed how he’d studied “the Routine Orders” pinned to the wall next to his bed.Midway down the list, it stated that “Buttons will be cleaned every day.” On parade nextmorning, the Sergeant Major bellowed at him for not polishing the buttons on hisuniform. Julian supposedly replied, “I’m terribly sorry, but the notice in our hut says‘Buttons will be cleaned every day’, so I’ve been waiting for the fellow to come round andclean them.”30At closing time Julian would often join Tambi, Subra, and whoever else was still in towfor a late night meal in an Indian restaurant on St Giles High Street. Huddled together inthe darkened street after they’d downed their last pints of the evening, he showed themthe lucky bullet he had, with such equivocal results, been carrying round since thesummer before last, its mangled shape momentarily spotlit by someone’s torch. But it slidthrough their fingers and dropped down an adjacent gutter, from where all attempts toretrieve it failed. On nights when Julian wasn’t with Tambi, he’d head for his old haunts, Alan Rossaccompanying him on one of these visits to the Scala, his image of himself as a successfulwriter dictating that he should treat the place as if it was the Ritz. Its menu, spattered withfood stains, was sparse and unvarying, but even that didn’t deter him from studying it withall the eyebrow-flexing care of a gourmet wavering over an array of tempting and esotericdishes. At length he opted for his current favourites: soup, followed by roast beef andvegetables. In dictating his order to the Greek waiter, he gave detailed instructions as tohow he wanted the vegetables and beef cooked. When he’d finished, the incredulouswaiter “ambled across to the serving hatch and bellowed ‘Roast and two veg for His Nibsand his mate.’ Similar consideration was given to the matter of the wine, at the end ofwhich House Red was selected with the same deliberation that others might have given toa rare Mouton-Rothschild.”31Though the easy-going nature of the documentary film world meant there was nopressure on him to keep normal office hours, both he and Dylan showed up at GoldenSquare each morning, regardless of how heavy a night they’d had. Facing one anotheracross their desk, the narrow window beside them framing the spire of the otherwisedevastated Soho church of St Anne’s, they swapped notes on the latest movies they’d seen.And they made a tentative start on the Home Guard script they’d been allocated. Neitherof them knew anything about the subject, so they painstakingly constructed a comedy-thriller set in an imaginary village, possibly a precursor of Llareggub in Under Milk Wood.The village was peopled by Dads’ Army-like eccentrics, who had to contend with aGerman parachutist and a group of Nazi collaborators. Reliant as ever on first-hand128THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"experience for his writing, Julian modelled one of the villagers on Wilf, the ancient HomeGuard who drank in the Wheatsheaf. As a sideline they were encouraged by Donald Taylor, who was planning to move intofeature film production, to discuss the formal possibilities of screenwriting and come upwith ideas for scripts. Julian managed to interest his boss in producing an adaptation ofhis army stories. And, together with Dylan, he devised the outline of a script which theywere going to call either The Whispering Galleryor The Distorting Mirror, inspired bytheir shared passion for thrillers and Gothic horror movies. Anticipating Ealing Studios’masterful Kind Hearts and Coronets, which exploited an identical premise for blacklycomic purposes, it told the story of a distantrelative of the owner of a stately home, whoplots to eliminate everyone in the long path tosuccession. Provided their morning’s work had gonewell, Julian and Dylan would join Phil Lindsayon a trip to the Horseshoe Club, one of manyafternoon drinking venues that thrived becausepubs were prohibited from opening between3.00pm and 6.00pm. Located in a basement at21 Wardour Street, it was approached via alitter-strewn staircase down to a door with aspyhole in it, through which the doormanvetted prospective customers. To Dylan, whowent there on a regular basis, this lent it the low-life frisson of a gambling den orspeakeasy. The more worldly Julian found the place disappointingly tame. All that awaitedthem inside, slouched on the club’s cracked leather sofas, were bookies’ touts, elderlylesbians, and a regiment of bulbous-nosed old men. Because of Dylan’s tendency toconfuse “age with sage”,32he was on the best of terms with most of the old boys,particularly the art critic Tommy Earp, remarkable for his wiry physique, red face,quavering voice, and absurdly exaggerated upper-class accent. Dylan often used to extolhis “subtle deadpan wit”,33but Julian found him boring and a little creepy. Baffled by hisfriend’s tolerance of Earp and his ilk, he stopped going to the Horseshoe. From then on,he and Dylan came to an arrangement whereby they’d take turns manning the office afterlunch, enabling Julian to devote alternate afternoons to his complicated love life. By hisown admission, he was dating “various young women”34at the same time as Scylla, anypotentially awkward phone calls to the office tactfully fielded by Dylan. One of his harem was Monica Foster, a small, well-spoken twenty-year-old who had acarefully made-up face, piercing blue eyes, and shortish curly brown hair, tucked behindher ears. Born with a slight limp that prevented her from wearing high heels and causedher to walk with self-conscious care, she wore flat shoes that made her appear evensmaller than she was. She had just graduated in French and German from Cambridge129LONDONCALLINGAlan Ross (left), 1946 (© Jane Rye)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"University. New to London, where she had enrolled at a secretarial college, Monica wasstaying in Bayswater with her elder sister, Sheila, and brother-in-law, George Viliesid. BothSheila and George, a prewar Soho-ite who had been invalided out of the army, weredevotees of the Wheatsheaf. It was there that Monica had been introduced to Julian by hersister. For Monica, it was probably her first serious sexual relationship. But Julianremained noncommittal, refusing to give her any “real idea what [he] felt about [her].”35While he introduced her to his friends as “the Pinchables”36, she addressed him by theendearing nickname of “Jay”37, also used by Scylla.In the evenings she would often go straight from the secretarial college to theWheatsheaf, where she’d place her handbag on the bar and perch proprietorially on abarstool beside Julian, her head only reaching up to his shoulder, all the while sippingglasses of beer or rough Algerian wine. Whenever the opportunity arose, she’d dropreferences to her student days, a habit that peeved Julian, who was sensitive about his lackof a university education.If he could afford it, after the pubs closed he’d take her to the Gargoyle, a moderatelyexpensive and famously rumbustious Soho club where several of his friends, who weremembers, made a habit of signing in him and Monica as guests. The club was situatedabove a printing works on Meard Street, a grimy, cobbled thoroughfare sometimesfacetiously mispronounced as “Merde Street”. Run by the Hon. David Tennant and hiswife, the revue star Hermione Baddeley, it had been launched in the 1920s to provide a130THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSSDylan Thomas, 1940s (© BBC Photo Library)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"meeting place where artistic and theatrical types could mingle with members of Londonhigh society. By then, its fashionable status was waning, though it continued to attract aloyal and disparate clientele that encompassed John Minton, Nancy Cunard, AugustusJohn, and Bertrand Russell. From the street outside, you could usually hear the sound of laughter and musicleaking through its open windows. Beyond the burly doormen who guarded the narrowentrance and greeted guests with a salute or a deferential touch of their peaked caps,there was a short, dingy passageway that led to a claustrophobic cage-lift, not muchbigger than a phone box. Creaking and rattling as it made its ponderous ascent, it wouldjerk to a halt on the top floor, where a uniformed member of staff would slide open thesqueaky lift door and politely shepherd its occupants across the large, wood-panelledvestibule, the walls of which were hung with Henri Matisse lithographs. At the receptiondesk, customers would sign the guest book before being relieved of unwanted coats andscarves. They were then free to explore the warmly lit club, its patinated fittingsconveying an impression of tarnished opulence. Past the reception desk and thecloakrooms, there was a bar, a chintzy lounge, and a dining room where, in spite ofwartime constraints, the chef upheld its reputation for serving delicious yet relativelyinexpensive French provincial cuisine. Even the dried egg omelettes were more palatablethan those served elsewhere. The bar, not the dining room, was nonetheless Julian’spreferred destination. Eschewing the banquettes along the edge of the room, the lowtables in the middle, or even the bar stools, he liked to stand, more often than notflanked by Dylan Thomas and John Davenport, at the polished mahogany counter, whichspanned the width of the building.Only on rare occasions would he allow himself to be chivvied down the stairsconnecting the bar with the low-ceilinged, L-shaped ballroom. Designed by anincongruous pairing of Matisse and the architect Edwin Lutyens, its windows were hungwith leather curtains decorated with African motifs, its ceiling was encrusted in gold leaf,and its walls were tessellated with glittering mirror-glass. All but a fraction of thefloorspace was taken up by tables and chairs, bounding the generally heaving dance floor.As the night wore on, Alex Alexander’s nattily kitted out four-piece house band would playlouder and louder, the dancing becoming progressively more unrestrained.The Home Guard script, which Julian and Dylan had been having such fun with, wasabruptly cancelled around mid-September. Their brief partnership over, Julian wasredeployed to another project. Still relishing the freedom of civilian life, his work forStrand was juxtaposed with both the social whirl of Soho and spells of working on hisnovel. In contrast to the rigid routine and predictability of the army, “every day seemed agreat new adventure.”38He wasn’t making much headway as a screenwriter but his career in the short storygenre continued to flourish. Y-Listwas selected for inclusion in the forthcoming LittleReviews Anthology, scheduled for release during the build-up to Christmas. Added to131LONDONCALLING"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"which, on the first Friday of September, Tribunepublished A Sentimental Story, hisportrait of an abortive wartime romance. Two more of his stories also made it into printduring October. Alongside pieces by Frank O’Connor and William Sansom, he had one ofthe brief sketches already sold to Lilliputreprinted in a short-lived pocket magazine calledWriting Today. And he had Are You Happy In Your Workpublished in The Saturday Book,edited by Leonard Russell, who maintained “a high opinion”39of his writing despite hisapparent failure to deliver the novel he’d agreed to write. Better still, Russell – displayingwhat Julian regarded as a “sympathetic understanding”40ofthe problems he faced – wasprepared to pay promptly.His sense of himself as a rising star was given further endorsement when NinaHamnett asked if he’d sit for a portrait. One afternoon, in between pub opening hours, hewent back with her to where she lived at 31 Howland Street, only a short walk from theWheatsheaf. Under the prying eyes of her landlady, who observed the comings and goingswith a mixture of suspicion and envy, he tramped right up to her sordid top floor flat-cum-studio, its two rooms littered with unprimed canvases, stretchers, and empty tubes ofpaint. There he posed for her while she executed a watercolour portrait of him.With the onset of winter, Donald Taylor was summoned by the board of directors torepeated crisis meetings at Strand’s studios in Boreham Wood, an air of uncertaintyconsequently suffusing the company. Donald, however, remained buoyant about thefuture, predicting that they’d soon be making features instead of documentaries. Theportents were less encouraging though. Films scheduled to go into production werehalted, the offices becoming a waiting room for bored cameramen and directors. YetJulian, who worried that Donald had grown disenchanted with him, somehow clung on tohis job and kept up his boozy regime.On the evening of Friday 10 December he and Keidrych Rhys were at the bar of theWheatsheaf. As one of them handed a fresh Guinness to Mrs Stewart, who was poring overher crossword, Keidrych became aware of a dark-haired, high-cheekboned Major in theNew Zealand army peering at Julian, outraged perhaps by his longish hair and flashyyellow waistcoat. The stranger was sitting with another Kiwi: a small, stockily built womana few years older than him. They were positioned at the table next to Mrs Stewart. Glass inhand, Keidrych stared at the Major. In his soft Welsh accent, a seldom-heard tinge ofantagonism audible, he invited the Major “to agree what a dirty game of rugger the AllBlacks played.”41He went on to recall “a notable, if exceptional, defeat by Wales at Cardiff[...] with provocative satisfaction.” The Kiwi’s mild retort only served to rile Keidrych,whose attitude became even more threatening. Indifferent to either sport or nationalism, Julian initially remained aloof from theburgeoning argument which showed signs of escalating into a bar room brawl. For all hisoccasional verbal aggression, his love of violent stories and his sense of himself assomeone formidable, someone not to be trifled with, he was terrified of violence,invariably beating a surreptitious retreat whenever a fight started. “His pen was,” as Mac132THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"put it, “always mightier than his sword”,42yetthat didn’t deter him from goading the Kiwi.Noticing that the Major had an old edition ofPenguin New Writingwith him, Julian said,“But look. He can read.”Far from initiating the anticipated fracas,his comments gave the Kiwi a chance to defusethe situation by saying, “It’s got a short story ofyours in it.” “You know my name?” Julian replied.Pacified a shade, but still circumspect, he said,“Perhaps you’ll tell us your name.”The butt of their comments turned out tobe the up-and-coming short story writer, poet,and essayist Dan Davin, who had lived inLondon and knocked around Fitzrovia beforethe war. On discovering Dan’s name, Juliansaid, “Didn’t you write a story, Under theBridge, in New WritingNumber 13?” Dan admitted that he had. “Why didn’t you tell us you were a writer?” Julian demanded. “We thought you werean officer. Have a drink.”So began his friendship with Dan and his wife Winnie, who were snatching a few daystogether before Dan’s next posting to an unknown destination.As the year approached its conclusion Julian should have been preparing to celebrate therelease of his first book. But Wren Howard had fallen several months behind schedule.Now he’d decided to print only Julian’s army stories. Borrowing the title of the militarymemoir conceived earlier in the war, Julian wanted to call the book They Can’t Give You ABaby. The staff at Jonathan Cape, however, vetoed the title because they feared thatbooksellers would think customers were asking for contraceptives. On a provisional basis,the collection was, instead, given what Julian regarded as a dreary title – Are You Happy InYour Work.Even though Wren Howard had infuriated Julian by shunting back the book’spublication date until early July, his writing was in wider circulation than at any previousjuncture. In the space of only a month, four different publications carried work by him.The most well-established of these was The Strand Magazine, recently relaunched in thevoguish pocket format. With the publication of It Won’t Be Long Now (later retitledThrough the Usual Channels), his story about his protracted struggle to obtain a divorcewhile still in the army, Julian joined a roster of big name authors such as C.S. Forresterand Agatha Christie. He also had another army story featured in Lilliputand two more133LONDONCALLINGMonica Foster, late 1940s.(© Sheila Cutforth)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"included in the opening issue of The First Eighteen, co-edited by “the intriguing andattractive Patricia Joan Bruce”,43its contents selected from work “by men who are serving– or who have served – in the Forces during the present war.”44And, furthermore, two ofhis sketches made it into Christmas Pie, the latest of a series of charity fundraisingmagazines published by Hutchinson and edited by Leonard Russell, who modelled themon Lilliput— minus the pin-ups. Russell’s playful foreword to the magazine parodied the casual, apparently effortlessstyle of Julian’s army stories and, at the same time, poked gentle fun at the way hecontrived to smuggle references to Eugen Weidmann into the most unlikely conversations.“Really this style of writing is ridiculously easy,” Russell declared. “No wonder Maclaren-Ross writes six stories a day. (Interruption by J. Maclaren-Ross: I write four-and-a-halfstories a day, not six. To paraphrase Weidmann, [...] let us at least have accuracy on thepart of the editor.)”45Yet Russell remained a staunch admirer of Julian’s work, his enthusiasm affirmed byhis acceptance of two more stories for inclusion in Spring Pie, the next edition of themagazine. Of these, one was set in the army, the other in the civilian world, reflectingJulian’s altered circumstances and yielding his earliest published writing about the Sohoscene within which he’d already become such a noted personality.134THEBIZARRELIFEOFJULIANMACLAREN-ROSS"}]
