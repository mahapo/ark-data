[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"'FAILED A.C.' 269 • 'FAILED A.C.' BY T. S. BLAKENEY N the Alpine Journal for November, 196o, an attempt was made to rescue from oblivion an early mountaineer (in the 186o's), John Thorn of Liverpool, and it was then seen that this more than usually enterprising climber had failed on three occasions to be elected to the Alpine Club. It has seemed worth while to try and compile a list of other candidates who, for one reason or another, did not obtain membership of the Club. The list is printed below, based on entries in the old Candidates' Books, supplemented by the register of appli-cations kept by Sir Edward Davidson in two massive volumes, and with the aid of the Minute Books of the Committee and General Meetings of the Alpine Club. The great scrap-books, containing the Club's printed notices, etc. since the beginning, have also been of use, and in some cases the original application forms still exist, but this is not invariable. For obvious reasons, the list is not brought down to recent times, but ends with the close of the First World War. The list is cert~inly not complete; an application might come before the Committee, and yet no papers now exist, and only an entry in the Minute Book records the matter (two examples are given under 1898)~ Again, a candidate's application might be held up by his proposer, and never reach the Committee if it was decided that the case should not be pursued; others papers might find a home in the personal files of the President or Honorary Secretary of the Club for the time being. In some instances, dates are missing, for the keeping of records varied considerably with different Honorary Secretaries (it is pleasant to record that Sir Edward Davidson, an Honorary Secretary and President who incurred a good deal of criticism in his day, and after, was a model keeper of Club records). Minutes might contain all the names of the candidates considered, or might merely state that 'so-many candidates' applications were passed'. Again, in the Minutes of General Meetings, the names of the candidates ballotted for might or might not be recorded; even when the practice existed of pasting into such Minutes the printed circular showing who the candidates were, one may be at fault, for in at least one case, that of Aleister Crowley (1895), the name printed in the circular has been neatly cut out and, without consulting the Committee Minutes or the scrap book of circulars, one would never know he had come before the Committee at all. -"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"• 'FAILED A.C.' It should be noted that no names have been included of candidates who were subsequently elected; at all times, down to the present day, there have been cases where an application has been postponed, to give time, perhaps, for the candidate to amass a more satisfactory qualification. In the main, I have aimed to keep the observations in the 'Remarks' column to a minimum, and indeed not to add anything not contained in the original document unless special reasons necessitate. One or two comments, ho,vever, are suggested by a study of the list as a whole, and I would welcome any further information that readers may be able to supply about any of the candidates shown there are, for example, several solicitors on whom no information has been obtained or others who have been missed out. In A.J. 17. 334 it is said that T. S. Kennedy resigned from the Club (in 1878) because of the black-balling of a certain candidate or candi-dates proposed by him. As will be seen, the only candidate, so far as these lists show, proposed by Kennedy was J. A. G. Marshal!, in 1872. Marshall became a notable mountaineer in succeeding years, but in 1872 his climbing qualification was of a minor nature, and it could not have been justly felt by his proposer that the rejection was unwarranted. It would seem, therefore, that Kennedy may have put forward other names in the later 187o's, and that the papers have escaped the Club files. There is nothing in the Minute Books to show that Kennedy had made any protest to the Committee; in their Minutes of February 10, I 878, it is merely said that Kennedy had, with others, resigned from the Club. That rejection of a candidate might lead to his proposer or seconder resigning from the Club may have happened at times; thus, in 1904 0. A. Cayley, who had a very fair qualifying list of climbs, was rejected, and one notes that William Cayley, his proposer, resigned in 1905, though the reason is not given. Again, in A.J. 30. 65, sqq., Farrar examined the career of G. A. Passingham, and mentions that 'technical difficulties' prevented his joining the A.C., and by the time these were removed, he no longer wished to do so. This would seem to be a case of a possible candidate whose name never even reached the Committee. Passingham ran a gymnastic school, and is possibly identical with the man of that name who was gymnastic instructor at the King's School, Ely, in 1889.1 The non-election of some other names in the list may surprise one, though we are not always provided with the reasons. Lord W entworth (1878), who made the first ascent of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey, pre-sumably decided against joining, and asked his proposer to withdraw the application, for he would, one might have thought, have been very eligible. Still more notable as a mountaineer was W. M. Baker, also 1 Cruttwell and Garrett, Register of the.King's School, Ely, p. 181."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"• • FAILED A.C.' rejected in I 878; the A.J. at least did justice to him, by publishing an obituary notice in 1935. In I 882, W. W. Graham, who made the first ascent of the Aiguille du Geant that year, and whose list of climbs was a distinguished one, and who was to gain further fame in the Himalaya, was rejected by a heavy majority one must assume that personal dislikes operated in this instance. One would be glad to know more; indeed, Graham is a figure about whom surprisingly little seems to be known. All I have managed to trace is that he was the third son of William Frederic Graham, of Elm Grove, Wallington. He was born ea. 1859, matri-culated at New College, Oxford, October 13, 1877 (B.A. 188o), admitted to the Middle Temple August 13, 1878, and called to the bar on January 26, 1883.2 Despite his rejection by the A.C., he contributed several papers to the A.J.; and he also lectured to the Royal Geogra-phical Society.3 There was a rumour that Graham, round about the turn of the century, was in the far west of North America (whether Canada or the U.S. I do not know). Somewhere, too, I think I have heard a tale that his mind became unhinged, but I do not regard this as in any way to be relied upon.4 In 1883 J. R. Ellerman, who had done some good climbing in the Valaisian Alps, was turned down, though less decisively than Graham had been. Little seems to be known of Ellerman; despite his initials, he does not appear to have been related to the famous shipowner of that name. In 1906 came the rejection of V. J. E. Ryan, with an unsurpassed list of ascents; here again, personal factors are known to have operated. against him. A considerable proportion of candidates had their names withdrawn and, without knowing the reasons involved, it is impossible to comment upon them. Others, particularly in the first decade of the Club's existence, obviously failed to put up a proper climbing qualification. There is nothing to guide one as to the operation of cliques within the Club, who black-balled irresponsibly, but it is part of the Club's tradition that Sir Edward Davidson in particular aimed to make the Alpine Club a small, social club, a factor that at times roused great ire in Coolidge. That the ballot system of election could become abused is, however, known; and, as Sir Arnold Lunn has remarked,5 when 2 Foster, Alumni Oxonienses; Middle Temple Admission Register. 3 See consolidated index, A.J., vols. I-IS, p. 7; Procs. of R.G.S., vi, pp. 429, sqq. (paper read June 9, 1884). 4 J. Norman Collie to Coolidge, December 18, 1905 (Coolidge papers, Zentralbibliothek, Zurich) writes: ...
