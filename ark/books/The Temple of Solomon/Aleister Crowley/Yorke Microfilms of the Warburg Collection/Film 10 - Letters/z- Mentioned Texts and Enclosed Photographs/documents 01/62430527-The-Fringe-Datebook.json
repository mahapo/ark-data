It all started one day as I was looking at my calendar and reading the fine print at the bottom of the square that said these actors and a politician were born on this date. I yawned and was not impressed. I wondered who some of these people were but I was not inspired enough to seek answers. I had other interests. That is when my curiosity was sparked into wondering what might have happened on this particular date that I might find relevance in? After all, I enjoy those subjects which most of society ignores as being the actions or babblings of crazy and delusional people. I take pleasure in reading about bizarre incidences with UFOs, or sightings of Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster or the Chupacabra. Studying fringe Masonry, occult fraternities, Satanism and witchcraft has always been my passion. Since childhood I have been drawn toward things best left alone that go bump in the night and frighten little children, or grownups with less than a stable reality. It is these sorts of stories that constantly cause me to question reality in general and sharpen my wit into realizing how little we know of the world around us. Furthermore, upon reading of an incident that had actually occurred on the very date that I was now living makes the story more personal. Yes, it was nothing less that pure frivolity that drove me into producing this book and its taken me years but little by little my book of dates grew and grew until one day I realized that I had created a monster. It is a never ending project and one that I will be working on until the day I die. I also never thought others would be interested in my twisted obsession but I was sadly mistaken. It seems, of all the things that I have written over the years, this manuscript is the one that is often carefully read by my friends who laugh, gasp and make comment upon things that they didn’t know as happening on the day of their visit. Admittedly it has become a great ‘coffee table’ book which has inspired many conversations over facts that most people really don’t need to know in order to function in their daily lives.J. Edward Cornelius2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"JANUARYJanuary 1, 1909 At the age of seventy two the Revd William Alexander Ayton decided to join the British fraternity known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He took the motto of Frater Virtute Orta Raris. He died about twenty years later on this very date in Saffron Walden, Hertfordshire. The Revd Ayton once wrote to his friend W. B. Yeats that he had actually manufactured the elixir of life  “A French alchemist said that it had the right smell and the right color ... but the first effect of the elixir is that your finger nails fall out and your hair falls off. I was afraid that I might have made a mistake and that nothing else might happen, so I put it away on a shelf. I meant to drink it when I was an old man, but when I took it down the other day and it had all dried up.” January 1, 1915 The history of the Ordo Templi Orientis in America began with Charles Stansfeld Jones (1886-1950) on the date. He was granted a patent by Aleister Crowley to establish the OTO in North America, which became known as the British Columbia Lodge No.1. One of the new members was Wilfred T. Smith, who signed the OTO Pledge Form on January 18th and then took Minerval initiation on April 17th. Smith later joined Crowley’s A∴A∴ as a Probationer in March of 1916. Taking the magickal motto of Nubem Eripiam (I will snatch away the cloud.) Smith later founded Agape Lodge No.1 in North Vancouver, Canada and in June of 1921 he swore the A∴A∴ Oath of the Abyss and assumed the magickal motto was Frater Velle Omnia Velle Nihil 132 (To will all, to will nothing). In early April of 1922, Smith moved to southern California where he began working for the Department of the Southern California Gas Company in Los Angles which inevitably lead to the establishment of Agape Lodge No.2. January 1, 1929 It was on this date that Aleister Crowley, the Great Beast 666, wrote a deep philosophical piece of wisdom in his private diary about his favorite religion. All it states is: “Christianity is like a painted mummy; expose it to fresh air, & it crumbles to dirt.” January 1, 1946 The author Eliza M. Butler, who was a professor at Cambridge University, left London on this date in route to Netherwood to interview ‘Old Crow’ or Aleister Crowley for her new book The Myth of the Magus. She later wrote; as she stood in the hall, “a seedy figure in light tweed knickerbockers materialised on the stairs and a grating voice was heard to utter: ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law’.” Miss Butler claims that her direct response to Crowley’s statement was an unspoken comment which immediately ran through her mind: “In that case...I’m for the next train back”—but, somehow, she decided 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to stay. Butler also claimed that Crowley “was more repulsive that I had expected, and his voice was the ugliest thing about him: thin, fretful, scratchy - a pedantic voice and a pretentious manner ... I could not take him seriously.” When The Myth of the Magus was finally published a year after Crowley’s death in 1948 he was only briefly mention as being the “amanuensis of Aiwass,” or his Holy Guardian Angel. Nothing more. Ironically in his diaries on this date Crowley thought differently. He writes, “Prof. Butler of Newham came & talked with such sympathy, consideration, and understanding that the day was a dream of joy!” Toward the end of her life E. M. Butler wrote several novels, like Silver Wings (1952) and although many people have tried to figure out who the characters in this book represent, one of the “only real people in the book” was “Aleister Crowley” whom Butler claimed “nobody seemed to recognise.” The character in question goes by the name of Christopher Carlton, who was a “brazen beast” who claimed to be “the high-priest and prophet, if not the incarnate god, of a new religion.” Butler slipped into her novel many things regarding Aleister Crowley which she had personally witnessed while she was at Hastings years earlier. One of the strangest talents which she attributes to Carlton is when he “boasted that he could make himself and others invisible.” Probably the best comment regarding Carlton comes toward the end of the novel when E. M. Butler refers to him as a “ravenous land-shark.” A phrase which the Great Beast might actually have found rather humorous considering some of the names which he had been called by the press over the years. January 1, 1976 On this date a five-foot tall, huge bald black bird, with large red eyes and with a six-inch long beak in the center of its gorilla-like face was seen by many people in the Rio Grande Valley of Mexico. It was standing with its wings folded around its large body and it made a loud shrill “eeeeeee” sound and its wings sounded almost bat like when it took off. Those who reported seeing the creature say its face was horrifying and that the large red eyes were ‘pure evil.’ One family reported that they saw the bird watching their daughter and her little playmate, who became terrified as was the family dog that lived outside. The fathers of the two little girls later went out to investigate the area where the creature was seen and, upon arriving at the site, they found prints that were eight inches across squared at the top with three-toed impressions and about two inches deep in the hard dry dirt. One of the men attempted to gauge the weight of the bird. His weight was 170 pounds and even jumping up and down hard on the hard dry dirt, he was unable to make even a slight impression. Later, when the dog was unchained in order to come into the house for dinner it darted in and refused to leave the safety of the house all night. A second sighting of the bird was made by a motorist on January 7, 1976. The driver was startled by a big bird standing 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"aggressively in the middle of the deserted road with his wings wrapped around his body and whose eyes glared at him. January 2 This is the birthday of the Sumerian Queen of Heaven and Earth, INANNA. She journeyed into the underworld only to find herself turned into a corpse and the only way for her to leave was to provide a substitute. She thought hard and decided it was best that she provide her husband as the substitute. A story of true love.January 2, 1920 Issac Asimov was born on this date in Petrovichi, Russia. At age 3, he moved with his family to America. He is an extraordinarily popular science-fiction writer, and one of the most prolific writers in history; producing around 450 books in his lifetime and thousands of articles in professional and mass-market publications. He once wrote, “Let me make my position clear, since I don’t want my writing to be used as a basis for a point of view that I consider folly. I Don’t believe in flying saucers.” January 3, 1892 On this date a child was born in a hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa but within days the baby was stolen by a local native. Testimony later showed that the woman simply wanted to take the child home to show the rest of her family. Apparently none of them had ever seen such an oddity before - ‘white child’. Since it was an ‘innocent act of curiosity’ no charges were pressed and the little blue eyed, fair haired and ‘high-domed headed’ baby who was named John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, or more commonly known as J. R. R. Tolkien, was returned unharmed. Thus was the remarkable beginning of the author who wrote The Hobbit and the classic trilogy of The Lord of the Rings, which are highly imaginative stories about elves, dwarves, and wizards in a land known as the Middle Earth. Characters like the hobbits Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, along with the wizard Gandalf figure prominently in these stories. January 3, 1894 The Ahathoor Temple No.7 of The Hermetic Order of The Golden Dawn was consecrated by MacGregor Mathers in Paris, France on this date. Although it might have been due to his autocratic tone and what some historians believed to be his growing friendship with Aleister Crowley, a practicing homosexual, but this would be the last Temple of the Mathers’ branch of the Golden Dawn. January 3, 1931 Aleister Crowley briefly wrote in his diary that “practically all woman ought to be chloroformed at 35.” There is no indication before or after this 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"remark which might give the reader some indication as to what prompted this comment but, knowing Uncle Al, it could be anyone’s guess. January 3, 1955 Harold Angel, a private eye depicted in the movie Angel Heart, was hired by Louis Cyphre on this date to track down the black magician Johnny Favorite who had fled into obscurity before fulfilling the payment of his ‘soul’ to Lucifer. January 4, 1878 The artist Augustus John was born in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, SW Wales on this date. He studied art in London and Paris made an early reputation with his etchings. His favorite themes were gypsies, fishing folk and naturally regal women, as in Lyric Fantasy (1913). He enjoyed painting portraits of political and artistic contemporary figures, such as Shaw, Hardy, and Dylan Thomas. He even drew many sketches of Aleister Crowley throughout his lifetime but probably his most famous was sent to Crowley in 1946 for the front piece in Crowley’s book titled OLLA, The Anthology of Sixty Years of Song. Of his earlier sketches, John described them briefly in letter to Evan Morgan, or Lord Tredegar, wherein he writes: “Aleister Crowley is in no way admirable; I even doubt his carnal prowess. The face I have drawn is that of a vulgar charlatan - a coarse bad mystagogue.” Augustus John died on Tuesday October 31st in 1961January 4, 1918 It is considered by some that Roddie Minor or Sister Achitha’s visions, which actually began on this date, appear to be no more than hallucinations produced by ‘The lady of our Dreams’ (opium), lacking any real occult significance but Aleister Crowley found them extremely impressive and claimed they put him in contact with a spirit known as the wizard of Amalantrah. January 4, 1922 On this date Doreen Edith Dominy, the daughter of Harry and Edith, was born in Mitcham, South London. She would later be known as Doreen Valiente, one of the most respected Gardnerian witches to have influenced the modern day movement of Witchcraft. Her books include Natural Magic, An ABC of Witchcraft Past and Present, Witchcraft for Tomorrow, and The Rebirth of Witchcraft.January 4, 1946 The Spear of Destiny, known also as the ‘Spear of Longinus’ which is reputed to be the actual spear which pierced the side of Christ, was rescued from the Nazis by the Allied forces in Bavaria on this date. January 4, 1946 Jack Parsons began the rites known as The Babalon Working on this date in California, and they continued on for a few weeks. Parsons’ intent was 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to invoke and incarnate an Elemental or Familiar Spirit ... a ‘Moonchild’ in the purest sense. These rituals began precisely at nine o’clock every night, often performed with Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto Number 2 as an accompaniment. The scribe throughout some of these earlier rituals was L. Ron Hubbard. Then on January 18th, as Parsons records: “at sunset, while the Scribe (L. Ron Hubbard) and I were in the Mojave Desert, the feeling of tension suddenly snapped.” A calm came over the air and at this stage Parsons turned to Hubbard and told him that he felt “It is done.” He felt “in absolute certainty that the operation was accomplished.” Upon returning home he “found a young woman answering the requirements waiting for me” at the door. Jack described his ‘familiar’ as “an air of fire type with bronze red hair, fiery and subtle, determined and obstinate, sincere and perverse, with extraordinary personality, talent, and intelligence.” The woman whom Parsons was referring is Marjorie Cameron. Now that he had his Elemental Spirit or ‘earthly vehicle,’ the next stage was to prepare her to be the ‘Mother of Babalon.’ These rituals continued till late February, the last occurring on the 27th. The following day, February 28th, Jack Parsons headed into the Mojave Desert alone. After the appropriate invocations, Parsons wrote, “the presence of the Goddess came upon me, and I was commanded to write ...” This ‘Communication’ as Jack Parsons would later call it was seventy-seven verses, later named Liber 49, The Book of Babalon. It is very fascinating to read, although the most outrageous claim is in Verse 2 where it states, “And this is my book, that is the fourth chapter of The Book of the Law.” It appears that Crowley’s three previously manifested Chapters of Liber AL vel Legis represented Yod-He-Vau, the Father, Mother and Son  Babalon now communicated the fourth and final chapter, that of the Daughter, the final He. On March 1st and 2nd Jack Parsons prepared a special altar in accordance with the instructions found in Liber 49. Little was obtained this evening but one warning would later manifest with frightening consequences. The scribe recorded, “Beware the use of profaned rituals. She (Babalon) is the flame of life, power of darkness, she destroys with a glance, she may take thy soul. She feeds upon the death of man.” It continued with commands to perform another ritual the next day, concentrating all one’s energy and being in Our Lady Babalon. Parsons was required to light a single candle on ‘Her’ altar, saying: “Flame is Our Lady, flame is her hair. I am flame.” January 4, 1949 While undergoing treatment for eye trouble, Lewis Allen Browne, former Rabbi and author of This Believing World and Stranger Than Fiction, terrified of his approaching blindness, was driven to suicide on this date. His suicide note ends “I have no fear of death. I think it is an endless sleep so good night. I don’t want to think.” His book, This Believing World, A Simple Account of 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the great religions of mankind, is frequently suggested to people by A∴A∴ sponsors, but this is not Aleister Crowley’s A∴A∴ but ‘Alcoholics Anonymous’January 4, 1971 The Christian minister Arthur Ford, who was born in 1897, died on this date. He was brought up as a strict Baptist but developed ideas that were too heretical for that strict faith and was kicked out of his church at the age of sixteen. He became a great spiritualist who became known as the man who talked to the dead. He was the founder of the ‘Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship’ and has been described as “a gifted psychic who fell back on trickery when he had to” and after his death his private papers seemed to support this claim. Even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, after witnessing one of Arthur Ford’s séances, called it “one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in forty-one years of psychic experience” but he further added that everything Ford had said could “fit someone in the crowd” as if to imply such broadness gives way to fraud. Ford had gained his reputation as a spiritualist by communicating with the deceased Harry Houdini who told him the ‘Secret Message’ that he set up between himself and his wife Bess. This code, supposedly only known by Bess, had been set up to prove that the psychic who claimed communication with Houdini was real and not a fraud and Ford revealed the exact code. At first everyone was amazed everyone until it was pointed out that Bess had earlier revealed the code to a newspaper writer, who had written an article about the late Houdini. Immediately, Ford was labeled a fraud, with the same enthusiastic headlines that he had received when he first announced his ‘success’ with contacting the other side and revealing Houdini’s message but, either way, Ford was now famous. One of his most popular books was Unknown but Known.January 4, 1986 Christopher Bradshaw Isherwood died on this date in Santa Monica at the age of 82. He was a champion with his controversial stand on gay liberation. In 1955 he experimented with the drug Kif while in Tangier visiting, the novelist and poet, Paul Bowles. He fictionalized his account in a short story titled “A Visit to Anselm Oakes,” which he included in his book Exhumation. Some have speculated that Anselm Oakes was actually based on Paul Bowles but actually Oakes is “a figure primarily modelled on Alistair {sic} Crowley.” This is obvious because instead of the typical Crowley greeting of “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” Anselm Oakes uses a corrupt version, “The Will is the Law, the Law is the Will.” It might be interesting to note that in the opening paragraph to this story one of the main characters states, “I don’t trust Anselm,” as if to mimic an unconscious view which Isherwood himself shared about the Great Beast. Originally the story was the final episode of Isherwood’s book titled Down There on a Visit. However, not “long before the novel was published, in 1962,” he 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"“suddenly decided to take the visit to Anselm out of it.” Years later, in his private journal, Isherwood made another rather amusing comment about Crowley. He wrote, “The truly awful thing about Crowley is that one suspects he didn’t really believe in anything. Even his wickedness. Perhaps the only thing that wasn’t fake was his addiction to heroin and cocaine.” January, 4 1996 On this date outside Isabella County, Michigan, the town woke to its first case of ‘Cattle Mutilation’ when eight one week old calves were found frozen and dead. Two of them were skinned of their hide from head to hooves; six were skinned of their entire hide from neck to hooves. These cases are often attributed to UFOs. Three days later, near Kalamath Falls, Oregon another one week old calf was found dead and mutilated. Its right ear had been cut off and the entire skull had been removed. January 4, 1996 On this date near Campo Rico, Puerto Rico, about 7pm, Madeline Tolentino was driving her Isuzu Trooper on Route 185 near a horse track called El Comandante with the windows rolled down. Her two year old son was in the car seat. Suddenly, she smelled something very pungent, a sulfur-like odor, which irritated her throat. At this moment a small hairy creature with bright red eyes ran across the road in front of the car and quickly disappeared into the woods. Very frightened Madeline quickly headed for home to tell her husband, who decided to investigate for himself. He never saw the Chupacabra, or “Goat sucker”, where his wife had claimed it ran into the woods, but he did smell the foul odor.January 5, 1893 Mukunda Lal Ghosh was born on this date in Gorakhpur, India. The world would know him as Paramahansa Yogananda the founder of the ‘Self-Realization Fellowship’ in Los Angeles. January 5, 1904 Jeanne Pinchert, more commonly known as Jeanne Dixon, was born to German immigrant parents in Milford, Wisconsin. She was a well-known psychic, Seer and astrologer who always concealed her real age, often citing 1918 as her birth year, but her birth records show that this date is correct. She grew up to be one of our most noted modern psychics, although this title of ‘most noted modern psychics ‘ is dubious considering that she predicted that Russia would be the first nation to put men on the moon, that world War III would begin in 1954 and that the Vietnam war would be over in 1966. Her sole claim to fame rested on a single ‘correct’ prediction that she made in Parade Magazine, May 13, 1956, which stated: “As to the 1960 election, Mrs. Dixon thinks it will be dominated by labour and won by a Democrat. But he will be assassinated or die in office, though not necessarily in his first term.” Naturally, when President Kennedy was 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"assassinated, she quickly reminded the world that she had predicted it. Jeanne Dixon died of a heart attack on January 26, 1997, at 2:30 PM, in Washington, DC. Her most famous book was A Gift of Prophecy (1966).January 5, 1915 Aleister Crowley’s wrote in Rex de Arte Regia, The King on the Royal Art Diaries, on this date regarding the opposite sex in New York, that, “women in America seem purely animal. They come like water and like the wind they go. Not one of these operations in this country has ever had the flavor that one gets in Europe.”January 5, 1941 Grady Louis McMurtry, the future head of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis, attending his first Gnostic Mass on this date at Agape Lodge in southern California.January 6, 1412 Joan of Arc, the hero of the Hundred Years War, was born on this date. It is said that in her teens she began hearing voices. She let them guide her throughout her life and also on the battle field, where the voices urged her to save France from English domination. She had a lot in common with Marshall Gille de Raise who fought at her side, both were said to be reckless in battle; they both preferred a simple response to any given situation; they both had a sense of occasion, of the theatrical; and they both shared a fondness for fine clothes.On January 6, 1883, On this date Khalil Gibran was born in the mountain villageof Bsharri, Lebanon. At the age 12 his family immigrated to Boston, where he lived for three years before returning to the University of Beirut. He was a very prolific writer, but is mostly known for his book titled The Prophet (1923) which Gibran summarizes: “The whole Prophet is saying one thing: You are far greater than you know, and all is well.” Besides writing one of the best-selling books of all time, he is also a talented artist. In fact, when Auguste Rodin wanted his official portrait done, he commissioned Gibran to do the work. January 6, 1915 Dr. John Cunningham Lilly was born on this date in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was a neuroscientist and writer who explored human consciousness, dolphin communication and the farthest reaches of the borders of reality with, as one writer pointed out; “the showmanship of P. T. Barnum and the infectious zeal of Jacques Yves Cousteau.” The main characters in two popular films, The Day of the Dolphin and Altered States, were both based on Dr. Lilly. He also published nineteen popular books, including the classic titled The Center of the Cyclone (1972). He died on Sept 30, 2001 in Los Angeles of heart failure at the age of 86.10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"January 6, 1915 Alan Watts, who was born on this date in Chislehurst, England, once stated that the “best book I’ve read in years is about Aleister Crowley. He was said to be a Satanist, a black magician, a sadist, a nut, a heroin addict and a sexual degenerate of monstrous proportions, and one wonders a bit if some of Aleister’s infamous reputation was exaggerated.” He was referring to the book he read titled, The Eye in the Triangle by Israel Regardie. He was as a leader of the San Francisco counterculture in the 1960s and he played a crucial role in merging Oriental philosophy into the world view of the 20th century, helping to awaken millions of people to new ways of knowing. He is the author of The Way of Zen.January 6, 1920 Sun Myung Moon was born in Korea on this date. It was in 1936 that he had a vision where Jesus Christ told him “to carry out my undone task” and on May 1, 1954 he would establish the Unification Church in Seoul, South Korea. His followers are known as ‘Moonies’ and are taught that ‘it is permissible to lie’ for the cause, especially when raising money to give to him.January 6, 1931 “The reason that I cannot manage stupid people is that I always want them not to be stupid, instead of using them.” Aleister Crowley from his private diaries.January 6, 1933 The classic movie titled The Mummy, where an Egyptologist unwittingly unleashes the 3,000-year-old Imhotep, opened on this date.January 6, 1963 Upon learning that Karl Germer had died in October of 1962, Frater Paragranus, Hermann Metzger of Switzerland summoned all his close friends and on this date they proclaimed that they “unanimously elected” him; “the Very Illustrious + H. Josephus M∴, Fra.∴Paragranus, Grand Master X° of the Order of Oriental Templars, Sovereign Grand Master-General of the Ordo Illuminatorum, Sovereign Grand Master General of Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua, and Sovereign Patriarch Ecclesiæ Gnosticæ Catholicæ henceforth to be Sovereign Grand Master-General, Outer Head of the Order of the Ordo Templi Orientis.” This sounds all well and good and very impressive, but since no other IX°s anywhere in the entire world were even notified of the elections being held, Metzger never gained any credence outside his own circle of friends who elected him. January 6, 1968 On this date there were two different sightings of a Bigfoot in California. The first occurred near Confidence Ridge when Robert James, Jr. and Leroy Larwick were flying their small plane and reported seeing a ten to twelve 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"foot high creature walking in the woods below. The second sighting occurred in Trinity Alps just north of Weaverville. This is when Larry Browning saw a Bigfoot wading across a river and, on the following day, he claimed that he was chased by a female Bigfoot who had been watching him for almost thirty minutes, just narrowly escaping. The very next day, on the 8th and in the same area, a man named Mike Melton saw a Bigfoot leaning over the river drinking.January 6, 1969 When the classic movie called Freaks (1932) was re-released to a ‘cult audience’ in the 1960s, two of its original actors, the famous Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, were talked into going on a national publicity tour. Their last public appearance was at a movie theater in Charlotte, North Carolina but the agent, who had set up the tour, never showed up when the movie was over. Penniless and stranded, the conjoined sisters were forced to take a job at a local grocery store, with one working the register and the other bagging groceries. The store manager was nice enough to buy work dresses for the twins, since all they had were show clothes. Then, on this particular date, after not reporting for work the store owner called the Police who went over to their house, broke down the door and found Daisy and Violet Hilton dead from complications due to influenza, or the Hong Kong flu. January 7, 1536 Queen Catherine of Aragon died on this date at Kimbolton Castle in Cambridgeshire, England, either from cancer or by poisoning. Following the news of his former wife’s death, King Henry VIII held a ball at Greenwich to celebrate the glorious occasion. He wore a bright yellow suit. A large portion of the South Wing of the Castle collapsed in 1707 but the Queen’s private Chamber remained intact, and it is in this Chamber that the lonely Queen still returns as a ghost, seen robed in a white dress and wearing her crown. Another ghost of the castle is that of Sir John Popham, who was Lord Chief Justice during the reign of Elizabeth I, who after death, just as he had done in life, lies in wait for poachers in the park. He has also been seen on many occasions sitting on a wall, ready to pounce on any intruder. A third ghost is that of an unidentified child who had been flung from one of the castle’s windows only to meet a dreadful death on the flagstones below. January 7, 1883 Largely at the request of Madame Blavatsky who was living in India, Anna Bonus Kingsford was elected president of the British Theosophical Society in London on this date. Aleister Crowley once wrote that, “this woman, though handicapped by a brain that was a mass of putrid pulp, and a complete lack of social status, education, and moral character, did more in the religious world than other person had done for generations. She, and she alone, made Theosophy 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"possible, and without Theosophy the world-wide interest in similar matters could never have been aroused.”January 7, 1943 Nikola Tesla died on this date in a New York hotel room. Earlier, a Federal Judge had ruled that Tesla was the true inventor of the radio even after his strange view of openly proclaiming to everyone that its crystals were actual ‘living beings.’ January 7, 1948 Captain Thomas Mantell was flying his P-51 Mustang in hot pursuit of a UFO on this day near Fort Knox, Kentucky when all of a sudden his plane blew up and crashed. His last words were, “. . . metallic and tremendous in size.” Be that utterance as it may, the official government explanation of his crash was, and I quote; that “Mantell died from a lack of oxygen while chasing the planet Venus.” January 8, 1744 After visiting Constantinople Sir Francis Dashwood founded the Divan Society in London at Thatched Tavern. Some have considered it to be little more than a ‘Friday night’ dining club which held its first dinner on this date. In fact historians claim that the club had no purpose other than providing an outrageous setting to party in Turkish style. It was also very short lived and closed its doors after only a few years due to the qualification of membership. Everyone who applied had to have some connection to the Sultan’s Empire in Constantinople some time during their life and this qualification was simply hard to fulfill.January 8, 1854 Samuell Liddell `MacGregor’ Mathers was born on this date in Hackney, Middlesex, England. He was described by W. B. Yeats as, “a jacobite who believed in the overthrow of Queen Victoria and the restoration of the Stuarts” and “imagined a Napoleonic role for himself, Europe transformed according to his fancy, Egypt restored, a Highland principality, and even offered subordinate posts to unlikely people.” He was also said to be a man who studied only two subjects  magic and the theory of war.January 8, 1864 Prince Eddy, who was once suspected of being Jack the Ripper, was born on this date. When Aleister Crowley published his book entitled The World’s Tragedy in 1910 he gave a brief cryptic message which stated that he held in his possession letters between a boy by the name of Morgan and the late Duke of Clarence or Prince Eddy. Historically, Morgan really existed. He was the son of a woman who owned a small shop at 22 Cleveland Street where Mary Kelly, 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the last victim of Jack the Ripper, had held her last job. What was in these letters or exactly what became of them is not recorded. January 8, 1932 “Initiation is never what you think it is going to be; if it were, you would already be Initiated,” thus wrote Aleister Crowley in an unpublished diary.January 8, 1947 David Robert Jones was born on this date at 40 Stansfield Road, Brixton, London. He would grow up and become known as the rock legend David Bowie. He is reported to have always had a fascination with the occult and Aleister Crowley. When he released his album Hunky Dory in November of 1971 it contained a song called Quicksand which contains the following verse; “I’m closer to the Golden Dawn. Immersed in Crowley’s uniform. All in a dream.”January 8, 1946 Violet Mary Firth is the real name of Dion Fortune. She died on this date of acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 55 on this date. In 1919 she had joined the Alpha and Omega Lodge of Stella Matutina of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. She derived the name Dion Fortune from the magical motto which she adopted when joining which was “Deo Non Fortuna,” which means “by God, not chance.” In 1929 she left the Order and founded a Community (later called Fraternity) of the Inner Light. She wrote numerous books throughout her life. Such as, The Secrets of Dr. Taverner (1926), The Demon Lover (1927), Sane Occultism (1929); The Training and Work of an Initiate (1930), Psychic Self-Defense (1930), Through the Gates of Death (1932), The Mystical Qabalah (1936), The Goat-Foot God (1936), The Winged Bull (1936), and The Sea-Priestess (1938) to name only a few. When Aleister Crowley published The Book of Thoth he sent her a copy inscribed to the “Priestess of Selene.”January 8, 1996 On this date in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, a pair of sheep were discovered slaughtered on a farm owned by Jose Febo, victims of the Chupacabra or “Goat sucker.” As Febo was investigating the bodies he observed the creature asleep, resting up in a tamarind tree. It reportedly had pointed ears, a strange profile, and a shaven head. When it noticed Febo, it jumped off the tree and ran “like a gazelle.”January 9, 1349 The bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, killed a fourth of the European population in just three years time. In Basel, Switzerland, not understanding that humans got the plague when bitten by fleas and then spread it by coughing, the townspeople came up with the ludicrous belief that the disease was caused by the Jews. In retaliation for causing ‘plague’ six hundred Jews were 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"forced into a specially designed wooden house on an island just off shore and on this date the building was set on fire and everyone was burnt to death. One hundred and forty children were also taken from their parents and forcible baptized ending the Jewish presence in the town, but not the bubonic plague. January 9, 1932 Aleister Crowley wrote briefly in his private diary on this date that “Morality is a system of classifying women according to the functions of their vulvas” but like many of his entries he doesn’t explain what prompted him to write such. January 9, 1944 Jimmy Patrick Page was born on this date in London, England. In late 1968 he, along with Robert Plant, John Bonham and John Paul Jones, formed the legendary rock band Led Zeppelin. Their 1969 debut album was a unique blend of heavy rock and the blues, while their second album soared to the top of the charts with such hits like Whole Lotta Love. Throughout the 1970s Led Zeppelin was considered on of rock’s most successful act. Jimmy Page was becoming a ‘guitar god,’ famous for his strange obsessions with the occult as much as for his heavy riffs. In fact, he even bought Aleister Crowley’s mansion called Boleskine over looking the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland. There are those who said Page was convinced that Crowley’s ghost haunted the mansion, and that Page frequently tried to contact it through séances and spiritual readings. Then disaster struck; the band’s drummer Bonham died in 1980 and soon thereafter Led Zeppelin disbanded. Some, to this day, blame these tragedies, and many others, on something Jimmy Page unwittingly unleashed while dabbling in the occult.January 9, 1989 Jamie Kellam Dodge won her lawsuit against the Salvation Army on this date, over being fired for being a Wiccan. It all began in 1987 when Dodge was seen using the copy machine at the Salvation Army for what turned out to be personal rather than professional reasons. She was copying material related to paganism and Wicca. When she was confronted, she admitted to using the copy machine for personal reasons and, in addition, that she was Wiccan. “She was told that she was mentally ill and, later that same day, terminated because of her religious affiliation.” Although she later ‘Saw the Light’ and returned to Christianity, she decided to file suit against the Salvation Army anyway in order to make a stand for religious liberty. The Salvation Army in turn argued that, as a religious corporation, they are exempt from laws which prohibit religious discrimination. However, on this date, the U.S. District Court of Biloxi, Mississippi ruled that the Salvation Army’s actions constituted illegal and unconstitutional discrimination. Judge Russell agreed that, in principal, the 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Salvation Army was normally exempt from employment anti-discrimination laws.

January 12, 1863 Swami Vivekananda, Hindu mystic, major exponent of Vedanta philosophy, was born on this date in Calcutta. His birth name was Narendra Nath Datta. He was a student of Ramakrishna. Aleister Crowley, liked his writings but stated that Vivekananda’s Raja Yoga “is very good indeed, if you remember to switch off when he slides into sloppiness.”January 12, 1917 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was born on this date. He was the founder of the Transcendental Meditation movement. Many skeptics believe his vedic flying to be little more than bouncing around the floor “like an idiot.” Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was briefly a mentor to The Beatles.January 12, 1935 George Joseph Kresge Jr., more commonly known as The Amazing Kreskin, was born on this date in Montclair, New Jersey. With a showman’s flair and comedian’s wit, he built up a show business career on his apparent ability to read people’s thoughts. His weekly TV show which was titled ‘The Amazing World of Kreskin’ was a syndicated hit from 1971 to 1975, with Kreskin ‘amazing’ his studio audiences by guessing people’s birthdays or deciphering the pips on hidden playing cards. While always vague about the exact nature of his skills, he denies being a psychic or mind-reader and prefers to call himself a bona fide mentalist.

Some individuals have actually thought that the movie The Philadelphia Experiment was just a fictitious story to amuse the masses, or was it? January 14, 1892 On this date, one of the people whom Scotland Yard suspected was ‘Jack the Ripper’ slipped off into a deep permanent sleep due to a slowly induced morphine overdose. He was Prince Albert Victor or Eddy the Duke of Clerance and the future King of England, if he had lived. It is written that years later “Aleister Crowley had somehow acquired a few incriminating letters from the dead Prince to a boy who lived in Cleveland Street.” The author who over heard Crowley make these comments, St. John Terrapin, further writes, “I heard him discussing the prospects for using them to raise money from those who might want them suppressed.” What became of this blackmail scheme is not recorded if it ever took place at all.January 14, 1902 On this date several people trying to skate in Chesterfield, Indiana reported to the police of being chased by 8-ft hairy creature with club.January 14, 1960 Gerald del Campo, an initiate of the Ordo Templi Orientis, ordained Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica Priest and Master of an O.T.O. Oasis, was born on this date in Cordoba, Argentina. He is the author of the book New Aeon Magick: Thelema Without Tears (1994), which one reviewer called, “An excellent straight-forward primer for the curious novice or neo-pagan who’d like to learn a bit more about Thelema without going directly through Crowley.” January 15, 1875 Tom Longstaff, the famous mountain climber and President of the Alpine Club, was born on this date. In his biography entitled This My Voyage he wrote of his old friend Aleister Crowley, who “was a fine climber, if an unconventional one. I have seen him go up the dangerous and difficult right (true) side of the great ice fall of the Mer de Glace below the Geant alone, just for a promenade. Probably the first and perhaps the only time this mad, dangerous and difficult route had been taken.”January 15, 1947 On this date a corpse was discovered which began one of the most famous unsolved murders cases in the history of Hollywood  the Black Dahlia. The woman’s real name was Elizabeth Short. Her nude body was discovered in an empty lot in two separate pieces. It had been bisected in half at 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the waist and drained of all its blood. The body was also covered with numerous mutilations, cigarette burns and her mouth was cut wide open from corner to corner as if to give some frightful smile. January 16, 1900 According to the actual Membership List of the Golden Dawn Aleister Crowley was initiated as an Adeptus Minor by MacGregor Mathers, or Frater Deo Duce Comite Ferro, in Paris on this date and not as he remembers on Feb. 20th, although he does get the year correct. Crowley took the magical motto of Parzival.January 16, 1909 The story of the ‘New Jersey Devil’ which was seen by over 1,000 people between January 16 to the 23rd is very well documented. It began when Thack Cozzens of Woodbury saw a flying creature with glowing eyes flying down the street. Further down in Bristol, John Mcowen heard and saw the creature on the banks of the canal. A patrolman named James Sackville even fired at the creature as it flew away screaming, while E.W. Minister, the Postmaster of Bristol, saw a bird-like creature with a horse’s head that had a piercing scream. When daylight came the residents of Bristol found hoof prints in the snow. Two local trappers said they had never seen tracks like those before. On the following day the Lowdens of Burlington found hoof prints in their yard and around their trash, which was half eaten. Almost every yard in Burlington had these strange hoof prints in them. The prints went up trees, went from roof to roof, disappeared in the middle of the road, and stopped in the middle of open fields. The same tracks were also found in Columbus, Hedding, Kinhora and Rancocas. A hunt was organized to follow the tracks but the dogs wouldn’t follow the trail. On the 19th the New Jersey Devil made his longest appearance of the week. At 2:30 am Mr & Mrs. Nelson Evans of Gloucester were awakened by a strange noise. They watched the devil from their window for almost ten minutes. Mr. Evans described the creature. “It was about three feet and half high, with a head like a collie dog and a face like a horse. It had a long neck, wings about two feet long, and its back legs were like those of a crane, and it had horse’s hooves. It walked on its back legs and held up two short front legs with paws on them. It didn’t use the front legs at all while we were watching. My wife and I were scared, I tell you, but I managed to open the window and say, ‘Shoo’, and it turned around barked at me, and flew away.” The following Tuesday two professional hunters tracked the devil for about twenty miles throughout Gloucester. The trail jumped 5 foot fences and went under 8 inch spaces. The hoof prints were found in more parts of South Jersey. A group of observers in Camden saw the devil. It barked at them and then took off into the air. The very next day, a Burlington police officer and the Reverend John Pursell of Pemberton saw the Jersey Devil. Rev. Pursell said, “Never saw anything like it before.” Posses in Haddonfield found tracks that ended abruptly. In Collingswood 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"a posse watched the devil fly off toward Moorestown. Near Moorestown, John Smith of Maple Shade saw the devil at the Mount Carmel Cemetery. George Snyder saw the devil right after Mr. Smith and their descriptions were identical. In Riverside hoof prints were found on roof tops and also around a dead puppy. On the following Thursday, the Jersey Devil was seen by the entire Black Hawk Social Club. He was also seen by a trolley full of people in Clementon as it circled above them. The witnesses’ descriptions matched others from the days before. In Trenton, Councilman E.P. Weeden heard the flapping of wings and then found hoof prints outside his door. The prints were also found at the arsenal in Trenton. As the day wore on the Trolleys in Trenton and New Brunswick had armed drivers to ward off attacks. The people in Pitman filled churches. The West Collingswood Fire Department reported firing their hose at the devil. The devil retreated at first, but then charged and flew away at the last second. Later that night, Mrs. Sorbinski of Camden heard a commotion in her yard. She opened the door to see the Jersey Devil standing there with her dog in it’s grip. She hit the devil with a broom until it let go of her dog and flew away. She started screaming until her neighbors came over. Two police officers arrived at her house where over 100 people had gathered. The crowd heard a scream coming from Kaigan Hill. The mob ran toward the creature on the hill. The Policed shot at it and the devil flew off into the night. The streets of Camden were empty after this. The next night, or Friday, Camden police officer Louis Strehr saw the Jersey Devil drinking from a horse’s trough. The school in Mt Ephraim was closed because no students would attend. Mills and factories in Gloucester and Hainesport had to close because none of the employees even came to work. Many New Jersey residents wouldn’t leave their houses, even in the daylight. Officer Merchant of Blackwood drew a sketch of the creature he saw. His sketch coincided with the descriptions from earlier in the week. Jacob Henderson saw the devil in Salem and described it as having “wings and a tail.” The devil was only seen once more in 1909 in February. January 16, 1933 Edith Starr Miller, known by her title of Lady Queenborough, died in Paris, France on this date. Her name is often linked with the Order of the Golden Dawn and the British Fascist movement. She wrote only three books during her life. The first was called Common sense in the Kitchen, (1918), the second, Occult Theocrasy published posthumously in France, in 1933, and a third was simply called Judaism. Without fully realizing it, her book Occult Theocrasy relied heavily on the published works of self-described 33° freemason, Domenico Margiotta, along with the hoaxers Dr. Karl Hacks and the anti-Mason Leo Taxil, Diana Vaughan and Dr. Bataille, which means that all the facts in her book are suspect. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"January 16, 1976 Dr. R.

With this, as only part of the evidence, some historians claim that Benjamin Franklin, who was born on this date, sold American Revolutionary secrets to the British and was not as patriotic as some would like to believe.January 17, 1996 On this date Phil Schneider was found strangled in his hospital bed with a catheter wrapped around his neck. Needless-to-say, the circumstances of his death are highly suspicious, if not controversial and some believe that he was murdered. Others say it was an ‘accident.’ He was a self-taught geologist and explosive expert who supposedly worked on many of the U.S. government’s ‘deep underground facilities’ after World War II. One of these bases that he worked on was the secret facility at Dulce, New Mexico where, according to Schneider, UFO ‘greys’ or humanoid extraterrestrials worked side by side with American technicians. UFO theorists claim, if Schneider was telling the truth, then he obviously broke the code of imposed silence and the penalty for that blunder was presumably termination.January 18, 1824 Joseph-Antoine Boullan, the Satanic founder of The Church of Carmel, was born on this date. He seems to have been fascinated by the human excretory organs and their functions; he participated in rites that were ‘scatological’ in nature. It is written that “documents survive showing that Boullan and his followers of The Church of Carmel engaged in, or thought they engaged in copulation with angels, cherubim, seraphim and the spirits of famous people like Cleopatra and Alexander the Great.” He died on January 4, 1893 at the climax of a ‘Battle of the Magicians’ between the Church of Carmel and the Kabbalistic Order of the Rose Croix which was run by his old foe Stanislas de Guaita.20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"January 18, 1932 Robert Anton Wilson, who was born on this date in Brooklyn, New York, claimed that he had entered Chapel Perilous “quite casually one day in 1971 while reading The Book of Lies by the English mystic Aleister Crowley ... in a ‘blinding flash’ or at least a mini-Satori, I knew Crowley’s secret.” Although Wilson has written many books, the one he coauthor with Robert Shea titled Illuminatus! Trilogy has become an underground classic. A few of his other notable books are Cosmic Trigger, Prometheus Rising and The New Inquisition.January 18, 1935 Michael Paul Bertiaux, the author of the Voudon Gnostic Workbook, was born on this date in Seattle Washington. He was consecrated a Bishop on January 18th 1966 by Hector-Francois Jean-Maine (born 1924) who was a Bishop of the L’Eglise Spirite Albigeoise and an initiate of the Haitian voodoo tradition. Michael Bertiaux’s responsibility was to disseminate Jean-Maine’s teachings to the white population of America. When once asked by a reporter if he was a black magician, Bertiaux simply replied, “yes ... but black magic is merely a sensational term designed to keep the frivolous away and create barriers.” January 19, 1344 The Order of the Garter was founded by Edward the Third on this date. Many believe that Edward was a ‘witch’ and that the ‘Garter’ was really a witchcraft order.January 19, 1809 Edgar Allan Poe was born on this date. His poem, The Raven, has forever associated Poe’s name with the reputation of being the black-feathered literary master of the macabre. Throughout the 1830s and 40s Edgar Allen Poe worked on various magazines in and around Richmond, Philadelphia and New York, while publishing his disturbing short stories and poems, like The Tell-Tale Heart, The Cask of Amontillado and The Murders in the Rue Morgue, the latter of which is widely considered by many to be the first modern detective story. Poe was never a healthy man, while always being a heavy drinker. He died at the age of 40 under very mysterious circumstances. In regards to Edgar Allan Poe; H. P. Lovecraft wrote, “his elevation of disease, perversity, and decay to the level of artistically expressable themes was infinitely far reaching in effect.” January 19, 1880 On this date Old Dorothy Clutterbuck was born in Bengal.

Heinlein wrote a letter to a friend dated today, where he briefly discusses a verse from Aleister Crowley’s The Book of the Law, stating “Certainly ‘Do what thou wilt is the whole of the Law’ is correct when looked at properly - in fact it is a law of nature, not an injunction, nor a permission. But it is necessary to remember that it applies to everyone - including lynch mobs. The Universe is what It is, and It never forgives mistakes - not even ignorant ones.” January 20, 1996 On this date in Jardim Andere, Varginha, Brazil, Hildo Lucio Galindo opened his bathroom window to see a creature with oily dark brown skin crouched in a nearby alleyway. The creature had no hair, very small hands with three extremely long fingers; it wore no clothing and was about 4-5 feet tall. As soon as Hildo screamed the creature ran away. With no local police, Hildo called the fire department who said they had already received several calls about the “wild animal.” It seems three young girls reported throwing rocks at the creature, which emitted a soft buzzing sound like a bee when struck. When the fire department finally arrived to investigate they found the military already on scene. According to witnesses the military apparently had already shot and killed the creature, put it into a wooden box with a white plastic canvas cover and had transported it away by army truck. Other observers saw two F-5 aircraft moving at a very low altitude over the area. It was also reported that a total of eight creatures were captured on this day. One dead, two injured, and five were unhurt and alive. It also seems earlier that same day two farm workers had spotted a group of agitated animals running away from a wooded area, upon closer investigation they saw a gray metallic blimp shaped UFO that appeared to be in trouble, emitting smoke shortly before crashing.January 21, 41AD On this date Rome’s third and most ruthless emperor, Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, more commonly known as Caligula, was murdered by members of his own Praetorian Guard.

He was Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis from 1947 to 1962. In the early thirties Aleister Crowley stayed at his house in Germany and there, during one of his sexual adventures he allowed his ‘semen’ to stain Germer’s black satin sheets. This was an outrage according to Karl Germer, or so he complained. Crowley found Karl Germer’s attitude absolutely ridiculous. In his private diaries Crowley writes, “I replied with the Mild Wisdom of the Sages: Since when, pray, have Cunts been water tight?” January 22, 1909 Rupert S.

Many believed him to be a ‘quack’ who drove around in a gold-plated Mercedes while seemingly performing surgical services by plunging his hands into the body in order to remove cysts and to drain infected areas but it was all done by sleight-of-hand. In 1968 when Agpaoa visited Detroit to perform ‘surgery’ he was arrested and charged with medical fraud.

Early in life his deep spiritual interests found expression in traditional Christianity, but he soon learned there was more to life and he turned to psychic phenomena and yoga. His ‘transformation’ occurred on May 8, 1954 when he was sitting alone in his London apartment. He claimed to have heard a loud distinctly human voice saying, “Prepare yourself! You are to become the voice of Interplanetary Parliament.” It came out of nowhere and ended as abruptly as it had happened. A few days later an unidentified world-renowned Yoga Master from India walked ‘through’ his locked door and taught him a series of highly specialized exercises which would enable him to bring about a state of consciousness necessary for the establishment of mental rapport with the Cosmic Masters who inhabit the higher planes of other planets. On their direction King founded The Aetherius Society and began publishing the journal, Cosmic Voice. He lectured throughout Britain serving as the channel for numerous Transmissions from Cosmic Intelligences whose transmissions, according to King, constitute the most priceless metaphysical library in the world, with a range and depth of spiritual teachings without equal in the annals of occult Truth. In June 1959, guided by the ‘Cosmic Authority’, Dr. King came to the America where The Aetherius Society was incorporated as a non-profit organization in November of 1960.

This night is chosen because Robert Burns was born at Alloway, near Ayr, on January 25, 1759. The typical dish served on this holiday is haggis but before once can eat it you must read to it assorted poetry by Robert Burns. Haggis is simply a traditional Scottish dish of sheep’s stomach stuffed with seasoned meat, oatmeal and barley. Crowley played an rather funny practical joke on a friend who was visiting Boleskine, his home in Scotland. One summer evening, just as they were about to sit down to dinner, Crowley’s servant, primed of course beforehand, ran into the room and, dropping on one knee explained, “‘My lord, my lord! The haggis is on the hill!” Crowley and his unsuspecting friend snatched their guns and rushed out. It was beginning to get dark, but there was still light enough to distinguish not far away an animal with a pair of horns. Crowley’s friend fired both his barrels and immediately killed the animal. He yelled with delight and was about to run forward to claim his prize when Crowley stopped him with a warning that according to local tradition the haggis must never be approached by ‘him who has killed it.’ He went on to say 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"that the carcass would be brought to the hall later, after it was cleaned. So the two went back to their dinner, and, sure enough, later a small procession led by a piper entered the dining hall carrying the now skinned animal.

He promised to take them back to Switzerland and affixed them, duly labeled and dated, to the wall of his villa. In truth the horns were merely that of an elderly ram procured for the occasion because, as everyone knows, a haggis is not an animal at all, which was part of Crowley’s joke on his friend to make him think otherwise. Still, it has been suggested that Crowley’s killing of the haggis never really happened, that it was simply an allegory told by him to imply that Burns is dead and there is a greater poet to whom Scotland should honor.

He spoke French until he was orphaned at the age of eleven, after which he was sent to England to be raised by an uncle, a clergyman. Like many writers, Maugham once found himself with a writer’s block. At the age of thirty he decided the best way to stimulate his creativity was to do what he knew best, travel and so he headed to Paris where he took a small apartment near the Lion de Belfort. He described his first meeting with Aleister Crowley in the story titled A Fragment of Autobiography; “Soon after my arrival, Gerald Kelly took me to a restaurant called Le Chat Blanc in the Rue d’Odessa, near the Gare Montparnasse, where a number of artists were in the habit of dining: and from then on I dined there every night ... one of the casual visitors was Aleister Crowley. He was spending the winter in Paris. I took an immediate dislike to him, but he interested and amused me ... at the time I knew he was dabbling in Satanism, magic and the occult.”January 25, 1892 The German occultist Herbert Reichstein was born on this date. His occult periodicals linked all manners of health cures, revelations, reassurances, and techniques of Self-realization, and contained a marked tendency to embrace several contemporary fringe-sciences. He also adopted numerous forms of the current racist beliefs which made him a respected member of Lanz von Liebenfels’ Ariosophy movement. He would go as far as hailing Adolf Hitler as ‘the instrument of God.’ January 25, 1946 Grady Louis McMurtry finished his a twelve page letter on this date and sent it to Aleister Crowley. It was his official ‘Grand Inspector General Report’ which detailed his investigation into the shenanigans going on under Agape Lodge’s roof in southern California, along with his recommendations. Jack 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Parsons would later refer to this report as the “inquisition.” The funniest comment is found at the very end of the letter when Grady refers to Agape Lodge as “the Hodge-Podge-Lodge  otherwise known to its inmates as Ghastly Gables.” It summons up the flavor of the Report. January 25, 1971 In California, on this date, Charles Manson and three of his female followers whom the press called ‘the mindless but blood thirsty zombies’ were found guilty of murdering Sharon Tate and her friends.January 26, 1930 Approximately nine months prior to this date a woman by the name of Stella Taylor is reported to have cheated on her husband, Len Standish. She had an affair with Aleister Crowley while the latter was briefly visiting Brussels. Supposedly Crowley got her pregnant and, on this date, she gave birth to an bouncing baby boy named Andrew Standish. Unfortunately, Mr. Crowley, who kept extensive diaries about all his affairs and often dropped names like water; never once mentions either Stella or ‘his’ son anywhere. Be that as it may, when young Andrew grew up he decided to claim his ‘rightful heritage’ and he changed his name to Amado Crowley. He has never offered one shred of evidence to prove his claims about being Aleister Crowley’s illegitimate son. He is the author of such ‘creative’ books as The Secrets of Aleister Crowley (1991), The Riddles of Aleister Crowley (1992) and The Wrath of Aleister Crowley (1994).January 26, 1931 On this date the practicing English ‘hereditary witch’ Robert Cochrane was born into a Methodist family in London, England. In the early fifties he founded his own coven, based on his family tradition, calling it the Clan of Tubal Cain. However, to this day, many of his hereditary claims have yet to be proved. January 26, 1959 Bob Lazar was born on this date in Coral Gables, Florida, to unknown parents and was adopted by Albert Lazar and his wife within the first few months of his life. Bob Lazar gained world wide notoriety in November of 1989 by going on a Las Vegas television station and announcing to the world that he was a physicist who worked at the top secret Area 51 involving ‘Flying Saucers.’ He claimed to have seen a total of nine flying saucers housed in hangars built into a hillside. He even said that he had hands-on experience with one of the craft and he can describe its propulsion system in detail. Lazar says he read briefing papers about the alien presence but that he saw no aliens himself, aside from a fleeting glimpse of a small figure through a window at the facility. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"January 27, 1832 The renowned Victorian author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, more commonly known by his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll, was born on this date in Daresbury, Cheshire, England, the son of a clergyman. Although multi-talented in many areas he achieved lasting fame as the author of Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871).January 27, 1883 John Francis Toye was born on this date in England. He was the cousin of Gerald Kelly, whose sister Rose misguidedly married Aleister Crowley. Toye once wrote, “Of all the extraordinary people I met ... undoubtedly the most extraordinary was Aleister Crowley. Crowley, like the author of Hadrian VII, whom in many ways he much resembled, was a genius gone wrong, with a remarkable talent for Browningesque verse, a soaring imagination, and a sense of humour altogether exceptional. Indeed, in retrospect, his sense of humour stands out as his most striking attribute.” He goes on to give an example telling us that when Crowley bought his estate in Scotland, on Loch Ness, he posted signs saying “Beware of the Ichthyosaurus!” and “The Donotheriums are out today!” John Francis Toye died in 1964.January 28January 29, 1665 Jeanne de Anges a Nun of an Ursuline convent in Loudun France died peaceably on this date. Some thirty years earlier her demonic possession was considered by some to be the most classic case in the annuals of European witchcraft history. The priest in charge of the convent, Urbain Grandier, was accused of bewitching her, with the aid of the demon Asmodeus, to compel her to ‘think and do’ impure thoughts. Under torture Grandier supposedly confessed and was later burned alive in 1634.January 29, 1688 Emanuel Swedenborg, inventor, author, philosopher and mystic, was born as Emanuel Swedberg (or Svedberg) on this date in Stockholm, Sweden, the third of the nine children. He devoted his life to studying the Holy Scripture and publishing eighteen theological titles that draw on the Bible, reasoning, and his own spiritual experiences. These works present a Christian theology with a unique perspective on the nature of God, the spiritual world, the Bible, the human mind, and the path to salvation. Aleister Crowley was so impressed by his writings that he personally believed Swedenborg was at least an Adeptus Exemptus since he had published his thesis on the ‘nebular hypothesis’ to explain the birth of the planets and the universe. Swedenborg died in London on March 29th, 1772, at the age of eighty-four. He was deeply into Freemasonry and established the Swedenborgisan Rite. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"January 30, 1940 It was on this date that Zsusanna Budapest, (aka Zsusanna Mokcsay) was born in Budapest, Hungary.

She has authored of such books as Grandmother Moon (1991), The Goddess in the Office (1993), The Goddess in the Bedroom (1995), The Holy Book of Women’s Mysteries (1989)January 31, 1591 Dr. John ‘Cunningham’ Fian, an alleged leader of the North Berwick Witches, was arrested on the 26th and tortured for days, but he refused to confess to the twenty counts charged against him, such crimes as: “Conspiracy with Satan to wreck the ship carrying King James to Norway, on a visit to his future queen, by throwing a dead cat into the sea.” He was finally found guilty and executed in Scotland on this day. As was the general custom, he was first strangled and then “immediately put into a great fire, being ready provided for that purpose, and there burned in the Castle Hill of Edinburgh, on a Saturday in the end of January last past.” Historically, the date of his death has been listed as either being on the 30th or 31st, January 31, 1969 Merwan Sheriar Irani more commonly known as Meher Baba the ‘Compassionate Father’ died on this date at the age of seventy five. His followers merely claimed he ‘dropped the body’ which is a euphemism used by the Baba lovers. In 1925 he took a vow of silence ‘to save mankind from the monumental forces of ignorance’ and although many of his followers hoped he’d break his silence before death they were greatly mistaken. He uttered no last words of wisdom and so the world remains ignorant. January 31, 1984 The Slack Guru J. R. ‘Bob’ Dobbs was tragically ordered assassinated in San Francisco on this date by his evil twin brother the Anti-Bob, or Dick Dobbs who wanted to take over the Texas based Church of the Sub-Genius. The assassin Woodman Atwell who had legally changed his name to ‘Puzzling Evidence’ never stood trial and to this day is a free man. January 31, 1996 Near Romatambo, Peru, at a remote mountain village several Quechua Indian shepherds tending their flocks watched six UFOs flying over the area. According to a forty year old witness, Silvia Bedoya, the UFOs apparently emerged from nearby Lake Cococha and formed what seemed to be a protective circle around a larger mother-ship. The flight of the objects illuminated the whole valley in an eerie deep purple type of light. They also said that they watched the ‘mother ship’ landed upriver from the village and saw two occupants emerged who were only about three or four feet tall, with large oversized heads, long 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"spindly arms and short bandy legs. They wore gun metal gray helmets and matching one-piece coveralls. The humanoids took out transparent containers and, ignoring the people watching them, they collected many samples, like soil, grass, mountain weeds, & water from the nearby river. After awhile the humanoids reentered the large object and all the UFOs shot away into space at a high speed.FEBRUARYFebruary 1, 1920 Jane Cheron, who was one of Aleister Crowley’s mistresses, had allowed her home to be used for one of the infamous Paris Working Rituals in which Crowley and Walter Duranty had performed acts of buggery to the God Mercury. But on this particular date she would give Aleister Crowley a beautiful embroidered silk of the Stele of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu which she had recently finished.February 1, 1941 Frater Saturnus, Karl Germer the Grand Treasurer General of the OTO was released on this date by the Nazis from a concentration camp where he had been held since May 10th 1940, when the Germans first marched into Belgium. In March, Crowley received a letter from Karl Germer who informed him of his release from the Nazis. Crowley records in his diary on the 14th, “Great ‘havings’ indeed - a letter from Germer, who is safe after all. The happiest evening of my life!” He further adds, “This is a stunning joy. Life has again immediate value; the future is all sunrise on translucent wings.”February 1, 1945 When the Nazis began bombing London during World War Two it forced Aleister Crowley from his apartment at 93 Jermyn Street, Piccadilly into a new residence. On this date, at the age of seventy, Aleister Crowley moved into his last boarding house at Netherwood, Hastings and it is here where he would shed his earthly vehicle in 1947. February 1, 1967 Anton LaVey, the Black Pope, held the infamous satanic wedding of John Raymond and Judith Case on this date which turned into an unbelievable media sensation. The photographer who was assigned by the San Francisco Chronicle to cover this story was Joe Rosenthal, who also took the immortal shot of the soldiers raising the American flag on Iwo Jima during World War II.February 2 Today is the rite of Candlemas, or Imbolg, which literally means ‘in the belly’ since this day represents the first fetal stirring of Spring from the womb of Mother Earth.30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"February 2, 1882 James Joyce was born on this date in Dublin, Ireland. He originally studied in Dublin and then went to Paris in 1902 primarily to study medicine but also took up voice training for a concert career. His early works includes the short stories, Dubliners (1914), and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1914-15). His best-known book was Ulysses which was based upon a single day in Dublin (June 16th 1904). The book appeared in Paris in 1922, but was quickly banned in both England and the USA where it remained banned until 1936. He also wrote Finnegans Wake (1939). Joyce has been hailed as the father of literary modernism. His work revolutionized the form of novels, partly through the abandonment of an ordinary plot for a “stream of consciousness” type of narrative, but more fundamentally through his unprecedented exploration of language. He died in Zürich in 1941.February 2, 1900 Carroll Righter was born on this date in Salem, New Jersey. He was an attorney who originally set out to disprove astrology but ultimately became one of its most influential promoters. He was the student of the famous astrology Evangeline Adams and was President Ronald Reagan’s astrologer for 45 years. He wrote such books Understanding Astrology, Astrology and Diet, and Astrology and You. He died of cancer on April 30, 1988 at 11:15 PM, in Santa Monica, CA, at the age of 88.February 2, 1905 The novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand was born on this date as Alissa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her novels focusing on reason and individualism have become a great source of personal inspiration for many people. She died of heart failure on March 6, 1982 in New York City.February 2, 1913 According to H. P. Lovecraft, Wilbur Whateley was born on this date in Dunwich, Massachusetts. Historians claimed that Whateley used the imperfect translation made by John Dee of the Necronomicon bequeathed to him by his grandfather to call down the ‘Old Ones’, which inevitably caused him grief.February 2, 1969 Boris Karloff, the ultimate icon of classic horror films, who made Frankenstein a house hold name, died on this date. February 3, 1937 Eduard Albert ‘Billy’ Meier, whose real full name is Eduard Albert Meier-Zafiriou, was born on this date in Bülach, Switzerland. For over 56 years he maintained that he was receiving, both physically and telepathically, communications with extraterrestrial beings, or Pleiadians, who claim to have come from the planet Erra in the Plejares (Pleiades ) star cluster. Although the visits supposedly began when Billy was only five; it was in January of 1975 that 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"they escalated with over a hundred visits, of which he was allowed to photograph the “beamship” during flight maneuvers. He took well over a thousand of the clearest UFO pictures ever seen. The actual contact conversations were also carefully written down word-for-word and they contain many interesting facts about Earth’s history, humanities, sciences and spiritual topics. As a rule, most people believe Billy Meier to be a fraud but he has an unbelievable following who will argue otherwise.February 4, 2001 Gerald Suster, the esteemed British writer, occultist and historian born in 1951, died on this date in London. His body was cremated. He wrote such books as Hitler: The Occult Messiah (1981), The Legacy of the Beast: The Life, Work and Influence of Aleister Crowley (1984) and John Dee, Essential Readings (1986), to name but a few.February 5, 1908 Violet & Daisy Hilton the famous Siamese twins of the carnival circuit were born on this date in England. Remarkably both sisters even found husbands and were married although they remained joined together. Anton LaVey who knew them well seemed to believe “that the girls shared mutual sensations” and further LaVey states, “I think they were jealous of each other’s husband.” It seems that if one was having sex with her husband the other often “enjoyed it more” through their joined sensations. February 5, 1914 On this date William Seward Burroughs was born in St, Louis, Missouri. By the 1940’s he was addicted to heroin. He became associated with Jack Kerouac and the poet Allen Ginsberg but tragedy struck in 1951 when a drug-addled Burroughs recklessly shot and accidentally killed his wife while in they were Mexico. In 1959 William S. Burroughs published his now classic Naked Lunch which pioneered a ground-breaking cut-and-paste technique that would be credited as a major influence on many cyberpunk and avant garde authors and, because of such, he has become an underground celebrity, a literary guru and pop culture philosopher who continued to write and record right up to his death of a heart attack on August 2, 1997.February 6, 1748 On this day Adam Weishaupt was born at Ingoldstadt and later educated by the Jesuits. He was appointed Professor of Natural and Canon Law at the University of Ingoldstadt in 1775. He is the founder of the Order of the Illuminati.February 6, 1954 James Thomas Graeb was born on this date in Hempstead, New York. He grew up in Branford, Connecticut.

While in Law School Graeb helped with the new OTO Bylaws and Incorporation papers which were signed on March 20, 1979. Grady McMurtry was naturally the Outer Head of the Order, James Graeb became Grand Secretary General and Bill Heidrick became the Grand Treasurer General. On February 16, 1980 he was Chartered to run the Heru-pa-kraat Encampment in San Francisco and three months later, on May 24, 1980 Graeb resigned the post of SGS. He was expelled from the OTO in winter of 2004. February 6, 1996 On this date a nineteen year old farmer named Louis Boisvert saw a very large metallic triangular UFO hovering over his barn, as he was attempting to plow snow off his tractor in the town of Buckingham, Quebec. The craft seemed to be slowly moving and the red light coming from the object did not illuminate the ground or even the roof of the barn. After the craft left Boisvert and his father noticed that their electric water pump would not function. The troubling part of the incident began with recurring dreams that so plagued Boisvert that he decided to undergo hypnotic regressing. He was able to recall jumping off the tractor and running into the barn where his father was working. He then remembered seeing his father just standing there with a blank expression on his face. Besides him stood two reptilian looking creatures, with long faces, scaled leathery skin, black eyes, clawed hands, and gaunt arms and legs. Boisvert then remembers that both he and his father were taken onboard the triangular object by the humanoids.February 7, 2000 On this date Stewart Farrar died and passed on into the next world. He was the author of such book as The Witches Speak (1976), The Secrets of Ancient Witchcraft (1974), Witchcraft in Yorkshire (1973), High Priestess ( 1998), The Zodiac Experience (1995), One Witch’s World (1998), Lid off the Cauldron (1998), Witches Were for Hanging (1999).February 8, 1868 This is the ‘real’ birthday of the astrologer Evangeline Adams, born in Jersey City, New Jersey on this date. She often lied about what year she was born. In 1914 she was arrested for ‘fortune-telling,’ a second time. This time she was fed-up with persecution and decided to fight the charges. In England the art of astrology was outlawed under the Vagrancy Act of 1825 which classified all astrologers with ‘rogues and vagabonds.’ In the United States astrologers like Evangeline Adams were prosecuted simply as ‘fortune-tellers’ and they had no official legal standing. The law in the state of New York at the time simply purported to protect society against “acrobatic performers, circus riders, men who 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"desert their wives, and people who pretend to tell fortunes” or basically all “disorderly persons.” Evangeline Adams wanted this changed, at least in regards to her own profession of astrology. The first thing she did was to hire one of the best lawyers in New York. Her intentions were not just to have the charges thrown out of court, as was done on the previous arrest, she wanted to go to trial and to put an end to the question once and for all—is astrology fortune telling? During the trial Judge Freschi gave Miss Adams a birth date and time of an individual without telling her who it was. Her reading of this unidentified individual convinced the Judge beyond a shadow of a doubt that astrology was a sincere art and not simple fortune telling. She described the person with uncanny accuracy. It was the Judge’s own son. Astrology won a great legal victory that day when the Judge ruled, “the defendant raises astrology to the dignity of an exact science.” Unfortunately even today many individuals do not share the Judge’s point of view. She would later released three rather popular books titled Astrology, Your Place In The Sun (1927), followed by Astrology, Your Place Among The Stars (1930) and then Astrology for Everyone (1931). Many people and astrologers did not know it at the time but her first two books were almost entirely ghost-written by Aleister Crowley.February 8, 1810 Eliphas Levi, who was christened Alphonse-Louis Constant, was born on this date in Paris, France. Levi was largely responsible for the revival of interest in magic in the 19th century. Although he admittedly studied magic and strongly believed in it, he often considered himself more of a commentator than and adept, though he did claim to practice necromancy on several occasions. His first and probably most important work was The Dogma and Ritual of High Magic. It was followed by A History of Magic, Transcendental Magic, The Key of Great Mysteries. Levi died on May 31st, 1875. Aleister Crowley, who was born later in the same year, claimed that this gentleman was one of his previous incarnations.February 8, 1828 Jules Gabriel Verne, the father of modern science fiction, was born on this date in the port of Nantes, France. He wrote such classics as From the Earth to the Moon (1865) and A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873). Many of his ideas were hailed far ahead of their time, if not prophetic. February 8, 1855 It was on this date in the town of Devonshire, England that everyone awoke to find strange footprints in the freshly fallen snow. Their shape was forming a ‘U’ which quickly spread rumors throughout the small village that the Devil had visited Devonshire during the night.34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"February 9, 1854 George Lippard, Councilor for Dr. R.

February 9, 1904 Aleister Crowley left for Cairo on this date after arriving the day before at Port Said in the Suez. In Cairo he would rent a small corner apartment where he turned the room, which faced north, into a Temple. It was here that Rose or Ouarda the Seer kept repeating, “They are waiting for you.” At first Crowley believed that his wife’s hysterical state of mind was brought on by either being constantly drunk all the time or since she was pregnant. It turned out the Gods did want to talk with Aleister Crowley. February 10, 1840 It was on this date that Fraulein Anna Sprengel supposedly took the Oath of 5°=6 ̈ assuming the motto of Soror Sapiens Dominabitur Astris. Most historians claim that she was the prominent Rosicrucian German adept who allegedly had handed Dr. Wynn Wescott a bunch of pseudo-Masonic rituals and told him to start up an order, an English version of the “Goldene Dammerung.” However, others will adamantly argue that Fraulein Sprengel, and all claims related to her, were simply an invention to give credence to the newly formed Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. February 10, 1906 Lon Chaney Jr was born Creighton Tull Chaney on this date in Oklahoma Cit, Oklahoma. Although he played numerous roles in Hollywood pictures he is probably most famous for being the Werewolf. Lon Chaney Jr came into the world prematurely at seven months, lifeless, on a cold winter day. After repeated attempts by the doctor to resuscitate the infant, his father grabbed the lifeless body and ran outside, where he submerged it into the icy waters of Belle Isle Lake which ‘jump started’ the seemingly dead child. Lon Chaney Jr died on July 12, 1973 in San Clemente, California of a heart attack after many years of poor health. As he had requested, his body was donated to University of Southern California for researchFebruary 10, 1966 The man who was both a friend of Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler, John Frederick Charles Fuller, died on this date. Aleister Crowley, after reading Fuller’s book The Secret Wisdom of the Qabalah, wrote in his diary that it is a “turgid unintelligible rant: no idea of what he’s driving at.

Toward the end of his life, around 1920, Edison became obsessed with communication with the spirits and he came to believe that he could build anything if he had the right components to do it and he took his beliefs one step further by announcing that he intended to invent a machine that could communicate with the spirit world. Edison strongly believed that when a person dies, the body decays but the intelligence that it possesses lives on into the so-called spirit world, which is a limbo where disembodied ‘intelligence’ waits to move on. He believed that this intelligence involved billions of sub-particles of matter like electrons that travel in space which combined into colonies to make up the sum total of our spirit. He called each of these intelligence particles “little people” and he believed that these little people stay united after a person dies and that they eventually settle into another person at birth. Henry Ford believed in Edison’s ideas and argued that the mind contains “millions of entities” and he felt that people, like Edison, received more ‘entities’ (i.e. genius particles) than most of us because he has, as Ford said, “a properly tuned antenna.” February 11, 1891 Karl Germer’s divorced his first wife, Marie Wys, while he was in Mexico in order to marry Cora Eaton. His second marriage took place on January 15th 1929 in New York but Cora died on July 13th 1942. Two months later he married his third wife, a Vienna piano teacher named Sascha Ernestine Andre, was born on this date.She is probably most noted historically as being the woman who took Aleister Crowley’s urn, filled with his ashes, and strewing its contents into the mud at the base of a tree in Hampton, New Jersey. Yes, the Great Beast is buried in New Jersey!February 11, 1906 It was on this date that Aleister Crowley assumed the Oath of Adeptus Minor in the A∴A∴, 5°=6 ̈ taking the motto ‘Christeos Luciftias’. Outside of an unpublished diary one of the only other places where he uses this motto appears at the beginning of Ambrossii Magi Hortus Rosarum which is found in The Collected Works although this creates a small historical problem. He wrote this piece in 1902 four years before he took the Oath of Adeptus Minor.February 11, 1938 Without any indication of what was on his mind which might have prompted him to write such, Aleister Crowley has the following brief entry in 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"his diary. ‘Never run after a woman. You many possibly catch her.” A short but truly important piece of wisdom for all men to appreciate.February 11, 1949 The government UFO program known as Project Sign was changed to Project Grudge on this date. The name change was reflective of a change in attitude towards UFOs by the Air Force. Years later, in October of 1951 Project Grudge would become Project Bluebook, headed by Captain Edward Ruppelt. February 12, 1554 On this day Lady Jane Grey’s ghost is often seen walking near the Bloody Tower in the Tower of London, where she was executed. Her saga began four days after King Edward’s death on July 6, 1553. This is when she was proclaimed Queen of England. However, Mary, who was the rightful heir to the throne according to Henry VIII’s Will, gathered support and rode into London nine days later and imprisoned Jane and her supporters. Mary was then proclaimed the rightful Queen of England. Jane and her husband were executed after a second ill-fated uprising in their name. Lady Jane’s ghost has also been seen near the ruins of Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, which is her birthplace. Legend has it that on Christmas Eve a spectral coach is often seen heading toward the ruins, drawn by four headless horses, and inside is Lady Jane, seated with her head set carefully on her lap. Once the ghostly coach arrives, Jane is seen to alight, carrying her head and slowly walking into the ruins, where she disappears. February 12th 1686 Cotton Mather was born on this date in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony. After he graduated from Harvard College in 1678, he became assistant minister of his father’s North Church. Many place Cotton Mather as an essential figure behind the Salem Witch trials, but this would be inaccurate. In truth, he had relatively minor role in the entire Salem affair. He simply offered ‘spiritual’ advice in Court on one occasion and later attended the hangings in which he addressed the crowd after George Burroughs’s execution. It must be understood that Mather wrote at length about New England in over 500 books and pamphlets trying to show how the holy Puritan task in the wilderness was to establish God s kingdom. His Salem connection would have inevitably fallen by the wayside had it not been for his own need to write about his experience at the trials but his brief account, titled Wonders of the Invisible World, was, admittedly, unfeeling and very slanted toward the condemned witches. This irritated one individual named Robert Calef who proceeded to write More Wonders of the Invisible World which attacked Mather’s character and his reputation as a ‘witch’ expert; a blow from which he would never recovered and which his name now irretrievably become linked as a ‘central’ figure behind the trails.37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"February 12, 1809 On this date the 16th U.

One of his greatest quotes, which are words often uttered by many without the realization of who originally spoke them, are inspirational words of wisdom to live by. “It is true that you may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time; but you can’t fool all of the people all the time.”February 12, 1964 The famous English witch, Gerald Gardner, died at the breakfast table on Board a ship after suffering a fatal heart attack on this date. The following day he was buried on shore in Tunis, his funeral was attended only by the Captain of the vessel that he had traveled on. Some historians claim that Aleister Crowley was paid a suitable large fee from Gerald Gardner to compose rituals that could be used in his new Gardnerian witch-cult although some modern Gardnerian Witches try to deny this fact as if trying to distance themselves from the evils of Old Crow. Is there a connection between the two? There is in fact an actual OTO Charter reportedly given to Gerald Gardner from Crowley giving him the right to begin an OTO Camp but under careful scrutiny this document becomes suspect. First of all, the document is written completely in Gardner’s handwriting, with the exception of the signature of ‘Baphomet’! Second, the official greeting which Crowley is always so methodical at using is quoted wrong as ‘Do what thou Wilt shall be the law’ something Crowley would never do. There are other obvious uncertainties, like Crowley calling Gardner ‘beloved son’ ... which is Highly unlikely.February 13, 1727 Cotton Mather, one of the ministers at Salem Witch trials, died on this date. Although many place his death at 1728, his tomb in Salem reads 1727. It reads: “The Reverend Doctors Increase, Cotton, & Samuel Mather were interred in this Vault. ‘Tis the Tomb of our Father’s Mather - Crocker’s I Died Augt 27th 1723 AE 84 C Died Fed 13th 1727 AE 65 S Died June 27th 1785 AE 79.” The names, I = Increase, C = Cotton & S = Samuel,” refer to the three ministers in the family, or the father, Cotton Mather and his son. February 13, 1902 On this date Aleister Crowley with his recently shaved head arrived in Kandy, Burma to look up his old friend, Allan Bennett. Besides learning about laudanum Crowley bought over twenty five pipes of opium and smoked such with absolutely no results but like a scientist he continued his experiments and fortunately realized his problem. His solution was simply that he wasn’t initially inhaling.

In 1882 he returned to England and became an editor on the London Evening News and other such periodicals like Fortnightly Review and Saturday Review. During World War I he returned to the U.S. where he became the editor of Pearson’s Magazine. He wrote that his friend Aleister Crowley upon leaving America bound for England in 1919 ... “left a string of worthless cheques” behind. A few years later Harris traveled to Berlin where the first volume of My Life and Loves was published. There would be three more volumes published between 1922 and 1927. Some claim his notoriety as a braggart and liar are epitomized in these books. While Harris was living in New York at the St. Regis Hotel none other than his old friend Aleister Crowley would often stop by. Crowley with his ‘phlebitis’ looked, ‘more like an Egyptian than ever’ according to Harris. It is said that Crowley would go over to Frank’s apartment for a ‘petite verre of brandy’ and of course a conversation. In January of 1924 Aleister Crowley briefly lived with Frank Harris. According to one source, they both shared similar ‘money troubles” and were ‘equal hypochondriacs.’February 14, 1890 Nina Hamnett was born on this date in Tenby, South Wales. She attended the Royal School in Bath, and later studied at the Dublin School of Art, the Pelham Art School and the London School of Art. Her studies primarily revolved around portraits and landscapes. She exhibited her works at the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy and the London Group in England, as well as at the Salon d’Automne in Paris. She taught at the Westminster Technical Institute from 1917 to 1918. She was a talented artist and writer. She was immortalized in the paintings, sculptures, novels, poems and memoirs of her contemporaries in both London and Paris. In 1932 she published The Laughing Torso, containing reminiscences of her bohemian life, which become a bestseller in England and America. Aleister Crowley unsuccessfully tried to sue for slander, 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"was born on this date. Crowley objected to the comments where Hamnett wrote that, “Crowley had a temple in Cefalu in Sicily. He was supposed to practice Black Magic there, and one day a baby was said to have disappeared mysteriously. There was also a goat there.” A sequential autobiographical novel, Is She a Lady?, appeared in 1955. Hamnett lived in London and Paris most of her life. She was briefly married in 1914 to Ronald Kristian, also known as Count Edgar de Bergen. She died on Sunday, December 16th 1956, from complications after falling out her apartment window and being impaled on the iron fence forty feet below. The great debate has always been whether or not it was a suicide attempt or merely a drunken accident. Her last words were, “Why don’t they let me die?”February 14, 1913 The former Episcopal Bishop James T. Pike was born on this date. He is probably most famous for holding the televised séance in Toronto where he, acting as a medium, contacted the spirit of Harry Houdini. It is further reported that Houdini during this séance actually informed Pike of the hidden coded message which he and his wife used during their stage acts. Other’s totally disagree. February 14, 1918 It was on this date that the black magician Johnny Favorite was born. He’s probably most famous for welching on his deal to Lucifer whom he had conjured and previously sold his soul to years earlier.February 14, 1931 Although Bram Stoker’s original book was published in 1897 it wasn’t until this date that the Hollywood movie version of Dracula opened in the theaters. Some scholars have claimed that since this book was first published it has remained the second biggest seller, only out shadowed by the Holy Bible.February 14, 1945 On this date the body of 74 years old Charles Walton was discovered in Lower Quinton England. He had been brutally murdered. His body was pinned to the ground with a hayfork. A large cross had been carved deeply into his chest and neck. It might be worth it to consider a quote from an old book titled Folklore, Old Customs and Superstitions in Shakespeareland which had been written by J. Harvey Bloom, a local vicar, in 1929. He wrote how, in 1875, “a weak minded young man killed a woman named Ann Turner with a hayfork because he believed she had bewitched him” To this day, Walton’s killer has never been found and the only clue is the rumors which persist that Walton was a ‘witch.’February 15, 1750 On this date the author Richard Payne Knight was born at Wormesley Grange in Herefordshire, England. He was a classical scholar best 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"known for his interest in ancient phallic imagery and for his book titled The Worship of Priapus. He died on April 23, 1824.February 15, 1883 The author Arthur Sarsfield Ward was born on this date. He is probably most famous as the creator of Fu-Manchu, using the pen name of Sax Rohmer. Some historians have claimed that he was a member of The Hermetic Order of The Golden dawn but there isn’t the slightest evidence to support this claim. February 15, 1891 The first installment of Huysman’s LA BAS appeared in a newspaper in France on this date exposing ‘Satanism’. Aleister Crowley would later comment in a letter to his student Jane Wolfe, dated November 20th 1928, that “Huysman’s ‘La Bas’ was written entirely about me. He was even thoughtful enough to do it thirty years before I was born. I was very touched by the attention.”February 15, 1941 Jack & Helen Parsons join the Ordo Templi Orientis on this date taking Minerval & First Degree on the same evening at the Agape Lodge in southern California. Jack would later take the Oath of a Probationer in the A∴A∴ under Wilfred T. Smith on March 22nd. He took the magickal motto of ‘Thelema Obtentum Procedero Amoris Nuptiae’, which Crowley later commented was “couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding.”February 15, 1996 A statue of Our Lady of Lourdes in a Carmelite Sisters’ convent in Diego Martin, in west Trinidad, began weeping tears of blood on this date. Professor Courtenay Bartholomew, a local medical consultant who has written a book on these apparitions, is said to have tested the blood and found it to be human. People from all parts of the country began a pilgrimage to the convent to see the statue, although the Sisters would only allow a few people to enter at a time. February 16, 1564 Christopher Marlowe was born on this date in Canterbury, England, the son of a shoemaker. He was probably expected to enter his father’s business but instead he was offered a scholarship by the Archbishop of Canterbury and entered Cambridge University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1584 and a master’s in 1587. However, instead of entering the clergy, he headed off to London and the theatre. He was soon writing plays for an acting company called the Admiral’s Men. Although he also wrote light verse, like The Passionate Shepherd to His Love, his major works were tragedies, for which he is best known, like Doctor Faustus.41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"February 16, 1854 Charles Webster Leadbeater was born on this date. Ironically, he often wrote, for no apparent reason, that he was actually born on February 17, 1847 yet his surviving birth records clearly point out that this was not the case. Anyway, he was ordained an Anglican priest and was a close associate of Annie Besant. Aleister Crowley condemned Leadbeater in The Equinox Vol.I No.X as a “senile sex-maniac.” In 1906 Leadbeater was forced to resign from the Theosophical Society for teaching masturbation yet, over the objections of some members, he was readmitted three years later. February 16, 1871 Richard Adams Locke died on this date in Staten Island, New York. He was a New York journalist who created the infamous “Moon Hoax” which was one of the greatest journalistic pranks of all time. In his article, which appeared in the New York Sun on Friday, August 21, 1835, Locke reported that Sir John Herschel, “has made some astronomical discoveries of the most wonderful description, by means of an immense telescope” at the Cape of Good Hope. It was a short article, intended simply to bait the reader into buying more newspapers. This blurb was followed on Tuesday, August 25 by an astonishing report in the Sun from the Edinburgh Journal of Science, which of course didn’t really exist, that boldly announced that plant and animal life had been found on the moon. By the next day the Sun’s readers were slavering to know more about the discovery. Locke obliged them by printing more info in the next paper describing the lunar features and flora. “It has been demonstrated,” he says, “that the moon has an atmosphere constituted similarly to our own, and capable of sustaining organized, and therefore, most probably, animal life.” There are poppies, fir trees, an inland sea with a “beach of brilliant white sand, girt with wild castellated rock, apparently of green marble. The scene unfolds like a vision of faerie: lush forests, waterfalls, crystal structure of lilac and “wine coloured amethyst.” And animals: herds of miniature bison, blue, goat-like unicorns, pelicans, cranes, and a “strange spherical creature of amphibious form.” Locke then promised that even greater discoveries were promised in tomorrow’s newspaper. On August 27, more account of the moon’s fantastic geography were printed, describing the “Lake of Death,” “lunar palm trees,” rivers and islands and fields of enormous quartz crystals. Zebras and pheasants were not lacking, nor were bipedal, tail-less beavers who apparently could use fire. Then the bombshell hit. When The Sun hit the streets on the 28th it disclosed that human life, or something very close to it, equipped with bat-wings had been discovered. ”They averaged four feet in height, were covered, except on the face, with short and glossy copper-colored hair, and had wings composed of a thin membrane, without hair, lying snugly on their backs from the top of the shoulders to the calves of the legs...these creatures were 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"evidently engaged in conversation; their gesticulation, more particularly the varied actions of the hands and arms, appeared impassioned and emphatic.” By this time the circulation of The Sun had increased 25%, eclipsing even that of the London Times. More stories continued to grace the pages of the newspaper and it wouldn’t be until September 16 that the truth behind the “Great Astronomical Discoveries” reared their ugly head as a hoax perpetrated by Richard Adams Locke simply to increase circulation, which it had done gleefully. It has been said, “In a journalistic landscape rich with hoaxes, Locke’s Moon Story stands out like a Lunar Sapphire in a lava bed.” Locke later created at least one other hoax, known as “The Lost Manuscript of Mungo Park,” but it never matched the crystals, temples, bison, and winged humanoids. February 16, 1878 Pamela Colman Smith, nicknamed ‘Pixie,’ was born in England to American parents on this date. She grew up in Jamaica but later returned to England. In the late 1890’s she joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn where she met Arthur Edward Waite. At the time she was a struggling artist, illustrator, and writer but her chief claim to fame was designing the Tarot deck used by Arthur Edward Waite and later referred to as the Rider-Waite deck. She also did illustrations for the works of William Butler Yeats.February 16, 1923 Raoul Loveday, Frater AUD, aka Adonis, died at the Abbey of Cefalu on this date. Some claim that his death had to do with drinking cat’s blood, others claim in was drinking ‘bad water.’ Three days earlier Crowley recorded in his Magical Record that he felt a current of magical force, “heavy black and silent” threatening the Abbey. February 17, 1600 Giordano Bruno refusing to retract any of his philosophical opinions before the Inquisition of Rome was finally condemned as ‘an impenitent and pertinacious heretic’ and was publicly burned at the stake on this date in a place called Campo dei Fiori (Square of Flowers) Rome.February 17, 1907 Colonel Olcott, one of the founding members of the Theosophical society with Madame Blavatsky, died on this date.February 17, 1986 Jiddu Krishnamurti died at the age of 90 in Ojai, California. One of his students once commented that “Listening to Krishnamurti speak was like eating a sandwich made of bread and sand.” Although his writings are far more clear. As when he wrote in Freedom from the Known, “All authority of any kind, especially in the field of thought and understanding, is the most destructive, evil thing. Leaders destroy the followers and followers destroy the leaders. You 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"have to be your own teacher and your own disciple.

Olson, was born on this date in Bode, Iowa. He is the author, or coauthor of over a hundred and fifty books with such titles as Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, Haunted Places, The Source: A Journey through the Unexplained, Strangers from the Skies, Project Bluebook, The Rainbow Conspiracy and UFO Odyssey.February 19, 1473 Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikolaj Kopernik) was born on this date in Torun, Poland, a city in north-central Poland on the Vistula River south of the major Baltic seaport of Gdansk. He is considered the father of modern astronomy. He was the first person to attempt to apply a modern, almost rational standard of order to God’s universe, which marked the beginning of the scientific revolution, and of a new view of a greatly enlarged universe. Copernicus died on May 24, 1543. February 19, 1680 La Voisin ‘The Satanic High Priestess’ during the reign of Louis XIV made her confession on this date of sacrificing over 2500 babies in the name of Satan. She did this, she claimed, with the help of Louis XIV’s mistress, Madamme de Montespan, and a 67 year old libertine priest named the Abbé Guiborg.February 19, 1941 Grady McMurtry, the future head of the Ordo Templi Orientis, found himself caught up in the spirit of American patriotism and he joined the United States Army on this date. However, there is every indication that his ‘patriotic decision to join’ came with a draft notice saying that he had to report for duty. This notice probably arrived while he was still in college and it effected his decision to quit just twelve days before he had to report  but of the impetus, it seems he went willingly. He was sent to boot camp, or basic training, at Ft. Riley in Kansas.February 19, 1973 Ivan T. Sanderson died of cancer at the age of 62. In his early career Sanderson was a nature writer but soon became an enthusiastic Fortean author; devoting the majority of all his later books and articles to mysterious phenomena of all kinds from strange monsters, sea serpents to Bigfoot. Some of his most notable books were Univited Visitors (1967), Things (1967), More Things (1969), Invisible Residents (1970) and Investigating the Unexplained (1972)44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"February 20, 1946 L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons formally established a company together on this date. The business began by Jack Parsons taking $20,970.80 of his life savings of $25,000, adding it to L. Ron Hubbard’s meager amount of $1,183.91 and then depositing it all into an account called Allied Enterprises. The third partner, Sara Elizabeth ‘Betty’ Northrup, Jack’s ex and L. Ron’s new girlfriend, contributed absolutely nothing into the account. However, according to the paperwork she, Jack and L. Ron would share equally in the project. The over all scheme was to take the money and invest it in buying a sailing vessel in Miami and then sail it to California for resale at a good profit. It seemed like a good business ventureFebruary 20, 1980 Dr. Joseph Banks Rhine, the ‘father of modern parapsychology’ who established the Duke University Parapsychology Laboratory in 1935, died on this date at the age of 84. He coined the term “extrasensory perception.”February 21, 1902 Theodore Reuss was authorized to begin the Swedenborg Lodge of the Holy Grail No.15 in Berlin on this date.February 21, 1903 Anais Nin, a literary figure of the avant-garde, was born on this date in Neuilly, France. She was a ‘modernist’ writer of short stories and novels but is most famous for her sexually explicit journals and her correspondence with her lover, the American writer and story-teller Henry Miller, whom she stated in her book Incest, in the chapter simply titled “November 2, 1934”, that “Henry has fallen under the spell of a remarkable old man {Aleister Crowley} who is fantastic and psychic, a painter gone mad in Zurich.” It seems, according to Miller, that he first met Aleister Crowley in Paris through the French astrologer Conrad Moricand in 1933 but Crowleyites are doubtful of this since Crowley was expelled from France in the April of 1929, never to set foot in that country again after June of that year. Therefore, how Miller could have encountered the Beast in Paris in 1933 is truly a remarkable feat of story-telling, which Anais Nin seemingly accepted as truth. February 21, 1907 On this date the British poet Wystan Hugh Auden, and author of The Age of Anxiety, was born in York, England. He was one of the 148 a contributors on a brief questionnaire which was sent “To the Writers and Poets of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.” The simple question that was asked of each was: “Are you for, or against, the legal Government and the People of Republican Spain? Are you for, or against, Franco and Fascism?” The final 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"pamphlet was titled Authors take Sides on the Spanish War and was published by the Left Review, London 1937. Some of the author’s remarks are neutral, others are speaking out for Franco and, of course, Aleister Crowley’s comment in the pamphlet is referred to as being ‘violent.’ All he wrote was: “Franco is a common murderer and pirate: should swing in chains at Execution Dock. Mussolini, the secret assassin, possibly worse. Hitler may prove a ‘prophet’; time will judge.”February 21, 1943 The first issue of The Oriflamme rolled off the press in California on this date. It was released through the Agape Lodge of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis. After receiving his copy Crowley sent Jane Wolfe a letter stating, “About ‘Oriflamme’: I cannot see the point of this at all. It is the most amateurish production I have ever set eyes on. You give absolutely not one word of the information which people expect when they pick up a new magazine. Why don’t you print the Constitution of the O.T.O. perhaps in an abridged form? You have got to show who you are, what you stand for, and what you are doing. You don’t even give an address, except a post office box. I can not imagine any more stupid way of wasting money ... Anyhow, for the future, please print nothing of mine in any such rag-bag of imbecility!”February 22, 1917 Sybil Leek was born on this date in Straffordshire, England, although she always told people she was born in 1922. However, at her death, her ‘funeral card’ gave the correct information. Many consider this auburn-haired, green-eyed woman one of the most famous twentieth century witches and astrologers who ever lived while others are not quite sure they’d go that far. Her claims to hereditary witchcraft are as fascinating as they are debatable. After leaving England she briefly stayed in California before finally settling in Texas. It was here that she made her fame from media coverage, radio shows and believe-it-or-not an occult restaurant in Houston named Sybil Leek’s Cauldron. During this period she is probably most famous for her long flowing black robe and her jackdaw named Mr. Hotfoot Jackson. She also gained considerable fame with her books, The Diary of a Witch, The Complete Art of Witchcraft andMy Life in Astrology, to name just a few.February 22, 1950 On this date, Neil Megson was born. He is more commonly known by his stage name; Genesis P-Orridge. He is a gifted English musician associated with the bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, he is also performance artist, writer and the founder of The Temple Ov Psychick Youth.February 22, 1968 A farmer named Stephen Coyne went to the dry bog near Lough Nahooin, one of a series of small lakes linked by streams which run 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"through Connemara, Ireland, on this date. With him were his eight-year old son and the family dog. On reaching the bog, Coyne noticed a strange black object in the water and assumed that it was his dog. When he whistled for it to get out, the dog came bounding up from elsewhere. The moment the dog saw the object in the water, it froze and stared at it. The object proved to be a strange animal with a long narrow, pole like head, without visible eyes and a neck nearly a foot in diameter. It was swimming in various directions, occasionally thrusting its head and neck underwater. Whenever this happened, two humps from its back would emerge into view as would, sometimes, a huge flat tail. On one occasion this tail was observed near the head, indicating that the animal was both long and flexible. Coyne said the skin looked black, very slick, and hairless and that the animal appeared to be at least 12 feet long. Once, apparently annoyed by the dog’s barking, the creature swam toward them, its mouth open. Coyne immediately stepped forward to protect the dog, and with that the creature retreated, to resume its casual, directionless movement through the water. Soon father and son were joined by the other more members of the Coyne family. It remained clearly in view, sometimes from as little as five or six yards away. The creature was still there when darkness fell and the Coynes decided to go home.February 22, 1969 On this date, Mark Probert, world famous medium and the most prominent psychic at Borderland Science Research Associates (BSRA), died. This organization was founded by Meade Layne. It was originally noted by Layne that Probert talked in his sleep in a “foreign language,” one which she couldn’t understand. Layne deducted that Probert was a deep trance medium, and she proceeded to confirm this hypothesis by tests. In time it was discovered that he had been in touch with a group of sixteen different entities, calling themselves the “Inner Circle.” In time Probert’s role was to act as a ‘cosmic telephone’ link between Earth and an ‘Inner Circle’ of departed spirits in order for them to help BSRA contact UFOs.February 23, 1680 La Voisin the ‘Satanic High Priestess’ was burned to the stake after confessing that she obtained over 2500 children during her life to be used as human sacrifices to ‘Satan’.February 23, 1996 On this date in Tamaulipas, Mexico, Irasema Margarita Cuevas, Guillermo Serna Marquez and others in the household heard their dogs barking crazily outside. When they went to investigate they saw a red-orange dome shaped UFO floating a few feet from the ground, near some nearby trees. From the craft a small humanoid emerged; floating up and down in an odd manner and from a belt around the creature’s waist a bluish beam of light was seen. The 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"witnesses said that the creature appeared almost robotic in nature, somewhat resembling “Alpha” from the famed children’s shows “The Power Rangers.” After a few minutes the creature reentered the UFO, which rose up to join a similar craft and then took off. It landed a short while away in a nearby swamp. At the second site they saw a much larger humanoid appeared, seemingly floating above the trees and be accompanied by the earlier “Alpha” like entity. When it became late and dark, everyone headed home but the next day, when they went to investigate they found a large section of the ground scorched in the form of three enormous circles. Strange purplish white foam like substance was also discovered. Over the next few days other strange incidents were reported in the area like small flying red spheres, animal mutilations, and a large orange sphere that followed some of the people around late one night.February 24, 1463 Pico de Mirandola, the Renaissance Alchemist and author of De Auro was born on this date. Italian philosopher and humanist. To many in the age of the Renaissance, Pico was the ideal man, whose physical beauty reflected his inner harmony. In his Oration on the Dignity of Man (c. 1487) he proclaimed that individuals face no limits to their development except those that are self-imposed. His other works include Heptaplus, a mystical account of the creation; De ante et uno; and an unfinished attack on astrology.February 24, 1902 On this date Wynn Westcott authorizes Theodore Reuss to form a High Council in Germania of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, with Reuss as the Magus and Leopold Engel as Magus Delegatus Primus although it never took root and by July of 1907 it folded.February 24,1950 One of the founding members of the Ordo Templi Orientis in the United States died in Canada on this date, this was Frater Achad, Charles Stansfeld Jones. February 25, 1894 Meher Baba was born on this date to Zoroastrian parents in Poona, a city on the Deccan plateau of India. It was said that at an early age Meher Baba entered into the state of God-Realization and that his mission as an Avatar, a Hindu word for Godman, was to extend his principle message of love. He died in 1969.February 25, 1919 Frank Bennett signed the Oath of a Neophyte in the A∴A∴ on this date and became known as Frater Progradior.

The 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"OTO’s limited activity in Australia ceased when Frank Bennett returned to England. He visited Crowley at the Abbey of Thelema, at Cefalu and attained an illumination while swimming near with the Beast. As a result Liber Samekh, DCCC, was prepared by Crowley especially for Bennett.

He had murdered ten women and a young boy. In his confession he wrote, “I did it. I burned their bodies in my kitchen oven.”February 25, 1927 The Baltimore Sun, of Baltimore, Maryland, ran the following headlines on this date; “Wm. Fuld is Killed in Fall from Roof, Support gives way while he is helping erect flagpole atop factory.” It seems William Fuld, one of the two brothers who ran the original Ouija Board Company, had accidentally fallen off the roof of his Baltimore company and plunged three stories to his death. He was only 54. Of course there were immediate rumors circulating of a suicide since the business had supposedly fallen on hard times. Others, who were actually present, disagreed, claiming that William was supervising the assembly of a new flagpole when the support post he was leaning against gave way. They said he simply fell backwards off the roof. Still, the suicide stories persist to this day. As for Isaac, he died twelve years later on November 18th 1939 at the age of seventy-four.February 25, 1969 On this date Barney Hill died. He had became famous years earlier due to his story being told in a book titled The Interrupted Journey about him and his wife Betty being taken aboard a UFO on US Route 3 near the village of Lancaster, New Hampshire in 1961.February 26, 1913 Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater V.I.O.) received a letter informing him that he has passed into the Neophyte Degree of the A∴A∴.February 26, 1919 The Evening World Newspaper carried an article on this date about Aleister Crowley’s paintings in New York. It was titled “Painting Dead Souls With Eyes Shut Easy For Subconscious Impressionist, Greenwich Village’s Latest Sensation.” In this article Crowley is quoted as saying, “Now over there you see a weird looking lady with something resembling a pig. The title of that is ‘Ella Wheeler Wilcox and the Swami.’ One of my best works, that.” Ella Wheeler 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Wilcox, was an American poet whom Crowley didn’t like. She wrote numerous popular verses which everyone ‘seemingly’ knew. Possibly her most famous verse quoted to this day is “Laugh and the World Laughs with you” (Poems of Passion, 1883).

He was cremated and then buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Although he had many followers who believed in his stories, Time magazine simply referred to him as “a crackpot from California.” At the time of his death he was offering to teach people how to visit the planets Venus and Mars through self-hypnosis ‘for only fifty dollars.’ February 27, 1784 Although many of his followers claim that this man to be still alive, since he knew the secret of the Elixir of Life, the truth is that Comte de St. Germain died in Hesse, Germany on this date.February 27, 1861 Rudolf Steiner, philosopher and the father of bio-dynamic farming movement, was born on this date in Kralijevec, Hungary, the gifted son of a minor railway official. At the age of eight he was already aware of things that are not seen by others. Writing about his experiences at this age, he said, “. . . the reality of the spiritual world was as certain to me as that of the physical. I felt the need, however, for a sort of justification for this assumption.” Inevitably, he was drawn to The German Theosophical Society, which he became the head of from 1902 until 1912. One of his main motives for leaving the Theosophists was that they did not treat Jesus or Christianity as special. After breaking away and formed his Anthroposophical Society. Steiner’s most lasting and significant influence still felt worldwide has been in the field of education. In 1913 at Dornach, near Basel, Switzerland, Steiner built his Goetheanum. This was a “school of spiritual science.” It was a forerunner of the Steiner or the now famous ‘Waldorf schools.’ The first U.S. Waldorf School opened in New York City in 1928. Today, the Steinerians claim that there are more than 600 Waldorf schools in over 32 countries with approximately 120,000 students. About 125 of the Waldorf schools are said to be currently operating in North America. Most people haven’t a clue where the term ‘Waldorf school’ originated. It seems the owner of a local factory had invited Steiner to give a series of lectures to his factory workers and apparently was so impressed he asked Steiner to set up a school for its children. He did so in 1919 and this became the first of the Steiner Schools  in the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany.

February 28, 1960 Richard Ramirez was born on this date in El Paso, Texas. Besides being called a “spineless, gutless punk” he was also known as the Night Stalker; a term taken from a song on AC/DC’s album titled Highway To Hell. This was Ramirez’s favorite heavy metal band. His nighttime killing spree and sexual attacks of random victims began in June of 1984 and proceeded for about five months. He boasted of being a ‘Devil worshipper,’ a ‘Satanist’ and he was notorious for scrawling an inverted pentacle in his victim’s blood on the wall of each crime scene. He was found guilty on September 20, 1989 and sentenced to death.February 29, 1880 Aleister Crowley’s sister, Grace Mary Elizabeth Crowley died on this date leaving young Alex an only child.February 29, 1934 Charles Webster Leadbeater died on this date. He was supposedly trained for clairvoyance by an Indian Master and he later became one of the prominent researchers in the field of human consciousness. He applied his knowledge by supporting several occult movements, particularly the Theosophical Society and the co-Masonic obedience Le Droit Humain.

The Ouija then spelt out many messages, including the advice for her to try ‘automatic writing.’ For almost a year both she and her husband experimented with automatic writing, receiving a number of simple messages but inevitably Betty was led to a method in which she entered a higher state of consciousness, speaking in her own voice or “the voice of other entities,” all of whom always refused to identify themselves.

As the aunt approached, she said to young Eileen, “I am going away now and I must take the baby with me.” Eileen quickly ran into the house to relate this to her adoptive aunt, who immediately punished her for making up a lie. The following day she learned that her aunt had died in childbirth, along with the baby. This strange introduction to death had a serious impact upon young Eileen. She asked many questions but received no answers, least of all from her aunt. Distraught and in reaction to what she felt was an undeserved punishment, she drowned some ducklings which her aunt loved. She recalls, “The little dead bodies were quiet, but a strange movement was occurring all about them. A gray, smoke-like substance rose up from each small form. This nebulous, fluid stuff wove and curled as it rose in winding spiral curves, and I saw it take new shape as it moved out and away from the quiet forms.” Thus, at a young age, she became aware that there was more to life than the physical form, and that this ‘more’ separated itself from the body, at the time of death.

He was considered by many to be the greatest psychic of the 20th Century. Most of his adult life Cayce demonstrated the uncanny ability to put himself into self-induced sleep by lying down on a couch, closing his eyes, and folding his hands over his stomach. This state enabled him to place his mind in contact with all time and space and, while in this state, he could respond to questions as diverse as, “What are the secrets of the universe?” During his life he had openly preached vegetarianism as a system of health and diet although he was known to break his own rules by eating his favorite meat, pork. When asked about this violation he simply replied, “I wouldn’t be worth much if I couldn’t raise the vibration level of that poor little hunk of meat.” He also believed that one of his past incarnations was ‘Lucius’, or Luke, the companion of Jesus Christ.

It was no secret that he was a Nazi apologist and he was charged with such a criminal offense in 1941 under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He served four years in prison between 1943-47. He was, for awhile, a close friend of Aleister Crowley who submitted numerous articles to his publication. In Crowley’s 1936 diaries there is a brief entry on Thursday July 30th, “George Sylvester Viereck to lunch. Saturnus, Rudy, & girl Pat.

This law was broadened further by Elizabeth’s successor James I, a king who wrote a treatise on Dæmonologie. In 1604, the first year of his reign, the Elizabethan act was broadened to bring the penalty of death without to any one who invoked evil spirits or communed with familiar spirits.

Here he changed his name to Léo Taxil but, caught in another fraud, he was expelled from Switzerland. He returned to France in 1879 during a period of strong anti-Catholic Church sentiment and Léo, ever looking for his next victim, decided there was a ready market for anticlerical publications. In hopes of gathering anti-Church material, he joined the Masonic lodge Le Temple de L'Honneur Français in Paris in 1881 but he was exposed and expelled before going beyond the first degree. Unable to make any serious money from his anti-Catholic writing he decided to look in other directions and soon he began attacking Freemasonry with such titles as; The Three-point Brothers, The Anti-Christ and the Origin of Masonry, The Cult of the Great Architect, Pius IX; Freeman? and The Masonic Assassins. He also took the simple phrase attributed it to the Masonic scholar Albert Pike; being “Lucifer is God” and he honed it into proof of the organization’s evil intent. He was also not above ‘fabricating’ information to insight the masses to buy his books.

Earlier, after Florence Farr had severed all ties to what was left of the Golden Dawn, those initiates who were oriented toward mysticism kept control of Isis-Urania under Arthur Edward Waite. Crowley would later angrily comment that Waite “has substituted a pompous, turgid rigmarole of bombastic platitudes for the neophyte ritual, so that the last spark of interest is extinct for ever.” History has shown that this same mystical ineptness would spill over into The Fellowship of The Rosy Cross.69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"March 25, 1900 Aleister Crowley received a letter on this date from Soror Deo Date, Mrs. E.

In this novel a human being named Valentine Michael Smith, who was born on Mars and raised by Martians, returned to Earth in 2519. He established the Church of All Worlds, built around ‘nests’, a combination of congregations and intentional communities. A basic concept was ‘grokking’, i.e., the ability to be fully empathic. Heinlein’s CAW emphasized non-possessive love and joyous expression of sexuality as divine union. Their greeting was ‘Thou art God’ or ‘Thou art Goddess’, recognition of immanent divinity in each person.

Having accomplished many a feat in his day, one of his claims to fame began when he 98 years ago, or on August 11, 1900; this is when Larkin found himself accepting the position of director of the Lowe Observatory. A volume alone could be written on the history of the Mt. Lowe Observatory in California and the astronomical discoveries of the skies recorded by its various learned astronomers but such does not necessarily warrant consideration in this book. What is to be noted is that in 1925 a writer by the name of Selvius wrote an article titled Descendants of Lemuria: A Description of an Ancient Cult in America, which was published in the Mystic Triangle in their August 1925 issue. The article was about a mystic Lemurian village hidden and concealed on top of Mt. Shasta in northern California. Selvius reported that Edgar Larkin had actually seen this Lemurian village through the Lowe Observatory telescope. Then, in 1931, Wishar Spenle Cervé published a widely read book entitled Lemuria: The Lost Continent of the Pacific in which the Selvius material appeared in a slightly elaborated fashion, which seemingly gave credence to Selvius’ story as if it was true in regards to Larkin. The following year another article appeared in the Los Angeles Times, dated May 22, 1932, by Edward Lanser. In his article he reiterates his stories about seeing strange things on Mt. Shasta and to prove that he has penetrated the Lemurian secrets he cites “no less an authority than the eminent scientist, Prof. Edgar Lucian Larkin, for many years director of the Mt. Lowe Observatory in Southern California.” He goes on to say that Larkin actual saw through his telescope huge temples and villages of marble and onyx, rivaling the in the beauty and splendor of those seen in the Yucatan. Thousands of Lemurians were seen going about their daily chores. Of course, all these Lemurian stories about Mt. Shasta went unchallenged because supposedly the original source, or Edgar Lucian Larkin, had died in 1924. Still, it is known fact that Larking did read A Dweller on Two Planets (1905) which was a ‘channeled’ book about Lemurians on Mt. Shasta and in 1913 he did openly acknowledge with absolute certainty, that he believed it. So, it’s quite possible that blinded by his ‘beliefs’ that he did focused Mt. Lowe Observatory’s telescope upon Mt. Shasta and there is no telling what he might have seen. 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"April 6, 1861 The ‘Satanic’ Rosicrucian, Stanisla de Guaita, was born in France on this date.

The intention was to provide a manual which will serve to establish an appropriate ‘setting’ for the experience of such drugs as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and DMT. He was dismissed from Harvard along with Leary in 1963 and, disillusion with utopist drug projects, he traveled to India in 1967, It was here that he encountered his spiritual teacher, Neem Karoli Baba and received the name Ram Dass, or ‘servant of God.’ Afterwards he returned to the United States to pursue his sadhana, or spiritual journey and, in 1974, Ram Dass created the Hanuman Foundation. He also co-founded the Seva Foundation (‘service’ in Sanskrit) in 1978 which is an international organization dedicated to relieving suffering in the world. On February 19, 1997, Ram Dass suffered a stroke which left him paralyzed of the right side of his body and limited his ability to speak.

Later, when Aleister Crowley & Neuburg were in the Sahara trying to summon the Devil, Neuburg kept ‘chirping’ unintelligently during the ritual and, as Neuberg’s friend Calder-Marshall noted, “Crowley became so enraged that he turned Vickybird into a zebra, rode him into Alexandria, and sold him to the zoo, where he remained for two years before regaining human shape.” April 8, 1944 Following months of German bombing, where one actually exploded in the backyard of 93 Jermyn Street, blowing out the windows in Aleister Crowley’s bedroom, Crowley finally decided that he needed “more quiet” and he left London for the countryside. “Can’t say I blame him,” said Grady McMurtry, “I thought it was dumb enough to stay in London to begin with; but I didn’t tell him that.” Crowley took a small room at the Bell Inn, Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire. Crowley described it as “a most delightful, really old, inn, big open fire, food incredibly good. But nothing to do, and no one to talk to.” He was given room No.11 which, according to one of Crowley’s biographers, seemingly pleased him since it was the number of the Qliphoth or rather the infernal sphere on the Qabalistic Tree of Life.

The first reliable historic evidence of spontaneous human combustion appeared years earlier in 1673 when Frenchman Jonas Dupont published a collection of spontaneous human combustion cases and studies entitled De Incendiis Corporis Humani Spontaneis.April 9, 1821 One of the giants of French literature, Charles Baudelaire, was born on this date in Paris. He was an audacious character who cherished the idea of doing things for their shock value, like dying his hair green or walking down the streets of Paris with a pet lobster on a leash. Once, when an interviewer asked him what his favorite word was, he simply replied, “hemorrhoids.” He was one of Aleister Crowley’s greatest inspirations. Who, like Baudelaire, would often wear daring hairstyles like a Mohawk haircut, or only a tuft of pink or green hair on top of a shaved head. Crowley’s dress was also so unusual at times that people starred at him as if he were a Parisian fashion statement. Crowley translated and published many of Baudelaire’s poems.April 9, 1879 Gerald Festus Kelly was born in Paddington, London on this date. He was educated at Eton, Trinity Hall Cambridge and Paris. While at Cambridge he met Aleister Crowley. Together they planned to publish a magazine, but they never did. Instead they built up a close friendship, with Crowley later joining Kelly in his Montparnasse studio in Paris. They met again in Scotland, where Crowley met Kelly’s sister Rose and inevitably married her. Kelly became a member of the Salon d’Automne, Paris in 1904. His first exhibition of paintings and drawings took place at the Royal Academy in 1909 and he was also a founder member of the National Portrait Society. He was commissioned to paint the State Portraits of both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, which he completed 1945. 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"He died quietly and peacefully at his home on January 5th 1972 of bronchial pneumonia. He was 93 years old. April 9, 1883 Leah Hirsig was born on this date in Switzerland, one of nine children. At the age of two her family moved to the United States, where she grew up in New York. On reaching adulthood she became a teacher at a public high school in the Bronx. She and her older sister Alma were drawn to the study of the occult, and this interest led them to visit Aleister Crowley in 1918, who was living at the time in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. Crowley and Hirsig felt an immediate and instinctive connection. In January of 1919, he consecrated her as his Scarlet Woman. She adopted the magical name Alostrael, “the womb (or grail) of God.” Crowley also called her the Ape of Thoth, in reference to the companion of the god Tahuti who enables his ideas to become reality. Hirsig indeed proved herself by assisting Crowley in making his dreams a reality. In 1920 they founded the Abbey of Thelema in the town of Cefalù on the coast of Sicily, thus realizing in concrete form the dream of the French literary genius and early Thelemite François Rabelais. At the Abbey, Hirsig was instrumental in guiding Crowley, the Prophet of the New Aeon, to a deeper understanding of the Law of Thelema. At a time of despair, Crowley wrote, “What really pulled me from the pit was the courage, wisdom, understanding and divine enlightenment of the Ape herself. Over and over again, she smote into my soul that I must understand the way of the gods... We must not look to the dead past, or gamble with the unformed future; we must live wholly in the present, wholly absorbed in the Great Work, ‘unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result’. Only so could will be pure and perfect.” Hirsig’s role as Crowley’s initiatrix reached a pinnacle on May 23, 1921 she presided over his assuming the Oath of Ipsissimus in the A∴A∴, or 10°=1 ̈ . She was the only person present to have witnessed this event. Inevitably, like all his woman, Hirsig fell out grace. On September 21, 1924 she sent a letter to Aleister Crowley stating, “I hereby renounce the title of Scarlet Woman and pass it on to the Scarlet Concubine” of your desire, which meant that his latest woman, Dorothy Olsen, could assume the throne. This did not mean that Hirsig was abandoning her commitment to Thelema. Her diary from this period reveals her continuing devotion to the Great Work, her renewal of her magical oaths, her ongoing invocations of Ra Hoor Khuit, and her consecration of herself as the bride of Chaos. In 1925, when Crowley asked her to serve again for a period as his scribe and secretary, she readily accepted; she was ready to give her assistance when it was necessary to the furtherance of his magical work and to the promulgation of the Law of Thelema. As Crowley wrote in his diary during the Cefalù period, “She loves me for my work...

He began his acting career in 1924 with the Provincetown Players. With a resonant voice and the ability to project a humane spirit, he won wide acclaim with his creation of the title role in Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones (1925) and All God’s Chillun Got Wings (1925) Other outstanding dramatic performances included Black Boy (1926), DuBose Heyward’s Porgy (1928) and Othello (in London, 1930, and New York, 1943-45). In 1925 he made his debut as a concert singer. Possessed of a magnificent bass voice, he became known especially for his rendition of “Ol’ Man River” in Jerome Kern’s play Show Boat (1928) and for his interpretations of spirituals. The oddest play, which Robeson wisely never did, was to perform the lead in Aleister Crowley’s play titled Mortadello (1912). It seems, according to Viola Bankes, that Crowley once approached her and asked, “I wish you would ask Paul Robeson to play the Negro rôle in this play. If he accepted it, the success of the play would be assured.” The character whom Crowley felt Robeson should play was Orlando. In Mortadello he is described as being “of gigantic stature, a full negro who is romantically involved with a white woman named Monica, ‘whose long black hair hung down upon her milky white shoulders.’ Viola agreed to Crowley’s requests and, in time, she met with Robeson at Albert Hall. She also gave him a copy of Crowley’s Mortadello but, in the end, Robeson declined the offer to play Orlando. He explained, “I’m afraid it’s no use. You see, there are certain lines and gestures which the British public would not care to see enacted between a Negro and a white woman. As for the American stage, why, if I were to produce it over there, someone in the audience would get up and shoot me with a revolver!” Paul Robeson died in Philadelphia on January 23, 1976.April 9, 1904 Aleister Crowley received the second chapter of The Book of The Law, known as Liber AL vel Legis, on this day in Cairo at noon.April 10, 1612 The events which lead up to this date began the previous months when Alizon Device was begging on the road to Trawden, England, where she met John Law and asked him for some pins. He refused, she became angry and no sooner had he parted than he mysteriously fell to the ground lame. The story of the witches of Pendle began with a feud between two families, both headed by old women with a notorious reputation for witchcraft and who began making accusations toward members in the opposite clans. Some members were arrested, 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"while others of the two rival clans met on this date, of April 10, 1612, at a big feast at Malkin Tower, the home of Alizon Device and her family. They met in order to try and find a solution to their feuding and to discuss the possibility of breaking those family members already accused of witchcraft out of jail. This makes the crimes seem all the more serious, as there is now an apparent element of conspiracy and even a documented “witch’s sabbat.” This meeting precipitated in Alizon Device’s being arrested on April 27 along with her immediate family, and all those who were present at Malkin Tower ‘sabbat, along with even some of their neighbors by Roger Nowell, the prosecutor and former High Sheriff of Lancashire. After the ‘interrogation’ some were deemed innocent and released while others were sent to Lancaster to await trial on a charge of witchcraft. However, on July 27, 1612, Jennet Preston becomes the first of the ‘Malkin Tower’ Witches to be hanged. On August 18th and 19th, more were tried at the Assizes in Lancaster, with Judge Bromley presiding, accompanied by Judge Altham. Unfortunately, one of the older clan members died in prison before she reached trial. On August 20th, ten more people, having been found guilty, were taken from the castle and hanged. In the end, twenty people were arrested, tried and convicted. This is the story, in brief, of the infamous Lancashire witches. April 10, 1880 The Reverend Alphonsus Joseph-Mary Augustus Montague Summers was born at Pembroke Lodge, near Bristol, England on this date. It is believed that he simply claimed the title of ‘Reverend’ because it is not exactly known to which religious order he belonged. Although many have theories, there is no specific proof of his affiliation. Throughout his life, he was a firm believer in the powers of Evil, and pursued an avid research to document its manifestation: he was a prolific writer on Satanism, Demonology, Witchcraft and Black Magic. His works include The History of Witchcraft and Demonology (1926), The Geography of Witchcraft (1927), The Vampire, His Kith and Kin (1928) and The Werewolf (1933), to name only a few. It is very difficult to decipher the exact relationship which he and Aleister Crowley shared, since not enough information survives to detail the full story but, unlike the story of Neuburg being turned into a Zebra, there is another story that “Aleister Crowley once changed Summers into a giraffe, but forgot to tell him. So that Summers never knew.”April 10, 1902 Arthur Edward Waite was admitted to Metropolitan College of the S.R.I.A on this date.April 10, 1904 The third and final chapter of The Book of The Law, known as Liber AL vel Legis, was dictated to Aleister Crowley at noon on this day, thus completing the volume.82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"April 10, 1931 On this date the author of the best selling book The Prophet, Khalil Gibran, died of cancer in New York City hospital, at age 48.

Several roosters and chickens were found mutilated the next day as well as some of the neighbor’s goats.

In the spring of 1670, when he was 76 years old, he suddenly began to confess to horrible crimes. At first, no one believed him, thinking he had lost his mind but since he insisted that he was telling the truth, the Provost was obligated to send doctors to examine him, to determine if major Weir was sane or insane. His confessions included an incestuous relationship with his sister Jane from the time she was ten until she was fifty, which only ceased when he no longer found her physically attractive. He also claimed to have slept with his step-daughter, Margaret Bourdon, and of having many illicit affairs with the servant girls of his house. Worse, he admitted to bestiality with horses and cows. One woman even came forward to report that she had seen him in ‘flagrante delicto’ with a mare. Sadly, she was not believed and was publicly whipped for telling lies. Still, Major Weir’s confessed perversions were just the tip of the iceberg. He claimed the motive for all his sexual misdeeds was that he was a witch, which in the 17th century sense of the word meant that he was a sorcerer and Devil-worshipper. His close colleague in sorcery was his sister, Jane Weir, who up to this time had been regarded merely as a kindly old spinster. When confronted with her brother’s charges, Jane Weir did an extraordinary thing  she confessed. Her description of her life of sin had more to do with magic than 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"perversion. She claimed to be an emissary of a Fairy Queen, “a very tall woman with a child on her back,” whom she struck a deal with in order to be taught how to spin yarn at a rate four times faster than any human could. When this detail was brought to light, all of Edinburgh recalled how Jane Weir was renowned for her skill at spinning and this meant that she obviously sold her soul to the Devil, whom she admitted appeared to her as a small female midget. It was Jane who told the authorities that her brother’s staff was a magical wand. He leaned on it during prayer, she said, so that the Devil could inspire him to colossal lies and pretense of piety. After being examined by a learned doctor both Weirs were pronounced ‘Certified as Sane’ and they went on trial for their lives on April 9, 1670. The trial didn’t last long. The jury unanimously found Jane Weir guilty of witchcraft. Her brother was not convicted of any witchcraft charges but he was found guilty of sexual crimes. On April 11, Thomas Weir was brought to the place of execution, which was a spot between Edinburgh and Leith. He was permitted the mercy of strangulation before his was body was burned. He died, as Sir Walter Scott would later write, “stupidly sullen and impenitent.” His sister, Jane Weir, was burned at the stake the following day at Grass Market. She was distraught on the scaffold, and cried out that she wanted to die with “as much shame as possible.” Though over sixty years old, she tore at her clothes, trying to bare her aged and wrinkled body to the onlookers. In a scene that echoes down to the present day, she rebuked the mob at her execution, telling them: “I see a great crowd of people come hither today to behold a poor old miserable creature’s death, but I trow there will be few among you who are weeping and mourning for the broken Covenant.” The Weir’s house, called ‘The Bow,’ stood for a century and a half, becoming infamous as a haunted house. Neighbors reported weird lights and noises from the empty house, sounds of dancing, shrieks, and the sound of a spinning wheel, even a glowing coach would sometimes pull up to the house to take the spirits of Thomas and Jane Weir off to Hell. No one would rent the place. The last known couple who tried, in the early 19th century, left after one night because they awoke to find, of all things, a spectral calf peering at them as they lay in bed. ‘The Bow’ was torn down in the 1830s to make way for new construction.

She admitted to having frequent dealings with faeries who took her to Faerieland, entering through various mounds and caverns. The entrance of the land of the Faerie was populated by elf-bulls, whose “roaring and skoilling” always left her frightened. Gowdie said that she met often with the Queen and King of Faerieland. They were always finely dressed and offered her more meat than she could eat. Together with other witches and faeries, Gowdie would amuse herself by changing herself into an animal, like a hare or a cat. The Faeries also taught her how to fly by climbing beanstocks and cornstraws and shouting, “Horse and Hattock, in the Devil’s name!” Gowdie also claimed to have used her broom for an atypical reason. Instead of using it for cleaning or nightly traveling, she used it to deceive her husband. Before going to a sabbat, Gowdie substituted her broom for herself in bed.

However, this didn’t stop Culling from signing over the Ordo Templi Orientis on this date to Carroll R. Runyon Jr in order for him to assume head of the Order. Of course, in reality, Culling had no authorization to give out Charters and although it was often said that Culling was a IX° initiate; there is no evidence to show that he went any farther than Second Degree.April 17 1996 Near Belem, Brazil on this date, twenty-seven year old Alfredo de Oliveira Mendes, a sacristan at a local church, witnessed a UFO land in the backyard of the mission. He later reported blacking out and having a period of missing time. Under hypnosis he recalled being abducted by eight beings, described as silver in color with long eyes and what looked like a fin on their foreheads. The beings wore silver coverall type outfits with an emblem containing a pyramid and a wing. If it was all his imagination no one could explain the huge burnt circle that was found on the ground behind the mission.April 18, 1955 On this date Albert Einstein died quietly in his sleep at Princeton Hospital in New Jersey, after a long and brilliant career in which his name became synonymous with genius. Like Aleister Crowley, throughout Einstein’s career he acknowledged the importance of combining scientific and religious methods. Where Crowley wrote the profound statement: “The method of Science, the Aim of Religion,” Einstein in 1934 offered this observation: “Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”April 19, 1858 Leopold Engel, the itinerant actor who practiced hypnotism and alleged naturopathic healing on the side, was born on this date.

In a letter to Kenneth Grant in April of 1945 Grady McMurtry Wrote, “I’ve been seeing quite a bit of Hitler’s Reich and expect to see a lot more. Very nice country. The scenery, I mean. What our air forces left of the cities shouldn’t happen to a dog house. They haven’t knocked down the walls and carted away the rubble as in London so that you find whole cities, and I don’t mean just large towns, that look like they had just been dug out of a mound by an archeological expedition. Which just goes to show that if you’re rude to other people they are apt to be rude right back at you.”April 20, 1912 Bram Stoker, the author of Dracula, died in London on this date at the age of 65. He was cremated at Golders Green Cemetery in London. Some people have speculated that Stoker was a member of the Hermetic Order of The Golden Dawn but no evidence has ever surfaced to support this assertion.April 20, 1923 Norman Mudd, the gifted ‘one eyed’ mathematician, arrived at Crowley’s Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu on this date. Upon joining the A∴A∴ he assumed the motto Omnia Pro Veritate, which means ‘All for Truth.’ Crowley would later write about Mudd as - “a nearly liquid mass of loathesome of detestable putrescence. - but oh that ‘nearly’.

Her father, Roy, was an auto-mechanic. Her mother, Edna, was part Cherokee. She was the nice girl but naughty, often shy while being daring, simple and exotic, Bettie portrayed a freshness never before seen in the modeling scene. Without elaborate props, costumes, or even set-dressings, Bettie produced some of the most beautiful shots to ever grace the covers of hundreds of magazines. Bettie once said, “I was not trying to be shocking, or to be a pioneer. I wasn’t trying to change society, or to be ahead of my time. I didn’t think of myself as liberated, and I don’t believe that I did anything important. I was just myself.

It happened on the Sutton family farm. A visiting friend, named Billy Ray Taylor, went out to fetch some water and saw a large shining object land. When he told others inside the farm house, they laughed but became concerned a short time later the family dog began barking wildly outside. At this point Carl “Lucky” Sutton and Billy Ray grabbed their guns and went out to investigate. That is when they saw a small 4 foot creature with large eyes, a long thin mouth, large ears, thin short legs, and hands ending in claws, walking towards them with its hands up, as if surrendering. In a rural area of Kentucky in the 1950s, folks were likely to shoot first and ask questions later if they felt threatened, which both gentleman did. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"However, the creature seemed ill affected by the bullets and simply made a quick back flip and ran quickly into the woods. Within a short period more creatures returned, looking through the window, climbing on the roof and literally putting siege to their house for over three hours.

Finally, the entire seven member family was able to climb into two vehicles where they fled down the dirt and away from the farm. April 22, 1984 J.

However, his baptismal register at the Holy Trinity parish church, in Stratford, survives and is dated April 26, 1564. The 23rd is merely a sentimental date being chosen by most historians since it is also the day of England’s patron, Saint George.April 23, 1616 On this date William Shakespeare, one of the greatest literary figures of the Western world, died at Stratford-upon-Avon, on his birthday. He wrote dozens of plays throughout his life, from Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet to Macbeth and such phrases as “To be or not to be” to “Parting is such sweet sorrow” are still standard lingo almost four hundred years after they were first written. In fact, although it might be blasphemous to say, while he was alive Shakespeare’s works rivaled the King James Bible as a source of oft-quoted English phrases. April 23, 1908 Allen Bennett, an initiate of the Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn known as Frater Iehi Aour (Let there be light), always had a strong fascination for Buddhism.

In Hollywood she acted in such movies as Two Mules for Sister Sarah (1970), Coogan’s Bluff (1968), The Beguiled (1971), Dirty Harry (1972), and Escape From Alcatraz (1979). She became heavily involved in the New Age movement and produced prime time TV specials in 1986-87 discussing her views. This lead her to be called the New Age Movement’s “Chief Evangelist,” while others, primarily the skeptics and comedians, sarcastically mocked her beliefs, but she took them all in stride. Although she has written many books, Out on a Limb (1986) is the one which showed her interest in Great Pyramid, reincarnation, trance mediums, astral projection, UFOs and telepathic space aliens. As far a reincarnation: she claims in her past lives to have been everything from an Indian princess, to a peg-legged pirate, to a man from Atlantis. 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"April 24, 1964 Officer Lonnie Zamora, of Socorro New Mexico, stopped his police car on this date and watched in shock as two human-like beings dug up soil samples while standing beside what appeared to be an egg-shaped UFO.

He was a former actor turned director in early Hollywood and was one of the more colorful personalities in early Hollywood. He would have all but been forgotten in history had it not been for his death. On the night of February 1, 1922, someone shot him in the back, between neck and shoulder, leaving him dead on the floor of his duplex at the Alvarado Court Apartments. There appeared to be no sign of a break-in or burglary, and cash was found in the house and on the body. It is still an unsolved crime which has continued to intrigue and tantalize people. Over the years, conspiracy theorists have drawn up a long list of potential suspects of both individuals and groups who may have had a hand in the killing William Desmond Taylor. Most seem fairly outrageous, like the rumors of drug dealing and sex perversions and dark whisperings that tied both his girlfriend and him into the occult practices of the “Ordo-Templis-Orientis” which was a “cult of drug-fiend satanist Aleister Crowley.” In fact, Taylor had been seen in opium dens where men smoked the pipe and had sex with each other. Some said there were “obvious clues, in the death-room, to a homosexual revenge killing.”April 26, 1914 Jess Stern was born on this date in Syracuse, New York. He was a journalist rather than an astrologer, none-the-less he played a role in widening public interest in astrology during the 1970s, especially with his book A Time For Astrology.

Three months later he released a small pamphlet titled Songs For Italy. The subtitle of this piece was ‘Parturiunt Montes - Nascitur Ridiculus Mus – Saolini’, which has been translated as ‘The mountain brought forth a mouse and who was the mouse?’ This is a quote from a fictitious Saolini, whose name when added to the last word of the quote, ‘Mus’, equals ‘Mus-Saolini’ or Mussolini.

He was sometimes called the last Renaissance man, important for his prodigious activity in disseminating knowledge. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1616. He first read mathematics and philosophy at Würzburg, then moved to Avignon and lastly to Rome, where he was appointed teacher of mathematics at the Collegio Romano c. 1638. A prolific writer of European fame, Kircher authored works on subjects ranging from philology to physics, sacred writings, astronomy, natural history, mathematics, music, Egyptology, geography, and Chinese civilization. His greatest legacy has to do with one of the most well-known symbols in the Qabalah known as Otz Chim, or the Tree of Life. This Tree of Life symbol represents everything about our Universe, both above and below, both externally and internally. This glyph supposedly teaches us the hidden secrets of creation itself. It is important to recognize the fact that the Tree of Life has been evolving over the centuries. Its fundamental shape has undergone many mutations 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"as well as numerous additions. Although there are many archaic drawings portraying the Ten Divine Spheres of God, called the sephiroth, most have a totally different quantity and configuration of paths that unite these spheres. Even the shape of the Tree itself varies. Many people mistakenly think that image of the Tree of Life used amongst today’s magicians and found in most Qabalistic books is of an ancient Jewish glyph  it is not. Although the Tree’s theoretical origins are webbed deep in Judaic lore, its design was actually conceived in the mind of Athanasius Kircher. While attending the Jesuit College in Rome he devoted most of his life to collecting information from many different religions, observing the Universe, analyzing, synthesizing, and publishing what he learned. His books are filled with a multitude of beautiful illustrations. In one such book titled Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652) he drew a glyph of the “Sephirothic System” on a Tree of Life as he has ascertained it to be. His drawing clearly shows three pillars comprising of ten spheres, which he connected by twenty-two paths of his own devising while attributing these paths to the Hebrew letters. Hebrew Qabalists so embraced Kircher’s design as being an accurate portrayal of God’s Will that over a period of time it has become acceptable Judaic lore. However, most historians agree, it is Kircher’s design, from the mind of a Christian, which is the earliest rendition of the Tree of Life most readily used today. Kircher died on November 27, 1680 in Rome.May 2, 1937 The only son of Aleister Crowley was born on this date to Patricia ‘Deirdre’ MacAlpine in London. He was name Aleister Ataturk. In September of 1955 he came to America aboard the Queen Mary and briefly stayed with Karl and Sascha Germer before settling in with the Agape Lodge member named Jean Sihvonen. Ataturk, by this time in his early twenties, would inevitably become her lover. Grady McMurtry once commented upon this relationship, “... what the hell. An older woman & she has a chance like this. For godsake let her have it.”May 2, 1996 On this date near the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, a pet goat was found dead with three puncture wounds in its neck, a ‘telltale mark’ of the “Chupacabra.” On the same day, down in Juarez, Mexico, besides finding the usual slain animals, people reported seeing the creature itself. It was described as a tall creature with three toes and hands, on haunches with the fore arms suspended at chest level very similar to a kangaroo. It was also said to have a row of spikes or straight feather like projections from its head and down its back that raise and lower and have been seen to glow with their own light. People reported it standing upright and running on all fours. One person witnessed the “sucking device” which seemed to be a tube like projection from the creature’s mouth.99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"May 3 (?) D. J.

In 1998, she was voted Best Wiccan and New Age author by Silver Chalice, a Pagan magazine. She lives a rather quiet life, with most of her time spent researching and writing. She wrote such books as: Moon Magic, Dancing With Dragons, Magickal, Mystical Creatures, Celtic Magic, Norse Magic, Animal Magick as well as By Oak, Ash & Thorn and Maiden, Mother, Crone.May 3, 1587 Shortly before this date the Angel Madimi appeared in the crystal before Edward Kelly and said: “Hear what I say God is the unity of all things.” She then instructed both John Dee and Kelley to share all things, including their wives. It was on this date that John Dee and Edward Kelley, along with their wives, put their names to a document swearing to carry out any and all Angelic commands, which meant wife swapping. May 3, 1932 On this date the author Charles Fort died. He left over 30 boxes of weird and bizarre stories which the Fortean Society began publishing in their Fortean Society Magazine, which was created by one of Fort’s few friends, Tiffany Thayer. Its premise was to promote and encourage Fort-like attacks on science and scientists. Charles Fort always claimed that he believed nothing was real and nothing was unreal, that “all phenomena are approximations one way or the other between realness and unrealness.” May 3, 1996 On this date near Calderon Village Sinaloa, in northern Mexico, a giant bat-like creature terrorized the local village. Goats were being found daily with their blood sucked dry and farmers formed nightly vigilante squads. One villager remarked, “We are telling people to keep the women and children locked up inside at night,” adding, “Nobody knows really what it is.” Dozens of goats had fallen victim to this bloodsucker by now and it even allegedly attacked one human. Other dead animals were found in Sonora, Veracruz and Agua Prieta, as well as other areas.May 4, 1939 On this date Maurice Richardson, the well-known British writer and critic who wrote numerous short articles, had lunch with the Great Beast. Crowley’s diary simply records, “1 o’c Maurice Richardson to luncheon....A good lunch: he stayed till after 5.” Richardson described the Beast, who was sixty-three, by stating “His once athletic physique had become blurred by fat. He was bald as a stone, and his huge expanse of naked hairless yellowish face was faintly 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"suggestive of an enormous penis, which is no doubt why the adjective ‘obscene’ has often been applied to it.

He had just been released from a Nazi concentration camp, had applied for a Visa and, on April 9th, he moved to New York City. Germer’s appointment would become very problematic over the next few years. Placing someone like Germer, a hard-nosed German who admittedly was not an American, in charge of dictating policies and critiquing other people’s life-styles in, of all places, California, was an accident waiting to happen. Even in this day and age most Americans cannot fathom the antics of Californians. Karl Germer was obviously going to have his hands full.

At the time of his birth his father was 40 years old while his mother, which was his father’s 3rd wife, was only 20. He gained no great love from his father, who always belittled him but his mother always pampered young Freud. From this he drew his theory of the Oedipal Complex which dealt with a young child’s attachment to the opposite sex parent, while viewing the same sex parent as a rival for the affection of the other parent. In a nutshell, it is best said that Freud’s goal in therapy was simply to make the ‘unconscious conscious.’101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"May 6, 1883 The poet Victor Benjamin Neuburg was born on this date at 129 Highbury Hill, Islington. Neuburg was present in Africa with Aleister Crowley in 1909 when the Beast evoked the demon Choronzon.

May 6, 1915 Orson Welles was born on this date in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In the early 1920s he formed The Mercury Theater which later became a radio show. He gained famed for a stunt that he pulled on October 30th, 1938. This is when he adapted a live version of H. G. Wells story ‘The War of the Worlds’ but with one important change. The book was to be performed by numerous actors so that it would sound like a real radio news broadcast about an invasion from Mars, a technique that, presumably, was intended to heighten the dramatic effect on Halloween. As the broadcast unfolded the dance music was interrupted a number of times by fake news bulletins reporting that a “huge flaming object” had dropped out of the sky onto a farm near Grovers Mill, New Jersey. At one point in the broadcast an actor in a studio, who was playing a newscaster in the field, described the emergence of one of the aliens from its spacecraft: “Good heavens, something’s wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake.” The radio broadcast was so convincing that Welles unintentionally fooled people into thinking that Martians had actually invaded Earth. Hundreds of people packed the roads to watch the sky, others hid in cellars, loaded guns, and even wrapped their heads in wet towels as protection from Martian poison gas. Clearly those who missed the opening statements, who had turned into the middle of the broadcast, were oblivious to the fact that they were acting out the role of the panic-stricken public which should have belonged in a radio play and not in the real world.May 6, 1938 The Church of Aphrodite, one of the earliest sources of the divine feminine in the United States, was founded on this date by Reverend Gleb Botkin in West Hempstead, Long Island.

The fight had begun two years earlier, in 1920, when the Internal Revenue Service handed the company a tax bill for the Ouija board.

Judge Woods, in Richmond, Hands Down Opinion Affirming Baltimore Judgment.” The court stated, that the company “cannot pretend to be ignorant that it [i.e. Ouija] is very largely sold with the expectation that it is to be used as a means social amusement or play and is actually so used.

He rode into ‘the valley of death’ at the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War. He was succeeded by a nephew, Courtney Morgan. When Courtney died in 1934 his son, Evan, became the new Lord Tredegar.

His menagerie of animals at Tredegar included a boxing kangaroo, a honey bear, baboons that stalked the gardeners, an anteater, pigeons, birds of prey, which were often sent after suspected Nazi spy pigeons, and a parrot named ‘Blue Boy’ who would sit on his shoulder. His problems leading up to why he invited Crowley to Tredegar Park began during World War II when he worked for British Secret Intelligence in an organization known as MI8. The problem began one afternoon, after having lunch with a pretty young girl, Tredegar decided to show her around the office where he worked. This of course meant his office at the top secret branch of MI8. It was a sort of personal guided tour. This was not a smart career move on Evan Morgan’s part because he was immediately arrested and thrown into the Tower of London for treason. In the end, another branch of British Intelligence called MI5 intervened on his behalf and got him released but he was forced into retirement. Tredegar did not go happily and one author wrote, “Tredegar was outraged by his arrest and threatened dire consequences. He retired to his country seat, Tredegar Park in South Wales, and invited Aleister Crowley, the renowned occultist and magician, to prepare a spell. Coincidentally or otherwise, Tredegar’s arresting officer fell painfully ill shortly afterwards and nearly died.”May 18, 1936 Ralph Metzner was born on this date in Berlin.

Three small occupants 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"emerged from the object and began walking among the parked airplanes. At this point airport security arrived and chased the beings across the runway right in front of a landing Delta airliner. Delta passengers described the beings as child-like in appearance, wearing metallic suits and white helmets. The three humanoids ducked into the terminal through the baggage area still being chased by airport security. Police were called in but when they apparently cornered the trio near a yogurt stand, they ran into what seemed to be an invisible barrier and could not get close to them. The humanoids then ran out through the baggage area. At the same time that Army personnel were arriving on humvees, the delta-winged UFO began to move. Witnesses saw the three occupants in the cockpit window. The object then rose straight up and took off at high speed. May 26, 1647 The widow Alse Young, the first person in the United States to be accused of the crime of witchcraft, was hung on this date at Meeting House Square in Hartford, Connecticut. May 26, 1897 On this date in North Rome, Ohio, two men by the names of Charles Lukins and Bob Forner were attacked by a curly-haired Bigfoot. No one was seriously hurt but the creature escaped.May 27, 1867 Enoch Arnold Bennett was born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, England on this date. His childhood was spent in genteel poverty, which gave way to prosperity as his father succeeded as a solicitor. From his provincial background he became a novelist. After winning a literary competition in Tit Bits magazine in 1889, he moved to London in order to pursue a career as a writer. He became assistant editor of Woman in 1894. Just over four years later his first novel, A Man from the North (1998) was published to critical acclaim and it soon became followed by many others, like Paris Nights (1913). When Aleister Crowley bought the novel Paris Nights he was also amazed to discover that it had been written by his old friend Arnold Bennett. After reading the book he wrote, “Arnold Bennett had gratified the public with a highly spiced description of me.” This description of Crowley appeared in Chapter III titled “An Evening with Exiles” and takes place in a Montparnasse restaurant in Paris. Bennett describes a character whom he calls ‘the Mahatma ‘, who walked into the café “wearing a heavily jewelled red waistcoat, and the largest ring I ever saw on a human hand.” Bennett never mentions the actual name of the Mahatma but Crowley knew it was obviously referring to himself.May 27, 1878 The famous dancer, Isadora Duncan, was born on this date as Dora Angela Duncan in San Francisco, California. She moved to London with her 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"family in 1899 and traveled throughout Europe. Her free-flowing forms of personal expression as a dance style was based on improvisation rather than the strict formal structure of traditional ballet of the day. Her secretary was Mary d’Esti Sturges. Crowley met both Duncan and Sturges during a rather boisterous party at the Savoy Hotel in London on October 11, 1911. This event was being hosted by Isadora Duncan in honor of Mary’s birthday. Crowley was the guest of a youth named Hener Skene whom he refers to as an “obscure prig,” and a “brainless and conceited youth.” Obviously Crowley didn’t like the boy and he used him simply to gain access to the party because he wanted to be introduced to Isadora Duncan. Instead, during the course of the evening, he discovered Mary. At that time Crowley was four years younger than Mary d’Esti who was celebrating her fortieth birthday. He described her as “a magnificent specimen of mingled Irish and Italian blood,” adding that she “possessed a most powerful personality and a terrific magnetism which instantly attracted my own.” May 27, 1911 On this date, Vincent Price, the film and stage actor known as the king of horror, was born in St. Louis, Missouri.May 27, 1922 Christopher Lee was born on this date as Christopher Frank Caradini Lee in London, England. After a long and distinguished career beginning in 1947, as one of the greatest movie stars of horror and fantasy, he took the role of Saruman the White in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). May 27, 1948 Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart (aka Diana Moore) was born on this date, of Irish and Choctaw Indian ancestry, in Long Beach, California. She is a Neo-Pagan poet and Priestess of Shamanic Arts who, along with her husband Oberon, was a co-editor of The Green Egg magazine. May 27, 1960 On this date Peter O’Connor sighted the Loch Ness Monster near Foyers. He described it as having a rather large hump with a small head attached to a long strong looking neck.May 28, 1738 Joseph Ignace Guillotin was born on this date in Saintes, France. He was a French physician who has been credited with inventing the machine by which the sentence of ‘beheading’ could be carried out more humanely. At that time, executions in France were public events that were held in town squares. The poor were usually hanged, but at times the entire town would gather to watch a quartering, where the prisoner’s limbs were tied to four oxen and the animals were driven in four different directions. Upper-class criminals bought their way into a 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"less painful death, usually by sword or axe. However, such traditional methods could prove messy and difficult, especially if the executioner missed or the prisoner struggled. The Guillotin was used as the principle mechanism of execution in France until the death penalty was eliminated in 1981. The last execution occurred in 1971 when 27 year old Hamida Djandoubia, a Tunisian immigrant, was beheaded for murder and torture.May 28, 1908 Ian Fleming was born on this date in Mayfair, England. It is written that he “was a large, healthy, exceedingly naughty child.” Years later, when Ian Fleming wrote his first James Bond novel titled Casino Royale he looked for someone on whom he could his arch-villain. He needed an evil figure so he dredged up his past images of his old friend Aleister Crowley. After all, Fleming “always knew a good villain when he saw one.” He decided to give his villain the name Le Chiffre which is a corruption of the word ‘cipher,’ since the villain claimed he was only a number on a passport. This idea stems from the fact that Le Chiffre was once a Jewish prisoner of Dachau who suffered amnesia, not knowing his real name, only his concentration camp number. Fleming further described Le Chiffre as clean shaven, his complexion was very pale or white, fat, slug-like, with sadistic impulses, constantly using a Benzedrine inhaler and with an insatiable appetite for women. He also had a rather feminine mouth. It is written that “parallels exist between them [meaning Crowley & Le Chiffre]. Both called people ‘dear boy’, and both, like Mussolini, had the whites of their eyes completely visible around the iris.” But does this really sound like Aleister Crowley? Especially being Jewish!May 28, 1939 Llee Heflin was born on this date in Denver, Colorado. After Grady McMurtry, Frater Hymenaeus Alpha 777 IX°, had arrived from Washington D.C. to California in April of 1969 he tried to reactivate the OTO using ‘emergency’ powers given to him by Aleister Crowley. On July 21, 1969 he held his first initiations at a public camp ground on the Russian River at Duncan Mills which is near Jenner, California. Assisting him in the role of the Black Guard was Mildred Burlingame. Phyllis Seckler decided not go. She would later write that these people were “a bad choice in my opinion.” She admitted that one of them she knew was on drugs for quite a few years, “a Haight-Asbury type.” She didn’t think it was a good idea to re-activate the OTO with these types of individuals and she though Grady was making a big mistake. She thought he should have had higher expectations for the OTO. She believed these people, meaning the hippies, would give the Order a bad outer appearance to the world. Heflin would later admit that he knew Phyllis “didn’t particularly care for us little band of ‘hippies’ that Mildred Burlingame found and brought together with Grady.” One of the four 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"people who was initiated on this date was Llee Heflin. Heflin, who was one of the originally founder of Level Press, went on to publish such the book The Island Dialogues (1973) and a pamphlet called Word From Kohoutek (1974).May 29, 1874 G. K. Chesterton was born on this date in London, England. Some have claimed that he was a charming, witty man with a rotund figure and that he was extremely popular in London literary and social circles. He once wrote in the Daily Mail: “We have all possible respect for Mr. Crowley’s religious symbols and we do not object to his calling upon Shu at any hour of the night. Only it would be unreasonable of him to complain if his religious exercises were generally mistaken for an effort to drive away cats. Gilbert Keith Chesterton died on June 14, 1936 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England. May 29, 1925 Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett asserted that “the connection of Atlantis with parts of what is now Brazil is not to be dismissed contemptuously, and belief in it, with or without scientific corroboration, affords explanations for many problems which otherwise are unsolved mysteries.” In Fawcett’s chronicles, which consist of letters, manuscripts, and other records compiled by his son, Brian, the Colonel detailed his expeditions into Mato Grosso, South America in search for the ruins of an ancient lost city of Atlantis. However, his private journal ended with his disappearance on this date.May 29, 1981 This date was the last performance of the band Throbbing Gristle, which was held in San Francisco, playing such classic songs as “Looking for the OTO.”May 29, 1973 On this date near North Sykesville, Maryland, a man named Anthony Dorsey reported seeing a Bigfoot with luminous eyes. Earlier in the day people reported seeing a UFO drop an object into a nearby reservoir and of its connection with the Bigfoot incidents, no one is sure. Besides Dorsey, other people also reported seeing an 8-ft black-haired Bigfoot in the area.May 30, 1431 Joan of Arc, also known the Maid of Orléans, was a simple peasant girl who had claimed to hear the voices of ‘saints’ telling her that she must help the Dauphin gain the throne of France, which she did. However, not long after the Dauphin was crowned King Charles the VIIth, Joan was captured by the English, who tried her as a heretic, found her guilty and burned her at the stake on this date. 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"May 30 1593 Christopher Marlowe, the English dramatist and poet who wrote Dr. Faustus (c. 1588), died on this date but his death is shrouded in mystery. The long-accepted version is that he and two close friends were dinning in a tavern in Deptford. The two quarreled over paying the bill, and in the fight that followed, Marlowe grabbed for his friend’s dagger and attacked him. However, his friend managed to wrestle the dagger from Marlowe and stabbed the author fatally in the eye. Marlowe was buried on June 1, 1593.May 30, 1662 William Backhouse, the ‘Alchemical teacher’ of Elias Ashmole died at Swallowfield, England on this date.May 30, 1778 Francois Marie Arouet, who used the pen name Voltaire, died in Paris on this date at the age of 84. His remains were interred in The Pantheon. Throughout his life he was in constant trouble with French leaders because of his satirical outlook, rationalist approach, and freethinking beliefs. He once wrote, “If God created us in his own image, we have more than reciprocated.” Perhaps his most famous work is his novel Candide (1759). May 30, 1939 On this particular date Aleister Crowley wrote in his diary, “Dion Fortune - Public Bat No 1 at The Belfry. Like a hippo with false teeth.” Crowley had spent the day with Mrs Fortune at The Belfry. This was the name of the property that Fortune leased in West London in order to create a Temple for her followers, which she dedicated to the “Mysteries of Isis”.May 31, 1875 Eliphas Levi, which was the pseudonym of Alphonse-Luis Constant, died on this date. He was a French occultist and author whose books greatly influenced many of the early revivalists of the 19th century, like Aleister Crowley who claimed that this gentleman was his previous incarnation.May 31, 1940 Victor Neuburg died on this date of tuberculosis. He once had an affair with Ione de Forest (Joan Hayes) who had a role in Crowley’s Rites of Eleusis. For some reason, this infuriated Crowley who later wrote in Magick in Theory and Practice that he once found it necessary to slay a Circe who was bewitching brethren. What Crowley is implying is that he cursed Ione de Forest who, two months after starting affair with Neuburg, committed suicide by shooting herself. Neuburg never forgave Crowley for this treacherous act.May 31, 1965 On this date Mrs. Seraphine Jasper, of Nicomen Island near Mission, British Columbia walked out into her field to see a tall, black Bigfoot walking across her field. She also noticed that all her cows were starring at it.119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"JUNEJune 1, 1563 Witchcraft act, signed in March of 1563, took effect on this date in England June 1, 1801 Brigham Young was born the ninth of eleven children on this date in Whitingham, Vermont, into a poor Vermont farming family. When the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young was on the East Coast. On his return, he played a critical role in keeping the savagely persecuted church together by organizing the exodus that would inevitably take the Mormons westward, first to their Winter Quarters, Nebraska, in 1846, and finally on to Utah’s Salt Lake Valley, in 1847. It was here that Young’s leadership was confirmed and he was named president and prophet of the church, inheriting the authority of Joseph Smith. Brigham Young died on August 29, 1877.June 1, 1867 On this date, in the city of London, the first meeting of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (S.R.I.A.) was held.June 1, 1926 Norma Jeane Mortenson, more commonly known as the actress Marilyn Monroe, was born on this date in Los Angeles, California. She was described by Anton LaVey, the founder of the First Church of Satan, as a “willing, but not very imaginative sex partner.” However, history has shone that Anton LaVey and Marilyn Monroe, although they might have known each other, were never lovers and that his comment was merely ‘wishful thinking. However, about relationships, Marilyn Monroe once candidly commented, “Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him. After marriage, she has to hold him to make love to him.” No words of wisdom were ever spoken more true. Tragically Marilyn Monroe died on August 5, 1962 of an overdose of sleeping pills at the tender age of 35.June 1, 1927 Lizzie Andrew Borden died on this date after a long illness, at the age of 66. She had been born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the youngest daughter of the prominent Andrew Jackson Borden and Sarah ‘Abby’ Morse. In August of 1892 her father’s body was discovered in the sitting room, lying on his back on the sofa, both legs hanging over the front. He had suffered over forty whacks of an axe and his face was unrecognizable. Abby’s body was discovered upstairs in her sewing room; she, like Andrew, had been beaten to death with an axe.

He went on a vicious murder spree staring in the summer of 1976 in New York. In January of 1977 he sent a letter to the chief detective Capt. Joseph Borelli stating, “I am the Monster - Beelzebub - the chubby behemouth [sic]. I love to hunt. Prowling the streets looking for fair game - tasty meat. The women of Queens are prettyist of all.”June 1st 1957 Luisa Casati died on this date at the age of seventy-six. Following a requiem mass which was held at Brompton Oratory, she was interred in Brompton Cemetery. One of her cherished taxidermed Pekinese dogs was placed resting at her feet. Her tomb was inscribed with a fitting quote from Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra. - “Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.” Her house was often the setting for some of the most shocking and scandalous parties. It is said that she had nude servants gilded in gold leaf to attend to her needs, and that wax mannequins sat in chairs as guests at her dining table. She dressed outrageously, wearing live snakes as jewelry, and was infamous for her nocturnal strolls through Venice’s Piazza San Marco, naked beneath her furs, while parading cheetahs on diamond-studded leashes. She once even accessorized an evening costume with chicken blood. She also traveled throughout Europe letting numerous artists paint and sculpt her. She influenced playwrights and film makers, poets praised her strange beauty, and fashion designers fought for her patronage. All of this is just the tip of the iceberg of her behavior. Like Aleister Crowley whom she knew, Casati was also into the occult. It was said that Crowley and Casati had two of the biggest egos in Europe and that neither of them ever got along. In fact, once at a cocktail party, Crowley upon seeing Casati, said in a rather loud voice – “YOU!” – and then walked away.June 2nd No one knows the exact date of her birth, or death of Ursula Sontheil.She lived some 500 years ago in the times of King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth and was known as a famous seer and has become the patron saint of women working in laundries. People celebrated her on this date. She was born in 1488 in a riverside cave, near the river Nid, at Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England. At the time of her birth a summer storm raged outside the cave which was a few feet from the ancient ‘Petrifying Well’ which, according to legend, had the power to turn objects into stone as if by magic. At the age of twenty-four she married Toby Shipton, a carpenter and this is how she became known as ‘Mother Shipton,’ although she never had any children. She inevitably became was 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"England’s most famous Prophetess. She foretold the invasion and defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588; and Samuel Pepys’ diary grimly records that Mother Shipton gave forewarning of the Great Fire of London in 1666. Today her prophecies still prove uncannily accurate. She died in 1561.June 2, 1740 Donatien Alphonse François comte de Sade, more commonly known simply as the Marquis de Sade, was born on this date into privileged French nobility in Paris, France. He was an extremely spoiled child who grew up on various country estates. This included an ancient castle with its dank and torturous dungeon; a playground which no doubt played a factor in his developing psyche. In adulthood he became one of the most controversial figures in world literature. His name has been cursed, while his genius praised. His imaginative works, which are very sexually extreme in nature, are meant for adults. About his perversions he once wrote, “I have imagined everything conceivable in this sort of thing, but I have certainly not done, and certainly never will, all that I have imagined.” He wrote such infamous works as Philosophy in the Bedroom, 120 Days of Sodom, Justine and Juliette. He died on December 2, 1814.June 2, 1743 Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, or Joseph Balsamo, said to be one of the greatest figures in occult, was born on this date in Palermo Sicily. In 1789 he was arrested while in Rome after his own wife had publicly denounced him to the Inquisition as a vile heretic, a magician, a conjuror and, even worse, a Freemason. He was sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to life imprisonment in the fortress of San Leo in the Apennines, where he died. June 2, 1939 Dr. Tony Agpaoa, Philippines’ famous Psychic Surgeon, was born on this date. Even though he had a strong following, most considered him a ‘quack.’ He died on January 23, 1982.June 2, 1973 Four men rowed out into Loch Ness on this date; one was F. W. Holiday the future author of The Dragon and the Disc (1973), another was the Reverend Donald Omand who wanted to perform an exorcism on the ‘Nessie’ but some are quick to point out that the monster has been seen since, so the ritual obviously didn’t work. However, the ritual was never meant to stop the creature from appearing. It was performed because the Reverend had somehow become convinced that Nessie had ‘attracted an evil force unto itself’ and he simply wanted to diffuse the foul atmosphere being associated with the creature.June 3,1940 Phyllis Seckler took the A∴A∴ degree of Probationer 0°=0 ̈ under Jane Wolfe (Soror Estai) on this date, assuming the magical motto Tenax 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Propositi, she later took the name Meral.

Swinburne Clymer died on this date. He had founded the Fraternitas Rosæ Crucis (FRC) in Quakertown, PA in 1912, which he claimed was a movement originally started by Pascal Beverly Randolph in 1856. Clymer devoted quite abit of effort and work to attack Dr. H. S. Lewis of AMORC, which he evidently regarded as an enemy and fraud. June 4, 1604 It was on this date that the magician John Dee petitioned the King to have himself tried for sorcery, hoping to clear his name.June 4, 1922 Aleister Crowley began writing The Diary of a Drug Fiend on this date.June 4, 1996 It was late in the evening on this date in Cornwall, England when a woman saw what she first thought to be a sack floating “at twice rooftop height.” On closer examination she realized that it was a five-foot tall man dressed in dark ‘Victorian’ clothing which was flapping in the wind. A dog followed the mysterious figure briefly before it vanished from sight. What she actually saw, compared to what she reported to the police, is anyone’s guess.June 5 ? On this date, as asserted by some authorities, the lost continent of Atlantis sank beneath The Atlantic ocean. As to how historians figured this out is a mystery.June 5, 1828 John Ballou Newbrough was born on this date on a Springfield, Ohio farm. He went to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, but returned to New York and practiced dentistry. He became involved in spiritualism and probably had his first psychic experience in the 1850s. He was a trustee of the First Society of Spiritualists of New York City. As a self proclaimed clairvoyant, he practiced automatic writing. His greatest achievement began on the morning of January 1, 1881. This automatic writing session, using a typewriter, began at 4am. As Newbrough would later tell a friend: “To my amazement as I sat in the chair, my hands went up and started to pound at the keys. It seemed to me that I was half asleep, but I saw everything I was doing. I saw no spirits, but I knew they were using my body and thought. I looked at my hands and fingers; they were going 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"like mad. Then it occurred to me that it was fantastic.” He continued with these sessions every single morning until December 15, 1881.

Newbrough died in 1891.June 6, 1832 Jeremy Bentham died on this date in London. He left behind a large estate, which he willed to be used to finance the newly established University College in London. However, as a stipulation of getting his money, he also willed that his cadaver, per his instructions, was to be dissected, embalmed, dressed, and placed in a chair in a cabinet in a corridor of the main building of University College, where to this day it still resides. June 6, 1926 The man who made the unfulfilled promise to “make Aleister Crowley look like a Boy Scout,” Alex Sanders, the King of The Witches and founder of the Alexandrian witch tradition, was born on this date.July 7, 1860 Florence Farr was born on this date. She attended Queen’s College, the first woman’s college in England. She was initiated into the Isis-Urania Temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in July of 1890, just past her 30th Birthday. She was the Order’s 88th member. Her motto was Sapientia Sapienti Dono Data, or Wisdom is a gift given to the Wise. She quickly progressed through the grades, and on the Winter Solstice of 1891 was the second member to be initiated through the 5°=6 ̈ Ritual. The following year, she was elevated to Praemonstratrix of the Order. The Golden Dawn then went through difficult times. In January of 1902 she severed all her ties to what was left of the Order. In 1912, she moved to Ceylon. She died of cancer on April 29th 1917, all alone in a Colombo hospital. As was the Hindu custom, she was cremated and her ashes scattered in a sacred river.June 7, 1905 On this date the Honorary Grandmaster of the Ordo Templi Orientis, Karl Kellner 33°, 90°, 96°, the ‘director’ of the ‘inner triangle’ consisting also of Franz Hartmann, Reuss, Kellner, died in Vienna of a mysterious illness, which no doctor was ever able to diagnose.

Under the pseudonym of ‘Oscar’ he provided a short outline of his life in his book Astrology for the Millions. In the late thirties and forties, Lewi edited the Horoscope Magazine but in 1950 he resigned in order to begin his own magazine, The Astrologer. He moved to Arizona around this period and he passed away July 15, 1951, having already determined the exact moment of his own death by using astrology. Lewi’s two major works, Astrology for the Millions and Heaven Knows What have remained popular even to the present day.June 8, 1905 Karl Kellner, The Spiritual Father of Ordo Templi Orientis, died on this date. He was a wealthy Austrian paper chemist and a student of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and Eastern mysticism, who had traveled extensively throughout Europe, America and Asia Minor. During his travels, he claimed to have made contact with three Adepts (a Sufi, Soliman ben Aifa, and two Hindu Tantrics, Bhima Sena Pratapa of Lahore and Sri Mahatma Agamya Paramahamsa) who taught him the mysteries.

She was a major leader in the ‘Quietest Movement’ which was a heretical form of religious mysticism founded by Miguel de Molinos, a 17th-century Spanish priest. The belief behind quietism states that true spiritual perfection lies only in the complete passivity of one’s soul and the annihilation of one’s Will through divine love in the eyes of God can lead to redemption. Molinos and his doctrines were condemned by Pope Innocent XI in 1687 and a commission in France found most of Madame Guyon’s works also intolerableJune 9, 1885 Wilfred T. Smith was born illegitimately in Tonbridge, Kent, England on this date. He moved to Canada in January of 1907 where he worked at numerous jobs before landing a position at the British Columbia Electric Railway. It was here, around 1912 that a coworker named Charles Stansfeld Jones (1886-1950) turned him on to Crowleyanity and where he inevitably joined the OTO. He 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"later became known as Frater Ramaka. Smith was also the person whom Aleister Crowley stated; he “is not a man at all; he is the Incarnation of some God.”June 9, 1901 Priscilla Pardridge, better known as the noted author Eden Gray, was born on this date in Chicago, Illinois. She wrote such books as Mastering the Tarot, A Complete Guide to the Tarot and Tarot Revealed: A Modern Guide to Reading the Tarot Cards. June 9, 1949 The Agape Lodge of the OTO moved into its new location at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena on this date. A procession led the way into the house; Jane Wolfe carrying a picture of Aleister Crowley followed by Wilfred Smith with The Book of The Law. Behind him was Regina Kahl with The Stele and last was Jack Parsons with the Holy Ark.June 9, 1944 On this date, Ron (Jerrold) Johnson, MUFON’s Deputy Director of UFO Investigations, died. He was 43 years old and had just passed a recent physical examination with the proverbial flying colors. At the time of his death he was attending a meeting being held by The Society of Scientific Exploration in Austin, Texas. It was during the slide show, when several people sitting close to him, heard an odd gasp sound. When the lights were turned on they found Johnson slumped over in his chair, his face an odd shade of purple, with blood oozing from his nose. A soda can, from which he had been sipping, was sitting on the chair next to him.June 10, 1692 Bridget Bishop was the first woman to be put on trial in the historical Salem witch hunts and was hung on this date. She was born in England in 1640. When she was twenty years old she married George Wasselbe. They moved to Salem, Massachusetts but, within six years, she became a widow. Soon afterwards, she married another man by the name of Thomas Oliver. They had a daughter who they named, ironically, Christian. Their marriage was a very stormy one at times, and they sometimes quarreled in public. Being that the community was a Puritan one, this act was looked upon with scorn. In fact, they both were taken to the county courts after two such incidents and once, after they had had a violent argument, they had to stand together in the town square, bound together back-to-back, and gagged as punishment for their sinfulness. When Oliver died in 1679, his death was thought to be suspicious, and Bridget was accused of practicing witchcraft. The case was eventually dismissed. She went on to marry a third man by the name of Edward Bishop. Bishop was a well-respected man in Salem. He not only owned a sawmill, but he also helped to found the Beverly Church. Their marriage was no different from her first two marriages, as she and 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Bishop quarreled and bickered often. Bridget Bishop was certainly not a typically submissive Puritan wife. Finally, on April 18, 1692, Bridget Bishop was arrested again and charged with being a witch. This time she was found guilty and on June 10, the High Sheriff took Bridget Bishop to what would come to be called ‘Witches Hill,’ a barren and rocky elevation on the west side of town, and hanged her from the branches of a great oak tree.June 10, 1895 Immanuel Velikovsky was born in Vitebsk, Russia on this date. In his book, Worlds in Collision, he proposed a theory that many ancient myths and traditions were actually based on real events, such as worldwide global catastrophes of perhaps even of celestial origin and that these had such a profound effect on the human psyche of our ancestors that they affected their beliefs and culture. However, although his book reached number one on the best-sellers list, his well researched theory was banned from a number of academic institutions and he became ostracized from the general academic community, who even threatens a boycott against any publisher who printed his books. For nearly a decade prior to the early Sixties, Velikovsky was persona non grata on most college and university campuses.June 10, 1969 A young boy by the name of Saul who was living at the Solar Lodge, or Brayton Ranch in California decided on this date to burn down his own Quonset hut or bedroom dwelling, hoping that it would force the adults to allow him and his sister to stay in the main house. A Solar Lodge member publicly stated that this was because the children “liked to listen to the adults talking instead of sleeping as they should.” Regrettably the fire got out of hand and within moments explosions occurred. The entire ranch was ablaze. In the end it was reduced to rubble and debris.June 10, 1975 Michael Aquino left Anton Lavey’s Church of Satan in San Francisco and formed his own group, The Temple of Set, on this date.June 11, 1886 Issberner Haldane was born on this date.

June 13, 1662 On this date Mary Sanford was hanged in Hartford, Connecticut after being accused of witchcraft. This took place almost thirty years before the witchcraft hysteria broke out in Salem Village. (Hoadley’s Record Witchcraft Trials : Records Particular Court case No.2:174-175) Even though the witchcraft hysteria continued in Connecticut until 1697, Mary Stanford, who was born on February 16th 1620 in Stanstead, Mountfitchet, Essex, England, was the last person executed in the state. We also know that her husband Andrew Sanford was listed amongst the Roll of Names as having an indictment cast against him but he was acquitted. They did have a child, a young boy named Andrew Sanford the IInd, born in 1643. When he married he named his son Andrew Sanford III. He was born in Milford Connecticut on July 13th 1673. His son was named John Sanford and he was born July 1st 1720. His son was named Elisha Sanford, born on October 7th 1751.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.June 13, 1884 Dr. Gerald Gardner, of Gardnerian witch fame, was born on this date in a small town called Blundellsands, which is near Liverpool, England. He believed that he was a descendant of ‘Grissell Gairdner,’ who was burned as a witch at Newburgh in 1610. He authored such books as High Magick’s Aid, Witchcraft Today, The Meaning of Witchcraft, Kris and Other Malay Weapons.June 13, 1888 Fernando Pessoa, pronounced as peswä, was a Portuguese poet born in Lisbon on this date. He did something rather unique. He wrote his poetry under 73 different names. Four of these: his own, Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, and Álvaro de Campos, are well known. Each of his personas has his own putative biography, physical characteristics, relationship to the others, poetic voice, and outlook, and in part reflects Pessoa’s disbelief in the idea of an integrated personality. Among Pessoa’s collections, which include poems in English, are Sonnets (1918), English Poems (1922), and Mensagem (1934). He knew Aleister Crowley during his infamous stunt in 1930. This is when the Portuguese papers in Lisbon announced finding a note at the mouth of Bocade Inferno, a dangerous piece of water celebrated as a place for “suicides.” The note, in Crowley’s hand and placed under his personal cigarette case to keep it from blowing away, was simply saying how he couldn’t live without his 19 year old Scarlet Woman, Hanni Larissa Jaeger, whom he also refers to as “The Monster.” The Press around the world, due to the instigation by Pessoa, jumped on the fact that Crowley had committed suicide. However, in Crowley’s private 1930 diary he wrote, “Sept. 21. I decided to do a suicide stunt to annoy Hanni. Arrange details with Pessoa.” Obviously the stunt worked because he and Hanni were reported as being ‘seen’ together shortly after his suicide.

To complicate the story even further, The Oxford Mail of October 14th 1930 even went as far as reporting that preparations were being planned in London to hold a seance in order to contact the spirit of Aleister Crowley! As for Pessoa, he died on November 30th 1935.June 13, 1941 Grady Louis McMurtry, the man who would inevitably take over the Ordo Templi Orientis after Karl Germer’s death, took Minerval & First Degree Initiation on this date and thus joining the OTO.June 13, 1945 Whitley Strieber was born on this date in San Antonio, Texas. He is a writer best known for his horror novels The Wolfen and The Hunger. He also wrote the best-seller titled Communion: A True Story, which professes to be a non-fictional description of his subjective experiences with non-human entities from a UFO, which looks exactly like the drawing of an entity Aleister Crowley saw out in Montauk in 1918 called LAM. According to Strieber’s story it all began on December 26, 1985, at a secluded cabin in upstate New York. He had gone sliding with his wife and son, they later ate Christmas dinner leftovers and then went to bed early. Six hours later, Whitley Strieber found himself suddenly awake and being abducted by aliens.June 13, 1949 On this date a quiet gentleman, the son of a plumber, by the name of Cyril Henry Hoskin fell off a ladder and suffered a serious head injury. When he finally came around he seemingly had forgotten who he was while remembering a totally new identity of a Tibetan monk. This was the birth of the author known as Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. His most famous book, read by hundreds of thousand of people, was The Third Eye (1956). June 14, 1381 Simon of Sudbury (Simon Tybald), Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of all England, was murdered on this date in London. His demise began when Richard IInd introduced the unpopular Poll Tax. This caused the infamous ‘Peasants Revolt’ led by Wat Tyler, which inevitably led to a mob of peasants storming the Tower of London, dragging Simon of Sudbury out to Tower Hill and then, after ‘many blows,’ beheading him. Afterwards they took his head and stuck it on a pole over London Bridge. His mummified head is still kept preserved in a glass case in St Gregory’s Church in Suffolk, so shriveled that it looks more like a skull. His body is buried at Canterbury, where ghostly footsteps have been heard for year, rumored to be the ghost of Simon looking for his head.130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"June 14, 1968 The creepy, eerie gothic film titled Rosemary’s Baby opened of this date.

However, prior to finding this out, Rosemary has a nightmarish dream in which she is making love to Satan. She then imagines herself impregnated so that her baby can be used in the New Yorkers’ evil cult rituals.

June 15July 14, 1969 Gabriel Montenegro died of heart trouble on this date. He had three funeral services. The first was Catholic, performed by his daughter Sister Marie Angelica, a nun at Notre Dame. The second was a Masonic service overseen by the F. & A. M. Lodge # 434 in Daly City, since Montenegro was a 33° Degree Mason. And the third was a Christian ceremony in Spanish to accommodate all his relatives who had come up from Mexico. He was buried at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. He originally joined the OTO back on August 6th 1948, taking Minerval Initiation at Agape Lodge. He was born in Zapotlan Mexico in 1907 and claimed to have received “the highest initiations from Toltec priests.” Many people who knew Montenegro simply accepted this statement without question. However, modern historians are quick to point out that this was a ludicrous claim considering that the Toltec empire emerged around the 10th century in Mexico and within two centuries it all but ceased to exist. Where Montenegro found a Toltec priest seven centuries later is anyone’s guess. Be that as it may, he was legitimately the representative of the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua in Mexico and later he even became a 33° Mason of the Antient & Accepted Rite for Mazatlan. He was a member of Crocker Lodge Nº 454 in Daly City, California. To say he was a colorful character is an understatement.June 15, 1996 Near Twain Hart, California on this date a woman reported seeing a large bubble like UFO hovering near a river.

June 17, 1952 Jack Parsons, the ex-Lodge Master of Agape Lodge in southern California died on this date. He and his wife, Marjorie Elizabeth Cameron, had their trailer already packed and were ready to move to Mexico for a time but this date would end their plans. Jack accidentally dropped a can of mercury fulminate in his ground floor laboratory. His lab was an old four-car garage apartment that had once been the stable of the estate located at 1071 South Orange Grove Avenue, which had once been Agape Lodge. The first people to arrived after the blast found the huge stable doors blown off their hinges, two walls gone, windows shattered and a gaping hole torn through the ceiling timbers revealing the second floor apartment. They found Jack Parsons underneath a massive double-tub laundry fixture that had landed on top of him along with a section of the wall. All the newspapers at the time reported that he was actually conscious even though he was badly burned and mangled. In fact, Jane Wolfe would later tell Grady McMurtry that Jack “was in so deep a case of shock that he gave instructions regarding the removal of a bath tub which had landed on his back. Yet getting to the hospital [Huntington Memorial Hospital] he became inarticulate, lapsed into unconsciousness and shortly died.” One newspaper wrote that, “The explosion blew off his right forearm, tore a gaping hole in his jaw and shattered the other 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"arm and both legs.” Jane also told Grady, “Jack was badly mutilated, no one was permitted to see the body.” He was later cremated on July 19th.

The group was supposedly to leave on June 19th at 1:00pm but, as the day dawned clear and beautiful, their leader never appeared.

Then seemed out of every Castle a cloath to be thrown on the ground, of more than the breadth of a Table-cloath. Out of that in the East, the cloath seemed to be red, which was cast. Out of that in the South, the cloath seemed white. Out of that in the west, the cloath seemed green, with knops on it. Out of that in the North, spread, or thrown out from the gate under foot, the cloath seemed to be very black.” Of these four castles, they are also referred to as four houses and “Watchtowers.” The importance of this vision is the use of the term Watchtower which not only implies a place where angelic sentinels are stationed to stand guard and protect God’s Kingdom from the profane, but also they act as Hidden Gates which allow entities to descend and guide humanity when summoned appropriately. It is important to mention this vision because anyone who has studied one of the numerous modern books on Enochian magick will realize the elemental colors have changed. They are not what are found in Dee’s original manuscripts.

His article Flying Saucers Are Real in the January 1950 issue of True became one of the most widely read and discussed articles in publishing history, and caused a sensation. The article was later expanded into a paperback book by the same title, The Flying Saucers are Real (1950) and it reached an even wider audience. This was followed by the major hardcover books Flying Saucers From Outer Space (1953), Flying Saucer Conspiracy (1955), and Flying Saucers: Top Secret (1960). He also published other articles such as What Radar tells about Flying Saucers and I Know the Secrets of the Flying Saucers. In January 1957 Keyhoe had become Director of the newly formed National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in Washington, D.C., which under his leadership gave serious publicity to the UFO mystery through the 1960s and encouraged Congressional hearings. In 1966, he was already convinced that the control of gravity was the explanation for the ‘impossible’ maneuvers made by UFOs, and he publicly demanded an end to the Government’s policy on UFO secrecy in order that all scientists world-wide could openly work on the subject without the fear of ridicule.

He immediately pointed it out to the others who froze as the creature slowly walked towards a small house next to the sheep pen, where the feed was stored. The kids later described the creature as being about the size of a goat, with large wings on its back, small arms, and a tail.

It was because of Arnold’s descriptions of the object that the term ‘Flying Saucers’ was born. Besides Arnold’s, there were as many as eighteen other sightings of unusual flying objects in the Pacific Northwest on the same day.

It would be at Greta’s house that Crowley and Frieda would develope some of the earliest designs for The Book of Thoth, his essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, which would be published in 1944. Greta Mary Sequeira died in 1998 at the age of 91. Her obituary referred to her as “one of the last survivors of the circle around Aleister Crowley, the black magician and self-styled wickedest man alive.”June 27, 1931 Marcelo Ramos Motta was born on this date in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As a young man he attended a University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and, in the mid-50s began corresponding with Karl Germer, the head of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis. Germer died in 1962 and there are those who believe that he became Karl Germer’s heir. Yes, it is true, Motta was Karl Germer’s personal student and for awhile was venerated by Germer simply because he had recently helped him publish Crowley’s Liber Aleph. However, Motta had a falling out with Germershortly afterwards. It began when Motta started writing crazed letters of abuse. Germer summed them up best in one of his replies dated December 23rd 1961 when he wrote, “You blithering, miserable IDIOT! I have seen and had observed several similar cases of Demonitis but yours beats all records in our files.” Even a few months before his death, in June of 1962, Germer was still telling Motta that his actions are “contaminated by the 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"demonic forces that have got hold of you.” In the summer of 1976 established his A∴A∴ branch in Tennessee to began a corporation known as Society Ordo Templi Orientis, more commonly known as SOTO. June 27, 1956 Scott Cunningham, who was a Wiccan and a popular author of more than thirty books, was born on this date in Royal Oak, Michigan. His first glimpse into the craft came when his mother purchased and gave him the book The Supernatural by Douglas Hill and Pat Williams in 1971. Some of his more popular books were Magical Herbalism (1982), Earth Power (1983), Cunningham’s Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs (1985), The Magic of Incense, Oils and Bres (1987), The Magical Household (1987), Cunningham’s Encyclopedia of Crystal, Gem and Metal Magic (1987), The Truth about Witchcraft (1988) and Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (1988).June 28, 1752 On this date Karl von Eckartshausen was born in Haimhausen, a town near Munich, as the illegitimate child of the Count of Haimhausen and Maria Anna Eckart. At the age of seven Eckartshausen began experiencing strange dreams of a prophetic and mystical nature, as well as having ‘visions.’ He wrote the classic on every occult reading list: The Cloud upon the Sanctuary (1802). June 28, 1855 Albert Karl Theodor Reuss was born on this date in Augsburg, Germany. He was the son of an innkeeper who became trained as a professional Opera singer. He met Richard Wagner and, in 1882, he sang in the first performance of Wagner’s Parsifal in Bayreuth. Later, in London, he sang in music halls under the name of Charles Theodore. Sadly, with the lose of his voice, he was forced to give up his singing career. He then became a druggist, a journalist and possibly even a spy for the Prussian Police but he is most likely remembered as being one of the future world leaders of the Ordo Templi Orientis.June 28, 1909 Aleister Crowley finds the lost manuscript of Liber AL vel Legis.June 28, 1916 Stewert Farrar was born on this date in Highams Park, Essex. Probably his most notable book on witchcraft was titled What Witches Do (1971).June 28, 1940 On this date the ‘sleeping prophet’ Edgar Cayce predicted that Atlantis would rise from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Bimini in the late 1960s June 28, 1944 Aleister Crowley had one of the most important visions of his life on this date, one that would inevitably affect the future of Thelema. He wrote in 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"his diary that about 1:48 a.m. he saw an “Apparition of Fra H.A. In oval of dim light. Dark Blue clothes, standing at attention. Greeting returned, before I finished mine.” There is no immediate indication in his diaries at the moment of Crowley attempting to figure out what this meant but, shortly after this vision, he begins looking toward Grady as a possible O.H.O. or successor to the OTO leadership in the future. Crowley also began thinking more about “777” as his spiritual heir. He would spend the next few months trying to figure out Grady’s future and in this time he would inevitably develop the Caliph theory. He would later send Grady a letter dated August 22nd 1944, considered one of the most significant letters in modern Thelemic history because, as Grady stated, this was “the 1st of the Caliphate letters.” In time it leads to Grady being appointed the Thelemic Caliph.June 28, 1952 On this date just after midnight, Truman Bethurum of Prescott, Arizona was peaceably asleep in his truck. Within minutes he found himself abruptly awakened by strange visitors; short little spacemen in coveralls. He claimed that he was then escorted out of his truck and taken aboard a UFO where he met a beautiful female captain name Aura Rhanes, who said she was from a planet called Clarion. After his visit he wrote a note which he put in his pocket and which was later printed in LIFE magazine in 1957: “To whom it may concern. If I am found dead it will be because my heart has stopped from the terrible excitement induced by seeing and going aboard a flying Saucer.”June 28, 1975 Rod Serling, known primarily for his role as the host of television’s The Twilight Zone, died on this date.June 29, 1967 The actress Jayne Mansfield’s tragic decapitation in a car accident happened in Slidell, Louisiana about 2 am the morning on this date. Her Buick Electra, carrying Jayne, her lawyer and boyfriend Sam Brody, her three children and their dog, plowed into the back of a tractor-trailer, obscured by the haze that had been released by a mosquito fogger. Only her children survived. She was a brief member of Anton LaVey’s Satanic Church in San Francisco; rumors that they both had a falling out and that she was ‘curse’ helped pushed LaVey’s book, Satanic Bible, into the best seller list.June 29, 1988 One of the most bizarre creatures reported in recent times appeared on this date in South Carolina and became known as the Lizard Man. It was first seen by 17-year-old Christopher Davis who was changing a flat tire on his car near Scape Ore Swamp, which is just outside the backwater village of Bishopville in South Carolina’s Lee County. As Chris looked up he saw something rather large running toward his car, on the passenger side. It was running on its hind legs, it was covered by green scales and 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"stood about seven feet tall with glowing red eyes. Chris, terrified, immediately jumped into his car. He tried to slam the door shut but the reptile-man jumped upon the hood and seized the mirror in an attempted to wrench his door open. Chris intuitively hit the gas petal hard, accelerating, which knocked his scaly attacker off as he sped away. The only evidence that anything had ever happened was a series of long deep scratches on the hood and the wing mirror was severely twisted and at the site when the incident occurred the creature left three toed tracks. Throughout the summer other sightings were reported but as quick as the creature had appeared, it disappeared.June 30, 1882 Charles Guiteau, ex-Oneida Community member was hanged for the assassination U.S. President James Abram Garfield on July 2, 1881. His trial was one of the first in American history where ‘insanity’ became a defense. He claimed that he was innocent, and that “Lordy made him do it!”June 30, 1908 On this date an unidentified object appeared above Western China, with a deafening supersonic roar that terrified everyone as it headed due north. When it fell out of the sky, at 7:17am near the Stony Tunguska River in Siberia near Kansk, it leveled miles of forests, but left no crater. It was so powerful that the seismographs throughout the world registered what looked like an earthquake. It would be the largest recorded explosion until the H-Bomb was invented. To this day theorists are still pondering what caused the explosion; meteorite, comet, anti-rock, mini-black hole or alien spaceship? It remains a mystery.June 30, 1925 Frederick Leigh Gardner the man whom Aleister Crowley had decided was responsible for evoking Typon-Set against him, died on this date.JULYJuly 1, 1881 The infamous Vampire of Dusseldorf, ‘The Lover of Blood’ was executed in prison on this date for his crimes, and as Peter Kurten moved toward the guillotine his final recorded statement was, “... after my head has been chopped off, will I still be able to hear at least for a moment, the sound of my own blood gushing from the stump of my neck?” smiling he added, “That would be a pleasure to end all pleasures.”July 1, 1942 Aleister Crowley’s tarot cards, which were painted by Frieda Harris, were shown in the Berkley Galleries to the public on this date.July 1, 1951 The most famous case of spontaneous human combustion occurred on this date in St. Petersburg, Florida to Mary Hardy Reeser, a 67-year-old widow. The next morning, her next door neighbor came by to visit but discovered the 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"doorknob too hot to touch and she immediately went for help. The Police, upon entering the apartment, discover Mary’s body sitting in her easy chair, surrounded by a blackened circle on the floor, four feet in diameter. Her 175-pound body, or what was left of it, was reduced to a pile of ashes, leaving only a section of her backbone, a shrunken skull the size of a baseball, and one foot completely undamaged encased in a black stain slipper which stretched just beyond the four-foot circle. The police report states, since no chemical accelerants was ever found, that the cause of death of Mrs. Reeser occurred when her highly flammable rayon-acetate nightgown caught fire, perhaps because of a dropped cigarette. However, one medical examiner stated that the 3,000-degree heat required to destroy the body should have destroyed the apartment as well and, in fact, damage was unbelievable minimal and confined only to the four foot circle. Even stranger was the fact that the ceiling and upper walls were not even covered with soot. July 1, 1952 On the morning of this date Phyllis Seckler attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, that attainment, or consequence, which marks the Adeptus Minor Grade, 5°=6 ̈, of the A∴A∴, the full initiate of the Sephirah Tiphereth. She shared her results with Karl Germer. Many letters survive of their subsequent correspondence of the subject.July 1, 1996 On this date near Fayetteville, Georgia, a woman reported that she awoke, froze and was unable to speak, as she watched a small five foot tall grayish humanoid with thin limbs, large dark slanted eyes, and a teardrop shaped face sitting on her bed. It then moved quickly across to her husband’s side of the bed toward the foot in a sort of sitting, scampering kind of motion. It jumped off and continued on across the room where it joined at least three other similar creatures, all of whom wore dark cloak like garments and dark hats, similar to a Panama. They all huddled next to the wall on her husband’s side, talking quietly in an unknown language. All of a sudden the woman later reported that she felt unbelievably tired and she fell back to sleep. Shortly after awakening in the morning she frantically related the ‘experience’ to her husband who, besides recalling nothing unusual during the night, thought she was crazy. However, neither of them could explain the odd orange-brown stains on the carpet at the foot of the bed or the similar stain on the sheet, which had been clean when they went to sleep the night before.July 2, 1568 Nostradamus died on this date. He was buried standing upright in one of the walls of the Church of the Cordeliers at Salon, with a marble plaque attached to the wall in his memory. However, rumors began to almost immediately circle that there was a secret document in his coffin that would decode all his 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"prophecies. After almost hundred a thirty years of fearing looters, his body was finally removed for safekeeping and no document was ever found; just an amulet. The greatest story regarding his body occurred one night in 1791 during the French Revolution. This is when soldiers from Marseilles broke into the church and ransacked tombs in search of loot. The very next morning they were ambushed by Royalists. Ironically, the soldier who had used Nostradamus’ skull as a wine glass the night before, died by a sniper’s bullet. July 2, 1881 President Garfield was shot on this date by an ex-Oneida Community member Charles Guiteau. After having invisible sexual intercourse with a Spirit called ‘Lordy’ Guiteau was commanded to kill the President. At his interrogation he explained,” Get acquainted with the science of Spiritology” and you’ll understand why I did it.July 2, 1947. It was during a severe thunderstorm on this date that a UFO crashed on a rancher’s property in Roswell, New Mexico. Later, on July 8, the USAAF issued a press release stating, “USAAF Recovers a Flying Disk,” but the very next day the US Government changed their story and said it was merely a weather balloon.July 2, 1947 In Lake Okanagan in British Columbia a number of boaters saw the monster known as ‘Ogopogo’ simultaneously. One of the witnesses, a Mr. Kray, described the animal as having “a long sinuous body, 30 feet in length, consisting of about five undulations, apparently separated from each other by about a two-foot space, in which that part of the undulations would have been underwater...There appeared to be a forked tail, of which only one-half came above the water. From time to time the whole thing submerged and came up again.”July 2, 1961 Like his father who had committed suicide some thirty years earlier, Ernest Hemingway died on this date at age 61 in his home in Ketchum, Idaho of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had rose early, as he had done most of his entire adult life, he selected a shotgun from a closet in the basement and went upstairs to a spot near the entrance-way of the house and shot himself in the head. If he had waited a little more than two weeks he could have celebrated 62nd birthday. Of all his novels, it is not what Hemingway published that brings him notoriety amongst Crowleyites as much as what was deleted from his 1926 classic The Sun Also Rises. It originally contained a short story based on an incident where Ford Madox Ford snubbed Hilaire Belloc only for Hemingway to later realize that Ford had 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"mistaken the identity of the individual whom he had snubbed. It was not Hilaire Belloc at all, but rather the Great Beast himself, Aleister Crowley. July 3 Over the years a ghostly body, wrapped in a white flag, has been seen being thrown from the ruins of Burgh Castle, an old Roman fort, in Bradwell, Suffolk, England, always on this particular date. The haunting is said to go back to the time immediately after the Roman Legions had left Britain. It began, according to legend, when a large band of Saxons commanded by a man called Siberg attacked the Danish forces lead by a cruel leader named Gonard. Unable to beat the Danes, Siberg sent a messenger to his half-brother Cerdag, asking for help. In the meantime Gonard launched an attack on Siberg’s camp, killing a large number of Saxons. He then sent an arrogant message to Siberg telling him to come to Burgh Castle with the remainder of his men where one last battle would be fought to determine who gets the land. However, Siberg went to the castle alone, to met with Gonard to discuss peace. This infuriated Gonard who ordered the Siberg be bound and thrown into a pit. Four days later Siberg’s forces tried to rescue him but were massacred as they attempted to storm to castle. Those Saxons who survived, were captured or wounded, were tied to stakes and tortured to death. Two days later, Gonard had a ‘glorious vision’ in which he saw a white angel and a black angel fighting in the skies, and then clutching each other’s throat as they fell downwards into the sea. Knowing that Siberg was an interpreter of such visions, Gonard ordered him released from the pit and brought to him. Gonard asked what the vision meant? Siberg said nothing for a while, then slowly pointed over Gonard’s shoulder towards the sea behind him. On the horizon was a fleet of Saxon ships sailing towards the fort. Cerdag had arrived with the relief force and upon landing he sent a messenger to the fort under a white flag demanding that the Danes surrender. However, once the gates were opened to let the messenger into the fort, instead of discussing the Saxon terms, the messenger was immediately killed. His body was then wrapped in his white flag and thrown over the walls of the fort. Upon seeing this barbarity Cerdag gave the order to attack; he took no prisons. Tragically, both Siberg and Gonard died in the battle.July 3, 1886 The Rosicrucian Adept and member of the S.R.I.A., Kenneth Mackenzie. died on this date.July 3, 1899 Pearl Driver one of Crowley’s Scarlet Woman, was born on this date..

July 3, 1915 On this date a small boat rowed up to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In the prow of the boat was Aleister Crowley, claiming to be an Irishman, along with Leila Waddell, whose mother was an Irish refugee of the last generation and who believes herself an Irish patriot. She was a violinist and she played Irish songs to accompany the moment. Also in the boat was J. Dorr, an Irish editor who has published papers in both Ireland and England, and Patrick Gilroy, an Irish agitator. Everyone in the boat called themselves members of the secret Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic, and their early morning mission was to declare the independence of the Irish Republic, which included a declaration of war against England. Crowley, in an act of utter defiance, tore up his British Passport and unfolded as Irish flag, proclaiming loudly; ““I unfurl the Irish flag. I proclaim the Irish Republic. Erin go Bragh. God save Ireland.” Afterwards the newspapers reported, “The party left the launch and went to Jack’s restaurant for breakfast.”July 3, 1935 Carroll ‘Poke’ Runyon (Magister Thabion) was born on this date in St. Petersburg, Florida. He earned a Masters Degree in cultural anthropology from California State University, is an initiate of an ancient Tibetan tantric order, and has served as an officer in three active Golden Dawn temples. He is also a 32nd Degree Freemason and a former soldier in the U.S. Army’s Special Forces. He is the founder of America’s oldest continually practicing Lodge of ritual magick, the Order of the Temple of Astarte in Southern California. Runyon is best known in the occult field for his discovery and development of the facial reflection technique for summoning spirits to visible appearance. He has been practicing and teaching Western ceremonial magick for 32 years and is the writer/narrator of the very successful VHS video The Magick of Solomon and The Book of Solomon’s Magick.July 3, 1996 On the evening of this date near Fargo North Dakota, a man and his two sons were on a remote dirt road about a quarter mile south of their farmhouse when they noticed a strange object, a UFO, hovering about 200 feet away. They later described the UFO as a circular metallic gray object, with six legs for landing gear. On the bottom of each leg they saw what appeared to be a suction cup shaped pod, and on the bottom of the object there was a globe that looked like a light glowing on and off. Three rod-like beams of light protruded from the top of these globes. On the top of the ship was a dome that ‘seemingly’ had four 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"windows that appeared to be tinted, although they did notice what appeared to be moving shadows through these windows. The object then tipped on about a 20-degree angle and went straight up at very high speed emitting a loud air-displacement sound.July 4, 1971 On this date, a contemporary and friend of H. P. Lovecraft, August William Derleth, died in Sauk City, Wisconsin. He was the founder of Arkham House. He is considered Wisconsin’s most prolific author with 150 books already in print and forty manuscripts still to be published. July 4, 1974 It was in the early morning hours on this date, just outside Oakland, Nebraska, that Emery Wickstrom and his two sons Nick & Tom saw a bizarre creature. They said that it was only about the size of a medium dog but it had a flat, monkey-like face, a curved tail and it ran upright and it also leaped as it ran across the road at a fast speed.July 4, 1982 Hugh Lynn Cayce, the son of the ‘Sleeping Prophet’ Edgar Cayce, died on this date of cancer at the age of 75.July 4, 1996 Near Fayetteville, Arkansas, a couple of guys reported that he had just finished firing off the last of his fireworks in a pasture and then walked away toward a patch of woods to enjoy the warm night for a few minutes. In the woods they noticed a light about hundred yards away. Thinking that it was somebody shooting off more fireworks, they walked towards it. As they approached, they saw in a clearing, three triangular shaped objects hovering just above the ground. They were UFOs. Lights were pointing down off each point of the triangles. Three strange beings were also noticed standing nearby, speaking among themselves in gruff voices. The beings were described as tall and covered with very thick hair that covered their bodies completely. After a few moments the beings seem to sniff the air and glanced immediately in the guy’s direction. Realizing they had been seen, the beings quickly ran into their ships, which shot then away into the sky emitting a bright burst of light, knocking the witnesses to the ground. The crafts seem to elongate as they accelerated.July 5, 1810 Phineas Taylor Barnum was born on this date in Bethel, Connecticut, the first child of Philo Barnum and his second wife, Irena Taylor. While it is true, P. T. Barnum was the founding force behind one of America’s most famous circuses, the Barnum & Bailey Circus, or the ‘Greatest Show on Earth,” he is mostly associated with the circus sideshow and the display of freaks. He is often quoted as saying, “There’s a sucker born every minute” but, in truth, 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"he never said this.

One such route brought him head on into a tree outside Paris on this date which was almost near fatal.July 6, 1187 On this date Salah ad-Din Al-Ayyubi, more commonly known as Saladin the revered hero of Islam who united Arab forces and recaptured the holy city of Jerusalem from Christian Crusaders, marched the captive Templars before him to give all them the choice of conversion to his faith or death ... all decide upon death and were killed to the last man. Some place the figure at 666 killed.July 6, 1935 The 14th Dalai Lama, Lhama Thondup, was born on this date in a peasant family in northeastern Tibet in the city of Taktsir. In Tibetan Buddhism the Dalai Lama is believed to be an incarnation of Avalokitesvara, the Buddha of Compassion and when the Dalai Lama dies his soul is believed to pass into the body of an infant. When Lhama Dhondrub was recognition as the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama he was renamed Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, and became known as Yeshe Norbu, the Wishfulfilling Gem or Kundun. As a teenager the Dalai Lama became the head of the Tibetan government in its fight against the occupying forces of the People’s Republic of China but in 1959 he was forced to flee his country into exile. His travels in the cause of peace and for a free Tibet have made him an international celebrity, and in 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace PriceJuly 7, 1864 Florence Farr was born on this date. It has been written that she was “... not a nymphomaniac, nor was she really interested in sex, but she was almost incapable of saying no to any man who asked her to sleep with him.” Aleister Crowley was rumored to be one such gentleman.July 7, 1907 The writer Robert Anson Heinlein was born on this date into a family of seven children in the little town of Butler, Missouri.

He was an avid spiritualist and strongly believed in the possibility of communicating with the dead, a subject that he lectured on extensively in his travels throughout the world. After his own death the London ‘Times’ reported: “All sincere British mediums are now sitting in the darkness, waiting for a spirit message from Sir Arthur.” A week later his wife held a ‘public’ séances at Albert Hall in London where she claimed to have spoken with her deceased husband but when newsmen badgered her to reveal his message, she simply smiled and replied, “Oh, it is beautiful and sweet  but private.”July 7, 1996 In was shortly before midnight on this date near Drosendorf, AustriaThat Rudolf Slam had stepped outside onto his balcony to smoke a cigarette when he saw a shining triangular object about two meters high, on the ground in a field near the apartment.

Again I come. Patience Worth (is) my name.” Over the next five years she obtained twenty-nine bound volumes of material from short stories, plays and full-length novels to simple epigrams and poems. Many were acclaimed as literary masterpieces. There is little doubt of the remarkable relationship fostered between Pearl and an entity calling itself Patience. However, with fame came pressure and criticism. To remain amongst her newly found literary friends Pearl began to deny that an Ouija board was responsible for producing the stories. She began claiming authorship herself. Those close to her knew otherwise. Some even pointed out that she was actually 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"too stupid to perpetrate such a fraud. Even philologists who studied her works have stated that with Curran’s limited education and child-like intelligence there was no way she could have produced novels where the majority of the words were of Anglo-Saxon derivation of a medieval nature.

The child would inevitably take on the form of Charles Stansfeld Jones, Frater Achad.July 9, 1856 Nikola Tesla was born on this date, at the stroke of midnight, in Smiljan, Croatia. He was an Austrian-educated electrical engineer who immigrated to New York in 1884. At first Telsa worked with Thomas Edison but soon part ways due to Edison desire to work with direct current, while Tesla favored alternating current. Many of Tesla’s eccentricities and visionary prophecies were humorously winked at without scorn but some found his ‘terrestrial stationary waves’ abit too much. With these he believed could make the Earth a huge conductor that would be as responsive as a tuning fork to electrical vibrations of a certain frequency. It was his dream to link the entire world together through telephones, telegraph systems, by transmitting pictures and even text from one end of the globe to the other within minutes, and delivering mail between specially set-up terminals, using electronic messaging. As brilliant as these early Internet visions were, he received caustic criticism for his ideas about communication with other planets, or his assertions that he could split the Earth like an apple, and his claim of having invented a death ray capable of destroying 10,000 airplanes at a distance of 250 miles. Toward the end Tesla was a complete recluse, living in a series of seedy New York hotel rooms with only his pet pigeons for company. After his death on January 7, 1943, he slowly became regarded as an underappreciated prolific inventive genius, poet, and a humanitarian visionary and mad scientist. July 9, 1910 D. H.

He was very controversial witch. He owned the Magickal Childe occult shop at West 19th Street in Brooklyn Heights. He was also a notorious prankster who ‘published’ the infamous manuscript known as the ‘Necronomicon’ of Lovecraftian infamy, after a ‘mysterious monk’ (wink-wink) named Simon “delivered” the manuscript to his store, which was then called The Warlock Shop.

Simon also wrote The Hoodoo Bible, The Witch’s Formulary and Spellbook and A Book of Pagan Ritual.July 9, 1997 On this date a farmer named Paul Bryan made an astonishing discovery on his 15-acre oat field in Lawrence Township, New Jersey. Three crop circles had mysterious appeared. One large circle, about 100 yards long, appears in the center of his field and, to the sides of that circle, two straight lines pointed to two smaller circles. Crop circles have been quite the rage for several years in New Age circles. Some people believe they are formed by the wind, others claim that they are created by UFOs and still others say they are created by brief, intense bursts of microwave radiation from outer space. Bryan simply considered the circles graffiti made by kids and said that whoever or whatever made them cost him a lot of money because he will have to buy cattle feed to replace the smashed oats.

A neighbor named Orlando Barriga told her that he saw a strange black creature sprinting across his lawn earlier that night. Another neighbor found giant cat-like prints in the sand of her children’s play pen area.July 11, 1861 On this date the Royal Navy ship, the Bacchante, was rounding the tip of Africa when it was confronted with the sight of The Flying Dutchman. This ship, who’s real name has remained unknown, supposedly sank off the coast in 1641. It is probably the most famous ghost ship known; doomed to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa forever. The legend has it, as the ship was sinking, a Dutchman named Captain Cornelius vander Decken screamed out a curse: “I WILL round this Cape even if I have to keep sailing until doomsday!” What makes this sighting in 1861 so unique is that one of the people reporting the sighting was the midshipman, who at this time was only a prince, but he would inevitably become King George V of England. The lookout man who had first seen the Flying Dutchman is recorded in the ship’s records as saying; “A strange red light as of a phantom ship all aglow, in the midst of which light the mast, spars and sails of a brig 200 yards distant stood out in strong relief.” Unfortunately, an ironic twist to the story is that he was so distraught that a few days later he accidentally fell from a mast and diedJuly 11, 1948 Lon Milo DuQuette, aka Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, was born on this date in Long Beach, California. He is U.S. Deputy Grand Master of the O.T.O. and a respected occult author of such books as: The Chicken Qabalah, My Life with Spirits, The Enochian World of Aleister Crowley, The Magick of Thelema and the now infamous Crowley coloring book called Aleister Crowley’s illustrated Goetia, to name a few.July 11, 2003 On this date a group of government officials were treated to a school of large unknown creatures swimming in Lake Tianchi in the Changbai mountains, in northeastern Jilin province of China, near he Korean border. The provincial forestry bureau vice-director Zhang Lufeng later explained, “At times there was one, at times there were several. The last time, there were as many as about 20.” In all, the creatures appeared five different times in about an hour. This creature is not something new to the Lake. The first sighting of these creatures go back to 1903 when one of them attacked three people and only retreated into the depths after being shot.

Considered by some to be one of the more prolific researchers on the history of the OTO, while proselytizing that no branch of the Order, outside of certain Europe claims, is genuine. Others are quick to point out that Koenig is notorious for taking history completely out of context for his own personal agenda. One author summed it up quiet nicely: “Part of this problem is rooted deep in the animosity that some Europeans have toward Americans. Who, I might add, have always resented the OTO Grand Lodge moving to this country. Even to this day some Europeans continually stamp their feet, whine and slander all that is American simply in the hope of fostering their own supremacy.” Although Koenig has written many books he’ll always be remembered for How To Make Your Own MC OTO.July 12, 1985 The beloved O.H.O. of the Ordo Templi Orientis Frater Hymenaeus Alpha 777 aka Grady Louis McMurtry shed his earthly vehicle and died in California after a long illness. He was lying in his hospital bed at Brookside Hospital in San Pablo, discussing forms of meditation with a friend when he softly said, “I think my path is more the Sufi Path.” When questioned what he meant, he simply looked up and said, “I don’t know.” He then closed his eyes and quietly passed away. Grady once wrote that; “The moment of ultimate self-embarrassment is when you die. That is when you wake up.” In other words, you get to review your whole incarnation for all its good and bad, shake your head and then prepare for the next. On July 15th, his body was prepared at the Apollo Crematory in Emeryville, California. He was dressed as Saladin, in a turban with his favorite red robe. A bouquet of roses was placed in his arms shortly before he was cremated. Grady’s ashes remained in the possession of the OTO for almost a year. Then, on July 12th 1986, a large group of individuals boarded a boat rented at Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco. About three miles past the Golden Gate Bridge, with help of the Neptune Society, his ashes were spread out across the Pacific Ocean. It was written, “From the fire of cremation to the waters of the great sea, by formula and verse did we rejoice him on his way.” A single rose was then tossed into the water, cut from the same bush as the bouquet that had been placed in his hands when he was cremated. As his ashes slowly vanished beneath the waters, one of Grady’s poem was read to send him off on his last voyage The Redeemer That is in the Waters.153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"July 13, 1527 The Elizabethan scholar, Dr. John Dee who was born on this date is said to have translated the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred into English.

In the 1920’s she began writing about her theories on the origins and organization of witchcraft predating Christianity. Some of her most noted works were Witchcraft, The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921) The God of the Witches (1933) and the Divine King in England (1954).July 13, 1865 Gérard-Anaclet-Vincent Encausee, otherwise known as Papus, was born on this date in Corogna, Spain.

In 1965 she responded to an authoritative ‘inner voice’ that was being channeled through her, who identified himself as Jesus Christ, and who urged her to take down his message. What she received would be called A Course in Miracles. It is a self-study course in spiritual psychology which focuses on the principles of universal love and forgiveness. It is seemingly Christianity improved wherein Jesus tells us that he wants less suffering, sacrifice, separation, and sacrament. He also wants more love and forgiveness. Why is it called A Course in Miracles? According to Schucman, the voice said to her: “This is a course in miracles, please take notes.”July 14, 1951 On this date J. Edward Cornelius, aka Frater Achad Osher 583, was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the eleventh direct descendant of Captain Aaron Cornelius whose ship arrived in America in 1645 and who was one of four men who founded Flushing, Long Island. He is also a direct descendant of Mary Sanford who was hanged in Hartford, Connecticut on June 13th 1662 after being accused of witchcraft. J. Edward is an avid writer and Crowleyite.

Edward was chartered to run The Frater Achad Chapter of the OTO in Connecticut which was elevated up Brocken Mountain Lodge in 1978. He ran Brocken Publications and the Lodge Newsletter, Hellspawned, A Newsletter of Brocken Spectres. In 1986 he chartered to run a Rose Croix Chapter at Brocken. He remained in charge of these three bodies for well over ten years. In August of 1989 he moved to Berkeley, CA. Here, he became the sixth Lodge Master of the oldest continually operating Lodge in the world, Thelema Lodge, which was actually founded by Grady McMurtry in 1977. He held this position between 1991-1993. He was also placed in charge of the Neb-Het Chapter of the Rose Croix in the Bay Area. He has written such notable articles as Did Aleister Crowley Know the Identity of Jack the Ripper?, Myths of the Solar Lodge Revisited, Aleister Crowley in Novels, Crowley’s I-Ching Sticks, Poetical Flavours of the Beast, The Warrior Troubadour and dozens more.

He described it as having three humps with a long neck and a tiny head.July 14, 1996 Near Orlinda, Tennessee on this date a family of four living in a trailer was suddenly awakened by weird noises coming from the backyard deck. Grabbing a flashlight, the father went to investigate. Sliding the door open he heard a noise that sounded like “something running across the deck, bumping into things.” Oddly, neither of his dogs chained up outside had barked at the intruder. Shining his flashlight toward the railing, he saw ‘something’ rear up and stare at him between the rails. He described it as a kind of rubbery or pulpy object five feet in diameter. It extended a tentacle, or appendage resembling an elephant’s trunk, through the railing and onto the deck floor. The father quickly went back inside as the whole family watched the creature from the trailer’s dining room window. The wife also noticed some bright lights off in the distance. Every time a family member aimed their flashlight directly at the creature it acted in a defensive manner, moving very fast across the yard, hiding under cars, or under the deck, and apparently it even changed into a glowing disk at times. Meanwhile a luminous UFO slowly appeared and hovered over a nearby clearing, shooting off beams of light. The witness was apparently struck by these beams of light on the 155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"elbow and the neck. The man and his two sons followed the creature to the family’s parked cars.

In 1877 she married Asa Gilbert Eddy and became known as Mary Baker Eddy. She was the founder of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College and the Church of Christ, Scientist, or Christian Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts in 1889. It was the belief of the Christian Scientists to use healing by faith as an affirmation that human suffering is not what God creates, but is rather a mode of human perception. Critics are quick to point out that her methods were neither Christian, nor especially scientific and that her techniques to heal illness were so effective that when her husband became ailing, he died. Mary Baker Eddy passed away on December 3, 1910 at her home in Chestnut Hill, Boston, Massachusetts.June 16, 1881 The New Orleans newspapers, on this date, announced that Marie Laveau, the renown Voodoo Queen of New Orleans, had died earlier on this date at the age of 87. This is noteworthy because she continued to be seen in and around town after her ‘supposed’ demise. However, Marie bore fifteen children. Historians now believe that Marie Laveau really did died in 1881 and that her daughter, Marie Laveau-Glapion, a striking look alike, took over the role of Voodoo Queen. Marie the II was about 50 years old when her mother died and this theory accounts for sightings all the way into the early twentieth century of the Voodoo Queen being seen in New Orleans. However, her mother, the real ‘Voodoo Queen of New Orleans’, was born in 1794 in Vieux Carre. Her father, Charles Laveau, was said to have been a wealthy white planter and her mother, Darcantel Marguerite, a mulatto with a strain of Indian blood. She described herself as being mulatto, quadroon, and sometimes just as “yellow.” She was a tall statuesque woman, with “curling black hair, good features, dark skin that had a distinct reddish cast, and fierce black eyes.” She married Jacques Paris, a free man of color, on August 4, 1819. However, a short while after the wedding he disappeared and Marie began calling herself the ‘Widow Paris.’ It is certain that 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"she was both feared and respected. Though apparently adept with charms and potions of all kinds, Marie’s real power came from her extensive network of spies and informants. It seems the New Orleans elite had the habit of carelessly detailing their most confidential affairs to their slaves and servants who then reported to Marie their secrets both out of respect and fear. As a result, Marie had an almost ‘magical knowledge’ of the workings of political and social power in New Orleans. When her daughter, with her uncanny resemblance to Marie, became a priestess, legends of Marie Leveau’s power only grew because now she was ageless and could appear in more than one place at a time. In the end we can say that Marie was no charlatan who deceived her followers with tricks and intimidation. She clearly had a great passion and devotion for Voodoo. Her most famous religious mark was probably the rituals on the banks of Bayou St. John held every June 23, St. John’s Eve. Voodoo rituals were also held occasionally on the shore of nearby Lake Pontchartrain at Marie’s cottage, Maison Blanche. It was said that sometimes she would dance about with her large snake, whom she called Zombi, wrapped around herself. All in all, Marie Leveau is a figure shrouded in mystery. She was a Voodoo priestess and a devoted Catholic. She weaved spells and charms but wielded even more influence through her earthly network of spies and informants. She ruthlessly wielded her power yet went to great pains to help the injured, sick, and downtrodden. In the final analysis, we will never know her true character, but it seems a mistake to try to choose between these disparate sides of Marie Leveau: this fascinating and complex woman was all of these things and more.July 16, 1945 On this date, at exactly 5:29:45, the first Atomic Bomb was tested in New Mexico. Witnesses said that the light of the explosion soon turned orange as the atomic fireball began shooting upwards at over 360 feet per second, reddening and pulsing as it cooled. The characteristic mushroom cloud of radioactive vapor materialized at around 30,000 feet. Beneath the cloud, all that remained of the soil at the center of the blast site were fragments of jade green radioactive glass created by the heat of the reaction. What was astonishing is that a blind girl saw the flash 120 miles away. July 16, 1996 Around noon on this date in Los Villares, Jaen, Spain, 66-year-old Dionisio, a retired farmer, was walking through a field and had sat down on a rock next to a tree. Suddenly he smelled a very strong and pungent odor in the air. He also began hearing a low hum. Looking around he noticed a UFO hovering near the ground, next to some nearby power lines. The metallic object was shaped like a dome and it had several black glass oval shaped windows. On one side of the object he could clearly make out what appeared to be an inscription resembling 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"‘IOIO’ and from the top of the object there were some cables that were apparently connected to the nearby power lines. Dionisio also noticed an unbelievably curious fact, when he started to walk away he turned and could no longer see the object. Inquisitively, as he approached the area, he was able to see it again as well as seeing three figures standing next to it. They were about six-feet tall, Asian in appearance with slanted eyes, two men and one woman, wearing tight fitting silvery outfits with boots. They also had large hands with five long well defined fingers and their mouths were slit-like. Then al of a sudden, the witness felt something strike his chest and looking up he noticed that the woman was pointing at him. Soon he began hearing voices in his head but could figure them out and being frightened he ran and hid behind some nearby rocks. That is when he claimed to hear the humming sound again, as well as smelling the pungent odor. When he peered over the rocks he noticed that the humanoids and the UFO were gone. He called the local authorities and investigators found ground traces of evidence at the site that something had landed. During the same period in time other witnesses in the region also reported seeing low flying lights and objects.July 17, 1921 Frank Bennett arrives at Aleister Crowley’s Abbey of Thelema at Cefalu causing a schism with C. F. Russell. Russell would soon leave Cefalu for America where he would start his own magical fraternity the G.B.G., the meaning of these initials are still being speculated upon to this date, although some claim its the ‘Great Brotherhood of God’.July 17, 1923 The anti-Semitic leader of the List Society, Philipp Stauff, committed suicide in Germany on this date. Many suspected foul play because of his continuing exposure of prominent Germans with Jewish roots in his newspaper. July 17, 1959 On this date Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Miller and Mr. and Mrs. Pat Marten saw a tremendous creature with a snake-like head and a blunt nose swimming some 250 feet behind their motor boat on British Columbia’s Okanagan Lake. The group watched ‘Ogopogo’ for over almost three minutes before it submerged.

S. Capitol. All night long glowing lights were being reported in the night sky by residents as well as by airline pilots. The U. S. Air force was immediately notified of the possibly of a threat to the U.S. government. Fighter planes were then scrambled from a base in Delaware to fly to the U. S. Capital and intercept the UFOs but were unable to make contact. On the following night seven more UFOs returned and were detected near Andrews AFB. The radar blips were clocked at moving up to 7,000 mph. They would also suddenly stop and accelerate again. Again, a jet interceptor was dispatched but nothing was found. July 18, 2003 On this date the newspapers reported that government officials discovered that a distraught mother in the town of Pavlodar, in northern Kazakhstan, had kept her daughter’s mummified body in her apartment for three years, with withered limbs and parched skin, lying on a plain bed in the flat. It seems the 27 year old mother, named Olga, belonged to a weird sect preaching a ‘cosmology’ that promised the resurrection of her child with the help of ‘Aliens’ and the use of a ‘third cosmic eye.’ Government officials were not amused and the daughter’s remains were given a proper burial.July 19, 1692 From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been identified and convicted of witchcraft, were carted off to Gallows Hill which was a barren slope near Salem Village, to be hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft; dozens languished in jail for months without trials until the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts subsided. On this particular date, of July 19, 1692, five of the key figures were executed; Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth Howe, Sarah Good, and Sarah Wildes.July 19, 1860 Lizzie Borden was born in Fall River, Massachusetts on this date. She is mostly likely remembered as being the axe murderer who whacked her father, Andrew Jackson Borden, and step-mother, Sarah Anthong Morse-Borden, to death in August of 1892. However, without sufficient evidence she was found not guilty.159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"July 19, 1874 Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels was born on this date. He was a former monk, the founder of the right-wing anti-Semitic magazine called Ostara and the founder of the German religious movement known as Theozoology (c.1904) which advocated sterilization of the sick and the “lower races” as well as castration for all of forced labour, while glorifying the “Aryan race” as “Gottmenschen” (god men). He justified his racial ideology with imaginary biblical evidence which claimed that the original blonde women, Eve, whom he described as being divine, had become involved with a demon, got pregnant and then gave birth to the “lower races.” His theory stated that if the true Aryan masters could “once again rule the dark-skinned beastmen” they would ultimately achieve “divinity.”July 19, 1892 The Fuld brothers filed a U. S. Patent as the new owners of the Ouija Board design on this date. The original owner, Charles Kennard, of the Kennard Novelty Company, had lost his company earlier in the year due to a hostile takeover and rather than fighting, and in need of money, he simply sold the business. This takeover was done by two of his financial backers, Isaac and William Fuld. The latter had previously been the foreman of his company. July 19, 1918 Aleister Crowley begins a retreat on Esopus Island in the Hudson River area of New York with Charles Stansfeld Jones, aka Frater Achad. In his diary Crowley simply wrote, “July 19. Began Great Magical Retirement in canoe on Hudson.” The author William Seabrook later commented that Crowley hadn’t bought so much as a can of beans or a loaf of bread. He had nothing in his pockets except the ticket for the trip up the river.” As the boat was leaving Crowley waved good-bye with a slight grin. Seabrook yelled,“What are you going to eat, for crying out loud?” to which Crowley replied, in his heaviest pontifical manner, “My children, I am going to Esopus Island, and I will be fed as Elijah was fed by the ravens.” Seabrook just shook his head and yelled back, “Are you coming back in a chariot of fire, or in a Black Maria?”July 19, 1969 It was on this date that Grady Louis McMurtry, Phyllis Seckler and Mildred Burlingame officially re-activated the Ordo Templi Orientis in the state of California, using Grady’s “emergency powers” that were given to him by Aleister Crowley. The Order had remained dormant since the death of Karl Germer in October of 1962.

Germer referred to it a “crazy Manifesto” and was infuriated that Grant had proclaimed himself a divine “priest” of a planet that he discovered and named “Isis.” Germer wrote, “It seems blasphemy to me.” Especially blasphemous was that Grant had signed this document “entirely unauthorized” as X° O.T.O. & O.H.O, both the degree and title of which he simply ‘assumed.’ Germer, thinking Grant had gone mad, immediately fired off a registered letter on this date, of July 20th 1955, which was Grant’s Notification of Expulsion. Grant was thrown out of the Order. July 21, 1899 Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois on this date. Like many writers of the period, Hemingway was fascinated by the evils of Aleister Crowley and incorporated him into one of his stories. In the unpublished version of the story, titled The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway describes an incident where he was sitting in a café in Paris in the twenties when Aleister Crowley, whom he describes as “a tall, gray, lantern-jawed man” walked by, adding that Crowley was “walking with a tall woman wearing a blue Italian infantry cape.”July 21, 1959 Martin P.

July 21, 1980 Gerard Croiset, the Dutch psychic died at the age of 71 on this date. Croiset’s versatile psychic abilities enabled him to locate missing persons, find lost objects, and also to solve crimes when called upon by police departments. The accuracy of his descriptions of various locations was amazing as was other information he was able to offer. He was able to tell people their life histories by just holding an object that belonged to them. This is a skill is known as Psychometry. He became well known for his gifts, even appearing being interviewed by the BBC.July 22 The Sun enters LEO.July 22, 1892 On this date, as two boys trolled for bass near the south shore of Lake Geneva, Switzerland, they were startled to see the head of a huge serpent like creature rise out of the water about twenty-five yards away. It opened its huge mouth, revealing several rows of sharp, hooked teeth, and focused its fierce eyes on the terrified onlookers.

Everything became eerily quiet. Soon they heard a sort of modulated scraping metallic sound followed by the sounds of something moving in the forest. When they looked towards the sound they noticed two dark red gleaming eyes staring at them. The girl screamed, became frightened and covered herself with a blanket; the boy reported that he saw what appeared to be a large form, like a white-silvery blanket approaching from a nearby hill. Suddenly the bizarre robotic creature seemed to shrink up within itself and then disappeared into the woods. Other people in the area also reported hearing loud noises coming from the woods.July 23 1865 Max Heindel was born on this date in Copenhagen, Denmark.

She was the older sister of Sir Gerald Festus Kelly, later President of the Royal Art Academy in England. She would later marry the notorious black magician Aleister Edward Crowley on August 12, 1903 and become known as ‘Ouarda’, the seer, which is an Arabic word for ‘Rose.’ On July 28, 1904 the couple had a daughter. She was named Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley. She died young. In 1906 Rose gave birth to their second daugther Lola Zaza. The best quote regarding Rose is from a book titled The Demon Lovers (1969) by Joseph R. Rosenberger. It takes place on the night of her honeymoon with Aleister. It goes as follows: “Rose stripped off her clothes and stood before Crowley in all her nudity. 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Her breasts were perfect cones, high and firm.

Jung was especially knowledgeable in the symbolism of complex mystical traditions such as Gnosticism, Alchemy, Kabala, and similar traditions in Hinduism and Buddhism, all of which he brought into his theories about human archetype.July 26, 1894 Aldous Huxley was born on this date in Surrey, England. He was a novelist best known for his books titled The Devils of Loudun (1952), The Doors of Perception (1954) and Heaven and Hell (1956). Numerous historians and biographers of this gentleman have always stated that there is absolutely no proof to even support any allegations that Aleister Crowley ever met Huxley and, least of all, that Huxley would become fascinated with altered states of consciousness after dropping mescaline given to him by the Great Beast. But let’s reflect upon some of the facts. We know that Aldous Huxley was visiting Berlin while Aleister Crowley was living in the city. This fact is mentioned in one of Huxley’s biographies where it states that “Aldous had gone on to Berlin and Paris, accompanying his friend Sullivan on a ‘tour of great men’ ... a most entertaining piece of sightseeing.” This was in late September, early October of 1930. It appears that Huxley was traveling with his dear friend John William Navin Sullivan (1886-1937) who at the time was on ‘a tour of great men’  interviewing as many eminent scientists as he could find for an upcoming book. We also know, Sullivan was a friend of Aleister Crowley’s. In fact, in Crowley’s unpublished diaries on October 2nd 1930 he mentions that he received a “letter from Sullivan - who arrives tonight with Aldous Huxley” According to other diary entries he had “dinner & Mikado &c with Sullivan & Huxley,” and again on another day, “Spent evening with Huxley & Sullivan at Muenchner Hofbraeu one of those large mediocre places which delight the grossness of Sullivan ... Huxley improves on acquaintance. We left him, very tired, at 1 A.M. Sunday.” So we can put to rest some of the stories by saying that Aleister Crowley definitely did meet Aldous Huxley. Although there is no indication in Crowley’s diaries as to what they 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"discussed, it is highly unlikely that magick, drugs or The Book of the Law were not mentioned, these being Crowley’s favorite topics of discussion. As far as Huxley being introduced to mescaline, although Crowley’s diaries do not specifically mention Anhalonium lewinii (peyote cactus), this was his drug of choice during that period of his life, and it is safe to assume that he shared with his friends. Aldous Huxley died on November 22nd 1963.July 26, 1943 On this date Michael Phillip Jagger was born on this date in Dartford, Kent, England. He dropped out of London’s School of Economics to be a rock star and he formed The Rolling Stones which began recording in 1963. The band struck stardom in 1965 with their international hit (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction. During the late 60’s Mick Jagger became associated with the underground film producer, and avid Crowleyite, Ken Anger and he did the music for Anger’s 1969 film version of Invocation of My Demon Brother.June 26, 1973 On this date near Murphysboro, Illinois, four year old Christian Baril told her parents that she saw a “big white ghost” in yard. She was not taken serious but less than ten minutes later their neighbors Randy & Cheryl turned around in their backyards to see seven foot tall dirty white Bigfoot with glowing pink eyes standing watching them. As soon as eye contact was made the creature turned and slowly walked off through trees. It left behind a strong ‘sewer-like’ odor. The police were immediately called, with tracking dogs but nothing, except slime on weeds, was found.July 27, 1873 Dr. William Moriarty the real figure whom Dion Fortune based her character called Dr. Taverner, in her book titled The Secrets of Dr. Taverner, was born in Dublin, Ireland on this date. Contrary to popular opinion, Dr. Taverner was not based upon Aleister Crowley. It has been written that “Moriarty was not an MD. He was not even a PhD. He just fibbed a little.”July 27, 1969 Robert ‘Bobby’ Kenneth Beausoleil, aka Cupid, Jasper, Cherub, Robert Lee Hardy and Jason Lee Daniels, killed Gary Hinman on this date in California. Beausoleil was part of Charles Manson’s Family. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to death but it was commuted to Life when California briefly outlawed the death penalty in 1972. In the sixties he had briefly been the lover of the underground film producer Kenneth Arnold and had even supplied him with the soundtrack for his film Lucifer Rising. Beausoleil also acted in the original film version of Lucifer Rising which later mysteriously disappeared. He played the part of Lucifer. After their falling out, Kenneth Anger began referring to him as ‘The Toad.’ 165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"July 27, 2003 Helen Parsons Smith, the ex-wife of both Wilfred T.

Sadly she would not live long and she died shortly afterwards. Duncombe Jewell remarked later that she had died of “acute nomenclature.”July 29, 1566 On this date Agnes Waterhouse was hanged. She and her daughter Elizabeth, were two of the Chelmsford Witches tried in the first major trial after the institution of the Elizabethan statute against Witchcraft in 1563. Agnes was originally accused of bewitching a child and of other wicked deeds but in her confession, obtained through torture, she told tales of worshipping Satan, who appeared to her in the form of a spotted cat, and later as a toad. Satan taught her and her daughter how to do many evil deeds from murder to bewitchment. Agnes also claimed that they both fed their own blood to the cat after pricking herself. This was proved by the shape of certain blemishes on both of their bodies. In the end, Agnes was hanged on this date and Elizabeth, seemingly acquitted now, was hanged thirteen years later in a second trial.July 29, 1875 Pascal Beverly Randolph, the 19th Century Adept and author of The Magia Sexualis, shot himself in head and died on this date in Toledo Ohio. He is credited with being the first overt spokesman in the west of sexual ‘gnosis’ which he claimed had been hidden for centuries in layers of religious symbolism. He is said to be the founder of The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor (c.1881) which is also known as the Brotherhood of Eulis. After his death he was succeeded by a Mr. Freeman B Dowd, who was succeeded by Dr. Edward H. Brown, who in turn was succeeded by R. Swinburne Clymer.July 29, 1906 Although many claim that Aleister Crowley’s A∴A∴ began around 1907 it is this date when the idea of creating a ‘new’ Order was first mention, in theory, if not by name. In Aleister Crowley’s private diaries, on this date, we find the following note: “D.D.S. and P. discuss a new O∴.” Frater D.D.S. refers to George Cecil Jones, P is Frater Perdurabo, or Aleister Crowley and O∴ implies an ‘Order.’At this stage they both discussed all the requirements, of which Crowley diligently pursues, which inevitably manifests the Order into a working structure. 166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"July 29, 1924 Elizabeth Virginia Short was born to Cleo and Phoebe Short on this date in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. During the Depression the family fell on hard times and Cleo simply abandoned his wife and five daughters by faking his suicide. His empty car was discovered near a bridge and the authorities believed that he had jumped into the river below. Years later, when he resurfaced in California, Elizabeth, who always wanted to be an actress, cane out and briefly stayed with him. Her claim to fame came on January 15, 1947 when a passerby spotted a nude body in a vacant lot near Hollywood. The dead woman seemed posed, lying on her back with her arms raised over her shoulders, her legs spread eagle. She had been cut in half at the waist. Her face and body had been slashed viciously. Rope marks on her ankles, wrists and neck suggested a very nasty scene before she died. After she was identified as Elizabeth Short the press dubbed her The Black Dahlia because of her black hair and black attire. Her murder still haunts the Los Angeles Police Department since the heinous crime was first committed back in 1947.July 29, 1934 Stanton T. Friedman was born on this date in New Jersey. He worked fourteen years as a nuclear physicist with highly classified, eventually canceled projects as nuclear aircraft, fission and fusion rockets, and nuclear power plants for space. He has always been interested in Flying Saucers and since 1967 he has lectured on the topic “Flying Saucers ARE Real” at more than 600 colleges and over 100 professional groups in 50 states, 9 Provinces, England, Italy, Turkey, Germany, Holland, France, Finland, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Korea, Mexico and Israel. He has published more than 70 papers on UFOs besides his dozens of conventional articles, and appeared on hundreds of radio and TV shows.

He was the founder of an order called The Society of Jesus, or Jesuit Order. He was canonized in 1622; declared by Pope Pius XI to be the patron of spiritual exercises and retreats.AUGUSTAugust 1, 1555 The most prolific of John Dee’s skryers and one of Aleister Crowley’s earlier incarnations, Edward ‘Talbot’ Kelly was born on this date in Worchester, England. Almost nothing is known about his life and much of what is, is a fabrication. There has been great confusion over his death, especially considering that John Dee’s private diaries recorded in 1595 on November 25: “News that Sir Edward Kelly was Slain.” This turned out to be only gossip because in 1596 Kelly, who was apparently still alive, was imprisoned for debt at the castle in Brux, western Bohemia. It was in the following year of 1997 while trying to escape over the wall that Kelly slipped, fell and broke his leg. He died shortly afterward due to complications.August 1, 1857 Ida Craddock was born in Philadelphia on this date. When she was only two years old her father died. After this, her mother who had always been very interested in spiritualism and the occult, became a fundamentalist Christian. She raised young Ida with an extremely puritanical discipline and armed with this intense religious training, this repressed young woman inevitably grew up to be deeply interested in the very subjects which were most forbidden to her in childhood: namely, sexuality, occultism, and all aspects of freedom in general. She published a book on her ideas in 1893 titled Heavenly Bridegrooms. Aleister Crowley reviewed this book in his Equinox Vol. III No.1 and wrote, “This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.”August 1, 1910 Raymond A. Palmer, the editor of the pulp magazine Amazing Stories and the co-founder of FATE magazine, was born on this date in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Tragedy struck when he was only seven.

The operation to remove the 168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"pressure on his spine was almost a success but in the end, due to many complications, Palmer was left permanently disabled; a hunchback. As an adult he stood only four feet eight inches tall. It can be said that Palmer was the P. T. Barnum of the occult world. He championed some of the most bizarre stories about UFOs, monsters and the Hollow Earth imaginable and some say that he even single-handedly created the ‘myth’ about Flying Saucers. His friend and colleague, P. W. Fairman, once wrote to him saying, “In these times of drab and unconvincing falsehood, there is still something to be thankful for. A Palmer promotion has the touch of genius. It has zing, sparkle, and true showmanship. It can be spotted a mile away by the bright lights. The thing to do is sit back and enjoy it.” Ray Palmer died in August of 1977 at this home in Florida on this date.August 1, 1912 Iona de Forrest, the mistress of Victor Neuburg, committed suicide on this date by shooting herself. Neuburg was convinced that Aleister Crowley had put a spell upon her as a ‘Circe’ and had actually murdered her.August, 1, 1978 Walter Ernest Butler, born in 1898 in East Yorkshire, died on this date in England. The world simply knew of him as W. E. Butler. He spent some years with the British army in India and tried many times to get into the Theosophical Society but was always turned down. While in India he studied among Hindu spiritual teachers and with the renowned mystic Annie Besant. After returning to England he became a member of Dion Fortune’s Fraternity of the Inner Light, and was also a pupil of the psychic Robert King, an archbishop in the Liberal Catholic Church. In 1965, W. E. Butler founded Servants of the Light School of Occult Science. He was SOL’s first Director of Studies up until a few years before his death. His books, classics in the field, are well-known for their readability and no-nonsense approach to occultism. August 2, 1832 Henry Steel Olcott was born on this date into a pious Presbyterian household in Orange, New Jersey. After the Civil War he returned to New York City, where he supported himself by being as a journalist and an insurance lawyer. In 1874, while covering reports of spirits materializing at a farmhouse in Chittenden, Vermont, he struck up a friendship with a Russian occultist named Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. One year later, he and Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society in New York, an organization that would soon play a major role in introducing Americans to the ancient wisdom of the East. Ironically, there was not one single representative of the Eastern Mystical Tradition among the founders of the Theosophical Society. At this stage they all claimed, including Madame Blavatsky, that their ‘Inner Contacts’ were non-physical masters from an Egyptian Order that was carrying on the work of 169"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Zoroaster and Solomon.

Olcott died on February 17, 1907 in Adyar, Madras, India.August 2, 1939 It was on a Wednesday at 3:15pm that Dr. Herbert Spencer Lewis, the founder of AMORC, gave up his earthly vehicle and died. He had been called many things during his life but some believe that he should be remembered by this quote which called him “a boastful, pilfering Imperator with Black Magic connections!”August 3, 1918 On this date, while on his Magical Retirement on Esopus Island in the Hudson River, Crowley wrote, “Having been trying to get into dhyana for half an hour: not the least use. What’s wrong? If this goes on, I shall be eligible for membership in the Theosophical Society.”August 4, 1892 On this date Lizzie Borden she took an axe, and gave her mother forty wacks. When the job was nicely done, she gave her father forty one! August 5, 1860 Oswald Wirth was born on this date in Brienz, Switzerland. He was a 19th century Swiss occultist, writer and artist of such books as Introduction to the Study of Tarot and Tarot of the Magicians. He worked with the noted magician Eliphas Levi. He’ll probably be remembered for being the first artist to put the letters of the Hebrew alphabet on a Tarot deck.August 5, 1862 Joseph Carey Merrick was born on this date at 50 Lee Street, Leicester, England to Mary Jane and Joseph Merrick. He became known as the ‘Elephant Man’ because of the abnormal masses of flesh which began growing on his face and body. Although his father didn’t want him; his Mother raised him until her death in 1873. When his father remarried his new wife gave him the ultimatum of “It’s either him or me.” Forced out of the home, Joseph was forced to work selling shoe-black on the streets, a menial job that left him an open target to scores of children who taunted him for amusement. Inevitably he found his way and was admitted to the Leicester Workhouse. For the most part, Joseph was unemployable, but he was prepared to do anything to earn money. Having pride that far outweighed his grotesque deformity, Joseph could write and speak eloquently and he could also read, a rarity amongst the poorer classes of the 19th century. Joseph Merrick left the workhouse in 1884 and took a job as a side-show freak.Merrick was later befriended by surgeon named Frederick Treves of 170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"London’s Whitechapel Hospital, a place which became Merrick’s permanent resident until he died at age 27, on April 11, 1890.August 5, 1959 While dictating pages for a new script, Preston Struges began complaining of severe chest pains and shortness of breath. A doctor was immediately called but early the following morning around 2:15 A.M. he suffered a massive heart attack and quietly died. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Preston Sturges was considered one of most successful writers and directors. He created such Oscar-winning classics as The Great McGintry (1940), The Palm Beach Story (1942) The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (1944) and also The Lady Eve (1941) which starred Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck. He is considered the first screenwriter in Hollywood to acquire directorship of his own films. Sturges was also an actor, playing the role of Serge Vitry in the Bob Hope movie titled Paris Holiday (1958). His mother, Mary D’Esti Sturges, was one of Aleister Crowley’s most infamous Scarlet Women. She adopted the magical name Soror Virakam which translates from Latin and Sanskrit as meaning ‘I will perform’. It was through her mediumship, while practicing magick with Crowley, that a spirit was contacted who called himself Ab-ul-Diz. However, years later, Preston would refer to the spirit simply as the “Babylonian pimp.” Generally, Crowley never mentions Preston by name. He refers to him only as “Virakam‘s brat ... a most god-forsaken lout.” Preston would later write, “Mr. Crowley’s reference to me as ‘the brat’ doesn’t bother me because, compared to the way I refer to him, it is a compliment.” It was obvious that Preston did not enjoy the presence of Aleister Crowley and that actually disliked him. In later years he would call Crowley “a sinister buffoon ... depraved, vicious and revolting.”August 5, 1970 A bus load of miners being driven to work by Aimee Latreille near Cobalt, Ontario, nearly crashed when a huge Bigfoot walked out in front of them while trying to cross the road.August 6, 1848 On this date in the Atlantic Ocean, seven men including the Captain on board the Daedalus reported seeing a huge creature which they estimated to be about 60 ft long and possibly 15 inches in diameter.

Prior to his death The Alien Digest had run only seven very limited issues but it touched on very controversial subjects such as the predator aspect of the aliens and how they might be using humans as food and recyclable body parts. August 7, 1876 On this date the worlds most infamous spy known as Mata Hari was born as Margaretha Geertruida Zelle in Leeuwarden, Netherlands. At her execution, on October 15, 1917, it was said that more than 6000 people made a ‘pilgrimage’ to the firing range to watch the spy Mata Hari shot.

After the death of his family, Ed Gein began his murderous traits. On January 6, 1958 he was officially ruled insane on this date and therefore he never stood trial for his crimes. It could be said that he was more than a cross-dresser who derived pleasure in wearing woman’s clothes, because he often danced in the moonlight his backyard wearing his victim’s face, breasts and hair, along with their vagina and underwear but now behind bars his proclivities were curbed to wearing the standard uniforms issued by the hospital.

It was the author Frank Harris who introduced Kemp to Aleister Crowley, the black magic occultist, at his studio on Fulham Road. Crowley accepted Kemp’s proposition that he attend a séance in order to write it up for the Sunday Magazine Section of The New York World but Crowley later complained about Kemp’s newspaper article in his autobiography, The Confessions, saying that Kemp exaggerated his magical exploits. Kemp, for his part, characterized his article on Crowley as a “turgid bit of sensational journalism.”August 10, 1930 Fakir Musafar, shaman, artist, master piercer, and body modifier who was a depression era baby, was born on this date on an Indian Reservation near Aberdeen, South Dakota.

He claimed it was a bright red or orange spherical object that seemingly paced the plane about 500 yards off the starboard wing. It was about 5 or 6 feet in diameter and seemed to vibrate constantly. Captain Reida claimed that he attempted evasive action, but the object followed every maneuver he did for about eight minutes, then it suddenly made an abrupt 90 degree turn and accelerated away rapidly.

Casey Brennan was born on this date in St. Clair County, in Port Huron, Michigan. He openly proclaimed that he was “The Great Beast 666 Reborn.” One person, after reading Brennan’s claims, wrote, “If Crowley has reincarnated, he’s back-sliding.” The late Grady Louis McMurtry, previous head of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis, wrote a poetic piece titled A Maiden in Love in which he immortalizes Brennan by stating that he, “did vaunt himself THE GREAT WILDe BEASTE cometh back across Ye Abysse, and did Fart and Stench about, making Muddy ye waters that had been so clear, and generally making odiferous Ye landscape, as of an ancient Oriental rice paddy teemed with night-soil that had been ex-hum-ed, and giving a stench in ye cup of hot water as becomes Instant Shit.”August 12, 1647 Matthew Hopkins died and was buried on this date. He was born in Suffolk, England, the son of a Puritan minister. He is perhaps the most notorious name in the history of English witchcraft, more commonly known as “The Witch-Finder General.” He began his successful career in 1644 by questioning old one-legged Elizabeth Clarke of Manningtree. By the time he had finished with her, thirty-one others had been named accomplices to witchcraft. Being a ‘Witch-Finder General’ was a financially lucrative trade. In a time when daily wages were as little as 2.5 pence, Hopkins was raking in £15 to £23 per town cleansed of witches. Hopkins dressed fashionably and was able to employ two assistants to help him with his work. He acquired a feared and an evil reputation as a ‘fingerman’ or the informer, paid by local authorities to determine if someone was a witch, or not. During Hopkins’ reign of terror, which lasted only two years between 1645-1646, he was responsible for the condemnations and executions of some 230 alleged witches, more than all the other witch-hunters that proliferated during the 160 year peak of England’s witchcraft hysteria. Eventually, opposition to Hopkins’ methods grew. In 1646, Puritan minister Reverend John Gaule of Great Staughton, wrote a pamphlet called Select Cases of Conscience towards Witches and Witchcraft, an exposé of Hopkins’ cruelty. Gaule also preached from his pulpit against Hopkins’ brutality toward people both guilty and innocent, and even hinted that Hopkins himself was a witch. In retaliation, Hopkins published 175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"his own pamphlet entitled The Discovery of Witchcraft. There are conflicting accounts of the death of Hopkins. One source claims that he died peacefully at home in Mannigtree in 1647, while another states that he, himself, was eventually accused of witchcraft, and was hanged accordingly. However, records show that Hopkins died “peacefully, after a long sicknesse of a Consumption” or tuberculosis in Mistley on 12th August 1647. Today according to local legend, Hopkins’ ghost is said to haunt Mistley Pond, a place where he ‘ducked and drowned many a witch.’ An apparition wearing Hopkin’s 17th-century attire is also reportedly seen roaming the vicinity, particularly on Friday nights near to the Witches Sabbats.August 12, 1827 On this date William Blake died in London at age 69 and was buried in an unmarked grave at Bunhill Fields, London. He is regarded by many as one of the earliest and greatest figures of Romanticism. In his classic 1805 poem titled Auguries of Innocence, he captured the injustice of the “haves” and “have nots” of our world by writing: “Every night and every morn.

Although well received by much of the public, The Yellow Book was attacked by critics as utterly indecent. So strong was the perceived link between Beardsley, Wilde, and The Yellow Book that Beardsley was dismissed from the publication in April 1895 from his post as art editor following Wilde’s arrest, even though Wilde had in fact never contributed to the magazine.

No one knows where he was buried, or so the story goes.August 26, 1904 Christopher Bradshaw Isherwood was born on this date in Disley, Cheshire, England, he was a champion with his controversial stand on gay liberation. He was the son of an army officer who had been killed in World War I. As a novelist and playwright he was best known for The Berlin Stories which fictionalize his life in pre-World War II Berlin in the 1930’s. These were later adapted into the stage play I Am a Camera and into the popular musical Cabaret. The latter was made into a movie in 1972 starring Liza Minnelli and Michael York. Isherwood disliked the movie when he first saw it due to its watering down the homosexual role of Yorke’s character. Isherwood never hid his homosexuality and he was seen as a champion for his controversial stand on gay liberation which he clearly reflected in his books. Although he has become a cult figure amongst the modern gay community, he always hated the term ‘gay’ and simply preferred being called ‘queer.’ During his time spent in Berlin Isherwood could often be found in the Cosy Corner which was a small working-class bar often frequented by male prostitutes. It was in Berlin that Isherwood met “the practitioner of the occult, Aleister Crowley” with a mutual friend by the name of Gerald Hamilton, who lived with the Great Beast and his mistress for awhile in Berlin in 1932. Shortly after their first meeting Isherwood decided to take Aleister Crowley to one of his favorite spots, the Cosy Corner, for drinks. No sooner had Crowley entered when he declared very loudly, “I haven’t done anything like this since I was in Port Said.” Then, glancing around the room, Crowley decided to stroll up to a “very tough-looking youth in an open shirt, standing by the bar.” Instead of introducing himself like a normal person, Crowley simply “scratched the boy’s chest deeply with his nails.” It’s hard to understand what he might have been thinking, but his actions did not receive the response that Crowley was probably hoping for. Apparently the boy was pissed. It is written that “only a sizable gift of money succeeded in restraining the boy from beating him up on the spot.” One wonders just how much money was offered to keep Aleister Crowley from getting punched out cold. Although, typical of Aleister Crowley, it’s a safe bet that some one else came up with the cash and it was most probably Isherwood. Another question could be asked-what did Crowley do at Port Said? 189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"August 26, 1931 The writer Frank Harris died in France on this date of a heart attack. He was a friend of Aleister Crowley since the mid-twenties, but on January 2nd 1924 Aleister Crowley recorded this bit of wisdom in his diary about Harris; that he had “Lunched with Frank Harris. ...

He is insane.”August 26, 1939 Phyllis Evelina Seckler, also known as Soror Meral, took Minerval Degree into Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis in the sands near Playa Del Rey in southern California, becoming a member of Agape Lodge.August 27, 1890 Emmanuel Radnitzky was born on this date in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He later changed his name to Man Ray and in 1921, at the age of thirty-one, he left New York for the city of Paris. Once there, he quickly established himself as a rather unique portrait photographer and painter. He is often considered to be one of the earliest American Dadaists and surrealists accepted amongst the Paris scene. In fact, in the early 1920’s, if an individual was going to have their portrait taken in Paris, it was believed by many that you’d be wasting your time unless you were sitting for Man Ray. Regarding his early Paris career, it is written that “there was always an endless dribble of schemes and suggestions by others concerning how Man could enhance his career and related earnings. Except for the inevitable acceptance of contracts with fashion houses and fashion magazines, he politely excused himself from such offers. One of the more diverting proposals was that proffered by Aleister Crowley.” He had met the Great Beast one day while sitting in Hotel de Blois in the Montparnasse section of Paris. Man Ray later wrote, “There was a strange character, Aleister Crowley, whom I’d heard of in connection with various suspect activities in London and New York. We were sitting in the cafe with some friends; he took me aside to speak more confidentially. He knew many wealthy women who came to him for horoscopes. We could work together, he said—why not tell those that wished to be photographed that I require their horoscope in order to portray them properly; on his side he would tell a prospective client for a horoscope that he needed a portrait of her to complete his analysis. As I did not need the extra business, the proposition was not adopted.” Another author has stated, “Ray, no fool, chose not to align himself with Crowley.” May Ray died in Paris on November 18, 1976.August 27, 1906 Eddie Gein was born on this date in La Crosse, Wisconsin. In 1957 he shocked the world when police raided his Plainfield, Wisconsin home and discovered a bowl made from the top of a human skull on the kitchen table with a spoon in it, plus numerous lampshades and wastebasket also made from human skin, an armchair made of human skin, female genitalia kept preserved in a 190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"shoebox, a belt made of nipples, a human head, four noses and a heart. One of the more ghastly trophies was a suit made entirely of human skin. The noted author who lived in Wisconsin at the time, Robert Bloch, was so inspired by the stories that he wrote the classic thriller Psycho around them. Later, in 1974, and classic thriller emerged inspired on Gein; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and although there is no character that is an exact Eddie Gein model the movie helped put Gein back in the spotlight in the mid-1970’s. Years later, Gein provided the inspiration for the character of another serial killer, Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs. Like Gein, Buffalo Bill treasured women’s skin and wore it like clothing in some insane transvestite ritual. On July 26, 1984 Eddie Gein died at the age of 78, senile & suffering from cancer.August 27, 1911 Johnny ‘Eck’ Eckhardt was born a twin on this date in Baltimore, Maryland, without legs and the ‘shortest torso’ ever recorded. His identical twin brother, Robert, was born normal. At the age 11 he developed a strong fascination for the carnival after a stage magician named Rabsid Rasha offered them a break into the business in an act which consisted of sawing Johnny in half. A midget acting as Johnny’s legs would then run off stage chased by Johnny. He loved acting in carnival side-shows and he became quite famous but, during the off-season, he would tour the music halls with his own twelve-piece orchestra and himself leading on the piano. He made relatively few film appearances but, predictably, he did star in the movie, the cult classic, called Freaks (1932). He also appeared alongside Johnny Weismuller in MGM’s Tarzan Escapes (1936) as the Gooney-Bird. Sadly, Johnny withdrew completely from public life in the early 1980s, when burglars who broke into his home in Baltimore. One sat on him while the other ransacked the house. After this sordid experience his remaining years were spent in bitter seclusion. He commented on this by saying, “If I want to see freaks all I have to do is look out the window.” He always refused to speak about his early days in show business and died on January 5, 1991 at the age of 79.August 27, 1930 Three fishermen reported seeing a disturbance in the water on this date in Loch Ness, Scotland.

When Aleister Crowley took his Theatrical Tour to Russia in 1913 he met with Lockart and his old friend Walter Duranty, who much admired the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin. It has long been known that Lockhart had connections both with the intelligence services and occultism, but little survives of the exact nature of his personal exploits. Lockhart died in 1970.September 2, 1996 It was at night in Iporanga Brazil when three local police officers watched a UFO land near Serro das Mottas.

In his youth he became swept up into religion, but lost his license to preach because of his “perfectionist” doctrine. He took its name of The Perfectionists from Mathew 5.48 and was based on the belief that man’s innate sinlessness could be regained through communion with Christ. He established the first Perfectionist commune in Putney Vermont in 1839 but because of his views on polygamy, which aroused the neighbors sense of moral ethics, Noyes was forced to flee. In 1848 he established his community at Oneida, N.Y. where he continued to develop his religious and social experiments in communal living and, for approximately 30 years, they lived in a gigantic group marriage of over 200, with shared property in larger units of group-family and group-family life. They avoided the ‘back to the land’ fantasies which were so prevalent in 1800’s communes, and which typically resulted in city people trying to be farmers and failing miserably, instead they founded businesses in and around the area. They had a complex marriage arrangement where they believed that every man and every woman was married to each other. Monogamy was considered harmful because it excluded others from sharing in connubial affection and therefore it was abolished. The idea was to engage in as many sexual relations as possible in order to keep two members from falling in love. In these relationships they could engage in sexual intercourse, but the male was forbidden to ejaculate, either during intercourse or after withdrawal. Although, men were permitting to achieve ejaculation with post menopausal women and thus the Perfectionists not only were employing a novel level of birth control, but were also found a novel approach of providing older women with sexual partners. Noyes was the first to use the term “free love.” He died on April 13, 1886 in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.September 3, 1967 On this date, the widow of Karl Germer, Sascha Germer heard someone knocking at her front door.

A drug was then injected by a syringe that totally knocked her out cold. When she came to, she found that her house had been ransacked and that many books in the library on the second floor had been stolen. Also missing were Aleister Crowley’s personal robes, various OTO documents and ritual papers. Sascha tried to call the police but found that the phone lines had been cut. When she finally did notify the local Constable, he took her story, along with a few photographs but no fingerprints were taken or any serious research done. Phyllis Seckler has stated that it was obvious that “they put her story down 195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"to the wanderings of the demented mind of a lady who had been alone too long.” In other words, they didn’t believe her.

The film was based on Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula, but sadly the filmmakers failed to get permission from Stoker’s widow which was a problem that kept the movie from audiences for decades.September 4, 1900 Charles Henry Maxwell Knight was born in Mitcham, Surrey on this date. He became one of Britain’s favorite radio and television naturalists, and it was said that any visitor “to his home at Camberley might find him nursing a bush-baby, feeding a giant toad, raising young cuckoos, or ‘engaging in masculine repartee with a vastly experienced grey parrot.” He was also considered an excellent jazz musician who loved playing the clarinet, an avid cricketer and someone who had a keen interest in the occult. He was also a British spy-master during World War II, having joined MI5 in April of 1925. Knight’s close friend in MI5 was Ian Fleming, the author of numerous books about James Bond. In fact Fleming based the character for Bond’s boss, whom he simply named ‘M’, on Knight. Knight’s strong interest in the occult inevitable lead him to the writings of Aleister Crowley. He met the Beast around 1937, being introduced to him by his dear friend, Dennis Wheatley. Knight would later describe Crowley as “a well-dressed middle-aged eccentric with the manner of an Oxford don.” There are rumors that both Wheatley and Maxwell Knight jointly applied to Crowley as novices and were accepted. Although others are quick to point out that Knight’s “interest-and also Wheatley’s-was purely academic.” According to Dennis Wheatley, he was merely studying magic for use in his novels. In fact, Aleister Crowley would later become a model for some of the characters in Wheatley’s books. Some writers have suggested there were more sinister reasons why Knight wanted to meet Crowley other than ‘occult interest.’ Hinting that Knight’s first 196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"wife, Gwladys Poole, who apparently knew Crowley before marrying Knight, had a bad personal experience with the Beast.

For whatever reasons, Aleister Crowley tried in vain to make a friendship with her and her brother Osbert. Regarding this Edith Sitwell wrote, “Although Mr. Crowley did his best to pursue an acquaintance with my brother and myself, I did not at the time wish to know him.

He had by that time taken to mysticism and was surrounded by a group of idiots who regarded him as inspired and almost, indeed, a god. Inasmuch as it was whispered in London that a certain amount of homosexuality was intermingled with the devotion of these disciples, I avoided him as much as possible, but after I got home he began bombarding me with mystical literature, all of it elaborately printed and brought out at his own expense, or that of his followers. He became, in the end, the recognised head of all the English occultists, and a figure of some consideration in the life of London.” Mencken wrote many profound statements throughout his life, like: “The objection to Puritans is not that they try to make us think as they do, but that they try to make us do as they think.”September 12, 1877 German occultist, astrologer & rune scholar Georg Lomer, was born in Loosten near Wismar on this date.

She was an accomplished violin and orchestral player. Of all of Aleister Crowley’s Scarlet Woman, Leila Waddell aka Soror Agatha, is without doubt the most unique. Waddell, with a thick Australian accent, used to call Aleister Crowley, “I.C.” According to her friend Gwen Otter, Crowley used to say to Waddell, “Oh, Mother, I wish you’d get rid of your Australian accent. It sounds so bad in ceremonies.” To appease the Beast, Waddell once asked Gwen, “Will you tell me when I sy anything in Austreyelian?” Some of Crowley’s best work was inspired by Waddell’s presence, including The Book of Lies, and many wonderful short stories and works of poetry.

He often faced the suspicion of having a ‘familiar’ simply because he owned a black dog, named Monsieur. Agrippa died in Grenoble or Lyons in 1534 or 1535, no one is really sure but they did record the fact that at his death his dog disappeared, which only fueled the legends that it was a ‘familiar’ and that Cornelius Agrippa had been in league with Satan all along.

She described him as “a rather rugged, athletic man with an undeniable force of personality.” Once, while she was sitting with friends in the Café Royal, she was approached by the Beast who leaned over her table, took hold of her hand, looked into her eyes and said, “You are a pythoness ... and a strong one.” Miss Garret further elaborates that Crowley “looked at me intently with half-closed eyes. I remember that his eyes were protruding and his mouth betrayed a sensual nature. He may have been anywhere between thirty-five and forty at the time-but in those days everyone over thirty looked old to me!” He then took off one of his rings and gently slipped it onto her finger. She quickly took it off and gave it back to him. “My giggling companions were somewhat surprised, and I, too, was startled not knowing what a pythoness was.” Crowley apparently “just walked away slowly to another table and joined a few companions.”September 15, 1996 On this date in the Cabeca da Penha Mountain of Portugal a young backpacker named Ricardo Machado Oliveira was exploring a remote mountain cave when suddenly he ‘blacked out.’ When he came to, he found himself in a vast underground hangar surrounded by “three distinct species of aliens.” Nearby were several ovoid silvery crafts, or UFOs.

Oddly, in the 14th century, at the exact same cave, a little girl from a nearby village vanished for three days. When she was finally found, she told the search party that she had been cared for by “a lady in white” who had offered her water to drink from a bell. Some have attributed this to a visitation by the Blessed Virgin Mary.September 16, 1692 On this date Giles Corey was crushed to death on this date in Salem Massachusetts for refusing to plead to the indictment of witchcraft, as did wife Martha.

The leader was described as taller and green colored; wearing a long flowing robe. He was very slender and had a narrow vertical head, with eyes located on either side of it. One of the small humanoids stepped up Sakhov and sprayed him in the face with a yellowish powder and then began conducting numerous medical tests on him, which made him feel “horrible” and very uncomfortable. Midway through the tests Sakhov blacked out. When he came to he found himself lying flat on his back in the middle of a soccer stadium half a mile or so from his house.

Some claim that it all began on this date when ten young boys outside Greensburg told the police that they had seen a huge tan colored Bigfoot in woods. The police investigated and found hair samples and footprints. Three days later two boys in the same town came upon a Bigfoot who was asleep on pile of grass clippings; they quietly fled and, when they returned with adults, the creature had gone. Across town a boy delivering papers also saw a tall, tan colored Bigfoot walking with stooped posture; “like it was drunk.” The sightings continued.

Television, radio and newspapers eagerly covered this unique phenomenon, and even skeptical journalists held their milk-filled spoons to the gods and watched, humbled, as the milk simply disappeared. One person who considered the thousands of people who had already feed Ganesh, explained, “It cannot be a hoax. Where would all that milk go to? It just disappeared in front of my eyes.” Within weeks the phenomenon spread as statues of Ganesh, throughout Hindu temples worldwide, began drinking milk. While the media and scientists still struggle to find an explanation, many Hindus believe this was a sign that a great teacher had been born to save the world. At the Southall temple in London where thousands had also witnessed a similar miracle of a drinking statue, the chairman Mr. Bharbari offered his explanation: “All I know is that our Holy Book says that wherever evil prevails on earth then some great Soul will descend to remove the bondage of evil so that right shall reign.

The idea of time involves that of two consecutive things, that of space two non-coincident things, that of causality two connected things.” October 1, 1949 On this date, the author of the book titled Real Magic (1971), Philip Emmons Isaac Bonewits was born in Royal Oak, Michigan. His parents were devout Roman Catholic, from whom he acquired an appreciation for religion. Years later in 1971, at the annual ‘Aleister Crowley Birthday Party’ in Berkeley, California, Grady Louis McMurtry the head of the Ordo Templi Orientis met Bonewits. Grady would later remark, “Stupid me, I thought he was Jewish, name, appearance, etc., but trust that clever Phyllis [i.e. his wife]. She just right out asked him if he wasn’t a Catholic, and he said, well, yes, in a way.” The author Israel Regardie would later joke to Grady in a letter that he too, had made the same mistake about ‘Bonewitz’ by calling him “a smart-aleck Jew” with “a fat ego,” admitting that the Jewish part being, of course, wrong.October 2, 1857 The English Christian mystic and writer on Masonic and occult subjects and member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Arthur Edward Waite, was born on this date. Aleister Crowley once wrote about Waite’s Fellowship of the Rosy Cross that it, “...has substituted a pompous, turgid rigmarole of bombastic platitudes for the neophyte ritual, so that the last spark of interest is extinct for ever.”October 2, 1890 Groucho Marx was born on this date in New York City.October 2, 1914 On this date John ‘Jack’ Marvel Whiteside Parsons was born in Pasadena, California. He was a writer, visionary, dedicated occultist, rocket scientist and chemist. He helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, now a major industrial complex. His rocket experiments were often conducted behind the Devil’s Gate Dam in Pasadena, near the present day Jet-Propulsion Laboratory. He worked with such great minds in rocketry as Eric Von Karmen, Frank Malina, Jack Williamson and Edward S. Forman. In fact, Parsons’ ideas regarding solid-propellant rocket fuel would aid the first American rocket-assisted takeoff on August 12th in 1941. His exploits in rocketry are so famous that it gained him the honor of having a crater on the Moon named after him, 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"appropriately enough on the dark side. On February 15, 1941 at 7:45pm, Jack Parsons and his wife, Helen, joined Aleister Crowley’s OTO taking both Minerval and First Degree Initiation on the same evening. Jack would later take Probationer in the A∴A∴ under Wilfred T. Smith on March 22nd; taking the magickal motto of ‘Thelema Obtentum Procedero Amoris Nuptiae’, which Crowley later commented was “couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding.” Parsons later assumed Lodge Master of Agape Lodge after Wilfred T. Smith resigned. In time Parsons would also become known by such names as Frater Belarion, Frater 210 or the self-proclaimed ‘Antichrist.’October 2, 1917 Rosaleen Norton was born on this date in Dunedin, Australia. She claimed to have experienced various forms of psychic apparitions throughout her life and considered them part of the natural order of the universe. She started drawing at aged 3, but was expelled from Chatswood Girls Grammar School after disrupting her classmates by drawing bizarre pictures of supernatural phenomena. She studied art at East Sydney Technical College, where her vivid imagination was encouraged, and she started exploring ritual and the occult, later experimenting with hypnotic trance states. In 1952 she released The Art Of Rosaleen Norton, with poems by Gavin Greenlees but it became heralded as indecent by the newspapers of the day and, as time went by, rumors began to spread about Black Masses and Rosaleen’s devil cult. She became known as the “Witch of Kings Cross.” She supported herself by selling her paintings and making charms and hexes for a chosen few. She spent her last years with her cats, music and books, and she died of colon cancer on December 5, 1979. October 2, 1924 British Customs seize Aleister Crowley’s book The Bagh-I-Muattar, also known as The Scented Garden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz, and destroyed every copy because of its indecent subject matter, or so they thought. The book claimed to have been “translated from a rare Indian manuscript by the late Major Lutiy and Another.” Of course Aleister Crowley had written the entire thing, not only the translations of the mythic Persian verses but also the copious pseudo-scholarly notes in the manner of Sir Richard Burton.October 3, 1860 On this day Annie Elizabeth Fredericka Horniman was born in Forest Hill in Lewisham in 1860, the daughter of a wealthy family. She used her inheritance to back theatrical enterprises; from W. B. Yeats, Bernard Shaw to even MacGregor Mathers. She was deeply involved in the Order of the Golden Dawn and was once the official ‘scribe’ whom some claimed, in the Golden Dawn, should never have gotten the position because “it was almost certainly a mistake; 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Mrs. Horniman was obviously a difficult person to get on with, as shown by her irreverently bestowed nickname of “Pussy.” October 3, 1884 Paul Foster Case, the founder of the Los Angeles occult school known as the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), was born in Fairport, New York on this date. His mother was a teacher and his father was the head librarian. Case was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn on May 16, 1920, while visiting the Praemonstrator Michael Whitty, on May 16, 1920. He took the magical motto of ‘Perseverantia’ at the Thoth-Hermes Temple of the Golden Dawn (Alpha et Omega) in New York.October 4, 1877 On this date, at the age of twenty-three, MacGregor Mathers was initiated into a Masonic Lodge of Hengist – No.195 in Bournemouth. Mathers quickly progressed through the grades of Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft, and was raised to Master Mason on January 30, 1878.October 4, 1967 On this date, shortly after 11:00pm, ‘something’ crashed into the bay by the tiny fishing village of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. It was described as being about 60 feet long with 4 lights that flashed in sequence. After it hovered for a few minutes, it descended at a 45 degree angle and, upon impact with the water; there was a bright flash and an explosive roar. The crash was viewed by at least 20 witnesses who said that just before sinking, it looked like it was flat dome shaped. The crash was originally phoned into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Detachment in Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia by a young fisherman, describing it as a possible ‘airliner’ impacting the surface of the waters adjacent to Shag Harbour. Canadian Navy and RCMP divers were brought in on the morning of October 6 to recover the wreckage but all attempts were unsuccessful. Nothing was ever found. Today, many believe that it was a UFO that crashed into Shag harbor.October 5, 1848 The Austrian esotericist Guido von List was born on this date. He was the founder of Ariosophy. At the age of fourteen built a temple to the god Wotan complete with altar in the crypt of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.October 5, 1930 On this date the British airship known as the R 101 crashed in flames on a hillside in Beauvais, France killing 48 of its 54 passengers. What makes this story unique is that two days afterwards an anxious voice of a man claiming to be Flight Lieutenant H. Carmichael Irwin spoke through the lips of the medium Eileen Garrett while she sat in a trance during a séance at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research in London, which had been set up four years 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"earlier by Harry Price, a well-known psychic investigator. The Captain spoke in short disjointed sentences as he described in-depth the horrifying last moments before his incineration. Because of the worldwide interest in the crash, the séance also attracted worldwide attention and this was also due to a reporter, present at the séance, who put the news story out at once. What made the story even more amazing is that the ‘spirit’ included a wealth of technical information that was confirmed six months later by an official lnquiry.October 6, 1902 Arthur Edward Waite joined Arthur Machen’s Drinking Society on this date which was called ‘Rabelaisian Order of Tesspots.’ He assumed the title of Master Basil.October 7, 1909 On this date Arnold Crowther was born in Chatham, Kent, England, one of a pair of fraternal twins. He grew up to become a skilled stage magician at sleight-of-hand, a ventriloquism, and a puppeteering. He was married to the witch Patricia Crowther and would become a famous English Witch in his own right.October 7, 1877 The American master of terror, Edgar Allen Poe, was found lying almost unconscious in the gutter outside Ryan’s saloon on Lombard Street in Baltimore. He was taken to the local hospital where he remained delirious with tremors and hallucinations. He went in and out of a coma over the next few days, was even calm and lucid at times, but finally he lapsed into a delirious state, became combative, and required restraint. He died on his fourth day in the hospital; October 7, 1877. He was only 39 years old, had always suffered from bouts of depression and madness and he even attempted suicide once in 1848. His death certified states that the cause of Poe’s death was “congestion of the brain.” He was buried in a cemetery next to Westminister Hall at Fayette and Greene Streets. His poem The Raven had appeared in the New York Evening Mirror in January 1845 and was a critical and commercial success. The Fall of the House Of Usher (1839) and The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) are arguably two of his best short stories.October 8, 1825 Pascal Beverly Randolph was born on this date at 70 Canal St in New York to a black woman named Flora Beverly, who was said to have been a black princess from Madagascar and to a white father, Edmund Randolph. His father, although not of royal stock, was known well enough in his own sphere. He had been the Governor of the state of Virginia, was present at the constitutional convention during the birth of the United States, was the Attorney General to President George Washington and in 1794 he became Secretary of State. The 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"marriage between Flora and Edmund was short-lived and his parents separated early, and his mother was to die at an early age from one of the many epidemics prevalent at the time.

In a letter to his friend Louis Wilkinson dated January 8th 1952, Powys wrote, “My dear, I have been absorbed in the Aleister C. book. I think he suffered from a mental & nervous disease for which I here & now invent the name ‘gynaesclerosis.’ Powys continues, explaining, that this word is “from ‘gynae’ – ‘having to do with the nature of women, and sclerosis’ – ‘the hardening of tissue’, by which I mean that he gradually assumed the physical & mental & emotional qualities of women, but in the process of his taking them on they hardened themselves so that they ceased to resemble the qualities of women, since in these natural qualities there is always a tendency to & power of amazing elasticity or softening of which males are forever taking advantage. The emotions and all the feelings of the sexual act differ in women completely from those which men experience, and Crowley was by inheritance & environment and by the fiat of pure chance an embodiment of all the feelings woman have in the sexual act hardened into a permanent attitude of body & mind.” Powys continues, trying to further clarify his views on the differences between men and women, and then writes, “So when I invent the word ‘Gynaesclerosis’ for Crowley’s whole life’s weird & abnormal history-and this alone explains his peculiar mania for his own breasts and belly - I show how it is a case of the life-long hardening (an almost unique abnormality) of the female feelings that in a women are so quickly changed into something else by softening.”October 8, 1920 Frank Patrick Herbert, the author of the sc-fi classic The Dune (1963) and all its sequels, was born on this date in Tacoma, Washington. He died on February 12, 1986 after long treatment for cancer. October 8, 1935 Robert de Grimston, was born on this date in Shanghai, China. His true name was Robert Moore (‘The Teacher’) but he and his wife, Mary Anne Maclean (‘The Oracle’) changed their last name to de Grimston after they married and began to establish the group called The Process Church of the Final Judgment or The Process.October 9, 1921 Frank Bennett signed the Oath of Practicus, 3°=8 ̈, in the A∴.A∴, the man whom Aleister Crowley wrote: “... cannot spell”.218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"October 10, 1954 Jim Eshelman was born on this date in Rochester, Indiana.

The Temple of Thelema became the ceremonial and initiatory vehicle of the College of Thelema, which Phyllis Seckler (Soror Meral) founded in 1973. Jim Eshelman published the classic volume The Mystical and Magical System of the A∴A∴ in 1993.October 11, 1868 Born on this date was Percy Bullock, who at the age of twenty-four joined the Golden dawn assuming the motto Frater Levavi Oculos, which means “I will lift up mine eyes.” October 11, 1911 Aleister Crowley met Mary d’este Sturges at a party given by the dancer Isadora Duncan. He asked, “Have you ever had a serpent’s kiss?” and before she could answer yes or no, he bit her on the wrist. The story has it that she developed blood poisoning!October 12, 1875 Aleister Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley at 36 Clarendon Square in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire to Edward and Emily Crowley. In his autobiography Crowley claimed he was “remarkable from the moment of his birth. He bore on his body the three most important distinguishing marks of a Buddha. He was tongue-tied, and on the second day of his incarnation a surgeon cut the fraenum linguae. He had also the characteristic membrane, which necessitated an operation for phimosis three lustres later. Lastly, he had upon the centre of his heart four hairs curling from left to right in the exact form of a Swastika.” He’s been called everything from “Wickedest Man in the World” to the “Great Beast 666.”October 12th This date is ‘Crowleymas,’ or the Thelemic holiday honoring the birth of Aleister Edward Crowley.October 12, 1915 “I should unquestionably have become insane from satisfaction at the fulfillment of my utmost aspirations having been granted to me so superlatively beyond imagination conceived, but for ‘my sense of humor and my common sense.’” Thus Aleister Crowley wrote on this date upon his attainment to the grade of MAGUS, 9°=2 ̈.

Frater Hymenaeus Alpha IX° 777 signed the Charter as a Magus 9°=2 ̈. More importantly, after months of deep contemplation, Grady felt that he finally knew his Magickal Word which would create the Universe for which his entire life had prepared him. He uttered three letters – ‘OTO’. According to Grady, this magical affirmation gave birth to Thelema Lodge as The Grand Lodge of the Ordo Templi Orientis.

In her short life she wrote many stories using the pen-name of Katherine Mansfield, these include In a German Pension, Bliss and Other Stories and The Garden Party, to name just a few. Her reckless pursuit of freedom and independence would in time claim her health, making her an invalid and eventually leading to her death. In December of 1911 she met a gentleman who would become her life-long lover, John Middleton Murry. It is said that after “their first meeting, he immediately wrote to her, suggesting she should contribute reviews to Rhythm” a literary magazine, and he also “sent her a volume of Crowley’s verse, and asked for more of her work.” In 1913. Katherine and Gwen Otter wrote a short play together titled Mimi and the Major in which, predictably, they were both the main characters. Gwen being the Major and Katherine playing Mimi. After the play, Gwen invited some of her friends back to her apartment for a private party, to smoke Hash and explore the ‘inner truth’ of their beings. Katherine was persuaded to take part but from their point of view she proved to be a total failure. Instead of showing herself to the expectant gathering as some unmasked and extraordinary female, it appears that she spent the whole time arranging and rearranging with the greatest exactitude the matches from a box which she had in her hand, making patterns on the carpet. It seems, according to witnesses, that Katherine simply kept saying, “That’s much better.” Followed quickly by “Pity that stuff had no effect.” It has also been written that during this 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"evening Katherine felt “sick and unduly irritated at the sight of a picture hanging not perfectly straight on the wall.” Katherine continued to try to talk, ranting about such things as “a princess who lived at the edge of the sea and when she wanted to bathe she just called to the waves ...” In the end, Gwen quietly got rid of the remaining guests and, when she turned around, she found Katherine laying in the middle of the floor. Katherine slowly looked up and asked, as if implying that she was on a boat, “Where are the others? ... Have they gone on deck? It’s lucky it is such a smooth night. Pity the stuff had no effect.” — After this evening, with ego bruised over the stories of her escapades, it appears Katherine quickly began to distance herself from Aleister Crowley and his associates in an attempt to forget her foolishness.October 14, 1920 Anne Lea (Poup’ee) died on this date at Cefalu. She was the daughter of Aleister Crowley and Leah Hirsig (Soror Alostrael).October 15, 1844 Frederich Nietzsche was born on this date in Rocken, a small village in Prussian Saxony. His concept of the ‘Superman’ inspired Adolf Hitler which probably made his “blasphemous spirit choke with glee”, or so it has been written. In his 1889 classic, titled The Twilight of the Gods, Nietzsche asked the great confrontational question: “Which is it, is man one of God’s blunders, or is God one of man’s blunders?” Nietzsche’s atheistic views infuriated many and inspired one of the cleverest pieces of graffiti ever to be written about a person: Nietzsche  “God is Dead.” God  “Nietzsche is Dead.” October 15, 1921 Two days after signing the Oath of Philosophus, Frank Bennett took the next step and signed the Oath of Dominus Liminis in the A∴.A∴ on this date.

Wilde was known for his flamboyance and wit, but he was rejected by many for his unorthodox views and bohemian lifestyle. He wrote stories, essays, plays, poems and novels, like: The Picture of Dorian Gray. At one time Aleister Crowley inscribed and annotated a two volume ‘proof’ edition of Frank Harris’ book titled Oscar Wilde, His Life and Confessions for the author.

At first their friendship was in the pursuit of ‘Black Magic,’ but Crowley also acknowledges that this was his first homosexual experience. In fact, when Crowley released his most noted homosexual tome titled The Scented Garden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz, he included a poem titled The Riddle; if you take the first letter of each couplet going down it spells out ‘Herbert Charles Jerome Pollitt.’October 16, 1869 The discovery on this date on a farm in Cardiff, New York of a 10 foot, 4 1/2-inch tall, 2,990-pound “petrified man” touched off what was one of the greatest hoaxes in America. The origins of the hoax started in the spring of 1866 when George Hull of Binghamton, N.Y., was in Ackley visiting his sister. There was a tent show revival, and the preacher quoted text from the Bible, Genesis 6:4: “There were giants in the earth in those days.” Inspired, in the summer of 1868, Hull acquired a five ton slab of gypsum and hired a few sculptors, swore them to secrecy, and had them carve the block of gypsum into a shape of a reclining giant, holding his stomach as if he was in great pain. Sulfuric acid was used to ‘age’ the giant, and needles were used to simulate skin pores in order to make the giant as realistic as possible. The giant was then put in a box and shipped to Union, New York where Hull and his cousin, William Newell retrieved it. Newell lived just outside of Cardiff. The plan was to bury the giant on Newell’s farm and to leave it there for about a year. Ironically, the following spring, a farmer less than a mile from Newell just happened to discover by accident real bones that scientists from Cornell University pronounced to be fossils. The incident helped pave the way for the discovery of the giant several months later. This occurred on October 16, 1869 when Newell hired well drillers to dig a new well. Using a dowsing rod, or two-pronged stick used to find subsurface water, Newell led the drillers to the very spot where ‘water’ would be found but instead of discovering water, they unearthed the giant. Within a short span of time, trainloads of people from New York City were coming to see the giant, a tent was set up and $1 admission per person was charged. The showman Phineas T. Barnum tried to buy the giant, but Hull turned him down. Miraculously Barnum then found his own giant and by the time the Cardiff giant was taken on the road to New York by Hull’s partner named Hannum, Barnum was already billing his as the ‘original.’ Ironically, everyone believed P.T. Barnum. Hannum was quoted in a newspaper as saying, “There’s a sucker born every minute,” a saying often mistakeningly attributed to P. T. Barnum. Needless to say Barnum and Hannum 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ended up in Court fighting over whose ‘giant’ was the real one and this is when George Hull stepped forward and confessed that the ‘Cardiff Giant’ was a hoax. The lawsuit was dismissed because the Judge ruled that Barnum could not be sued for having a fake Cardiff Giant because the original was a fake as well. October 16, 1942 Aleister Crowley mentions in his diaries on this date that he had recorded his classic poem, The Hymn to Pan, on a phonograph but it has, to many people’s regret, never been found.October 17, 1834 Edward Crowley, father of the Great Beast 666, was born on this date.October 18, 1616 Nicholas Culpeper, the astrologer and herbalist, was born on this date in London. He wrote the classic book, Complete Herbal and English Physician. He died of tuberculosis at the relatively young age of 38 on January 10, 1654.October 18. 1839 Cyrus Teed was born on this date in Delaware County, New York. He was a New York doctor and scientist who did unconventional experiments involving dangerously high levels of electricity. During one such experiment he was badly shocked, and was knocked out cold. During his period of unconsciousness, Teed believed that he was visited by a ‘Divine Spirit’ who informed him that he was the second messiah. Inspired by this vision he set about to apply his scientific knowledge to “redeem humanity.” He promptly changed his first name to ‘Koresh,’ being the Hebrew word for Cyrus. Of course, some believe that the heavy dose of electricity that Teed absorbed may have damaged his brain and there might be some validity to this. Following his divine visit Teed’s scientific theories began to get increasingly odd. He openly denounced the idea that the Earth revolved around the sun and instead he pioneered his own theory of the Universe, known as ‘The Hollow Earth Theory.’ According to his theory, human beings live on the inside of the planet, not the outside, gravity did not exist and humans are held in place due by centrifugal force. He believed that the Sun was a giant battery-operated contraption, and that the stars mere refractions of its light. Oddly enough, although denounced by many, Teed’s ideas caught on with some residents of his small town who began calling themselves the Koreshians and who promulgated “Koreshanity.” Many believe that Teed is the father of the ‘Hollow Earth’ theories.October 18, 1918 Grady Louis McMurtry, aka Frater Hymenaeus Alpha 777 X°, was born on this date in Big Cabin, Oklahoma, which is a little town located in the 223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"northeast corner of the state about fifty miles outside of Tulsa. He was a close friend of Jack Parsons, who introduced Grady to the writings of Aleister Crowley. He, along with his wife Claire ‘Tommie’ Halleck Palmer took Minerval and First Degree Initiation into Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis at Agape Lodge on June 13th 1941. He later claimed that both he and Claire “took to it [the OTO] like ducks to water” and that “we were instinctively at home.” Grady served in World War II. While stationed in England prior to D-Day he met Aleister Crowley who not only made him a IX° initiate but also gave to him his magickal motto: ‘Hymenaeus Alpha.’ In August of 1944 Aleister Crowley sent Grady the first of the infamous Caliphate letters. Crowley felt that if he was the prophet of the New Aeon, of Thelema, as Mohammed was to Islam, then the title ‘Caliph’ fits quite nicely to designate the spiritual aspect of descent while the position of OHO represented the material. Whether or not these two positions could be held by one person was something which Crowley had yet to theoretically work out but he honestly believed that they could. Years later Grady McMurtry would fulfill both the Caliphate and become the beloved Outer Head of Aleister Crowley’s OTO and establish Thelema ‘Grand’ Lodge in October of 1977 in Berkeley, California.October 18, 1946 A freshwater dragon was sighted on this date in the Clearwater River near Rocky Mountain House, Alberta. A farmer named Robert Forbes claimed to have seen a huge, scaly-skinned monster with fiery eyes, long, flashing teeth, and a horn dart its head out of the water long enough to swallow whole a calf which happened to be eating on the banks. October 18, 1949 Richard William Gernon, Frater 831, was born on this date in Rochester, New York. He served as master of Marcelo Motta’s Mentu Lodge of SOTO in Nashville, Tennessee. He had gone to Nashville at the instigation of James Wasserman. And become an A∴A∴ Probationer and was eventually passed to Neophyte but he inevitably had a falling out with Motta. He later joined Grady McMurtry’s OTO. He succeeded James Wasserman as Lodge Master of Tahuti Lodge in New York City and was a Bishop of the Ecclesia Gnostic Catholic. He died suddenly on March 15, 1989 in New York City at age 39. October 18, 1996 Early in the morning hours near Isabela, Puerto Rico, Norberto Del Valle claims to have been driving on state road No.2 and approaching the Experimental Agricultural Labs of the University of Puerto Rico, when he noticed three strange silhouettes crossing the road in front of him. He slammed on the brakes in order to avoid hitting the figures and noticed that they were not human in appearance. He described them as being short, with large heads, large round dark eyes, long thin arms, and fingers. Their skin was described as pinkish-white and 224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"very rough textured resembling a salamander; large protruding veins could be seen on the cranial area. He said that the one in the middle appeared to be somewhat taller than the other two. The creatures appeared to be disoriented and seemed to have even not noticed the vehicle. Del Valle slowly drove way and upon looking back he saw a fourth similar creature join the other three. He did not notice any type of clothing on them. October 18, 1996 In Paraiba, Brazil, on this date, during a night of intense UFO activity in the area, a 92 year old local peasant woman named Julia Monteiro de Cabral saw an unusual silver object come down from the sky vertically and land besides some nearby eucalyptus trees. She claimed that a group of small humanoids emerged from the object, which she described as being “ugly” and spoke in a high-pitched unintelligible language. The humanoids surrounded the witness home and apparently stole some of her chickens.October 19, 1910 Crowley’s Rite of Saturn of Eleusis was performed on this date at Caxton Hall, Westminster and a review of this ritual which appeared in the Sketch stated, “...beautifully conceived and beautifully carried out. If there is any higher form of artistic expression than great verse and great music, I have yet to learn it.”October 19, 1928 Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) was Incorporated in California on this date. Later Aleister Crowley was to write and ask H. Spencer Lewis to surrender his estates at San Jose believing AMORC to be a commercial enterprise of the O.T.O. and therefore to be his rightful property.October 20, 1882 Béla Ferenc Dezso Blasko, more commonly known as Bela Lugosi, was both on this date in Lugos, Hungary. He shot to stardom in the title role of the 1931 film version of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, wherein he set the standard for movie vampires. He also starred in such memorable movies as The Black Cat (1934), The Wolfman (1941) and Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). In 1955 Lugosi committed himself to an institution, admitting to a long time addiction to methadone. In his last years his life and career were on the skids, but he still worked a little in television and low-budget films. He died while working on what has been called one of the worst movies ever made  Plan 9 From Outer Space.October 20, 1949 Selena Fox was born on this date in Arlington, Virginia.

This was the first time someone ever captured a ‘Sasquatch’ on film.October 21, 1995 Mary Alice ‘Linda’ Goodman gave out different birth information to different people. She always cited April 9 as the day of her birth, but the year and birth time varied widely. It is even said that she bribed the record clerks in her home town to give out false information. She wanted her chart ‘never be known.’ After a tumultuous and often difficult life, she died from complications of diabetes on this date. Linda Goodman’s Sun Signs and her Love Signs, both of which were on the best seller lists for a very long timeOctober 22, 1920 Timothy Francis Leary was born on this date in Springfield, Massachusetts. He took LSD for the first time in 1962 and wrote, “It was the most shattering experience of my life.” He once stated in an interview, “...well, I’ve been an admirer of Aleister Crowley, I think I’m carrying on much of the work that he started over a hundred years ago, and I think the 60’s themselves ... Crowley said Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, under love. Its a very powerful statement. I’m sorry he’s not around to see the glory he started.” He died on May 31st 1996 at his home in Beverly Hills, California wearing a t-shirt that read: “If you only have one wish, make it BIG.” His last words are reported to have been: “Why? Why not? WHY NOT? Why not? Why not? Why not?” and later, “Beautiful.” On February 9, 1997, a portion of Leary’s cremated remains were launched into space.October 23, 1921 Eight days after taking the Oath of Dominus Liminis, Frank Bennett assumed the Oath of Adeptus Minor in the A∴.A∴. He was the man whom Aleister Crowley wrote “... his education had been quite elementary.”October 23, 1943 Aleister Crowley began writing his essay titled Jack, the Ripper on this date.226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"October 23, 1974 On this date in New York City, John Lennon and his then personal secretary and girlfriend May Pang had just ordered pizza. It was a hot night as John stepped out onto the terrace in their upper East side apartment. Pang, who was in the bedroom, heard John frantically shouting for her to come. As Pang walked out onto the terrace, she later claimed, “my eye caught this large, circular object coming towards us. It was shaped like a flattened cone and on top was a large, brilliant red light, not pulsating as on any of the aircraft we’d see heading for a landing at Newark Airport.” It was a UFO. As it got closer John and Pang could make out a row or circle of white lights that ran around the entire rim of the craft, which were flashing on and off. Pang also recalled, “It was, I estimate, about the size of a Lear jet and it was so close that if we had something to throw at it, we probably would have hit it quite easily.” Afterwards they immediately called the local newspaper to report the sighting and were told that at least seven other people had called in claiming to have seen the UFO. As for the rest of the evening, John kept saying, “I can’t believe it... I can’t believe it... I’ve seen a flying saucer!” John cryptically referred to his experience on the cover of his album Walls And Bridges, which was released in 1974, saying that he saw a UFO on August 23.October 24, 1879 Frizz Haarmann the ‘Vampire’ was born on this date. At his trial, when he was asked by the prosecutor, “How many victims did you kill?” Haarmann replied, “It might be 30, it might be 40, I can’t remember the exact number.” Then, when he was asked how he had killed his victims, Haarmann replied dispassionately, “I bit them through their throats.” Fritz Haarmann, who by now was being called the ‘Hanover Vampire,’ was executed on April 15, 1920. As he was being escorted from his cell, before being beheaded, he smiled and said, “I will go to my execution as if it were a wedding.” His brain was removed and handed over to Gottingen University for studying.October 24, 1914 Aleister Crowley left London on this date, went off to Mexico and there, “...reached such a low state that even the toughest of whores avoided him. His body was filthy, he had a thick, beard, and he was foul-smelling. There was no telling just how far he wanted to go in his orgy of masochism because a mountain-climbing friend of his, a man named Oscar Eckenstein, rescued him in time.”October 24, 2002 Harry Hay died on this date. Hay was one of the founders of the modern gay movement as well as the Radical Faeries in 1978. Although he never personally met Aleister Crowley, he did know some of his followers in California around 1935 when he briefly worked at the Agapé Lodge of Ordo 227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Templi Orientis, which was then located on Winona Boulevard in Los Angeles. At that time he played the organ during the Gnostic Mass. These Masses were beautifully performed with extreme seriousness, but it must be remembered that this was still California and even back then something humorous or ‘a twist’ was often added. Some believe that it must be something in the air. It was reported that Harry Hay, “mischievously slipped ‘Barnacle Bill the Sailor’ or ‘Yes, We Have No Bananas!’ slowed to dirge tempo, into the contrapuntal themes he was hired to play” for the Gnostic Mass. However, more humorous is the fact that Harry Hay frequently “dropped into his former Catholic church to play a mass earlier in the day-just to balance his sacrilege.” October 25, 1916 M. Gerard Encausse, aka Papus, joined the French army medical corps when World War I first broke out. Sadly, while working in a military hospital, he contracted tuberculosis and died on this date at the age of 51. He was the man, whom it has been written, who had a “... willingness to confer and receive high sounding but meaningless occult dignities.”October 25, 1962 The O.H.O. of the Ordo Templi Orientis, successor of Aleister Crowley, Karl Germer, he shed his earthly vehicle on this date. He died of prostate cancer. His successor, Grady Louis McMurtry, wrote that “... surgeons had made the incision at the level of the Lower Penal Sign known to our Order, found that the cancer was inoperable, sewed him up, and sent him home to die. Naturally Sacha was completely incapable of changing the bandages, the wound became infected, he was taken back to the hospital, and it was while the nurses were trying to clean him that he died screaming.” October 25. 1969 On this date near North Anahim Lake, British Columbia, a game guide named ‘Pan’ Phillips watched a huge brown Bigfoot through his telescopic sight on his gun for almost ten minutes. It was sitting by snow hole cave, which Phillips thought might be its home, at the edge of a glacier at 6,000 ft.October 26, 1440 Gilles de Rais (or de Retz) was a Marshal of France, one of the richest and bravest noblemen in the land, very cultured, sophisticated and supposedly a pious man. His chief claim to fame was that he fought by the side Joan of Arc. Years later, after his own arrest, his ecclesiastical accusers claimed that Gilles de Rais was a ‘heretic, sorcerer, sodomite, invocator of evil spirits, diviner, killer of innocents, apostate from the faith, idolater.’ Many historians claim that they fabricated the case against him and point out that his crimes only became ‘known’ his servants were tortured until adequate evidence was given against their master. De Rais himself was then tortured and supposedly made a full 228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"and ready confession, not only to the 140 murdered children, of which he was charged but to the murder of at least 8oo. Predictably, de Rais was found guilty and in a show of public contrition and humility he begged forgiveness from the parents of the children he admitted to slaughtering. Like his beloved Joan of Arc before him, he was sentenced to death by fire. But as an act of mercy’ for not recanting his confession, he was first garroted to death before being thrown on the flames on this date in 1440, “that the fire should not kill him but was shown a pity.”October 26, 1910 Aleister Crowley performed The Rite of Jupiter of Eleusis in Caxton Hall. October 26, 1982 Sybil Leek died on this date at the age of 65 in Florida after a long battle with cancer. One report of her death has it that a train derailed near to her Melbourne home and dosed her with a toxic gas which had caused her illness. She will be remember as a remarkable woman of many accomplishments, a gifted Psychic, Astrologer and Writer who did much to influence the revival of the modern day witchcraft movement. Aleister Crowley supposedly said to her as a young child that “This is the one who will take up where I leave off”, adding “You’d better remember that, young lady. You’ll hear all sorts of things said about me and they’ll say the same things about you, but I shall have broken the ground for you.”October 27, 1811 The Norwegian, Olaf Jansen, whose story was told in a book called The Smokey God, was born on this date. He and his father had traveled into the hollow earth and spent time living with a race of giants, stating that, “my experiences make Marco Polo look like a piker.” October 27, 1910 The noted World War I military tank expert, J. F. C. Fuller, signed the Oath of Probationer joining Aleister Crowley’s A∴A∴on this date.October 27, 1927 Patricia Crowther was born Pratricia Dawson on this date in Sheffield, England. Her family lived next door to a palmist named Madame Melba, who predicted that Patricia would later develop great clairvoyancy powers and follow in the foot steps of her great-grand mother, who had been a herbalist, clairvoyant, and fortuneteller. She inevitably ended up into the Old Religion, or witchcraft and was a High Priestess initiated by Gerald B. Gardner in 1960. She is considered by some to be Gardner’s spiritual heir, and has formed many flourishing covens throughout the United Kingdom. 229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Ocotber 27, 1942 Aleister Crowley recorded the First and Second Enochian Calls on a phonograph on this date.October 28, 1903 Evelyn Arthur St. John Waugh was born in London into a comfortable middle-class family on October 28th 1903. The first inkling of any interest in Crowleyism on Waugh’s part appeared in a short story that he wrote in 1933 titled A Step Off The Map, subtitle: An Experiment Begun in Shaftesbury Avenue and Ended in Time. It was published in Harper’s Bazaar (London) in December of 1933. It was later edited and released in a book titled Mr Loveday’s Little Outing and other Sad Stories (1936). It was also renamed Out of Depth. The story describes a dinner party attended by an American whose name, believe it or not, is Rip van Winkle. In this story there is another character named Doctor Kakophililos, which is Greek for a “Lover of Evil.” Dr. Kakophililos is said to be “a great magician” and is described as “an elderly man, quite bald, with a vast white face that spread down and out far beyond the normal limits.” This doctor always replies in a typical Crowley fashion“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” October 29, 1896 MacGregor Mather’s issued his ‘Manifesto’ founding the Second Order of the Golden Dawn on this date, but revolt was obviously brewing at this time and would take three years to surface into full war. October 29, 1925 Joseph Goodavage was born on this date in Philadelphia, PA. His first book, Astrology: A Space Age Science, was published in 1966, and Write Your Own Horoscope followed in 1968, to name but a few of his books. Goodavage passed away on April 14, 1989, in Kansas City after battling heart disease for many years.October 29, 1949 After being admitted into the hospital, apparently too late, G. I. Gurdjieff died on this date, but “Four hours after his death, his forehead was still warm. And when Bennett stood alone beside the body in the chapel of the American Hospital, he could hear someone breathing - even when he held his breath and closed his eyes. He suspected Gurdjieff of a last practical joke.” In truth, he was dead and thus ended the life of the man whom the British press call a “fakir and shit.” The Times magazine described him as a “remarkable blend of P. T. Barnum, Rasputin, Freud, Groucho Marx and everybody’s grandfather.”October 28, 1923 Albert Karl Theodore Reuss died on this date. He was a singer, druggist, journalist and possibly even a spy for the Prussian Police. He claimed to have used a charter supplied to him by John Yarker to establish a “Masonic 230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Academy” which became known as the Ordo Templi Orientis or O.T.O. Reuss was Aleister Crowley‘s predecessor as the Head of the OTO, who had attempted to revive the Order of the Illuminati in Munich and Berlin. October 29, 1829 James Hirst died on this date at the age of 91. He was an eccentric British bloke who wore a red coat with blue sleeves, harlequin breeches, a glossy waistcoat made of drakes feathers’ and a huge lambskin hat, a full three yards in circumference. In his Last Will and Testament he left £12 for 12 old grisly maids to carry him to his grave, with £5 for a piper and a fiddler to play as they carried him to his final resting place in the churchyard. He had been born in Rawcliffe, England in 1738, the son of a wealthy farmer. As a young man he felt the need to train of his father’s bulls named Jupiter to be a mount for riding like a horse and for pulling his wickerwork carriage. However, when Jupiter found it difficult to pull the carriage, Hirst added a huge master which he then fitted with sails but this was not an altogether wise move. On one particularly windy day it forced the carriage out of control to crash through a shop window, earning a ban from the town of Pontefract. If this was the only eccentric thing he did he would have been forgotten but he also tried to train an otter to fish for him to which he claimed success. Others point out that getting an otter to catch the fish wasn’t out of the ordinary but getting it to let go of the fish was a bit hard. Hirst also hunted by using pigs instead of dogs as pointers. The list of eccentricities goes on and on. When he finally married his housekeeper, he wore a toga and decided that the ceremony should be conducted in sign language.October 29, 1967 Vera Stacey Wainwright died on this date. She was a woman whose peotry appeared in a book titled Poems & Masks; the ‘Masks’ were drawings done by Austin Osman Spare, whom was introduced to her by Victor Neuberg during World War Two.October 29, 1997 On this date, Anton Szandor LaVey, the founder of the First Church of Satan and author of The Satanic Bible, died of cardiac arrest in, of all places, the Christian hospital of St. Mary’s in San Francisco. His death certificate incorrectly lists the date of his death as October 31. In 1956 he had purchased the old Victorian house on California Street in San Francisco’s Richmond district and painted it black. It was reputed to have been a den of iniquity and a speakeasy. It would become home to the Church of Satan. After his death, the house remained unoccupied, fell into disrepair and was finally demolished on October 17 of 2001.October 30, 1894 Philip Arnold Heseltine was born in the Savoy Hotel in London on this date. He is an English composer, critic, and editor known for his songs and 231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"for his exemplary editions of Elizabethan music. He used his real name primarily when writing literary & editorial works while reserving his pseudonym of Peter Warlock for his musical works. Like many who were numbered amongst Aleister Crowley’s circle of friends, we may never know the full extent of Heseltine’s involvement. However, his interest in magick is believed by many to have been his downfall. The catalyst began when his wife left him. He was greatly in love with her and rumors persisted amongst his circle of friends that he used black magick in order to get her back. Although he boasted that he had succeeded in getting her back, in other ways he failed, losing both his mind and his soul. By the late twenties it became obvious that Heseltine was under serious mental strain and life in general had become unbearable by 1930. He often felt himself a failure. Dark moods of depression over-took him more frequently than not. Finally, on the morning of December 17th 1930, the woman who lived above Heseltine in his Chelsea apartment woke to the sounds of Heseltine loudly closing all his windows and locking the doors. She thought it rather strange but, instead of investigating, she went back to bed. Later, she smelled a strong odor of gas seeping out from under his door and into the hallway. She immediately summoned the Police who broke open the door and found Heseltine lying fully dressed on the couch. He was dead of coal-gas-poisoning. Years later, when Aleister Crowley was writing about magickal talismans, he used Heseltine as an example of magick being applied wrong. He wrote, “You must on no account attempt to use the squares given in the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage until you have succeeded in the Operation. More, unless you mean to perform it, and are prepared to go to any length to do so, you are a fool to have the book in your possession at all. Those squares are liable to get loose and do things on their own initiative; and you won’t like it. The late Philip Haseltine {sic}, a young composer of genius, used one of these squares to get his wife to return to him. He engraved it neatly on his arm. I don’t know how he proceeded to set to work; but his wife came back all right, and a very short time afterwards he killed himself.”October 30, 1900 English writer Algernon Henry Blackwood wrote ghost stories and supernatural fiction, of whom Lovecraft wrote: “He is the one absolute and unquestioned master of weird atmosphere,” was initiated into the Golden Dawn on this date, assuming the motto Umbram Fugat Veritas. When Pope Urban IV (1261-1264) first established the Feast of Corpus Christi, he requested St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) to compose hymns for it, which he did called Lauda Sion. This is one of the five beautiful hymns Aquinas composed in honor of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. In once section of the hymn Aquinas wrote, “In hac mensa novi Regis, novum Pascha novae legis, phase vetus terminat.Vetustatem novitas, umbram fugat veritas, noctem lux eliminate,” which means, “On this altar of the 232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"King this new Paschal Offering brings an end to ancient rite. Shadows flee that truth may stay, oldness to the new gives way, and the night’s darkness to the light.” Thus Blackwood’s motto is often translated as “truth expels darkness.”October 30, 1943 On this date a young American Army Lieutenant named Grady Louis McMurtry met none other than the Great Beast himself, Aleister Crowley. It was a bright sunny morning when he came to the apartment at 93 Jermyn Street (pronounced German), located just off Piccadilly Circus in London. In response to his knocking, the door slowly opened, and there stood the Great Beast, Aleister Crowley, who simply asked, “Yes?” To this Grady replied, “I am Lieutenant McMurtry.” Crowley’s response was, “Well, come in dear chap!” Years later, when asked, “How could a Company Commander in the Invasion of Normandy have also been an associate of Aleister Crowley in London in the 40’s?” Grady simply replied with his typical wit that once, after he had just been balled by this little Japanese prostitute near Piccadilly Circus, while both were smoking cigarettes, he asked that age old stupid question, “How did a nice girl like you get mixed up in a lousy racket like this?” She replied, “Oh, just lucky, I guess!” This is how Grady would often explain how he managed to meet the Great Beast, Aleister Crowley, “Just lucky, I guess!”October 31, 1589 Peter Stubbe, who according to old German records was “a most wicked Sorcerer, who in the likeness of a Woolfe, committed many murders,” was executed on this date near Collin, Germany for being a werewolf; killing and devouring men, women, and children, some sheep, lambs, and goats, and even cattle. It seems that shortly after being put to the rack in the town of Bedbur, Stubbe, fearing the pain of torture, voluntarily confessed to all these crimes while working with the Devil in the shape of a wolf. He was condemned to death and his body laid and tied upon a wheel. With red hot burning pincers he then had his flesh pulled off from the bones, after that, his legs and arms were broken with a wooden ax and then his head struck from his body. All the parts of his carcass were then burned to ashes in a huge bonfire.October 31, 1833 Kenneth MacKensie was born on this date, who it is claimed “... to hold foreign medical qualifications, although he never produced evidence in support of this claim, not in support of similar claims to hold doctorates in Philosophy and Law. In this he displayed a common trait of occultists: the confusion of fantasy and reality in both esoteric speculation and real life.”October 31, 1874 The Golden Dawner Charles Thomas Loveday was born on this date, not to be confused with Raoul Loveday of Crowley fame.233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"October 31, 1899 The noted artist and future brother-in-law to Aleister Crowley, Gerald Kelly, was initiated into the Golden dawn on this date.

Four days earlier Houdini was sitting in his dressing room in Montreal, ready to give a lecture on spiritualism, when a student from McGill University asked if he could actually withstand a blow to the stomach thrown by any man. Houdini replied yes but before he could prepare himself by tightening his stomach muscles, the student hit him three times. Although, Houdini seemed to recover, even performing shortly afterwards, he soon fell ill and the pain never really subsided. He would not see a doctor for several days. By the time he was diagnosed, with a 104-degree temperature, it was too late. He had just finished his show and just as the curtain fell, he collapsed. Houdini was rushed to the nearby Grace Hospital, and diagnosed with a ruptured appendix. An operation was performed, but peritonitis had already set in. He had one more operation, but again failed to respond. His last words were, “I am weaker. I guess I have lost the fight.” On Sunday October 31st, Halloween day, at 1:26pm, Houdini died in room 401, Corridor D, in the old John R. Wing of Grace Hospital. He was 52 years old.October 31, 1938 Grady Louis McMurtry loved telling a story about a Halloween Party in 1938 which was attended by numerous science fiction types at Clifton’s Cafeteria in southern California. He recalled that there was, according to his words, “this idiot running up and down on the other side of the table,” a long conference table in the center of the room. The person was trying very hard to hide and would crawl along the floor and jump up whenever some one approached. He was wearing a horrible Halloween mask and was trying to scare everyone, especially the girls. However, no one was impressed, he wasn’t well hidden and everyone saw him crawling around the floor. Most saw him simply as an annoyance. After awhile the mask came off and who did it turn out to be? None other than a young Ray Bradbury! Years later, around 1981, when the opportunity arose to ask Ray Bradbury if the story was true. Bradbury wrote, “My God, yes, I remember Grady McMurtry, and of course what he remembers is true. Ray Harryhausen made a mask of my face and from that made a latex horror mask which I wore to the Paramount Theatre on Halloween of 1938 to see Bob Hope in The Cat and the Canary.” Bradbury continues by saying, “... Grady was probably with us when, on occasion, during the movie, I popped the mask on and shoved my face over people’s shoulders in various rows. I was 18 at the time, so I guess I may be forgiven.” 234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"October 31, 1967 On this date The New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn (NROOGD) was first formed. The original group began around a group of friends who were all students at San Francisco State College. It seems a class in which they were taking had an assignment of creating and performing a ritual. The students decided to recreate an archetypal witches’ Sabbath, using the printed sources available at the time, primarily Robert Graves, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner. After doing the ‘ritual’ several times, they began to feel the effects of it, and they decided to create a group and train others in its performance. The name they chose for themselves, New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, is a play on the attitudes they had toward what they were doing at the time and upon their spiritual antecedents. Over the years the mother circle of NROOGD hived off daughter and granddaughter covens, which trace an unbroken line of initiation and share a common liturgy. October 31, 1987 Joseph Campbell died on this date in Honolulu, Hawaii at the age 83. He established a worldwide reputation with such books as The Hero With a Thousand Faces (1949) and the four-volume study of world mythology, Masks of God (1959-68). He made the profound statement: “Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths.”NOVEMBERNovember 1, 1866 William John Warner was born on this date in Dublin, Ireland. The world knows him as Cheiro. He also went by the name Count Louis Hamon, claiming a noble ancestry that may or may not have been accurate. He is most likely the world’s greatest palmist. Cheiro was also a friend of the magician Aleister Crowley and even joined his A∴A∴in 1913, the same time as Nina Hamnett and Gwedoline Otter. Cheiro died on October 8, 1936, in Hollywood, CA, at the age of 69.November 1 1922 Visitors to the beach at Margate, South Africa, were treated to an amazing spectacle happening just off shore on this date. Two whales were clearly observed by many people seemingly engaged in battle with a bizarre sea monster with snowy-white fur and a huge elephantine trunk. As the battle progressed the monster seemed to weaken and three hours into the battle it disappeared. Then, during the evening, its lifeless body was washed ashore and proved to be truly colossal, measuring just over 47 feet in length, and including a 10 foot long tail. Apart from it’s luxuriant 8-inch long fur, the most remarkable feature about this creature was that it did not possess a distinct head which had trunk-like appendage about 5 feet long, that had been visible during its fatal 235"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"encounter with the whales. This creature was dubbed “Trunko.” Sadly, even though the creature’s corpse spent ten days on the Margate beach not one scientist came by to see it, or give it the time of day.

His father was another notorious member whose antic, after performing a Black Mass at Mountpelier House, cost the building to be burned down, killing many a member who was too drunk after the evening’s revelries to escape. It was said that local people watched the blazing pyre convinced that God had taken revenge. Whaley’s son, Thomas ‘Buck’ Whaley was to become, in his short life, far more famous and flamboyant than his father. He rallied the Hell-Fire club from the low ebb to which it had sunk after the fire by openly declaring his intention of ‘defying God and man in nightly revels.’ Black Masses and homosexual orgies were the principal features of his nightly debaucheries. However, years later, repentance and remorse began to enter into his mind and so he resolved to seek absolution for his sins. It is said that while kneeling in the darkened nave in St Audoen’s Church he had a vision of the Devil creeping down the aisle towards him. Seized with terror, Whaley ran from the church and fled Ireland forever. He lived a few more years but finally died at the age of 34 of sclerosis of the liver. In his memoirs, a repentant ‘Buck’ Whaley wrote that he felt “no trifling sensation from the prospect that this simple narrative may persuade the young and inexperienced, if the language of truth has the power of persuasion, that a life of dissipation can produce no enjoyment, and that tumultuous pleasures afford no real happiness.”November 2, 1910 “... amid choking clouds of incense, varied by barbaric dances, sensational interludes of melodrama, blasphemy and erotic suggestion” the Rite of Mars of Eleusis is performed at Caxton Hall by Aleister Crowley & Co.November 2, 1931 Aleister Crowley’s private diary has the following entry on this date: “...He gave us lots of bad cognac.

He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced briefly in Philadelphia until he went to Minnesota in 1857. Here, Donnelly was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1859, and again in 1861. He was later elected to Congress as a Republican, serving from December 7, 1863, till March 3, 1869. Besides doing journalistic work he has written an Essay on the Sonnets of Shakespeare and, for which he is most known, a book titled Atlantis, the Antediluvian World (1882), in which he attempts to demonstrate that there once existed in the Atlantic Ocean, opposite the straits of Gibraltar, a large island, known to the ancients as Atlantis. His next book titled Ragnarok (1883) he tried to prove that the deposits of clay, gravel, and decomposed rocks, characteristic of the drift age, were the result of contact between the earth and a comet. Donnelly died in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 1, 1901 and was buried in Calvary Cemetery, St. Paul, Minnesota.November 3, 1939 Franklin Jones was born on this date. He would become a follower for a while of Swami Mukananda, who gave him the name ‘Dhyanananda’ which means “he whose bliss comes through meditation.” Muktananda authorized him to teach then, but Da did not do so because he felt that his enlightenment was incomplete. Da’s enlighten event took place in the Vedanta Society temple in Los Angeles in September 1970. It was only several years later that he changed his name to Bubba Free John and then to Da Free John. He died in 2003.November 3, 1957 Dr. Wilhelm Reich dies in prison at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Many of his experiments were designed to ascertain whether sexual excitement was associated with an increase of bio-electric charges in the genitals & erogenous zones. He believed this to be true.November 4, 1922 In 1891 a young Englishman named Howard Carter arrived in Egypt convinced that there was at least one undiscovered tomb, that of the almost unknown King named Tutankhamen. Carter found a backer for his quest in the wealthy Lord Carnarvon. On this particular date, in November of 1922, Carter’s workmen discovered a step cut into the rock that had been hidden by debris left over from the building of the tomb of Ramesses IV and digging further they discovered stairs that lead to an ancient doorway that appeared to be still sealed. On the doorway was the name Tutankhamen. That evening, when Carter arrived home, his servant, wide eyed with fear, met him at the door. In his hand was a few 237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"yellow feathers. He proceeded to tell Carter that his pet canary had been killed by a cobra. Carter, looking at the feathers, simply asked if the snake was out of the house but his servant replied by grabbing his sleeve and saying, “The pharaoh’s serpent ate the bird because it led us to the hidden tomb! You must not disturb the tomb!” After the tomb was opened, a few months later, Lord Carnarvon, 57, was taken ill and rushed to Cairo. He died a few days later. The exact cause of death has never been determined but it seemed to be from an infection started by an insect bite. Legend has it that when he died there was a power failure and all the lights throughout Cairo went out and, at the same moment back on his private estate back in England, his favorite dog howled and dropped dead. Even more strange, when the mummy of Tutankhamen was finally unwrapped in 1925, it was found to have a wound on the left cheek. A wound which was in the same exact position as the insect bite on Carnarvon that lead to his death. All in all, by 1935 twenty-one people who were connected, or indirectly connected, with the discovery of the Tomb had all died of unnatural causes.

He believed that the earth was hollow, habitable and is composed of five hollow, concentric spheres, with space between each, and habitable upon both convex and concave surfaces. At the North Pole, he supposed there was an opening four thousand miles in diameter; and at the South, six thousand miles. In 1823 Symmes petitioned Congress to send an exploring expedition to test his theory and he actually got twenty-five affirmative votes. Symmes’ theory spawned a number of books including novels. The first was Symzonia (1820) by Captain Adam Seaborn. Edgar Allen Poe’s two stories, MS Found in a Bottle (1833) and Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, both owe something to Symmes. The theory had its loyal adherents right up until William Peary’s reportedly discovered the North Pole. November 5, 1920 Ninette Fraux Shumway, the Scarlet Woman whose name was ‘Beauty’ was banished from the Abbey of Thelema as an ‘intruding demon’ in the eighth month of her pregnancy.

Roger Scarberry slowed his vehicle to get a closer look, and in the dark they all could make out something that seemed to be about the same size and shape as a man but it didn’t seem to have a head.

Within minutes the creature turned back toward the door of the power plant, walking with a “strange, shuffling gait,” and Scarberry took this as his cue to floor his car but he soon discovered that the creature was following him and keeping up, even though he was doing almost 100 mph.

At one point it dropped close to the ground near the trees. Later, the woman and her daughter went over to the area to investigate and found strange marks on the ground. Upon leaving the park the two women saw two short humanoids wearing jeans with rolled cuffs, pointy ears and glassy eyes. The humanoids then smiled and the woman claimed to have then received a ‘telepathic message.’ She closed her eyes only briefly but when she turned around to look at the little men they had disappeared.November 18, 1896 The Sacramento Bee in California reported on this date in its newspaper of the strange appearance in the sky of an unidentified object “huge and cigar-shaped and had four large wings attached to an aluminum body.” There were quite a few sightings throughout the later half of this year up and down Northern and Central California.

In this letter Crowley wrote, “... Ah! United. Yes: Sometimes I sat and thunk, and sometimes I just sat. But no nearer to your motto. Then a flash! Well, yes, I think it may do. Hymenaeus Alpha (=Aleph) (You know the Greek Alphabet & its values of course?) Hymenaeus, the Graeco-Roman God of Marriage; and Alpha (Aleph) with all its meanings - see Essay on Atu O in the Tarot. And the whole show adds up to 777. Good enough?” Grady immediately sent Crowley back a letter, which was dated November 25th, “Is 777 good enough? I should argue with Jack Pot! This Alpha business. A bi-lingual pun asserts itself, i.e. ‘Liber Aleph’ which could mean anything from ‘Greetings, o perfect Fool’ to ‘Hi, Chump’. Yes, I think that it will do. And I think that I am the boy for the job.” Thus, Frater Hymenaeus Alpha 777 was born.November 19, 1995 On this date in Puerto Rico the Chupacabra, or “goat Sucker,” was blamed for a killing spree that caused the death of dozens of turkeys, rabbits, goats, cats, dogs and even horses and cows.

It had come out of the brush and attacked the family dog.

The creature was dark gray in color; it had large hind legs resembling those of a kangaroo, and small arms and hands. It seemed to be searching for something, maybe the rest of the chickens.

In 1904 Aleister Crowley issued an unauthorized edition of Mather’s translation of the Goetia where he not only credited the work to “a dead man” but prefixed an elaborate curse against Mathers in Greek.

He took the magical motto of Frater OY MH. Most initiatory systems within magickal fraternities like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis, or even Aleister Crowley’s A∴A∴, deal with spiritual self-transformation on the Qabalistic Tree of Life and titles like ‘Zelator’ are symbolically attributed to one of the ten sphere on this glyph. In this case, a Zelator works out of Yesod, the ninth Sphere of the Moon. Its purpose is to establish a suitable Foundation. November 22, 1963 Aldous Huxley, the man whom Aleister Crowley turned onto peyote, died on this date. There is story worth mentioning. In 1930, at the Porzo Galleries in Berlin, Aleister Crowley had an exhibition of seventy-three of his paintings and drawings. One portrait hanging on the walls was that of Aldous Huxley. It is said to have been a hasty sketch or drawing of Huxley, about which Aleister Crowley stated, “I thought he had a lot of money and painted him like this to flatter him.” There is no record as to what ever happened to this particular painting, or if Huxley even bought it, although it is presumed to have been destroyed by the Nazis shortly before World War II. It appears the entire Crowley collection was seized from Martha Kuntzel who was living in Leipzig. She had been storing them for Crowley at the time.

They take refuge in a house belonging to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff), a character loosely based on Crowley. Needless to say, the twisted Satanic ritual which follows is rather amusing. However, although the title is ‘suggestive’ of an the Edgar Allan Poe story, in reality has nothing to do with Poe’s original story. A black cat does make a few brief appearances throughout the movie, seemingly to justify the title, but its only memoriable scene is when Bela Lugosi throws a knife at it. Sadly, Boris Karloff died on February 2, 1969 after battling emphysema for a number of years, he was 81.

November 23, 1909 Aleister Crowley, along with Victor Neuburg, evoked the twenty-eighth Enochian Aethyr known as BAB on this date between 8:00-9:00pm at the village of Aumale in the Algerian desert. There are a total of Thirty Aethyrs according to the magickal structure laid out by John Dee. Crowley had previously evoked the twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Aethyrs in Mexico. To look into these invisible realms, known as Aethyrs, one often uses a crystal and once one has obtained the ‘vision’ the angels will appear and communicate messages by pointing to one letter at a time on huge boards of letters.

His father was a student of esoteric Christianity. In 1924, or so the legend goes, a spirit of a high Hermetic adept entered into the body of fourteen-year-old Franz and, being possessed, his personality changed dramatically and with great suddenness; in time he became one of the most remarkable magicians of the 20th century. He wrote such books as Initiations Into Hermetics, The Practice of Magical Evocation and The Key To The True Kabbalah.December 1, 1923 The noted occultist and visionary artist Steffi Grant, wife of Kenneth Grant, was born on this date in England.December 1, 1947 Aleister Crowley, magician, poet and author, died on this date in Hastings, England of bronchitis and cardiac degeneration. He was 72 years old. It has long been reported that the last thing which the Great Beast tearfully said just before he died, while his hand was gently being held by his dear friend Frieda Harris, was - “I am perplexed!” This is not true. Although they might have been the last words that he spoke to her, she was not at his bedside when he died. His real last words, which were spoken to his nurse, were  “Sometimes I hate myself.”December 1, 1947 Approximately one week after having a curse placed upon him by Aleister Crowley, Dr. William Brown Thomson, died. The author James Laver, who met Aleister Crowley shortly before he died, related this story in his own book, although he’s quick to point out “I do not vouch for it.” According to Laver, when the Doctor told Crowley he was going to cut off his heroin, Crowley replied, “If you do I shall die—and I shall take you with me” and, as already stated, Dr. Thomson did in fact die as Crowley predicted. The first article mentioning Dr. Thomson’s death appeared in The Daily Express on December 4th. It candidly proclaimed, “Magician Put Curse on Him, Crowley’s Doctor Dies.” It went on to say, “Dr. William Brown Thomson, who used to prescribe morphia tablets for Black Magician Aleister Crowley, ‘the wickedest man in Britain,’ has died within 24 hours of his patient, it was disclosed yesterday.”252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"December 1, 1952 On this date Anodea Judith was born in Elyria, Ohio.

December 2, 1963 Jane Roberts began using an Ouija board on this date which inevitably put her into contact with an invisible entity known as Seth, who described himself as “an intelligence residing outside time and space.” She would later tell her story about Seth in such best selling books as The Coming of Seth and The Seth Material. To this day she has a phenomenal following and her books can be found in bookstores across the world. She died in 1984December 3, 1909 While skrying into the 14th Aethyr on this date and, on an ‘impulse’, Aleister Crowley seized upon the idea of a doing a homosexual ritualistic act upon his scribe Victor Neuburg. This occurred outside Dal’leh Addin and it was dedicated to the great God Pan. Thus, on an erected altar of rough stone, Crowley was said to sacrifice himself, an act which he claimed consumed ‘every particle of his ego.’ Later that very same evening, while skrying further into the same Aethyr, Angels admitted him into the company of the Masters of the Temple. Thus it can be said; with a little buggery and just the proper ‘push’, Aleister Crowley ‘officially’ became a Magister Templi, 8°=3 ̈, and entered Binah, the third sphere on the Tree of Life. This degree, Crowley had taken back in December of 1906 but never felt ‘comfortable’with obtaining it until now. Back in 1906 he assumed the motto Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici which means: By the power of Truth, I, in my lifetime, have conquered the Universe. December 3, 1948 John Michael Osbourne, more commonly known as Ozzy Osbourne, was born on this date in Birminham, England. He was the lead singer of heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath. Ozzy left the band in 1979. Not only did he have hit records, he was a magnet for controversy like the time he once bit the head off a bat while on stage, giving himself a rabies scare; or the time he bit the head off a dove in the offices of record executives. He was even sued over his song “Suicide Solution” by the parents of a teenage fan who had killed himself; the case was dismissed. He was arrested in 1982 for urinating on a historical “shrine,” on of all placed  The Alamo.

December 3, 1966 Friedrich Bernhard Marby, German occultist and rune scholar, died on this date. He believed that man was a sensitive receiver of cosmic waves which animate the Universe and he saw the runes not just as letters but as incantations, or even as gymnastic postures and movements.December 3, 1967 On this date a 22 year old Police Sergeant named Herbert Shirmer in Ashland, Nebraska, was driving down a desolate road when he reported seeing a bright light in the sky, or a flying disk, which slowly settled on a distant hill. The closer he got to the object his car stopped and his lights went out. Needless-to-say, he was frightened as he watched some figures come out of the object and walk toward him. At what point he passed out he is not sure but, later, he came to in his patrol car, he realized that he had a missing time episode. He wrote in his official police log entry for the day, “Saw a flying saucer.”December 4December 5, 1484 The Papal Bull issued by Pope Innocent on this date, being in need of credibility, inevitably lead to the Malleus Maleficarum (1486) being published which was one of the most widely referenced and infamous books of its time. Throughout the middle Ages and the entire period of the witchcraft hysteria, the Malleus Maleficarum was the most influential how-to-guide used for the persecution and torture of witches and heretics. Montague Summers who translated it into English called it: ”One of the most important, wisest and weightiest books in the world.” Due to the rapid spread of the Printing Press revolution in the late 1400’s, generally attributed to Johann Gutenberg, the book became widely available to the masses and for over two centuries was second only in sales to the Holy Bible. December 5, 1872 The ship known as the Mary Celeste, which had recently left New York, was found on this date under full sail in the mid-Atlantic.

In fact, the galley fire was still burning, half eaten food lay on the table and still fresh. Smoldering pipes lit with tobacco were found, along with numerous other oddities.

They had vanished without a trace, or a fight; leaving one of the greatest mysteries of the sea for all to ponder.December 5, 1945 On this date five Avenger torpedo bombers lifted off from the Navel Air Station at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at 2:10 in the afternoon. It was a routine practice mission which had the planes fly due east 56 miles to Hens and Chicken Shoals to conduct practice bombing runs. About an hour and a half after the flight had left a radio transmission was received from one of the bombers claiming that their compasses were not working and, although they were they experienced pilots, they believed they were somehow heading in the wrong direction out over the Florida Keys. No matter how hard they tried, ground communications could not get the five Avenger torpedo bombers back on any recognizable course. By 4:45pm it was obvious that the planes were hopelessly lost. As it grew dark, communications with the planes slowly deteriorated. At 6:20 a Dumbo Flying Boat was dispatched to try and find the planes and guide them back. Within the hour two more planes, Martin Mariners, joined the search. The last transmission from the lost planes was heard at 7:04pm. The other planes searched the area throughout the night and into the next few days but no sign of the Avengers, nor was any wreckage ever found. They had vanished in the Bermuda Triangle.December 5, 1945 In the pieces titled What is Scientology? it states, “In 1945, left partially blind with injured optic nerves and lame from hip and back injuries, Mr. Hubbard was hospitalized at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California.” Finally, on this date, Lieutenant L. Ron Hubbard was mustered out of the Navy from too many undiagnosed pains. It has been written that “the doctors were undecided as to precisely what was wrong with him. He was certainly not blind nor crippled, but seemed to be suffering from endless minor aches and pains.”December 5, 1966 On this date the ashes of Dr. J. Irving Bentley, 92, of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, was discovered by a meter reader. Dr. Bentley’s body apparently ignited while he was in the bathroom and burned a 2-1/2-by-3-foot hole through the flooring, with only a portion of one leg remaining intact. Nearby paint was unscorched. This was a classic case of spontaneous human combustion.255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"December 6, 1495 Jacob Sprenger, co-author of the Malleus Malificarum, died on this date.December 6, 1890 Violet Mary Firth, also know as Dion Fortune, was born on this date in Llandudno, England. Her interest in occultism was sparked when she was working as a psychotherapist around the time of the First World War. Her first esoteric teacher was Dr. Theodore Moriarty who specialized in astro-etheric psychological conditions and who later provided the inspiration for her book The Secret of Doctor Taverner. Having found her ‘path’ in the Western Mystery Tradition she joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1919. She died of Leukaemia in January of 1946December 6, 1909 Aleister Crowley and Victor ‘Vickybird’ Neuburg went a few miles outside the town of Marrakhesh into the desert on this date and, as Neuburg later wrote, “we did not draw a circle, but a pentacle” to evoke Choronzon & the 10th Aethyr. It is well documented but the part of how the ritual ended borders on pure myth. The intent of this ritual was to hold a serious business conversation, but toward the end it seems Neuburg kept chirping in with questions of “a purely ostrobogulos nature” until Crowley became so enraged that he turned him into a zebra, rode him into Alexandria and sold him to the zoo, where he remained for two years before regaining human shape. As far as the demon Choronzon goes; within the original writings of John Dee this entity merely implies the serpent in the ‘Garden of Eden’ but when Aleister Crowley popularized this entity it became synonymous with the final evil dark obstacle of the Abyss, which separates the Second School from the Third on the Tree of Life. In an odd way the interpretations couldn’t be farther apart. If one believes in the Gnostic concept that the Serpent is, in truth, our true savior then one should embrace Choronzon as being good, while the other end of the spectrum Choronzon according to Crowley implies that the Serpent is the antipathy of Christian good, or baneful. It all depends upon how you see the ‘Serpent’ in the Garden.December 6, 1950 A UFO crashes outside El Indio-Guerrero area of the Texas-Mexican border. What remained of the object was said to have been almost completely incinerated.December 7, 1875 After the death of Eugene Vintras on this date in Lyons, Abbe Boullan, who was an unfrocked priest who had been imprisoned in Rome for heresy and in France for fraud, proclaimed himself the new Supreme Pontiff and the reincarnation of John the Baptist which he felt gave him the right to take over Vintras’ Church of Carmel. A schism soon ensued and Boullan, along with a few 256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"of his supporters, moved their Order from Paris to Lyons, a city that had retained some reputation for heretical sects going back to the days of Irenaeus.December 7, 1914 Kenneth Hopkins, poet and writer, was born in Bournemouth England on this date. In the late nineteen-forties he was known for wearing his hair extremely long for the period. He wrote that, “at least my moustache saves me from being called Madam by bus conductors,” which he states occasionally happened before he grew it. When Aleister Crowley died in 1947, Hopkins was one of the “long-haired devotees” described by the press present at his funeral. John Symonds has written that “he {Hopkins} had never met Crowley but he was an old friend of Louis Wilkinson.” Hopkins’ further supports this when he writes, “I wasn’t technically a devotee. I simply wanted to hear Louis Marlow read Crowley’s Hymn to Pan, which he did superbly. The wild and barbaric words echoed round the Crematorium, ‘Io. Pan! Pan!’ until I for one expected that ancient God to rise up through the floor.” Louis Wilkinson (alias Marlow) was a very good friend of Kenneth Hopkins, having met him in 1939 through a mutual friend named John Cowper Powys. Immediately after the funeral ceremony of Aleister Crowley at Brighton, Hopkins was walking back to town with Gerald Yorke when a reporter came up and asked a simple question. “Mr. Yorke, did you ever actually see Mr. Crowley perform magic?” Yorke replied “Oh, yes, countless times!” The reporter questioned, “What did he do?” With this, Yorke who was always fond of pulling reporters’ legs simply replied, “Oh, well, he was very fond of turning himself into a pillar of salt.” Also well worth repeating is Hopkin’s later account which shows his fear of Aleister Crowley even after death. He wrote that “one of the first things I do at night when I get home is take off my tie which (it seems) I then let fall wherever I chance to be. So the house is littered with ties, for I wear a different one most days. Some of these ties formerly belonged to Aleister Crowley, including one which in the end I gave to Ronnie Laws. This specimen was covered with magical symbols and I was afraid to wear it lest it strangled me.”December 7, 1995 On this date near Guanica, Puerto Rico there was an unusual bloodless death of chickens and cows attributed by the Chupacabra, or “Goat sucker.”December 8, 1868 The writer George Norman Douglas was born in Thurigen, Austria on this date. He received part of his school education at Karlsruhe in Germany, and in 1894 he entered the Foreign Office as a diplomat, serving in St. Petersburg Russia before taking early retirement to live on the island of Capri. He was a prolific author and a close friend of Nancy Cunard. In 1929 she witnessed Norman talking to Aleister Crowley on the phone. It seems Norman had just called the Beast and had begun his conversation, “Hullo you old b.....” .... “Haven’t seen 257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"you for a long time. How about a drink?” According to Nancy they both talked for quite awhile and Crowley’s comments “evoked a good deal of chuckling” on Norman’s part. She also remarked how she immediately beseeched Norman, “Get me the old rascal. What’s he up to now? Does he still wear that rediculous kilt?” It seems, according to Nancy that she had seen him dressed in a kilt at a Montmartre night-club at 2 a.m. “And there was that story about him ... Oh!just two little kittens that had got under his kilt and were playing some mysterious kind of pat-ball there ...” At to when Norman and Crowley had first met has always been a mystery but the “Italian years” which are always implied refer to Crowley’s days at Abbey at Cefalu and in reviewing Crowley’s diaries of this period there is a brief mention of Norman as being “a charming & plucky man. Norman died on 9 February 1952.December 8, 1872 Charles Henry Allan Bennett was born in London into poverty on this date. He was orphaned at an early age and was always racked by illness. He was educated at Hollowly College, and at Bath, England. He was also initiated into The Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn where he became known as Frater Yeti Amour - “Let there be light.” He always had a strong fascination for Buddhism and at the age of 28, in 1900, he decided to travel to Ceylon to further his studies and to relieve the asthma from which he had suffered for years. He became a pupil of yogi Sheri Paranoid who instructed him in Hath Yoga asana and Panorama and other meditation techniques. Later, while in Burma, he officially became a Buddhist monk, taking the name of Bike Amanda Mattie (“bliss of loving kindness”). He founded the International Buddhist Society in 1903. With health failing, his doctors suggested that he move to the warm climate of California. In route he stopped in England where his health and the events of World War I, forced him to stay. He never reached California. While in London he was befriended by playwright Clifford Box who helped him published The Buddhist Review to propagate the cause of Buddhism in Britain. He died on March 9th in 1923. He was only fifty years old.December 8, 1925 Sammy Davis, Jr. was born on this date in Harlem, New York.

Earlier in this very year he founded The Fountain of the World at 585 Box Canyon Road in Canoga Park, California. It was also known as the WKFL Foundation which stood for ‘Wisdom, Knowledge, Faith, and Love.’ He also changed his name to Krishna Venta. He even gave up his life of crime, which included everything from burglary, larceny and sending threatening letters to everyone who annoyed him from President Roosevelt on down, which ended him up in a mental hospital. Within his ‘new cult’ Krishna Venta claimed to be 244,000 years old, that he had arrived on Earth, supposedly, in 1932 at Mount Everest and further added that he would never die. Be that as it may, on this very date, December 10, 1958, former members of his cult, Ralph Muller and Peter Kamenoff, set off explosives killing themselves, Pencovic and several others at his compound. Krishna Venta is buried in Valhalla Memorial Park in Burbank, California. His grave is unmarked but near that of Oliver Hardy, of Laurel and Hardy fame.December 11, 1781 Sir Francis Dashwood, having been in ill health for some time, died on this date. He was buried beside his wife and parents in the family vault in St Lawrence’s church. His life has come down through the ages shrouded in controversy; bathed in half-truths and even more legends, making it now difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. He was an unashamed libertine, a gallant who reveled in every type of indulgence possible while dedicating his life to the worship of the old gods personified in Bacchus and Ariadne. He was the founder of the infamous The Hell Fire Club which met at night in his abbey for orgies, while mocking both the Christian church and the Devil. Their meetings were a celebration of life and all its indulgences, which they lived as the motto of the abbey dictated: “Do What You Will.” Sir Francis maintained this dictum right up to the end and never lost sight of his zest for life.December 12, 1531 It was on this date that the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to Juan Diego at the site of a former temple to the Aztec goddess Tonantzin. The story begins in 1523, or just two years after the Aztec capital of Tenochitlan had fallen to Hernán Cortés and his Conquistadors. This is when the first Roman Catholic missionaries arrived to begin the religious conquest of Mexico. Fray Bernadino de Sahagún and his fellow Franciscan brothers immediately immersed themselves in the intensive study of indigenous tongues along with the history, customs and religious practices of the Mexicans, whom they called Aztecs. Soon 259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"fluent in their language, the Franciscan proceeded to translate Christian religious texts into Aztec in order to teach the Christian doctrines. Among their first converts was a man baptized with the Christian name Juan Diego and shortly afterwards, as he was crossing the barren hill called Tepeyac to attend Mass. He was brought to a sudden halt by a blinding light and the sound of unearthly music. According to the legends, before him appeared an astounding vision; a beautiful dark-skinned woman who called the Indian “my son” and then declared, “I am the Entirely and Ever Virgin, Saint Mary.” In other words, she was the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. She told Juan Diego it was her desire to have a church built in her honor on Tepeyac hill, and asked him to relay that message to Bishop Juan de Zumarraga. Later, by order of the Bishop, a small church was constructed on the site designated by the Virgin.December 12, 1791 Jean Baptiste Alliette, more commonly known as Etteilla, died in France on this date at the age of 53. Some claim that Etteilla is the man directly responsible for making the Tarot and the Qabalah household words. He adopted the reverse spelling of his real name, Alliette, because it sounded more ‘mysterious. However, others have claimed the change was because his past was less than favorable and he didn’t want old ‘dirt to resurface’ which would have jeapordize him earning a living from astrology, Tarot and other occult sciences. In 1788 Etteilla published the first Tarot Deck designed specifically for esoteric reasons, which was made up of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana. He also founded the Society of Interpreters of the Book of Thoth in 1788, which was the very first organization known to be devoted exclusively to the study of Tarot. Etteilla’s legacy is a mixed one, many of the symbols he used between Tarot, astrology and elements on the cards have become unpopular in occult teachings and have been abandoned. Still, Etteilla was the first person to publish a book with a grammar and methodology for Tarot, titled Tarot Book of Thoth which sparked the popularization and the further study of the Tarot by other occultists. In the end, whether you agree with his teachings or not, he was still truly a pioneer in occult teachings and practices.December 12, 1882 Benjamin P. Williams was born on this date in Des Moines, Iowa. He later changed his name to Elbert Benjamine and then changed it again to C.C. Zain. Under this name he began publishing such books as The Sacred Tarot. His quest of the occult began in his youth when, at the age of 18, he found his way to The Brotherhood of Light where he studied a wide range of spiritual topics before becoming one of the organization’s leaders. In 1915 he moved to Los Angeles and began teaching a variety of subjects; ultimately incorporating such 260"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"into the organization that he founded called The Church of Light. He was one of the foremost astrologers of his time. He died in his late sixties on July 2, 1951. December 12, 1937 Aleister Crowley did a ritual at Cleopatra’s Needle on this date. The Daily Express of Thursday December 23, 1937 ran an article; “These Names Make News, Mixed Bag of Early Birds” by William Hickey, which is merely an alias used by the noted author Thomas Driberg. The article began; “An Englishman, a Jew, an Indian, a Negro, a Malayan - no, it’s not one of those saloon-bar jokes.” The article is about Crowley assembling a ‘mixed bag’ of people before Cleopatra’s Needle to announce the publication of his book, The Equinox of the Gods. December 12, 1964 On this date a French photographer named Robert Serrec was vacationing in Queensland, Australia. He was out in small row boats with his family and friends, in less than 6 feet of water, when they noticed a giant snake like creature lying on the ocean bottom. They describe it as a grayish tadpole like creature with a snake like head, approximately 75-80 feet long. There appeared to be a large wound on the creatures back. They took pictures of the creature before it became annoyed by their presence and swam off. December 12, 1996 An egg-shaped plaster image of the Madonna, about six inches high, had hung without incident for about a year in the trailer home of Thomas and Margarita Holguin in Lewis, Kansas. But in the pre-dawn hours on this date Margarita Holguin turned on the lights and saw what looked like tears dripping from the eyes of the statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The phenomenon lasted throughout the following day, and then the tears turned blood red. Mrs. Holguin, “I don’t know what to think about it all,” adding, “I have never seen anything like this before.” The phenomenon drew hundreds of people to visit the Holguins’ home. Ironically, December 12, the very day which Mrs. Holguin first noticed the tears, is the same day on which the appearance of the Guadalupe Virgin in Mexico in 1531 is commemorated. The Holguins’ pastor, Father William Vogel commented, “There is no doubt that there were tears, and it seemed as if blood was coming out of her eyes. I do not know what kind of natural explanation we can give to this.”December 13, 1890 Mary Butts was born on this date, she grew up in her family’s home at Salterns on the coast of Dorset, England.. She was the great granddaughter of Thomas Butts, patron and friend of William Blake.

However, they later broke up and she later married Gabriel Aiken, an alcoholic and a homosexual who also eventually left her. In the 1920s, while living between London and France, she partied excessively and lived a very wild life which shocked most of the people who knew her. She wrote six novels, three volumes of short stories, poetry, two pamphlet-length essays, and numerous reviews. Her most notable works are Ashe of Rings (1925), Armed with Madness (1928), Imaginary Letters (1928), The Death of Felicity Taverner (1932), The Macedonian (1933) and Scenes from the Life of Cleopatra (1935). She died at the age of forty-six at West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance on Match 8th 1937.December 13, 1973 On this date a French man named Claude Vorilhon claims that he was in a volcano near Clermont-Ferrand, France, when he saw a UFO. He says a radiant small human-shaped being with pale green skin and almond eyes emerged from the ship and took him aboard where he traveled to a distant planet of the Elohim. Here he introduced to Jesus, Buddha, Confucius and even Joseph Smith, where he was told that he was “the final prophet” and entrusted with a message that revealed the true origin of mankind. The human race was created from the DNA of aliens some 25,000 years ago and that the Earth was ‘created’ as an alien laboratory. Among other things, Claude Vorilhon learned that cloning is the way to immortality and there is no God or soul. According to him, our alien creators want us to be beautiful and sexy and to enjoy a sensuous life, free from the restrictions of traditional Judeo-Christian morality. They also told Claude Vorilhon that henceforth he would be known as Raël, which means “messenger.” His followers, called Raëlians. December 13, 1974 On this date John G. Bennett, while taking his daily walk through the grounds of Sherborne House, died at the age of 77. He had met Gurdjieff in 1921 while traveling in Turkey and he would later carry on where he left off. He is also the man responsible for letting the world know that Gurdjieff’s book Meeting With Remarkable Men was only an ‘allegory’ with little truth therein. Of the many books he wrote, most will remember Ennegram Studies, The Way To Be Free, The Dramatic Universe: Man and His Nature and volume two of this book called The Foundations of Moral Philosophy.December 14, 1503 Nostradamus, the French physician and astrologer who dabbled in prophecy, was born on this date in St. Remy, France His volume called the Centuries is a set of vague and often cataclysmic predictions set in quatrains.262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"December 14, 1995 On this date near Naguabo, on the east coast of Puerto Rico, several caged rabbits were “found dead with holes in the neck area, without a drop of blood.” Other rabbits had disappeared and near the rabbit cages were tracks with a three-toed claw, attributed to the Chupacabra, or “Goat sucker.” December 15, 1965 Somerset Maugham died on this date. In 1906, while in England, he wrote the novel titled The Magician but it would not be released until November of 1908. One of the main characters in this book was based on Aleister Crowley even though Maugham shared only a brief acquaintance with him. Maugham later wrote, “I do not remember how I came to think that Aleister Crowley might serve as the model for the character whom I called Oliver Haddo; nor, indeed, how I came to think of writing that particular novel at all ... though Aleister Crowley served, as I have said, as the model for Oliver Haddo, it is by no means a portrait of him. I made my character more striking in appearance, more sinister and more ruthless than Crowley ever was. I gave him magical powers that Crowley, though he claimed them, certainly never possessed.” Aleister Crowley bought the book in late November of 1908 when it first hit the stores. He wrote, “The title attracted me strongly, The Magician. The author, bless my soul! No other than my old and valued friend, William Somerset Maugham, my nice young doctor whom I remembered so well from the dear old days of the Chat Blanc ... Yes, I did myself proud, for the Magician, Oliver Haddo, was Aleister Crowley; his house ‘Skene’ was Boleskine. The hero’s witty remarks were, many of them, my own. He had, like Arnold Bennett, not spared his shirt cuff.”December 16, 1860 The English ‘witch’ James Murrell died on this date. He was born the seventh son of a seventh son and was known as ‘Cunning Murrell.’ He openly enjoyed a lucrative career as a white magician, healing and casting spells. Murrell often said that he was “the Devil’s Master” while claiming that he had the power to exorcise spirits and overcome witchcraft by counter-spells. Murrell was a secretive man, he traveled only at night, and always carried an umbrella with him regardless of the weather. On December 15, 1860, the day before he died, Murrell accurately predicted the time of his death to the minute. He is buried in an unmarked grave in Hadleigh churchyard.December 16, 1917 Arthur C. Clarke was born on this date in Minehead, England. He wrote Childhood’s End, which went on to become one of most popular and acclaimed science fiction novels of all time. He also wrote the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, based on his own short story The Sentinel.

As for Phillip, he dropped out of the University of California before getting a degree and began writing. By 1968 he had published almost thirty books, like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. He became a prolific writer, admittedly on methamphetamines and LSD. Then, on March 22, 1974, Philip K. Dick had a transcendental mystical experience which he described as “an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind.” This experience caused him to begin recording his thoughts and experiences into a journal, which he referred to as the Exegesis. The Exegesis contained a phenomenal amount of religious thought and philosophy which inevitably formed the basis for his Valis trilogy. Sadly, Philip K. Dick died of heart failure following a stroke on March 2nd, 1982 in Santa Ana, California. December 17, 1848 William Wynn Westcott was born on this date. He was a dedicated physician, public servant and Coroner for North East London and author of several medical texts. An active Freemason, he is best remembered for having founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (HOGD) with Samuel Liddel MacGregor Mathers and Dr. William Woodman, sometime before February 12, 1888. This was not a Masonic society but attracted many Freemasons of the day. From 1892 he administered the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), leaving the Golden Dawn, and its contentious members, to Mathers. After 1910, Westcott had no further involvement with the Golden Dawn. He died on July 30, 1925 December 17, 1917 Grigori Rasputin died on this date. He was known as the “mad monk.” He was a wandering peasant and self-styled holy man, who became a favorite of Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra in 1905 after he laid hands on their son Alexis and apparently healed the boy of hemophilia. Rasputin was soon a fixture in the royal household and a particular confidante to Alexandra. Wild-eyed and unkempt, Rasputin was strangely charismatic and his personal magnetism was legendary; at the same time his bouts of drinking, womanizing, and wild behavior created a scandal in Russian society. He was finally killed in 1917 by a cabal of aristocrats who feared Rasputin’s influence had grown too great. Rasputin’s death became the stuff of legend: assassins fed him enough poisoned cakes and wine to kill ten, and when the poison failed to kill Rasputin they shot him and beat him. Still Rasputin didn’t die, until finally the men bound him and tossed him into the Neva River, where, after his body had been recovered, the autopsy showed that he drowned.264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"December 17, 1960 It was on this date that Carlos Castaneda, a graduate student in anthropology doing research on medicinal plants used by Indians of the Southwest, visited the home of a Yaqui Indian named Don Juan in Arizona, for the first time. Shortly afterwards Don Juan made Castaneda a sorcerer’s apprentice and introduced him to the world of peyote and visions; where he would learn the art of a diablero, or a sorcerer with the ability to shape shift. However, although most people believe that what Castaneda wrote was truly brilliant and entertaining, they also argue that it is hardly factual. December 18, 1866 Karl Maria Wilgut was born on this date in Vienna, Austria. He was a seer throughout his life and his history of schizophrenia, which involved megalomania and paranoid delusions, was the basis for him being ruled insane. In 1933, after he had become ‘sane’ and was released, Wilgut was chosen by Heinrich Himmler to be his private Magus and councilor on magickal and religious subjects, because of his “clairvoyant knowledge of the ancient Germanic past.” He has been called the ‘Rasputin to Himmler.’ It was Wilgut who established Wewelsburg Castle as the ceremonial centre of the SS. Directly after the war Wilgut suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, with loss of speech. He was permitted to journey to his elected homeland where he was again hospitalized, in Salzburg and died on January 3, 1946. December 18, 2003 Charles Frambach Berlitz died on this date at University Hospital in Tamarac at the age of 90. He was a noted author of many popular books on unexplained phenomena. He is to be credited with internationally popularizing the phenomena known today as the Bermuda Triangle, due in large part to a book he wrote thirty years ago. He wrote such books as The Mystery of Atlantis (1969), Mysteries of the Forgotten World (1970), The Bermuda Triangle (1974), The Philadelphia Experiment (1979) and The Roswell Incident (1980), to name but a few.December 19, 1934 This was the last appearance of the freak Prince Randian who was born without all his limbs in British Guyana, South America in 1871. He was brought to America before the turn of the century by legendary showman P. T. Barnum who billed him as “The Human Caterpillar”, “The Living Torso” or “The Human Worm.” Prince Randian, a Hindu, was said to possess a quiet sense of humor and was able to speak Hindu, English, German and French. His personal philosophy was that no physical handicap need matter if the mind is dominant. He was able to write, paint, shave and roll his own cigarettes using only his tongue and mouth, the latter feat is demonstrated in the film Freaks Prince Randian’s only 265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"dialogue in the film is almost indecipherable, but he apparently remarks to one of the Rollo brothers, “Can you do anything with your eyebrows?” During the carnival’s off-season, Prince Randian resided in Patterson, New Jersey with his devoted wife and several children.

He collapsed and died shortly after at the age of 63.December 20, 1891 Dr. William Robert Woodman died on this date. He was a General practitioner and police surgeon, his greatest interests were gardening and Freemasonry. He was initiated into the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA) in October 1867 and he succeeded R. W. Little as its Supreme Magus in 1878. Woodman was a founder of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (HOGD) with Samuel Liddel MacGregor Mathers and William Wynn Westcott, sometime before February 12, 1888. He was born in 1828.

He calls himself a psychic and is most famous for his claims to be able to bend spoons, keys and other objects with his mind. He claimed that he had visions and that he may have gotten his powers from extraterrestrials. He has sued several people for millions of dollars for calling him a fraud but has lost all the lawsuits. His arch critic has been magician James “The Amazing” Randi, has written a book and numerous articles aimed at demonstrating that Geller is an outright fraud, that he has no psychic powers and that what Geller does amounts to little no more than the parlor tricks of a stage magician.December 20, 1968 The infamous Zodiac Killer, California’s most elusive serial killer, began his killing spree on this date in Vallejo; by slaying 16 year old Betty Lou Jensen and then her date, 17 year old David Faraday. Although others point out his spree really began two years earlier in October of 1966 but this is debatable. The Zodiac killer claimed he chose his victims based on their astrological signs.

His major work was A Dance to the Music of Time (1951-1975), a series of 12 novels in which the experiences of the narrator Nicholas Jenkins, a writer, are contrasted with those of a ruthless political opportunist named Kenneth Widmerpool. The tone grows more somber and haunting as they age and society changes. Powell’s autobiography, To Keep the Ball Rolling, was published in four volumes between 1977 to 1983. His literary criticisms were published in the volumes Miscellaneous Verdicts (1992) and Under Review (1994). His earliest recollection of Aleister Crowley occurred when he was a young child in 1911. It was a story his mother had told him. It begins with her waiting for a train to take her to a luncheon on the outskirts of London. “At the station my mother noticed getting into one of the compartments a man whose appearance made her feel a sudden sense of extreme repulsion. At her destination, this man reappeared on the platform. She found herself almost praying that he would not be her fellow-guest at the luncheon. Needless to say he was. It was the magician, Aleister Crowley.” When Anthony asked his mother what they talked about during the luncheon, she simply replied, “Horrors.” Anthony Powell died in 2000.December 21, 1995 On this date, at about 3 o’clock in the morning near Guanica, Puerto Rivo, 44-year-old Osvaldo Claudio Rosado thought it was a good time to be out washing his car. He was wrong. Something grabbed him from behind. He tried to fight off the intruder and claimed to have seen a black-haired “gorilla” about five feet tall as it ran off toward the woods. Rosado had cuts in his abdomen, possibly torn by fingernails or claws. He had survived the Chupacabra, or “Goat sucker.” December 21, 1995 Near Klamath Falls, Oregon on this date a pregnant heifer was found dead with her right ear gone, its hide cut from her face, her tongue sliced lengthwise along the top of the teeth, all four teats removed leaving black circles on the surface of the udder, and the rectum and vagina were cut out in a neat “keyhole” cut. There was absolutely no blood around any of the excisions or on the ground.December 22, 1581 The Elizabethan magician John Dee began working with his first ‘medium’ on this date. His name was Barnabas Saul and although it is said that they saw many visions, Saul would later deny everything and claim that he made it all up.December 22, 1939 At 6:06pm on this date, Aleister Crowley released his pamphlet titled Temperance.267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"December 22, 1942 At 11:31am on this date, Aleister Crowley released his pamphlet titled The Fun of the Fair.December 23, 1805 Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church, was born on this date in Sharon, Vermont, to Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph Smith Jr. He grew up on a series of tenant farms in Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York. It is a well-known fact that Joseph Smith read the magical treatise by Francis Barrett called The Magus (1801). From this he learned how to use a ‘crystal’ in order to obtain angelic visions. However, at first, he predominantly sought buried treasure and missing items. All this information came to light when historians realized that Joseph Smith was arrested as a fraudulent ‘glass looker’ and was found guilty in Bainbridge, NY in 1826. Court records clearly state that Joseph Smith, “had a certain stone which he had occasionally looked at to determine where hidden treasures in the bowels of the earth were.” Then, in 1823, Joseph Smith said that he was visited by an angel named Moroni, who told him about an ancient record containing God’s dealings with the former inhabitants of the American continent. How the Angel appeared, whether it was in person or in the crystal, has long been debated. In 1827, Joseph Smith supposedly retrieved these ancient records, which were inscribed on thin golden plates, and shortly afterward he began translating its words by the “gift of God.” The resulting manuscript, known as The Book of Mormon, was published in March 1830. After which he re-buried the golden plates. On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith organized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and became its first president. Sadly, Joseph Smith was persecuted much of his adult life and was killed along with his brother Hyrum by a mob in Carthage, Illinois, on June 27, 1844. Arguably there are two ways to look at Joseph Smith’s life. You can either view him as a fraud and an opportunist who shamelessly exploited his religious followers, who was murdered by an angry mob, infuriated by all his crazy beliefs, or, if you are a Mormon, he is the greatest man who ever lived. December 23, 1887 Rev. A. F. A. Woodford died on this date. He was the person who had found the original ‘Golden Dawn Cipher Manuscripts’ in a cupboard where Kenneth Mackenzie, a leading Masonic figure of his time, had stored them before his death. Woodford later showed the manuscripts to Dr. Westcott, due to Westcott’s reputation as being a scholar of ancient lore. He realized that the cipher used in the manuscripts was similar to that used in the 15th century by Abbott Trithemius to encode some of his writings. He then began to translate the manuscripts and soon discovered it contained a series of five condensed Masonic ritualistic grade initiations. Westcott then commissioned S.L.

Later Aleister Crowley would write that Jones “...tried to improve the Tree of Life by turning the Serpent of Wisdom upside down! Yet he could not even make his scheme symmetrical: his little remaining good sense revolted at the supreme atrocities. Yet he succeeded in reducing the whole Magical Alphabet to nonsense, and showing that he had never understood its real meaning.”December 24, 1973 It was predicted that the ‘Christmas Comet’ known properly as Kohoutek, was to destroy the Earth on this date.

Needless-to-say, Crowley was proud of the fact that he proved the superstition was not true. Yes, boys will be boys. December 25, 1890 LeRoy Ripley was born on this date in Santa Rosa, California. Robert L. Ripley’s Believe It Or Not! cartoon panel was a staple of American newspapers in the first half of the 20th century. The cartoon featured true-life oddities from around the globe, always with the tagline “Believe It... Or Not!” Ripley’s first such cartoon appeared in the New York Globe in 1918. As his readership grew Ripley began traveling abroad to find tidbits for his cartoon; he became famous as a globe-trotting adventurer, eventually claiming visits to 198 different countries. The cartoon’s success spawned radio and TV shows, books and museums which continued into the 21st century. He died of a heart attack on May 27, 1949.December 25, 1900 Adolf Josef Lanz (Liebenfels) claimed that it was on this date, on Christmas, that he founded the Order of the New Templars.

The world knows him as the television writer Rod Serling; inextricably linked to The Twilight Zone.December 25, 1925 Carlos Aranha was born on this date in born in Cajamarca, Peru, although he told his wife he was born in 1931 to ‘appear to be younger.’ He also changed his last name to Casteneda in 1959 when he became a U. S. citizen. He was also the best-selling author of a number of books, like Journey to Ixtlan, which deals with a Mexican Yaqui shaman, named Don Juan Matus, and his pharmacologically induced visions. However, a friend of Castaneda at UCLA declared, “I believe Carlos Castaneda is the greatest psychic fraud of the 20th century.”December 25, 1943. It was a cold Christmas. One of those typically snowy English winter days which found Grady McMurtry in Aleister Crowley’s apartment at 93 Jermyn Street enjoying a nice dinner. Afterwards, as they were sitting talking and playing chess, there came “a raucous noise at the door.” Crowley looked up saying; “I wonder what in the world that is?” He slowly got up out of his chair and walked toward the door. Opening it, he found four young English boys engaging in the British festivity of caroling on Christmas Day. It was customary to continue caroling until given money for the service. Crowley, not amused, did what most of us have probably always wanted to do. He slammed the door in their faces, screaming at the top of his lungs “To the lions with them! To the lions with them!” Not surprisingly, that day the kids went away not a penny richer. Whenever Grady told this story, he always joked, “That’s the Aleister Crowley I knew.” December 26, 1891 Henry Miller was born on this date in Manhattan, New York. He was the author of such famous works as Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn and The Rosy Crucifixion, to name just a few. Like many individuals he had a brief encounter with Aleister Crowley. It is believed that Henry met the Great Beast through the French astrologer Conrad Moricand in 1933. His friend, Anais Nin, has stated in a chapter simply titled “November 2, 1934” from her book Incest, that “Henry has fallen under the spell of a remarkable old man {Aleister Crowley} who is fantastic and psychic, a painter gone mad in Zurich.” In a letter to his childhood friend Emil Schnellock written in October of 1935, Henry Miller 270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"included a short but interesting story describing an event which took place between him and Crowley.

Later, the woman found her Siamese cat dead with the genitals removed, two guinea hens with their throats slit, a chicken with “perforations,” and four ducks and four rabbits dead in their cages. Obviously she had been visited by the Chupacabra, or “Goat sucker.” On the same day, near San German, eleven goats were found dead.December 27, 1959 Gerina Dunwich, Wiccan author, was born on this date in Illinois, Gerina. She was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older cousin in the Summer of 1969. She later moved to Southern California in the Spring of 1977, where she began doing research for a book called The Lexicon of the Occult (1990). December 27, 1962 Wilbert B. Smith died on this date. He was the leading scientist, he was appointed head of the Canadian government’s Project Magnet in 1950; the project was designed to investigate Flying Saucers, which were taken seriously by the Canadians at that time. But the idea of visitors from outer space was ridiculed by the press, and unsympathetic officials shelved the project four years later. Smith claimed to have received telepathic messages from UFOs. He aided UFO groups in their researches; he analyzed the famous “Ottawa chunk” and found traces of “oddities” indicating that it was perhaps dumped from a UFO.December 28, 1877 Georgii Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, a teacher, mystic, and philosopher, was born on this date in Alexandropol in Russian Armenia to a Greek father and Armenian mother.

He has written such books as Stealing the Fire from Heaven, Squeezing Being, Sorcery as Virtual Mechanics, Nemesis & Other Essays and Sixteen Essays on Magick and the Politics it Implies. It has often been stated that modern Chaos Magic is founded on the works of two magicians; Aleister Crowley and Austin Spare and Steve Mace’s books clearly demonstrates this point.December 29, 1992 Ann Livingston made her living as an accountant, but she was also a UFO investigator and writer or MUFON and had in fact, published an article entitled Electronic Harassment and Alien Abductions in the November 1993 MUFON Journal.

McKinney totally regards the UFO phenomena as merely a ploy to cover up experimental machinery or experimental psychology.

December 30, 1552 Simon Forman, physician, astrology and necromancer, was born on this date at Qusdham, a small village near Wilton, Wiltshire. He was an Elizabethan occultist, and ‘alternative’ medical practitioner in London. Many considered him a quack physician and surgeon, who often spent time in jail for occult practices and prescribing dangerous potions. All this being said, the London people held him in high regard, mainly because he bravely stayed in London during a plague outbreak, and supposedly even cured himself and others of the disease. The extensive records of his life, including his many occult experiments are held in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Oddly, he prophesied his own death the week before it occurred, or so his wife claimed. On the day of his death, a Thursday in September 1611, he keeled over in his boat whilst crossing the Thames saying, “Am impost, an impost” before dying. His death was also documented by another astrologer of that time, William Lilly.December 30, 1886 Austin Osman Spare, a brilliant artist, philosopher and occult magician, was born on this date in London. His father was a policeman who often worked the night shift and even though money was in short supply, when the young Spare began to show an unusual propensity for drawing and art, they managed to find enough funds to send him to art school. At the age of seven Spare was befriended by a mysterious old women, a sorceress by the name of Mrs. Patterson, whom it was said could change her appearance from that of an old women to that of a young temptress at will. Spare would later refer to this woman as his second mother, his ‘Witch-mother.’ She taught him how to visualize and evoke spirits and elementals to reify his dream imagery and initiated him into witchcraft during a sabbat meeting and gave him his craft name called ‘Zos.’ In the 1950s Spare began working on a definitive Grimoire called the Zos Kia Cultus, which was to contain the accumulation of his magical secrets. Austin Osman Spare died in May of 1956, his Grimoire left unfinished.December 30, 1947 On this date Major General L. C.

On this particular date, being the biggest hunting meet of the season, he challenged a neighbor to a race. Half way through the race, and discovering that he was obviously going to lose, Sydney pulled out his pistol and shot his opponent’s horse which caused the rider to be thrown, breaking his neck and killing him instantly. Since no gun was ever found, no charges were filed but everyone knew who fired the shot and even more damaging to Sydney was that he supposedly disappeared shortly afterwards. That is when the legends began; telling stories of how later that very evening after the race, while Sydney was sitting down at the table for dinner, a tall, thin stranger appeared and at the Old Hall, dragged him outside to a waiting horse, threw him across his saddle and galloped off into the darkness. Now, according to the same legend, every year on the 31st of December, the same scene is repeated as the “ghostly stranger” rides upon Old Hall.December 31, 1884 George Sylvester Viereck, noted writer, poet and propagandist was born in Munich Germany on this date. His family emigrated to New York in 1896. He was the author of many books; Nineveh and Other Poems (1907), Confessions of a Barbarian (1910), The Candle and the Flame (1912), Glimpses of the Great (1930), My Flesh and Blood (1931), The Kaiser on Trial (1937) and The Temptation of Jonathan (1938), to name but a few. In 1912 Viereck established The International, a monthly literary magazine of the avant garde, as well as conventional, poets and writers. Its office was located at 1123 Broadway in New York City. At the outset of World War I, in August of 1914, Viereck launched a new publication called The Fatherland. The goal of this weekly magazine was to publicize the German point of view in order to counteract the onslaught of propaganda coming out of England and France. Most important, it was trying to promote the idea of American neutrality. Aleister Crowley met Viereck in 1911. He would later work for him at The International and The Fatherland. It also appears that Viereck knew all about Crowley’s “devil worship” but it didn’t bother him. As he put it, “I knew nothing against him. I do not object to devil worship and I think that a man’s personal life is his own. Hence, any rumors against him which may have reached me had no effect.” George Sylvester died at the age of 77 on March 18, 1962 as a result of a massive cerebral hemorrhage.274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"December 31, 1896 On this date Aleister Crowley claims that he officially decided to pursue mysticism and occultism.December 31, 1922 Rudolf Steiner’s Goetheanum in Switzerland was burned down on this date by an arsonist.
