Gerald Yorke wrote the entries and descriptions foritems with the prefix OS, denoting Old Series. The NS series entries were prepared by theWarburg Institute for the large New Series accession donated by the Yorke family afterGerald Yorke’s death in 1983.In order to faciilitate research in subject areas, the papers are arranged topically rather thanby catalog number into a series of films with one or more reels. Film 4 is a supplementaryfilm of letters, fiction, poetry, criticism, drama, and essays; these miscellaneous paperswere filmed separately as the organization of materials within the original bindersdid not fall easily into the subject areas of other films. In Film 2, a few items were onlypartially filmed in order to omit material pertaining to Ordo Templi Orientis that was notintended for publication; these are annotated “edited” in their titles. Some cross-references to catalogue locators in the Yorke Collection refer to items not inthis microfilm publication, which includes about half of the papers in the collection.A few notes by Gerald Yorke indicate that some items were on loan to the Yorke Collec-tion from Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). These notes are retained to give provenance,but such items are now permanent gifts to the Yorke Collection.Editorial notes in square brackets are by the staff of the Warburg Institute, many of whichreproduce incidental notes by Gerald Yorke. Notes in curled braces are by the present edi-tor.
