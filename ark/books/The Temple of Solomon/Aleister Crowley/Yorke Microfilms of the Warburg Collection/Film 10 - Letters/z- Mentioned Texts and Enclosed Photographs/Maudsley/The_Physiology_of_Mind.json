featuresof his body,containingthe historyof whathe had willed,wouldbefoundto be an excellentrecordof character,couldwebut acquirethe skill to interpretthe symbolsaccurately.If one wererequiredto

fromaffinitiesdevelopedin it in consequenceof educationor of the particularpursuitin life.Afterthis had beenassumed,the requisiteconditionsmightbedeclaredto be these: first,the excitationof the

probablefromthesecircumstances—thatthereis a moreactivecirculationofbloodthroughthe brainduringfunctionthan whenit is inrepose,and that the effectof fixingthe attentionuponapartof the bodyis
