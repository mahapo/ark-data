[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"AU BAL To Horace Sheridan-Bickers A VISION of flushed faces, shining limbs, The Madness of the music that entrances All life in its delirium of dances ! The white world glitters in the void, and swims Through infinite seas of transcendental trances. Yea ! all the hoarded seed of all my fancies Bursts in a shower of suns ! The wine-cup brims And bubbles over ; I drink deep the hymns Of sorceries, of spells, of necromancies And all my spirit shudders ; dew bedims My sight—these girls and their alluring glances ! Their eyes that burn like dawn’s lascivious lances Waking all earth to love—to love ! Life skims The cream of joy. If God could see what man sees, (Intoxicating Nellies, Mauds, and Nances !) I see Him leave the sapphirine expanses, The choir serene and the celestial air To swoon into their sacramental hair ! "}]
