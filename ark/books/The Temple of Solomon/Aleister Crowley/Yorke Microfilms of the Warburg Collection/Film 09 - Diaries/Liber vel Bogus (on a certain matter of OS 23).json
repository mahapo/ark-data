Between noon and 1PM on 08, 09 & 10 April 1904 a supernatural herald allegedly manifested in the Cairo apartment of infamous Victorian Satanist, Edward Alexander Crowley. The praeterhuman entity, named Aiwass, proclaimed the onset of a new epoch for Mankind, dictated the three chapters of Liber L. vel Legis (Book of the Law), and appointed Crowley as figurehead of a New World Religion (Thelema) and sole terrestrial confidante of Horus, the supreme deity of a New Aeon. In short, Crowley was the new Jesus and Liber L. vel Legis represented a New Covenant with God – A contemporary Bible and ‘one-size-fits-all’ global rulebook valid for the next two thousand years. The Age of Aquarius had dawned, with The Great Beast 666 at its helm. On this outlandish claim rests the life, legacy and reputation of Aleister Crowley. On this slender bough hangs the spiritual authority of his New World Religion, Thelema. On this fantastical assertion dangles a global publishing industry, the faith of aficionados and converts across the globe, and the very raison d’être of (c)O.T.O. Inc. - Legal guardians of Crowley’s literary & artistic legacy and high priests of his Magickal construct. On the scaffold of those three pivotal days is suspended the ultimate historical fate of Aleister Crowley – Madman or messiah, seer or psycho! If my observations are correct, then everything written about (and by) the Great Beast 666 is subject to fundamental reappraisal. My study, as it appeared on 01 December 2013."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"B - Of Future Days Passed I am not an occultist and intensely skeptical of almost all ‘supernatural’ literature and its hyperbolic claims. Nevertheless, with reference to this work and the multiplicity of bizarre synchronicities that occurred during its preparation, I am unable to shake an unsettling conviction that ‘the Magickal essence of Aleister Crowley guided my footsteps every step of the way’ – Whatever those words mean. In releasing this material, I have created a monster that will hang like an albatross around my neck for the remainder of my life. Liber L. vel Bogus is a book that nobody wants to hear of, read, or, God forbid, actually be right! Somewhat paradoxically, it will attract interested parties with an allure equal and opposite to its force of repulsion. Ultimately, each will loathe it, on principle, in direct proportion to the spiritual, psychological, emotional and financial investment made in brand Crowley. Aleister Crowley faked his own suicide. He lied about burning his passport, and fabricated his ancestry. He spent his entire life hiding behind an elaborate façade of alter-egos, costumes, aliases and pen-names. Given this, and myriad other questionable character traits, I am perplexed in the extreme that some remain unable and unwilling to consider a possibility that Crowley’s account of his reception of Liber L. may not represent the unexpurgated and literal truth. For the benefit of unfortunates afflicted with acute and terminal cases of ‘Crow-Blindness,’ I offer this crumb of comfort - Liber L. vel Bogus does not exist. It is a spoof, a joke, a hoax and a phantasm of my imagination. Its publication and distribution are a mirage. Crowley received a new Law for Mankind, precisely as stated. Go ask Aiwass! "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"C – Talk of a backlash! Since news of this publication first surfaced, speculation regarding its content has gurgled within occult, Crowley and Thelemic communities. Heated debate relating to various ‘issues’ allegedly raised has echoed uneasily around online forums. Most of the e-mail I receive these days routinely includes probing questions and jocular references to the prevalent ambience of trepidation surrounding my “heresy,” “blasphemy” and “treason.” From the outset, I accepted that my findings would meet with a certain degree of caution and reticence. However, during the course of various correspondences it became increasingly clear that a virulent strain of what I can only describe as ‘instinctive aversion’ infects many aficionados and apologists of Aleister Crowley. Questions regarding Crowley’s reception of Liber L. vel Legis are nothing new. The Cornelius’, David Hulse and others have aired a multiplicity of perplexing anomalies. Yet, in the absence of conclusive proof, Crowleyites habitually bend over backwards in giving their messiah the benefit of doubt. On consideration of this frustrating trait, I came to realise that the evident disinclination to look at certain unsavoury facts relates not to the inconvenience of compelling a recalibration of one’s intellectual estimation of a historical figure. At its heart, the unease foreshadows a dread of the emotional, psychological and spiritual turmoil inherent within exposure – A self-defence mechanism enabling countless individuals (for years and even decades) to ‘look away’ from circumstantial evidence left by an unfaithful partner, rather than manifest the raw ego-shattering carnage of confrontation, betrayal and separation. The anomalies discussed in this publication comprise nothing more than a preliminary account of observations made during the study of an incomplete record. In short, its content merely scratches the surface of a very deep mystery. Much of which remains concealed. Nevertheless, these discrepancies are also, I believe, ample to convince any sane and reasonable person as to the bogus nature of Crowley’s claim. However, as I have learned in recent months, questions regarding the reception of Liber L. vel Legis slice through superficial layers of intellect and rationale, and penetrate into the deepest roots of belief systems – Dangerous territory indeed! I am primarily a researcher. My sole motive is that of discovering the truth, however unpalatable to a minority whose lives seem wholly reliant on the words of their saviour. However distasteful to those who, in private correspondence and public forums, speak as if acting in the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"capacity of Crowley’s solicitor. However unthinkable to those who for too long have looked the other way and ‘veiled his vices behind their virtuous words,’ and however damaging to the reputation of anyone who willfully buried evidence beneath a lucrative deception. Ignorance is the enemy of truth. The single greatest obstacle obscuring the facts of this matter is a scarcity of primary source material – Crowley’s original notebooks, diaries and correspondence. Whilst these remain veiled, misinformation, misdirection, hidden agendas, greed and duplicity will prevail. I sincerely believe it is the responsibility and duty of each individual to obtain copies of, then study the relevant documents, and form conclusions based on first-hand research. Accept nothing I or anyone else says at face value. Check everything with your own eyes. With reference to questions raised by this publication, and others, I feel that the legal guardians of Crowley’s legacy are encumbered with a duty to make public all documentation and information knowingly in its possession. Moreover, that they should routinely oblige all reasonable requests for access to material that may assist in the clarification of a mystery central to all with an interest in the life and legacy of Aleister Crowley. I am confident to suggest that any material uncovered following the publication of this book will support, and not refute my hypothesis. Conversely, I am happy to incorporate new information into subsequent editions of Liber L. vel Bogus, even if this highlights erroneous deductions on my part. I would not see this as ‘a defeat,’ and quite the reverse. My desire is solely that of definitively resolving an elephant in the room that has dogged Crowley’s footsteps for over a century. My stance with respect to this matter remains unequivocally one of full and forthright disclosure – Release everything, now! At its inception, I envisaged this work as nothing more than a slender compendium detailing enough of the AL-related oddities and curios I’d amassed over the years as to demonstrate, beyond reasonable doubt, that Aleister Crowley did not scribe the Liber L. manuscript between noon and 1PM, on 08, 09 and 10 April, 1904 - End of story! That the material presented herein is three years beyond its original release date, and requiring of two volumes, offers a telling insight into the complexity and depth of this enigma. When inspected, each discrepancy revealed a hitherto concealed layer, which in turn hinted alluringly at still deeper connections. Most intriguing of all was the gradual emergence of an entirely different genesis for Liber L..

The preparation of Liber L. vel Bogus was unquestionably the most demanding project I have ever undertaken. Throughout, it tested the limits of my mental faculties, tolerance, credulity and even health, to breaking point and beyond. At times, each passing week and day manifested a further development, more questions, and a pressing need to incorporate new material. By Christmas 2012, I had already sidestepped three deadlines and was increasingly concerned that I had started a project that would never end, and one already bulging at the seams of its original format. By the autumn of 2013, in the aftermath of the two seismic events described below and accompanying ramifications, all notions of a foreseeable completion date vanished over the horizon. Both instances had a direct and significant bearing on this work and, therefore, were demanding of inclusion. However, in the back of my mind lurked a niggling question: “In the time taken to incorporate Fs, Ks and an Appendix, who knows what other issues will have stacked up?” Rather perversely, on reaching the point at which I earnestly believed that work on this book probably would continue indefinitely... it ended - Abruptly, if not altogether unexpectedly."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Between then and now, fate ehe circuitous route by which a crude plot devised to wrest control of the et’s be honest, here...

All considerations regarding the further refinement of this ‘challenging’ material into a more easily-accessible format (not precluding the possibility of a complete rewrite) are also at an end.

As is the ‘true’ nature of the cathartic revelation gleaned by Crowley during an experimental honeymoon ‘ménage à trois.’ For over a century, the actualities of this immensely important period in Crowley’s life remained obscured by a collective aversion to look beyond the Holy smokescreen of glittering contradictions Crowley projected onto his mythology, and our expectations. It is time to wake up and smell the Thelema! La praeterhuman entity who forgets a verse of the Bible! – An error Crowley subsequently corrected, with a note pencilled on the handwritten Liber L. manuscript (III, 37). That Aiwass’ monumental blunder went unnoticed until (to the best of my knowledge) I mentioned it on www.lashtal.com several years ago is perhaps indicative of the complacency, or denial, endemic within Thelemic communities.

He alone noticed a small yet monumentally significant development in the core operating system of our species, correlated this with the imminent birth of a “New Aeon,” and predicted global changes that, since September 2007, have rocked our world to its foundations. Crowley was not merely the prophet of a new epoch, but actually precipitated the onset of a ‘Magickal Current’ that will shape our world for the next two thousand years.

Inc.. Buried at the bottom of this lengthy epistle, in a section innocuously titled “Archival News,” lurked a ticking bomb – A decision to change one letter of Crowley’s “Change not as much as the style of a letter” new Bible, Liber L. vel Legis. With hindsight, time has revealed Breeze’s announcement as a matchless example of shooting yourself in the foot with a bazooka! The spectacular manner in which his decision backfired must surely categorise it as an act of self-harm, rather than a literary announcement. In the eyes of most, Breeze’s changing of one letter most definitely did not constitute merely the ‘resolution of a longstanding textual difference,’ as stated. Rather, it was widely perceived as analogous to the Pope declaring a change in the wording of the sixth Commandment, from “Thou shalt not kill,” to “Thou shalt not fill.” As word of this inflammatory edit raced around the Internet, forum “I was not, however, quite prepared for what arrived: the book includes several early comments on verses of Liber Legis (a few of boards quickly mired in conjecture, debate, argument, and even abject condemnation. In addition to questions concerning Hymenaeus Beta’s legitimacy to make the change, at all, it quickly emerged that his basis for initiating “a very important text correction” was highly contentious.

This prompted the usually aloof Breeze into an unprecedented and protracted defence of his change (documentation at www.oto.org/legis.html). As the hand played out, it became increasingly clear that Breeze made his decision to change a ‘Commandment’ with almost reckless disregard for research, or consultation. He evidently made the ‘f-k’ swap in ignorance of numerous sources that greatly diminished his argument – Documents that were readily available, had he looked. He also failed to solicit (or heed) advice from individuals whose knowledge may well have alerted him to material contradicting the proposed “text correction.” To many, evBchange, based seemingly on nothing more substantial than the appearance of a single letter ‘k’ pencilled in the margin of a book, seemed bewildering."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Especially as the issue is complicated further by a devilish quirk of fate in which the offending letter is part of a pencil note scribbled onto the Liber L. manuscript at some point after its original creation – A note which itself refers to the content of a “now-lost vellum notebook.” Interestingly, two of Breeze’s three points refer to a vellum notebook: s matters currently stand, I think it reasonable to suggest that ‘The n a personal note, I feel that amidst the flurry of documentation raised (1) “...the versification of the Stèle of Revealing from a now-lost vellum notebook” and (2) “... giving directions for the extent of the quotation to be inserted from a contemporary [with Cairo, 1904] vellum notebook...” The phrasing of these points is ambiguous. Are the terms “a now-lost vellum notebook” and “a contemporary vellum notebook” two mentions of the same notebook, or individual references to different items? Despite clumsy wording, the two points serve to remind readers of an incident familiar to all with an interest - i.e. whilst in Cairo (April 1904), Crowley wrote a versification of the Stele of Revealing in at least one vellum notebook. To this confirmation is affixed an additional snippet stating that the notebook is no longer extant - A regrettable, though ultimately inconsequential loss. AWindram K’ is certainly worthy of a detailed footnote in subsequent editions of the text in question, but not a change in the text itself. The question lingering in many minds is not “Why was the change made on such flimsy evidence?” but “Why was it made, at all?” Prior to 10 April 2013, nobody gave a second thought to this “longstanding textual difference.” Then, at a stroke, Hymenaeus Beta transformed a formerly inconsequential niggle into a raging tempest that split Thelemic communities down the middle, manifested untold acrimony, and resurrected longstanding, often bitter differences – Why? Oby this inflammatory issue, one page in particular encapsulates the whole situation – Between 1919 and 1921, Crowley wrote an extensive commentary on Liber AL vel Legis (Crowley added an ‘A’ to the original ‘L’ in 1921). The monumental task of editing this material was trusted to Crowley’s friend Louis Wilkinson – For whom he wrote the 1941 jingoistic battle-cry Liber Oz. Wilkinson completed the first draft in 1946. According to Gerald Yorke, this was “approved by A. C.” Page fifty (of over five hundred), begins with the final two lines of the fourth verse of Crowley’s versification of the stele hieroglyphics. Interestingly, the ‘critical’ phrase initially read “Aum! Let if fill me.” Of which the ‘f’ was scrubbed out and replaced (above) with a letter ‘k.’ Then, a letter ‘f’ was written below the original (erased) typed ‘f.’ Given this evident indecisiveness, it seems to me that only a year before his death Crowley"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"still couldn’t make up his mind. So why should someone else decide for him a century later? The change is surplus to requirements. It corrects a mistake that was never there in the first instance. Incidentally, this material is currently housed at the Warburg Institute in a section indexed OSK1 to OSK4. Item OSK1 is a hardback, bound book comprising Crowley’s carbon copy typescript of his commentary on Liber AL. Rather surprisingly, ‘Chapter Three’ appears first.

Could the largely self-inflicted injuries Breeze amassed in the (entirely predictable) frenzied response to his change be perceived as an unavoidable trade-off – Recoverable collateral damage suffered in consequence of a sacrifice necessary to diffuse the otherwise catastrophic impact of an imminent bombshell? InLiber L. vel Bogus, I forwarded to a select handful of acquaintances a twenty-page booklet sketching several puzzling oddities. Of these, one in particular struck me as presenting a singular challenge to Crowley’s reception myth. The anomaly in question related to a minor yet damning chronological malfunction. On comparison of a few unpublished documents, it is relatively easy to demonstrate that numerous key texts, on which Crowley’s reception story is reliant, were actually written after leaving Cairo! One notable instance of material ascribed to April 1904 does not appear until October 1907, three years later!

None did. I personally racked my brain to visualise a realistic scenario accounting for the discrepancies. I even attempted to formulate a tenuous ‘possible though highly unlikely’ solution worthy of Jonathan Creek... and made no ground, whatsoever. Several months later, I’d forgotten about the question when something I read on the Internet unexpectedly precipitated the notion of a radical solution to the dating problem. I envisaged a hscuniverse, in which I am responsible for the preservation of Crowley’s legacy, reputation and d, I am facing the imminent rowley wrote much of the oleskine House. How can I explain this? My only real hope is that of producing a vellum notebook contemporary with Cairo, April 1904, containing Crowley’s handwritten versification of the Stele of Revealing. Unfortunately, such a volume does not exist, nor is it feasible to fake one. However, given my position of absolute authority, I don’t actually need to produce a physical notebook. With a deft sleight-of-hand, I can scrape through using a mirage. To accomplish the illusion I invent a reason to mention, casually, a ‘now-lost 1904 Cairo notebook,’ and bury the reference in a contentious statement. Several months later, on release of the heresy, I can argue that the numerous instances of material written implausibly status... at any cost.

However, given the severe threat level posed by the incoming heresy, the ‘lost vellum notebook’ trick does just enough to raise a ‘last-ditch’ question mark and stall a potentially irretrievable collapse of Crowley’s position.

Of these, “OS23” is yet another small vellum notebook contemporary with Cairo 1904. For reasons described in subsequent chapters, material in this notebook presents numerous serious challenges to Crowley’s version of events. Indeed, the discrepancies I stumbled over were so contentious as to demand further investigation. The handwritten content of OS23 mains unprescanned to microfiche in 2002 and, hers with access to the reels, and authors rthermore, digital copies of the Warburg archive are extant and afford a wider audience access to the unique collection.

They miss that one!” Of numerous ‘oddities’ contained in the elusive notebook, OS23, the above scan highlights two minor curiosities.

To illustrate my point, and working from known ‘start’ and ‘end’ points, I now outline the mechanics of a remarkable sequence of entirely random events. Crowley’s numerous small red vellum notebooks are difdistinguish between and his handwriting often borders on illegible. To assist with identification, tipped into each is a unique ‘marker’ page.

Again, this is an intelligent procedure, and an invaluable aid to locating specific content amongst hundreds of frames stacked along a long reel of film. he duplication of OS21 was not a simple copy error. The slightly Tdifferent treatment of numbered (but otherwise blank) pages (see above) demonstrates that, for whatever reason, the notebook labelled “OS21” passed under the Warburg scanner twice. The content of OS21 appears first as item two on film 1.

Evyears, it seemed reasonable to suppose that both OS21 and OS23 r page beneath their covers. Rather surprisingly, courteous and ever-helpful staff at the Warburg Institute confirmed that the two incorrect marker pages had swapped over, again, and returned to their former places in the correct notebooks, both of which were located in the correct place! It seems that chance is both random and occasionally... tidy. In this instance, fate noticed its error and engineered a corresponding set of seven equally random events required to rectify the glitch. In conspiring to omit the content of OS23 from the record, ‘coincidence’ required no less than fourteen discrete accidents. As Crowley once uttered, in a similar context, “Calculate the odds!

Intended as the debut public outing of a new brand labelled Thelema, for reasons unknown Crowley ultimately withdrew this material and for over a century it has languished in a drawer. Given its fundamental relevance to the origin, genesis and context of Liber AL, I find it difficult to believe that it has not already been widely circulated, subject to intense scrutiny, and the focus of at least one book. Whilst technically ‘unpublished,’ photocopies and, more recently, digital versions of the Appendix are in circulation. In consideration of this, I simply do not understand how this sensational material has, for so long, avoided the attention it sorely deserves. the Appendix at their earliest opportunity. To this, I’ll append a note of caution: Anyone expecting a rehash of the officially-sanctioned version of Liber AL and its accompanying mythology is in for quite a surprise. The Liber L. we never saw begins with Crowley’s unequivocal declaration that he is not the author of documents that only came into his possession in July 1906! Following a bizarre introduction, the material continues with a French translation of the stele hieroglyphs and two Enochian calls, ‘conjoined’ (as seen in the scan on next page).

The Appendix, cover sheet and incidental points raised over the previous few pages do not provide definitive evidence as to the precise ircumstances under which Crowley produced Liber L. vel Legis. iscover that neither his mundane or ‘Magickal’ diaries of the time cThese discrepancies do however spotlight a multiplicity of significant anomalies between the aborted 1907 version and the entirely different animal we know today. At very least, even a cursory examination of the “highly significant piece that raises as many questions as it answers” must set alarm bells ringing in the heads of anyone who tacitly accepts Crowley’s published account of the reception. Whilst this rarely seen documentation does not prove Crowley lied, it does hint suggestively that the flamboyant account left for posterity is far from the stuffed-and-mounted trophy Crowley would have us believe, and quite the converse. Crowley was an avid diarist who, throughout his life, habitually recorded details of his day-to-day activities. It is, then, most perplexing todchronicle any of the events Crowley subsequently narrated as the reception of Liber L. vel Legis. That Crowley included mundane references to “golf” and “long and futile Tarot divination,” yet neglected to mention the mind-blowing three days he spent scribbling down a new Bible is, to my mind, inexplicable. Without labouring this point, I think it pertinent to mention that, according to his account, almost before its ink was dry Crowley allegedly lost the foundation document of Mankind’s New Aeon! Mercifully, a manuscript of supreme importance to humanity eventually surfaced in the attic at Boleskine House, on 28 June 1909. It is reasonable to suppose that a fortuitous event of this magnitude would be noteworthy. Yet, Crowley’s diary entries for the period fail to mention his finding of a pivotal document lost five years ago. Coincidentally, at the time of the manuscript’s rediscovery Crowley was overseeing the occult initiation of a pupil named Victor Neuburg. Between 18 and 27 June, Neuburg kept a detailed record of his ordeals, and rewrote this on 30 June. That Neuburg’s chronicle also fails to mention what he would have unquestionably perceived as a glittering seal on the successful completion of his initiation, a divine endorsement of Crowley’s methodology and a generally fabulous portent, is to my mind a step too far.
