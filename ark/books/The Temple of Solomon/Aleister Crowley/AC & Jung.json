One may be incliwd to disregard Jung's fiscination witû alchemy as inconsequeatial to his understanding of the psyche and its inaimic drive towards wholeness. This inclination would be a grievous error. For Jung the alchernid writers, especiaiiy Gerhard Dom (16 c), represented a form of histoncal validation for his, Jung's, understmd'ig and model of the psyche. The alchexnid tradition dso gave Jung a new language through which he could describe the depth of the human progression towards wholeness in highIy rich and symbolic images.

This work will be divided inîo four chapters. In Chapter One we wili review two models on the nature and f'unction of symbols. The 6rst model, Multi-Dimensional Consciousness, is taken from the writings of Lama Anagarika Govinda.

They are symbols, in which the highest bwledge and the noblest endeavow of the human mind are ernbodied- Theü visualization is the creative process of spiritual projectioo, through wtiich imer experience is mnslated into visible form . . . which now takes on a reality of ts own, independent of its creator.\" Once the symbol is actïvated there is no concern as to whether or not the symbol is \"reai\" or 'Msualized\" because there is no longer any differentiation made between the two States.

Jung feit tbat alchemy was an expression of psychologid proceoses and nowhere was this proces more fuliy portrayeci than in the Conjunction. Alchemy tends to be portrayd as a primitive pseudo-science which was wocemed with the transformation of base metals, such as lead, into gold. On one level this dennition of alchemy is correct. There are many texts which are dedicated to such transmutations though not ail alchemy falls into this category.

The purpose of these ascetic practices is to fàciiitate self- knowiedge.

If this reintegraiion is not accomplished one is simply lefi \"living in the heaâ'' without a grounding in the physical world or with an asceticism which denies the body. The retum to \"this worldlùiess'' is accomplished through the caeium which is the divine spark which is found within the waste of the nigrecilo. The caelum is the state where spirituai soui reincarnaîes in the body. That actual reunion with the body can only happen once the c&m is separated and prepared fiom the rsidue of the nigredo. Before the reunion can take place, other psychologicai \"Ulgredients\" mut be added.

However, Jung did think it is possie for the individual to know aspects of both the wnscious and the unconscious through the mediator, Le., the self or Merairius.

The first quarter, lying in the east, is childhood, that state in which we are a probIern for others but are not yet conscious of any problems of our own.

ZY In childhood there are no discernable problems for oneself since, accordhg to Jung, there is not a fully established sense of consciousness. In the case of extreme old age the individuai slips deqer and deeper into the u~~conscious leaving many coaflicts of consciousness behind.

The process of the Conjunction would be an example not of lookiog to the past or fbture for meaning but an attempt, in the present, to make conscious the unconscious conflicts in order to tàce them and thereby gain a better understanding of its contents in order to have coutrd over them The actuai process of the Conjunction parallels a psychological practice, developed by Jung, called active imagination. Jung found psychologicai practices such as Freaidian fke association, were indechial at aliowing the unconscious an opportunity to make itself known.~' Free association, according to Jung, simply moves fiom one complex to snother without, necessatily, foNowhg one particular complex to its root in the unconscious.

The Conjunction can be seen as a form of active haghationpar excellence. Even the term \"the ar~ of alchemf suggests that thae is more to the practice than a pseudo- scient& misunderstanding of matter- In fact, the Conjunction is structurd so that the individual brings to coosciousness, t6rough projection onto the prim materia, those unconscious fantasies wtich are aear the threshold and then probes even deeper until the self, with its inherently contradictory me, becornes the mediator ôetween the Microcosm and Macrocosm. Summmy of Chapter Thme The Conjunction is not an undertakjng of lei- or curiosity. Nor is it a practice for those who are under the grip of the unconscious and have lost a grasp of the \"reai\" wodd. In either case, the undeaaking ofthe Conjunction wouid be psychologicaiiy harmhil. As both Jung and Edinger bave demonstrateci, the Coojunction represents one way of undertaking the natural and universal drive toward wholeness. Although this drive can be interpreted as a specifically psychological teleology based on the actions and reactions ofthe conscious and the unconscious it can also be dersîood as somethhg beyond this limited interpretation where the summation of an individual's potential as a human king is brought into a form of actualization. Jung, as an empincist, oould never posit that the Conton points to a Divine Behg with whorn the alchemist interacts. However, Jung did appreciate the spirituai nature of the alchemid tradition.

Jung's psychology does much the same thing as the alchernid tradition in that it uses theories like \"archetype\" and \"synchronicity\" to explain concepts which in our aimnt development seem to point to something beyond the gemrally accepted view of reality. Perhaps in four hundred years people will look back on Jung's hgs and comment on how quaint bis theones about the psyche were, in much the same way that some peopIe view alchemy today- More than anything Jung's understanding of alchemy ad the Conjunction demonstrate that the human condition is far more cornplex and deep than most people care to think It is fâr more simple to rernain ignorant of one's projections ad tive in a state of unio naturalis than it is to enter into the trials and tribulations of self-biowiedge found throughout the Conjunction Jung was absoluteiy correct when he wrote: \"Self- knowledge is an adventure that Cernes us unexpectedly fsr and deep?' Jung found, through his personal @ences and those of bis patients, that there seemed to be an innate need for the human psyche, both the conscious and un~~IlSCious components, to move towards a union with each other and so to wholeness. If ignored, this drive could be responsi'ble for nuwrous psychological as weU as physioiogical complications.
