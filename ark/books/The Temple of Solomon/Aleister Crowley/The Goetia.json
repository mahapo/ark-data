A.R.G.C THIS translation of the First Book of the “Lemegeton” (now for the first time made accessible to English adepts and students of the Mysteries) was done, after careful collation and edition, from numer-ous MSS. in Hebrew, Latin, French and English, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., by the order of the Secret Chief of the Rosicrucian Order.1 The G. H. Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the Four Great Princes (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The investigations of a competent Skryer into the house of our unhappy Fra., confirmed this divination; neither our Fra. nor his Hermetic Mul. were there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the evil Adepts S.V.A.2 and H., whose original bodies having been sequestered by Justice, were no 1 Mr A.

As Mr. Waite constantly hints in his writings that he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the syllogism, whose premisses are given above, is fair, if not quite formal.—ED. 2 It was owing to our Fra. receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up the Arcana of our Fraternity into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer to leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon.

Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literal belief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah,2 and only adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, as interesting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and as nothing more. Even when we learn that the Bible, by profound and minute study of the text, may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we are too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, even if we are the lucky holders of Burton’s veritable edition. To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper place once more. I am not concerned to deny the reality of all “magical” phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause.3 Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art? Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: “That cause lies in your brain.” 1 Introductory Essay. By Aleister Crowley. 2 “A Thousand and One Nights,” commonly called “Arabian Nights.” 3 This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its extreme, against the Advaitist theories. I"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 2English children are taught (pace the Education Act) that the Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akaca, which is the same thing. Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are told, that by Akaca is mean the Chitakaca. The Chitakaca is situated in the “Third Eye,” i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we can assimilate this face to Realism; but we have no need to take so much trouble. This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions are dependent on changes in the brain,1 we must include illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as “realities” are, in the class of “phenomena dependent on brain-changes.” Magical phenomna, however, come under a special sub-class, since they are willed, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomena called the operations of ceremonial Magic. These consist of: (1) Sight. The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, imple-ments, etc. (2) Sound. The invocations. (3) Smell. The perfumes. (4) Taste. The Sacraments. (5) Touch. As under (1) (6) Mind. The combination of all these and reflection on their significance. These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence their summary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenal world is therefore unusual. 1 Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissman). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 3Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic,1 and I conceive that the apology is ample, so far as the “effects” refer only to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, his conversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the one hand, and death or madness on the other. But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances? Say you so? I can, and will. The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer’s projected cube) methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye). The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: (a) General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions relative to the subtle world). (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit). (c) Control over one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to control a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit’s name. I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. If, then, I say, with Solomon: “The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,” what I mean is: “Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulated and developed by following out the process called ‘The Invocation of Cimieries.’” And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent of any objective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can only suspend judgement, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the facts alleged. 1 Apart from its value in obtaining one-pointedness. On this subject the curious may consult my tycarb.

Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtain information; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4) obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these five powers at random; considerations of space forbid me to explain all. (1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. (2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. “To destroy our enemies” is to realise the illusion of duality, to excite compassion. (Ah! Mr. Waite,1 the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.) (3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long. Even a child knows the difference between a cat’s miauling and purring. The faculty may be greatly developed. (4) Business capacity may be stimulated. (5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected, and the involved tissues brought back to tone, in obedience to currents started from the brain. So for all the other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly and necessarily miraculous. Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of course empirical, physiological experiments, and whoso will carry them through intelligently need not fear the result. I have all the health, and treasure, and logic I need; I have no time to waste. “There is a lion in the way.” For me these practices are useless; but for the benefit of others less fortunate I give them to the world, together with this explanation of, and apology for, them. I trust that this explanation will enable many students who have hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question, obtained no results, to succeed; that the apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus should give place to that of the baculum, the little to the great—how great one only realises when one identifies the wand with the Mahalingam,2 up which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000 1 A poet of great ability.

Waite in the “Book of Black Magic.” But a fresh persusal of that work reveals it to be such a farrago of twenty-fifth-rate shoddy schoolboy journalism that disgust compels me to refrain. I may merely mention that the letterpress is garbled and the seals abominably drawn. To give one concrete example: on p. 202 Mr. Waite observes: “This” (that the compiler of the Lemegeton was acquainted with the N. T.) “is proved by the references in the Third Conjuration to the Living Creatures of the Apocalypse.” There is no such reference! In the Second Conjuration, for I have corrected Mr. Waite’s careless blunder, there is a reference to Living Creatures; there is also a reference to the same beings in the Apocalypse. The argument then stands: The Book of Chronicles refers to King Solomon (unknown date). Mr. Waite refers to King Solomon (1898). Therefore, The author of the Book of Chronicles was acquainted with Mr. Waite’s book.1 We will conclude by condoling with the author of the Book of Chronicles. 1 Even apart from this, if Living Creatures are really existent things—which the name would suggest—the argument stands: The Rig-Veda, The Old Testament, The Insidecompletuar Britanniaware, The Sword of Song all refer to the Sun. ∴ there is a common source in literature. Mr Waite’s fallacy is all very well, though, for people who have never kept Living Creatures, nor even made a fourth at Bridge."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 6 LEMEGETON VEL CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC.1 MAGIC is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of Natural Philosophy, advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents2 being applied to proper Patients,3 strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced. Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effort,4 the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle. Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything subsisting, but although it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or subject to contempt or scorn; and doth distinguish the Natural Magic from that which is Diabolical. Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the Natural Magic, by the which he did perform wonderful things. Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the understanding of the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being con-temptible that the greatest Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! among the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this GREAT ART. This Noble Science often degenerateth, from Natural becometh Dia-bolical, and from True Philosophy turneth unto Nigromancy.5 The which is wholly to be charged upon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of that High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations of Sathan, and are misled by him into 1 This Preliminary Definition of Magic is found in very few Codices, and is probably later than the body of the work. 2 Or Actives. 3 Or Passives. 4 Or Effect. 5 Or the Black Art, as distinct from mere Necromancy, or Divination by the Dead."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 7the Study of the Black Art.

It will be observed that the evident desire is to represent hieroglpyhically a person raising his or her hands in adoration. Nearly all are stone sephulchral steles, and the execution of them is rough and primitive in the extreme. Most are in the Musée du Louvre at Paris. Figure 162. Figure 163. Figure 164. Figures 162 and 163 are from the district of Constantine and show a figure raising its arms in adoration. In Figure 164, also from Constantine, the person bears a palm branch in the right hand. Above is a hieroglyphic representing either the Lunar Disc or the Sun in the heavens; but more probably the former. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 42 Figure 165. Figure 166. Figure 165 is a more complicated stele. Above is the symbol already mentioned, then comes the sign of the Pentagram, represented by a five-pointed star, towards which the person raises his or her hands. Besides the latter is a rude form of caduceus. A brief inscription follows in the Punic character. The Punic or Carthaginian language is usually considered to have been a dialect of Phœnician, and Carthage was of course a colony of Tyre. Beneath the Punic inscription is a horse’s head in better drawing than the sculpture of the rest of the stele, which would seem to imply that the rudeness of the representation of the human figure is intentional. This and the following stele are also from Constantine. In Figure 166 again, the horse is best delieated by far. In addition to the other symbols is also a hand or foot, for it is almost impossible to distinguish which, at the head of the stele, followed by an egg-and-tounge moulding. The figure of the person with the arms raised is treated as a pure hieroglpyh and is placed between two rude caducei. The Lunar or Solar symbol follows. Figure 167. Figure 168. Figure 169. Figure 167, also from Constantine, shows the last-mentioned symbol above. The figure with the arms raised is simply a hieroglyph, and is placed between and arm and a hand on the one side, and a rude caduceus on the other. Figure 168 shows the person holding a rude caduceus in the right hand, and standing above a dolphin.. This latter, as in the case of the horse in 165 and 166, is by far the best delineated. Figure 169, this also being from Constantine, shows the usual human hieroglyph between a caduceus and a cresent."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 43 Figure 170. Figure 171. Figure 170 is from the site of ancient Carthage. It is very rough in workmanship, and the designs are mere scratchings on the stone. The ensemble has the effect of an evil Sigil. Figure 171 is also from Carthage and the various symbols appear to have been compressed into and synthesised in the form of a peculiarly evil-looking caduceus. Figure 172. Figure 173. Figure 174. Figure 172 is from the decoration of a sepulchral urn found at Olden-burgh in Germany. It is remarkable as showing the same hieroglyphic human form with the crescent above; the latter in the Secret Seal of Solomon has a flattened top, and is therefore more like a bowl, and is placed across the hieroglyph. Figure 173 is an Egyptian design which would show an analogy between the symbol and the idea of the force of creation. Figure 174 is a stele from Phœnicia somewhat similar to the others, except that the rudimentary caducei in Figures 166 and 170 are here replaced by two roughly drawn Ionic columns. These last three designs are taken from the work of the Chevalier Emile Soldi-Colbert de Beaulieu, on the “Lange Sacrée.” Figure 175. In figure 175 is given the seal of the Spirit HALAHEL. This Spirit is said to be under the rule of BAEL, and to be of a mixed nature, partly good and partly evil, like the spirits of Theurgia-Goetia which follow in the second book of the Lemegeton.

This edition of the Goëtia was prepared from the 1976 facsimile reprint published by Equinox Books, and the 1993 First Impressions reprint incorporating Crowley’s doodles and marginalia. Some of the latter have been retained as footnotes, flagged by double square brackets [[like this]]. Also consulted were electronic editions of the Goëtia and Pseudomonarchia dæmonum prepared by Joseph Peterson (online at www.esoteric-archives.org) and of the other books of the Lemegeton prepared by Ben Rowe (online at http://w3.one.net/~browe/classics.htm; Rowe’s version of the Goëtia was prepared primarily from the de Laurence piracy). The 1995 Weiser edition (edited by William Breeze based on the Mathers-Crowley edition and other sources) was not directly consulted. In the printed edition the figures (seals of spirits, diagram of the Circle, etc) were given on three full-page plates: one facing the main title, one facing the start of the list of spirits, and one before the start of the conjurations. I have inserted the bulk of them in appropriate places in the text for ease of comprehension: as such the original pagination has not been retained past the start of the list of Spirits. Figures 176-184 from that edition are omitted; these belonged with the Theurgia-Goetia, the second book of the Lemegeton. “EPIKALOUMAI SE TON EN TW KENEW PNEUMATI k.t.l.” This curse is extracted from the Demotic and Greek magical papyrus of London and Leiden, now known as PGM XIV / PDM xiv. A semi-popular edition with an English translation, edited by F.L. Griffith and Herbert Thomson, was published in 1904 as The Demotic Magical Papyrus of London and Leiden (London: H. Grevel & co.). The spell in question appears in col. XXIII lines 1-22. In full, including the rubric (in Demotic in the papyrus) it runs: A spell to inflict (?) catalepsy (?) Formula. You take an ass’s head, and you place it between your feet opposite the sun in the morning when it is about to rise, opposite it again in the evening when it goes to the setting, and you anoint your right foot with set-stone of Syria, and your left foot with clay, the soles (?) of your foot also : and place your right hand in front and your left hand behind, the head being between them. You anoint your hand, of your two hands, with ass’s blood, and the two fnz (?corners) of your mouth, and utter these charms towards the sun in the morning and evening of four days, then he sleeps. If you wish to make him die, you do it for seven days, you do its magic, you bind a thread of palm-fibre to your hand, a mat (?) of wild palm-fibre to your phallus and your head; very excellent. This is the invocation which you utter before the sun : “I invoke thee who art in the void air, terrible, invisible, almighty, god of gods, dealing destruction and malting desolate, O thou that hatest a household well established. When thou wast cast out of Egypt and out of the country thou wast entitled, “He that destroyeth all and is unconquered.” I invoke thee, Typhon Seth, I perform thy ceremonies of divination, for I invoke thee by thy powerful name in (words?) which thou canst not refuse to hear : IOERBETH IOPAKERBETH IO BOLCHOSETH IOPATATHNAX IOSORO IONEBOUTOSOUALETH AKTIOPHI ERESCHIGAL, NEBOPOOALETH, ABERAMENTHOOU, LERTHEXANAX, ETHRELUOTH, NEMAREBA, AEMINA, entirely(?) come to me and approach and strike down that person [here Crowley adds “Mathers”] with frost and fire; he has wronged me, and has poured out the blood of Typhon (?) beside(?) him or her: therefore I do these things.” (add the usual)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 72This mostly follows the translation in Griffiths and Thomson. A more modern translation may be found in Betz (ed.), The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (University of Chicago, 1986, 1992) as PDM xiv. 675-94. A couple of apparent transcription errors in the text as originally printed in the Goëtia (ABERAMENQOWN for ABERAMENQOWU and FUONS for TUFONOS) have been corrected. The student will observe that the opening of the invocation is almost identically worded in the Greek to a passage in the “Bornless One” ritual (section c in the Goetia version), possibly suggesting Typhonian influences in the latter. “KODSELIM” square. This talisman appears in Chapter X of Book 3 of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage (in the Mathers edition the top left and bottom right squares have C rather than K); its stated purpose is “To undo any Magic soever.” Prefatory Note D.D.C.F. (Deo Duce Comite Ferro) was S.L. “MacGregor” Mathers, chief of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. His “translator” credit was in this instance bogus: the British Museum MSS. of the Lemegeton are in English. If the date is to be believed, then Crowley’s final falling out with Mathers and proclamation of himself as the head of the Rosicrucian Order pre-dated the 1904 reception of The Book of the Law. “The Four Great Princes (acting notably under Martial influences).” The reference is probably to the Four Princes of Evil of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial. In Liber LXI Crowley alleged that Mathers had “imprudently attracted to himself forces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand” which he notes elsewhere were “probably Abramelin demons.” Crowley claimed elsewhere that Mathers was obsessed by Mars and Geburah. S.V.A. and H. were “Swami Vive Ananda” (a.k.a. Madame Horos, Madame Helena, Edith Loleta, Dis Debar) and Theo Horos (Frank Jackson), a couple of occult con-artists who pulled a scam on Mathers (Mrs. Horos convinced him that she was Soror S.D.A., Anna Sprengel, the supposed German Master who authorised the founding of the Golden Dawn, who had not died as had been reported) and procured from him the ritual of the G.D. which they then used to extract money from the credulous. They were imprisoned for rape in December 1901; sensational newspaper coverage around the trial did much damage to the reputation of the G.D. An account of the “investigation by a competent Skryer” by J. F. C. Fuller using information supplied by Crowley appears in Equinonx I (4) pp. 176-7. The Latin quotation is from vol. I of Kabbalah Denudata (p. 505) and may comprise a further subtle dig at Mathers. “Ex Deo Nascimur &c.”: Lat., “From God we are born; in Jesus we die; by the Holy Spirit we live again.” A Rosicrucian commonplace; vide the Fama Fraternitatis. “Mountain of A.” Abiegnus. A name in later Rosicrucian literature for the “Mountain of the Philosphers” depicted in Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, the symbolic burying-place of Christian Rosencreutz. See for example the Adeptus Minor ritual of the R.R. et A.C. as given in Regardie (ed.) The Golden Dawn and in an abridged form in Equinonx I (3). “Day of C.C.” Corpus Christi. This was the G.D. interpretation of the “day C.” when, according to the Fama, members of the Rosicrucian Order were bound to meet at a certain place or send cause of their absence. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 73Preliminary Invocation This is an adaptation, possibly by Allan Bennett, of a Græco-Egyptian ritual of exorcism known as the “Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist” (PGM V:96-172). While sometimes cited as the “Preliminary Invocation of the Goëtia” its connection with the Goëtia is modern, deriving from Crowley’s publication (probably also from private magical work by Crowley and others prior to that publication where the two were used in conjunction). The Greek text of the British Museum papyrus now known as PGM V (P. Lond. 46), with an English translation, was published in 1852 by Charles Wycliffe Godwin (Fragment of a Græco-Egyptian Work upon Magic, Cambridge: Deighton). Footnotes are transcribed from the two copies of the “Preliminary Invocation” in the First Impressions edition where they appeared as MS marginalia and interpolations; one set by Crowley from his personal copy, a second set by Gerald Yorke, collated from the former plus others unidentified sources. Text in angle brackets in these notes describes figures which I did not consider worth including in my occult symbols font. Crowley’s final working up of the ritual into which many of the ideas appearing in those notes were incorporated is Liber Samekh which was published as Appendix IV of Magick in Theory and Practice. The Greek text as given in Preisendanz (ed.), Papyri Græcæ Magicæ v.

A number of transcription errors in the voces magica occurred in the Goëtia version; I have not ventured to correct these, since these names are for the most part corrupt to the point of being meaningless in any language in any case (some of Crowley’s glosses do hinge on the erroneous reading). However, the above also contains a few conjectural restorations (of damaged places in the MS; flagged by angle brackets) and corrections by Preisendanz, e.g. ARBAQIAW for AR . . QIAW, IABAWQ IAW for IB . . QIAW, AGIE (‘holy’) for APE, etc. This is followed by a short rubric (English translation by D. E. Aune from Betz, op. cit): Preparation for the above ritual: Write the formula [onoma] on a new sheet of papyrus, and after extending it from one of your temples to the other, read the 6 names, while you face north saying: Øpotaxon moi panta ta daimonia, ƒna moi ºn Øphkooj paj daimon oÙranioj kai a„qerioj, kai ™pigeioj kai Øpogeioj kai cersaioj kai ™nudroj kai pasa ™pipomph kai mastix ¹ qeou. And all daimons will be obedient to you. The beneficial sign is :> (Øpotaxon moi panta ta daimonia k.t.l. is the prototype for the “Hear me and make all spirits subject unto me” refrain which does not occur in the body of the original invocation. The rest of Aune’s translation is omitted to keep within the limits of fair use.) ë denotes eta and õ denotes omega; umlauts over other vowels simply indicate that the vowel in question and the preceding one are pronounced distinctly. In their absence, ai, ei, oi, ui, au, eu, and ou are pronounced as single sounds (ai as in “aisle”, ei as in “veil”, oi as in “oil”, ui as in “quit”, au as the ‘ou’ in “loud”, eu as in “feud”, ou as in “route”—pronunciation information from Wenham, Elements of New Testament Greek)."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 75Note in the c section the fifth of the voces magica is OÖÖ not DÖÖ; similarly OO not DO after SABRIAM in the final section. The miscopying occurred in the execrable de Lawrence piracy of the Goëtia and has been perpetuated by other writers, possibly because in the blackletter typeface used by Crowley capital D and O were similar. Similarly the lower-case x and r are very similar, so de Lawrence miscopied ABRASAX as ABRASAR in the third and sixth sequences of voces magica. The Initiated Interpretation of Ceremonial Magic. This essay was reprinted in the notes to Crowley’s Sword of Song and in turn reprinted in vol. ii of his Collected Works. Some additional footnotes from the latter publication have been added in. Preliminary Definition of Magic. Crowley scholar Martin Starr has sourced this to a 1656 English translation of Themis Auræ, a Rosicrucian work by Michael Maier. Brief Introductory Description. The Lemegeton is a 17th-century English compilation of magical texts attributed to Solomon. The Goëtia is itself a composite: the praxis appears based partly on the Fourth Book of pseudo-Agrippa and partly on the Key of Solomon; the conjurations are closely or identically worded to Robert Turner’s English translation (pub. 1655) of the Heptameron, a 16th-century Grimoire of planetary magick (falsely attributed to Peter of Abano) which was bound up with the Fourth Book and the catalogue of spirits is an adaptation of the “Book of the Offices of the Spirits” published by Wier in 1563 as Pseudomonarchia dæmonum from a magical MS. in his possession. This text had 69 spirits; the compiler of the Goetia added some to bring the number up to 72 in accordance with the legend in the Pseudomonarchia which speaks of the 72 chief spirits bound up in the brazen vessel by Solomon. Further, the fourth spirit in Wier’s list, the Prince and Duke Pruflas or Bufas, is omitted in the Goëtia. It may be significant that this spirit was also omitted in the version of the Pseudomonarchia published by Scot in his Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), from a MS. collection of magical rituals in English compiled by one “T.R.” The Goëtia also perpetuates a few other errors or odditites from that translation. The Theurgia Goëtia lists 31 principal spirits and enumerates an astronomical number of subordinates of whom relatively few are named; of the 31, 20 are referred to the points of the compass and the other 11 are said to wander and have no fixed place. It is possible that the Theurgia-Goëtia was partly based on the Steganographia of Trithemius by someone who did not realise that the latter was primarily a work of cryptography. The apparently oxymoronic title (historically gohteia was used as a term of abuse by those who claimed to practice qeourgia for what other magicians did) is accounted for by the mixed nature of the spirits (and the fact that the words had shifted somewhat in meaning by the Renaissance). The Ars Paulina contains a catalogue of Angels for the 12 hours of the day and night, and for the 12 signs and 360 degrees of the Zodiac; they are also attributed to the seven classical Planets. The Ars Almadel is probably of medieval origin: it divides up the powers it summons into four “Altitudes”, seemingly referred to the cardinal points of the Zodiac. Both the Pauline Art and Art Almadel (alongside the Notary Art and “Art of Revelations” concerning which latter I have no further information) were denounced by Agrippa in his de Vanitate."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 76The Ars Nova is a kind of appendix which appears in one MS (BL Sloane 2731) where it occupies one and a half sides of a single folio leaf: it contains an extended prayer associated with the names on the circle and triangle of the Goëtia (it appears in this edition as “Explanation of Certain Names &c.”), along with a short and garbled conjuration containing some highly corrupt Hebrew names, probably also connected with the Goëtia as it mentions the brazen vessel; and finally, the “Mighty Oration”, a lengthy curse targetted at anyone who steals the book. The Ars Nova should not be confused with the Ars Notoria (Notary Art) attributed variously to Solomon and Apollonius of Tyanæa, which latter rather appears to be a medieval magical derivative of classical art of memory, based around the contemplation of images or notæ while repeating prayers. The Ars Notoria was condemned by Aquinas (cited in Yates, Art of Memory) and various Renaissance writers such as Erasmus and Agrippa (in De vanitate &c.); Robert Turner produced an English translation which was made less than useful by the omission of the figures: this translation was incorporated into some later MSS. and printed editions of the Lemegeton. Some figures from medieval MSS. of the Ars Notoria are printed in an article in a volume called Conjuring Sprits: Texts and Traditions of Medieval Ritual Magic, edited by Clare Fanger (Stroud: Sutton). A few complete editions of the Lesser Key have been printed since the Mathers-Crowley edition of the Goëtia was issued. One, edited by Nelson White, appears to have been prepared from either Sloane 2731, or a codex of similar content, and omits the Ars Nova on the grounds that the editor considered it worthless. A more recent and thorough edition, edited by Joseph Petersen (Red Wheel / Weiser, 2002) was prepared from various codices and includes the Ars Notoria (mainly following Turner’s translation). Crowley’s threatened “History of the Order of the Golden Dawn” did not manifest under that title; see instead the instalments of The Temple of Solomon the King by J. F. C. Fuller (based on Crowley’s notebooks) published in Equinox vol. I nos. 2, 3 and 4, as well as The Magicians of the Golden Dawn by Ellic Howe and Ritual Magic in England by Francis King. Shemhamphorash. The Shem ha-Mephorash (crmph \\c) is the “Divided Name” or “Name of Extension” derived by Kabbalists from three consecutive verses in the Book of Exodus, each of which has 72 letters in the original Hebrew. By writings these verses out in rows, the first and third right to left as usual, the second left to right, and reading down the columns, 72 three-letter names are obtained. On the basis that the first verse mentions “the angel of the Elohim”, from each three-letter group the name of an Angel is obtained by appending either hy or la. The analogy with the 72 spirits of the Goetia should be obvious. For eight spirits, two forms of the seal were given by Mathers. In most cases the variations are minor, attributable to divergence from repeated copying: any given MS would only have had one. The exception is Buné, where at least one MS gives two significantly different forms. Further, the proportions of some of the seals have been squashed or stretched somewhat to fit them inside the circular borders (not present in most MSS); compare the forms in this edition with those given by Waite in Book of Black Magic and of Pacts and by Hyatt and DuQuette in their edition of the Goetia, or the forms from Sloane MS 3825 by Joseph Petersen in his electronic edition. Where Mathers has remarked unusual or variant readings in the description of a spirit in a footnote, I have in many instances cross-referenced to the corresponding entry in the Pseudo-monarchia. Issues that cannot be dealt with in a brief footnote are discussed below."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 77Two handwritten marginal notes by Crowley to this section which appeared in the First Impressions edition are omitted; as in one instance there was no obvious citation point (the note read “I think he can only be invoked at this time” and appeared at the bottom of the page with the descriptions of Paimon, Buer and Gusion) and the other one was partially illegible and I could make no sense of it. It is perhaps appropriate to give notice of the system of Angelic Hierarchies alluded to in various of the descriptions of the Spirits, since it is not mentioned in many of the modern works of Qabalistic reference such as 777. It is due to a Platonizing Christian mystic and theologian known as pseudo-Dionysus (ca. 5th century C.E.; his system was largely plagiarised from the Platonist Proclus) and postulates nine orders of celestial spirits, to wit: Seraphim, Kerubim, Thrones; Dominations (or Dominions), Powers, Virtues; Principalities, Archangels, Angels. Sometimes they are referred to the Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod in that order, with the “Blessed Souls” placed in Malkuth to fill out the scheme. 3: VASSAGO does not appear in the Pseudomonarchia. Waite in Book of Black Magic and of Pacts states that he is also invoked in ceremonial crystallomancy by self-styled practitioners of “White Magic” but gives no specifics, although he does give a variant form of the seal said to be used in “White Magic.” 13: BELETH. The Pseudomonarchia mentions that Beleth, in common with many of the other spirits, has hopes to return to the Seventh Throne, “quod minus credibile.” 26: BUNE. According to the version of the Goetia in Sloane 3825,which gives both forms of the seal, it is rather the more complex form, given first, which is best. 32: ASMODAY. The sentence “When the Exorcist hath a mind to call him...” has been much garbled, largely due to “T.R.’s” mistranslation from the Latin of the Pseudomonarchia, compounded by misunderstanding of 16th-century useage by later copyists. The Latin runs: Cum hujus officia exercet exorcista, sit fortis, cautus & in pedibus stans: si vero coopertus fuerit, ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista, ab Amaymone in cunctis decipietur. Approx: “When the exorcist employs his [Asmodai’s] offices, let him [the exorcist] be strong, wary [lit. “warned”], standing on his feet, for should he be overwhelmed, he will be exposed in everything: but if the exorcist does not do this he will be deceived in everything by Amaymon.” In the powers of Asmoday, “Invincible” is probably a copyist’s error for “Invisible” (Wier has Hominem reddit invisibilem), Scot “invisible.” 33. GAÄP. The entry for Gaäp in the Pseudomonarchia goes off on a long digression, outlining a legend concerning how Cham (Ham) son of Noah was the first human after the Flood to invoke evil spirits, and mentioning many unspeakable things (nefaria) done by “exorcists”; also refusing to disclose the means whereby Gaäp (or possibly Beleth, the Latin is ambiguous) may be constrained by an Exorcist who cannot get him to appear or show himself, since that too is nefandum. 35: MARCHOSIAS. According to the Pseudomonarchia, the form of Marchosias is lupæ ferocissimæ cum alis gryphi, cauda serpentina, & ex ore nescio quid evomens... “of a ferocious she-wolf with the wings of a gryphon, a serpentine tail, and vomiting I don’t know what out of its mouth.” Wier also remarks that he was deceived in his hope. 54: MURMUR. A manufacturer of “Heavy Metal” and “Goth” jewellry and accessories recently added to their product line a pendant in the form of the seal of Murmur (it also bears the Masonic square and compasses for no clear reason), with a grossly misleading description in their catalogue. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 7855: OROBAS. Lon Milo DuQuette, in an edition of the Goëtia co-edited by him with Christopher S. Hyatt, gives an account of an evocation of this spirit and suggests it was with its help that he became a Bishop of E.G.C. 57: OSÉ. The Pseudomonarchia does not state how many legions Osé rules, so whoever compiled the Goëtia had to guess. 61: ZAGAN. According to the Pseudomonarchia Zagan, besides the trick with the metals and achieving what the British educational system generally fails in, transforms water into wine, and blood into oil, and the reverse; “T.R.” gave ‘wine’ for ‘oil.’ 64: FLAUROS has acquired sixteen more legions between the Pseudomonarchia and the Goëtia. 67: AMDUSIAS. The thing with the trees has been garbled due to “T.R.” mistranslating and possibly also failing to understand a Latin idiom: Pseudomonarchia has ut ... abores ad exorcistæ genu se inclinent, lit. “that trees bend the knee to the Exorcist” probably meaning “that the trees shall be subject to the exoricst.” 68: BELIAL. The Pseudomonarchia assigns 80 legions to Belial. The entry for Belial in the Pseudomonarchia includes an account of the myth of Solomon’s sealing up the spirits in the brazen vessel. While only listing 69 spirits, the Pseudomonarchia version of the myth states that 72 kings along with their legions were sealed up in the brass vessel; it also gives various other details not included in the Goëtia. The writer presents himself not as Solomon himself, but as one who learnt the Art from Solomon; he angrily rebuts the claim that Solomon, seduced by the cunning of a certain woman, once inclined himself to pray before the idol of Belial, asserting rather that Solomon accomplished all his works by divine virtue which never forsook him. Crowley’s note from 1923 e.v. possibly alludes to various workings directed at this spirit, in particular one on the 9th of March 1918 e.v. “to create Belial as 2nd dec. Aquarius, night-demon – to bring ‘earned success.’ ” 70: SEERE, in common with DANTALION and ANDROMALIUS, does not appear in the Pseudomonarchia. 71: DANTALION appears to have been the first Goëtic spirit to get its own fansite on the World Wide Web. Observations. The compiler of the Goëtia evidently left it to the ingenium of the Magician to determine which of the four Great Kings each spirit was under; since the rulership or assignment to a quarter is only given for a few, and there is no obvious pattern. Classified List of the 72 Chief Spirits. Planetary symbols were handwritten in by Crowley in his personal copy. In the Hebrew versions of the names from the Rudd MSS (Harley 6483). I have not reproduced Hebrew pointing. In 777 (cols. CLV to CLXVI) Crowley gave a different set of Hebrew spellings for the 72 Spirts, assigning them to the Decans by day and night. I reproduce this information below, adding the key numbers of the spirits for ease of reference, and the attributions to Tarot number cards thereby implied. Planetary symbols indicate the rank of the spirit (in the printed edition, that for 50, Furcas, was given as $ rather than '). It will be observed that Crowley has largely dropped Latinised endings such as –es, –us, –ius, –ion, etc."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 79Goetic Spirits of Decans by Day Ascendent (0°-10°) Succedent (10°-20°) Cadent (20°-30°) a 1 ! lab 2 W 2 $ raga 3 W 3 & wgacw 4 W b 4 = }ygymg 5 D 5 # bram 6 D 6 $ rplaw 7 D c 7 = }wma 8 S 8 $ cwfbrb 9 S 9 ! }wmyap 10 S d 10 # rawb 2 C 11 $ }wyswg 3 C 12 & yrfyc 4 C e 13 ! talb 5 W 14 = ]yarl 6 W 15 $ cwgyla 7 W f 16 $ rpaz 8 D 17 % and # cyfwb 9 D 18 $ }ytab 10 D g 19 $ cwlac 2 S 20 ! }wcrwp 3 S 21 % and # {aram 4 S h 22 % cwpy 5 C 23 $ \\ya 6 C 24 = rbn 7 C i 25 % and # lwblsalg 8 W 26 $ \\yb 9 W 27 % and = wwnyr 10 W j 28 $ tyrb 2 D 29 $ twrtca 3 D 30 = canrwp 4 D k 31 # carwp 5 S 32 ! yadmsa 6 C 33 # [ug 7 S l 34 % rwprwp 8 C 35 = cwjrm 9 C 36 & cwlwfcy 10 C Goetic Spirits of Decans by Night Ascendent (0°-10°) Succedent (10°-20°) Cadent (20°-30°) a 37 = {nap 2 W 38 % [lah 3 W 39 # [lam 4 W b 40 % \\war 5 D 41 $ rwlkwp 6 D 42 $ rapw 7 D c 43 = ]wnbc 8 S 44 = {c 9 S 45 $ and ! anyw 10 S d 46 % wrpyb 2 C 47 $ lawa 3 C 48 # tnguh 4 C e 49 $ lkwrk 5 W 50 ' ]rp 6 W 51 ! \\lub 7 W f 52 $ ]wla 8 D 53 # }yak 9 D 54 $ and % \\rwm 10 D g 55 & bwarwa 2 S 56 $ rwmg 3 S 57 # wcw 4 S h 58 # }wa 5 C 59 = {ayrw 6 C 60 $ lwpn 7 C i 61 ! and # }gaz 8 W 62 # law 9 W 63 = rdna 10 W j 64 $ rwah 2 D 65 = [lardna 3 D 66 = rwamyk 4 D k 67 $ ]wdma 5 S 68 ! laylb 6 C 69 = barwakd 7 S l 70 & rac 8 C 71 $ lafnd 9 C 72 % lamwrdna 10 C Yet another set of spellings and astrological attributions, due to the order Aurum Solis, may be found in The Sword and the Serpent by Denning and Phillips, or the third edition of Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia. The Magical Circle. The figure of the circle and triangle has been redrawn and coloured. The sequence of names around the serpent runs, for each Sephirah from Kether to Yesod inclusive, the Divine Name, the name of the Sephirah, the Archangel, the Choir of Angel, the Hebrew name of the “Heaven of Assiah” corresponding, then the appropriate planetary symbol, or an abbreviation for the Latin equivalent. Malkuth is represented by the square in the centre, which in some codices has Terra (earth) written on it. The Vessel of Brass. The Hebrew on the band around the first form of the Brazen vessel reads: (front): layhnah : lakim : layrbg : hyha rca Asher Eheyeh : Gabriel : Michael : Haniel (back): layqdx : \\ylmcj : atyrara or laypdx : layqdx : lamk : lapr : atyrara Ararita : Chashmalim : Tzadqiel or Ararita : Raphael : Kamael : Tzadqiel : Tzaphqiel"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 80The Secret Seal. Mathers’ long note appears to have been omitted in the de Lawrence edition. Not that it was any great loss. The Adoration at the Bath. This is a traditional versicle for purification: the source is the 51st Psalm, via the Ordinary of the Mass. For “purge” read “sprinkle” or “asperge”; you are not taking a laxative. I do not know what the original Hebrew means (NIV has “cleanse”), but “purge” is certainly not a reasonable translation into modern English of aspergo –ere. The Adoration at the induing of the Vestments. An adaptation of a prayer in the Key of Solomon. Another version occurs in the Heptameron; one almost identically worded to the Goëtia in one of the magical texts interpolated into the 1665 third edition of Scot’s Discoverie of Witchcraft. The Conjuration to call forth any of the aforesaid Spirits. Passages in this and the second conjuration closely parallel many elements of two of the conjurations in the Heptameron (which in turn probably derived from earlier Solomonic texts; in particular the series of divine names which Moses and others are said to have invoked to bring down the plagues on Egypt and work other wonders, is analagous though not identical to a long section in the “stronger and more potent conjuration” in the Clavicle). Re Mathers’ third note to the second conjuration; the Heptameron has et per sedem Adonai. ICTROS is probably a corruption of ISCHUROS (Grk., “mighty”); pseudo-Abano has et per O THEOS [God], ISCYROS [Mighty], ATHANATOS [Deathless], PARACLETOS [Assistant (or Intercessor)] in place of the two sets of three Greek names following “by the Seat of ADONAI.” The Constraint. “PREYAI or PRERAI” etc. is a classic example of the pernicious tendency of scribal glosses or notes to be incorporated into the text of repeatedly copied documents (cf. I John V, 7-8): in the hypothetical original of that conjuration, one of the names would have been written. The gloss could mean that in one codex the word was ambiguous due to poor handwriting and so could have been either, or that the scribe (possibly Mathers) had access to multiple codices some giving one reading, some the other. In actual practice only one name should be used (it probably doesn’t matter which since they are all horribly corrupted in any case). AYE, SARAYÉ is probably a corruption of EHEYEH ASHER EHEYEH (hyha rca hyha). The Address unto the Spirit on his coming. Again, adapted from speeches in the Heptameron. Pseudo-Abano has conclusionem (probably best translated “doom”) rather than ‘confusion’ (one MS. of the Goetia has ‘conclusion’). “Bathal or Vathat” is probably another example of duplication from scribal gloss (pseduo-Abano has Bathat, vel Vachat; some MSS. have just “Bathat”). Crowley’s note (handwritten into his personal copy) hinges on a point of Latin grammar. Explanation of Certain Names. This occurs on the final leaf of Sloane 2731, which Ben Rowe identifies with the Ars Nova, suggesting that rather than being an ‘explanation’ of anything, it is a prayer to be said either while writing out the circle and triangle, or in consecrating the place of working. It will be noted that besides several names being miscopied a number are omitted altogether, possibly because the author of this piece was working from a defective version of the figure of the Circle."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 81Ye Conjurations of ye Booke Goetia ... rendered into ye Magicall or Angelike Language. This “Magicall or Angelike Language” is the Angelic language, called Enochian by modern occultists, which emerged from the ceremonial skrying of John Dee and Edward Kelly in the 1580’s. Through the mediumship of Kelly, Dee received nineteen invocations or “Keys” in this language, together with their English translations. The extant vocabulary is comparatively small, of the order of a few hundred words, but sufficient to allow magicians to compose new conjurations (as well as bad puns and erotic poetry), albeit in what one suspects is an awkward pidgin form of the language. The orthography used here is a semi-phonetic spelling, following rules employed in the Golden Dawn; while the Angelic language does contain definite vowel letters, many words are impronouncable without the insertion of additional vowel sounds. ‘Z’ is expanded into ‘zod’ or ‘zoda’. These versions of the conjurations were omitted in the de Lawrence piracy; the 1995 Weiser “second edition” of the Goetia added an analysis and correction. It is here omitted; bar the correction of a few obvious typographical errors the intralineal Enochian-English conjurations are reproduced as they appear in facsimiles of the first edition; the student who wishes to conduct a deeper study of this aspect is referred to The Complete Enochian Dictionary by Donald Laycock (Askin, 1978; Weiser, 1994). Crowley additionally copied the first two Angelic ‘Keys’ with English translation onto the back endpapers of his personal copy; they are reproduced in the First Impressions edition. Second Conjuration: For “caelazod” for “firmament of wrath” read “caelazod vonupeho” (calz vonpho). Crowley apparently miscopied the First Key, as this error appears in Liber Chanokh and the version of the Key handwritten into his copy of the Goëtia as well. “zodimibe” (?zimb) for “veil” is not elsewhere attested. Possibly an error for, or modification of, zimz, glossed ‘vestures’ in the First Key. Invocation of the King: “bobanu” (?bobn) for “West” is not attested in the Dee material; in the Ninth Key, soboln (sobolanu) is glossed “in the West.” In so far as the Angelic nouns appear to be at least partially declined, it also should be noted that babage is glossed “in the South” in the Fourth and Twelfth Keys, but babegen “of the South” in the Thirteenth. Enochian names according to ranks of the spirits (these are mostly explained by the planetary attributions): Knights: pu-imé. pu-im, glossed “sharp sickles” in the Third Key. Prelates: tabaame. Probably an error for, or variant of, tabaan (taba-anu), glossed “governer” in the Fifteenth key. Earls: nazodapesad. nazpsad, glossed “sword” in the First Key. Kings: roré. ror, glossed “the sun” in the First Key. Dukes: oheloka. Possibly an error for obloc (obeloca), glossed “garland” in the Sixth Key. Presidents: balazodareji. balzarg, glossed “stuards” (stewards) in the Third Key. Marquises: geraa. graa, glossed “the moon” in the First Key. *** ***** ***"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 82 GOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASAL OMONI SREGISGOET GOETIA IAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGISGOETIAVELCLAVICULASALOMONISREGIS"}]
