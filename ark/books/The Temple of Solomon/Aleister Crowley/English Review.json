The very name, pronounce it as you will for I am surehe did, as the whim or poetic need demanded, conjures in the minds ofmost practices of black magic, people driven to drink or madness, sexualdebauchery and drug abuse. However, these images are evoked by the slan-derous lies attached to the man’s name and his work which necessarily threat-ens the very fabric of existence for some, exposing religious con-games andso-called “scientific” dogma. These images are promoted by the sensational-istic writers whose need for notoriety and profit far exceeds their concern forthe truth. Most of all ignorance is to blame for these false images. The igno-rance of those who would vilify the name of Aleister Crowley, and the igno-rance of those who accept such falsehoods as truth and continue to spreadthem further without going to the trouble of carefully studying for them-selves the life, personality and work of the man himself. If this is done, hon-estly, objectively, then one is bound to achieve a profound revelation. Aleis-ter Crowley did not practice black magic. He abhorred it. Yet he also recog-nized the fact that such things as good and evil are very often, if not always,extremely relative points of view. Most certainly to the Roman Catholic priest-hood, for instance, the philosophy that A. C. established in the world, Thelema,is the most abominable “black magic” imaginable for it teaches men andwomen how to be free and self-governing rather than subservient to the dic-tates of one man, cloistered in Rome and out of touch with reality, woefullyliving in a mediaeval mindset. To the Pope and others of today’s “orthodox”religions, crumbling before our very eyes, Thelema is a heresy for it teachesthat what Jesus and other prophets were we can all become. That is to say, wecan all realize the divine within us. The Thelemite is not enslaved by a list ofThou Shalt Nots which have no relevance to the needs of today’s world, andthere is no need to ask for priestly mediation between oneself and ones Godfor the Thelemite achieves God Realization for him- or herself, recognizingthat no mediator can do this for anyone.If individuals that Crowley was once associated with eventually went mador enslaved themselves to drug or drink we can no more blame him for theirpersonal choices than we can blame ourselves for the ill fates some of ourassociates in life have fallen prey to. No one can drive another mad. No onecan drive another to alcohol or drug abuse. One makes ones own choices in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"66life. Crowley did not teach a scapegoat philosophy in which someone orsomething else is blamed for ones own failures and self-destructive choicesin life. Crowley taught self-reliance and personal responsibility. Do not ex-pect someone else, man, woman or god, to save your soul. Take the responsi-bility for your own choices, your own actions, and if it needs saving, saveyour own soul.Sexual debauchery and drug abuse? Crowley experimented with both sexand drugs. Much is made of it. Yet if one has lived through the sixties and theseventies as I have, reading what Crowley actually did as well as what manypeople say he did, one can only smile, shrug ones shoulders, and say “Wellthat’s not so bad!”Aleister Crowley. Black magician? Sexual deviate? Drug fiend? Absolutelynot. I will not bore you with details of when and where he was born, hisupbringing and education. You can find this information in hundreds of places— and most times the information is relatively accurate. Exactly who andwhat Crowley was (and to some of us still is) goes beyond mere dates andhistorical facts. He was a poet and a mountain climber as well as an explorerwho not only travelled the world but delved into the very deepest reaches ofthe human psyche, aided by religion, science, philosophy, psychology, andyes, sex and drugs. His magick, Thelema, is a pure and direct route to therealization of ones own divinity and ones place in the scheme of things aswell as the worth of others and the world upon which we live. The Devil isnot the god of Thelema. It is the Anti-god of Christianity, the ultimate scape-goat upon which human failings and bad human behaviour is blamed. AndAleister Crowley was not that devil. He was above all, first and foremost, aMan.If an individual discovers his or her True Will, ones purpose for existence,which is to say the Universal Will, then freedom cannot lead to slavery. In-deed, Aleister Crowley taught that only through freedom, the freedom to doas one will so long as it does not interfere with the freedom of another, canone discover ones own True Will and achieve genuine liberation for oneselfand all of humanity. Such a philosophy can only be seen as “black magic” bythe slavemasters who would, for their own profit, enslave humankind viadrugs, money, religion, or a thousand other chains that bind, so that otherswill do their will, serving the petty desires of the slavemasters.In this humble booklet a handful of articles which originally appeared inThe English Review, written by Aleister Crowley, well represent the man. Tounderstand and appreciate them one needs only to relax, be receptive andobjective, and have enough of a sense of humor to know when Crowley wasINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"77EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWwriting with tongue tucked firmly in cheek. But do not make the mistake ofmany! Joking or not, Crowley was always making a serious point. Pay atten-tion! Think! Never allow others to do your thinking for you, for if you do youmake of yourself a slave and give up your rights to freedom.In Percy Bysshe Shelley the poet he admired is praised. However, there ismore to this article than mere praise of a genius and literary hero, and it is upto the reader to squeeze from this writing every ounce of its worth.The Crisis in Freemasonry is Crowley’s commentary on the lamentablestate of affairs of a fraternity that knows little fraternity, arguing over juris-diction, embroiled in secret signs, handshakes, steps and other formalitieswhile forgetting the purpose for these and indeed Freemasonry as a whole,and it is suggested that perhaps the whole rigmarole should be left behind asa part of history so that the seekers after truth and fraternity may move on tomore fertile ground.The Great Drug Delusion and The Drug Panic, with characteristic goodhumour, takes the responsibility for addiction off of the shoulders of the oldscapegoat (pharmakos), the drug (pharmakon), and places it squarely uponthe shoulders of those who are really responsible for “the drug crisis” —those who would rob all of us of our freedom and liberty as well as those whocreate the needs and desires through prohibition that provide the businessfor the black market profiteers, dealers and organized crime. Today’s “Waron Drugs” should be a war on religious, intellectual and emotional enslave-ment. Drugs are not the cause of abuse, they are the effect. If we could all butlive in genuine freedom, allowed to live as is natural for us, allowed to real-ize our own self-worth, there would be no desire for things which give onethe illusion of freedom. If art were truly free from censorship and banning sothat ideals were free for all to explore and accept or reject as we will; if theUnited States Constitution truly applied to all people, if committed and lov-ing same-sex relationships were given the same legal recognition and rightsas heterosexual marriages, many of which are not nearly half as committedas some same-sex unions, if people were allowed to be who they are withouthaving shame and guilt thrust upon them by a forbidding society ruled by anirrationally intolerant, hypocritical, god-defaming religious hierarchy with adesire to use basic needs to control others, then the need for the false free-doms and momentary illusions of liberation that drugs are most often mis-used for would vanish. True freedom would eliminate most of the interest inheroin, cocaine, crack, marijuana and the rest so that only those relativelyfew individuals interested in carefully and scientifically experimenting withthese substances for psychological and philosophical research would have"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"88any interest at all.Aleister Crowley did not advocate drug use. He is certainly opposed todrug abuse. Crowley advocates taking responsibility for ones own actions.Crowley advocates freedom for all — freedom to choose for oneself what isand what is not right for oneself. Governmental regulations should always bekept to the strict minimum for the sake of public safety alone and not abusedas an absolute rule for everyone, everywhere, at all times.And finally there is The Jewish Problem Re-Stated. Here is where Crowleyreally sticks his neck out for anything that can in any way be misconstrued asanti-Semitism damns one for all eternity to harsh criticism, deserved or not.It would be best if you simply read this article carefully and decide for your-self to agree or disagree. There is, however, one thing I would like to say,mostly by way of quotation, regarding the lie that Aleister Crowley, a manwhom I look up to, and Sir Richard Burton before him, one of Crowley’s rolemodels, were anti-Semitic. They were not. Quite the contrary, in fact, and thevery tone of The Jewish Problem Re-Stated shows A. C.’s love of Jewishculture, philosophy and spirit.Edward Rice in his biography Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton (CharlesScribner’s Sons, New York, 1990 E.V.) tells us that after Burton’s ambitionshad been thwarted “The anger and hurt continued to smolder, and though hehad been attacked by parties representing all faiths — some honest men,some scoundrels — he began to develop a dislike of the Jews, for he felt thathe had been betrayed by men like Sir Francis Goldsmid and Sir MosesMontefiore,” yet “in 1869, he had said, ‘Had I a choice of race, there is noneto which I would more willingly belong than the Jewish,’ ” and he spokehighly of the Jewish race and its culture, so highly, with so much sincererespect, that it should be easy for anyone to forgive anything he may havewritten or said after not only being hurt, but betrayed, his high praise seem-ingly thrown back into his face so that he felt bitter disappointment in thosewhom he loved.As for Aleister Crowley himself, this is just one thing he had to say in his“autohagiography”, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley (Hill and Wang,New York, 1969 E.V.) — italics mine:I am not a snob or a puritan, but Eurasians do get on my nerves. I do notbelieve that their universally admitted baseness is due to a mixture of bloodor the presumable peculiarity of their parents; but that they are forced intovileness by the attitude of both their white and coloured neighbours. Asimilar case is presented by the Jew, who really does only too often possessINTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"99EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWthe bad qualities for which he is disliked; but they are not proper to hisrace. No people can show finer specimens of humanity. The Hebrew poetsand prophets are sublime. The Jewish soldier is courageous, the Jewishrich man generous. The race possesses imagination, romance, loyalty, pro-bity and humanity in an exceptional degree.But the Jew has been persecuted so relentlessly that his survival hasdepended on the development of his worst qualities; avarice, servility, false-ness, cunning and the rest. ... The irrationality and injustice of theirneighbours heightens the feeling (of “the shame of being considered out-casts”) and it breeds the very abominations which the snobbish inhuman-ity of their fellow-men expects of them.Aleister Crowley demanded freedom for all. No one person can agree withabsolutely everything any other person says, but the writings of a man likeCrowley deserve a fair, objective and careful study, his words weighed withreason and common sense.And I, alas, should practice the fine art of brevity. I fear I have taxed myeditor’s patience, finding my literary feet again firmly planted on that wellworn soap box I have carried around with me for the past forty-five years,and I have gone against my own words when I told him “I will make it brieffor introductions to a great man’s work should be brief.” Well, after all, forme this is brief.Love is the law, love under will.G. M. KELLYMarch 1996 E.V.Anno XCII, A in a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1010THE GREAT DRUG DELUSIONBy a New York SpecialistPROFESSOR FREUD and M. Emile Coué have both pointed out, in similarlanguage, despite their different techniques, the same fact about the identityof fear and fascination. It is a commonplace in the daily observation of thepractising psychologist. As soon as an obstacle is realised as such, we makefrantic efforts to avoid it, with the result that we bump into it. Psychicalimpotence is in the experience of most men; it is the same thing in terms ofanother problem.Now the present craze for taking “habit-forming drugs” (so-called) andthe suggested remedies, are closely bound up with this curious phenomenon.The will behaves like a mule, and the imagination like a bird in the presenceof a serpent.In the spring of 1914 I had occasion to study the effects of cocaine. As ithappened, I had access to all the “fast” or “Bohemian” sets in London. I wentthrough them with a tooth-comb; and in three months managed to discovertwo girls who were indulging in that drug to a deleterious extent. Today, onemight almost say that no tea-party is complete without it.My investigations were cut short by the war; I was obliged to return to theUnited States. I had therefore no opportunity of observing the cause of thechange. My English colleagues, however, attribute the present situation totwo main factors: (a) the widespread outbreak of psychoses and neuroses dueto public anxiety and stress, and the consequent demand for something whichwould dull the nerves; (b) the D.O.R.A. restrictions on the sale of liquor. Iagree that both these factors were potent; they square with our own experi-ence in America. There drug-habits have been common for many years; forthe people of the United States are naturally afflicted with the nervous diathesis.This is due partly to the climate, which is electrically charged in a way whichEuropeans cannot possibly understand until they have tried it, and partly tothe fact that education is so widespread that the people demand art, litera-ture, and music, which things are denied to them by the benevolence of thespiritual heirs of Cotton Mather. No other hypothesis even attempts to ex-plain the Yellow Press, the dancing manias, the crazed search for amusement— and the resort to the waters of Lethe, beginning with cocktails and endingwith cocaine.But prohibition, ineffective as it is, has intensified the demand for drugs;and I am therefore ready to believe that war-time restrictions on the sale of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"1111EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWliquor produced a parallel result in England. I note in passing that the prohi-bition of absinthe in France has resulted in the manufacture of substitutes,some of which will actually eat their way through a marble table.There is, however, a third factor to be considered; and, without going overfrankly to the theories of Nancy, the Salpétrière, Vienna, and Zurich, it maywell be that it is the most important of all. This factor is the nauseating formof publicity given by the newspapers — some even of those which shouldknow better — to the matter. Indulgence in drugs is described with an unholyleer; it is connected lewdly with sexual aberrations; and the reprobation withwhich the writers smear their nastiness is obviously hypocrisy of the mostoily and venal type. The object is to sell the paper by making people’s fleshcreep, like the Fat Boy in Pickwick.Now there is in such articles — which began, I regret to say, with a notuninteresting novel called Felix, by Mr. Robert Hichens — what Baudouincalls a pernicious suggestion. The reader is invited to gloat on the forbiddenfruit. But even worse, from this point of view, is the unanimous assertion thatonce anybody starts to take a “drug” he cannot possibly stop of his own freewill, and is only to be rescued at the cost of unutterable torments. Medicaltreatises on the subject, with no exception so far as I know, perpetuate thiswicked libel on the divine prerogative of man to do what he wills, and, whenhe wills, to stop doing. Writers of fiction follow the evil precedent. The ex-ception to this rule is The Hasheesh-Eater, by H. G. Ludlow, in which theauthor (who lived on the Hudson near Poughkeepsie) describes his addictionto that drug, and his cure by his unaided determination.Such cases are, however, common enough; but the strong-minded neverreach the clinic of the physician, and are consequently ignored by him.There are, in fact, three main classes of men and women.1. Afraid to experiment with anything, lest ——.2. Enslaved by anything that appeals to them.3. Able to use anything without damaging themselves.I hesitate to admit either of the two former classes to the title of Freeman.Since the year 1898 I have been principally occupied in studying the effectsof various drugs upon the human organism, with special reference to theparallelisms between the psychical phenomena of drug-neuroses, insanities,and mystical illuminations. The main object has been to see whether it ispossible to produce the indubitably useful (see William James, Varieties ofReligious Experience) results of “ecstasy” in the laboratory. In pursuit of thislaudable aim, I attempted to produce a “drug-habit” in myself. In vain. Mywife literally nagged me about it: “Don’t go out without your cocaine, sweet-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1212heart!” or “Did you remember to take your heroin before lunch, big boy?” Ireached the stage where one takes a sniff of cocaine every five minutes or soall day long; but though I obtained definitely toxic results, I was always ableto abandon the drug without a pang. These experiments simply confirmedthe conclusion which I had already adopted, provisionally, on theoreticalgrounds: that busy people, interested in life and in their work, simply cannotfind the time to keep on with a drug. As Baudelaire says: A perfect debauchrequires perfect leisure. A prominent newspaper correspondent of my ac-quaintance had actually reached a stage where the privation of opium wastorture to him. The stress of the war threw additional work on him; but in-stead of accentuating his need, it made it impossible for him to find the timeto smoke. “Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do” is soundpsychology. A colleague of my own, who participated in my experiments,found himself on several occasions “in the clutches of the drug-fiend.” Butthose occasions were all characterised by one fact: he was, for external rea-sons, at a deadlock with his work. He had nothing to do but to think about thedrug, and his mind was flooded with “pernicious suggestions” that he couldnot stop it. Every trifling malaise was unhesitatingly attributed either to theeffects of the drug or those of trying to stop it! Just so the young man who wasreading Middlemarch fell downstairs and broke his leg — and blamed thelaw of gravity instead of George Eliot!It is not contended here that the physiological theory of “toleration” isuntrue. No doubt the nerves do, more or less, “shriek for their accustomedstimulus,” as the foolish physician usually tells his victim — apparently withthe hope of removing any traces of self-confidence or will-power that he maypossess. But, within limits, an average brave and resolute man can arrangethe details of his “cure,” and carry them out with success. The nerves, too,can be fooled to some extent. A member of the Himalayan Expedition of1902 has put it on record that when he was starved in respect of his sugar-ration he suffered the most intolerable tortures. The body agreed with him sofar as to furnish almost continuous spasms of nausea and diarrhœa. But onsweetening his tea with saccharine, the symptoms almost completely disap-peared: the “suggestion” of sugar, although he knew it was only a sugges-tion, sufficed to delude his physiological “Chorus of Troezenian Women.”Now if there be one thing certain in this complex world it is this: thatmoral maladies require moral therapeutics. The present system of “perni-cious suggestion,” backed by prohibition, which insults the free will anddignity of mankind, which offers princely opportunities to illicit traffic andblackmail, makes the situation worse every month.THE GREAT DRUG DELUSION"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1313EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWIn Harlem, a district of New York corresponding roughly to a combinationof Bayswater and Brixton, there are, by police statistics, over 17,000 schoolchildren addicted to heroin. In this particular case the cause is simple enough.An enterprising firm of doubtless God-fearing chemical manufacturers sentout agents to distribute the drug gratis to the children. Having established the“habit,” the agents next demanded an ever-increasing price, and when theyhad extracted the last mil from the tortured innocents, told them to steal, rob,and murder in order to get the “mazuma” for the “dope.” (The “addict” isnotoriously fertile in expedients for obtaining supplies of his drug.) Abomi-nations of this sort are only possible when the course of nature is violentlydiverted by pious Puritans and profiteering policemen. Nobody troubled aboutheroin when is was almost as easy and as cheap to buy as butter. To-day,despite repressive legislation, there is an international industry making itsmany thousands per cent. on an enormous turnover, and occasionally throw-ing some peddling Jonah overboard when some brainless dancing girl hap-pens to kill herself. What better could she do? And the police want “addi-tional powers.” Of course they do. They envy the Beckers of New York, thearbitrary irresponsible gangs of uniformed grafters, in league with every formof criminal, from the white slaver to the gambler and the gunman. If thepeople of England want to see their cities in the hands of petty tyranny pat-ting the paunch of corruption, well and good, “strengthen the Act!”*There has been so much delirious nonsense written about drugs that sanemen may well despair of seeing the light.But it ought to be obvious that if England reverted to pre-war conditions,when any responsible person (by signing his name in a book) could buydrugs at a fair profit on cost price, cocaine (say) at 16s. and heroin at 20s. thebottle of 10 grammes — instead of as many pounds — the whole under-ground traffic would disappear like a bad dream.It is possible, perhaps even probable, that for a month or two there wouldbe an increase in the number of fools who killed themselves in their folly,though personally I doubt it. But I have no shame in saying that, after a warin which we sent our sturdiest sons as sheep to the slaughter, we should notmiss a few score wasters too stupid to know when to stop.

Cures of this sort are naturally permanent, whereas the possible suppressionof the drug fails to remove the original causes of the habit, so that relapse is the rule.THE GREAT DRUG DELUSION"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1515EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWPERCY BYSSHE SHELLEYBy Prometheus“O! like a rose-wing’d pelicanShe hath bred blessèd babes to Pan!”— The Wizard Way.IN a story by Lord Dunsany Fame says to the poet, “I will meet you in thegraveyard at the back of the Workhouse in a hundred years.” If Shelley hasbeen more fortunate — though it hardly matters to him! — it is not on ac-count of his poetry, which passed as readable even among his contemporarydetractors, but of his prophetic gift and the moral wizardry which gave itsspirit body, in face of those qualities which made serious people considerseriously that in him Diabolus incarnatus est, et homo factus est.It seems at first sight astounding that Shelley was sent down from Oxfordfor theological views which are accepted to-day by the youngest average un-dergraduate with scarce a mumbled protest from the oldest average don; thathe should have been robbed of his children on account of a moral attitudewhich modern children themselves find reactionary rather then advanced;and that he should have been practically exiled from England because ofpolitical notions which the most case-hardened Tory of to-day would hardlydare to whisper in the gloom of his club.The truth is that the “Sun-treader” (as Browning calls him in Pauline)happened to be on the crest of a true dawn. The world, save for sporadicoutbreaks of Bourbon folie des grandeurs, has rolled steadily towards thatslight, shrill angel figure in the East. The poetry of Shelley hardly matters, ina sense, by comparison with his ethical ideals. He was the voice of the Zeit-geist; and it is relatively unimportant that it should have been, to Englishears, so matchlessly musical.Many of the best judges of poetry prefer Keats to Shelley; but the verdictimplies purism. A poet is one who “makes” or “does” things, and Keats waspreoccupied with eternal “Truth-Beauty” — to coin a term like the “Space-Time” of Einstein — of a far less potent and intricate quality.In Egyptian lore Tahuti, the god of language, is also the god of wisdom andof creative thought; the word “gramareye” (dear to Sir Walter Scott) is in-deed, like the French word grimoire, etymologically equivalent to “gram-mar.” Poets must not be ranked by their lyrical exaltation any more than bytheir technical ability: wisdom is justified of her children, and a poet of his!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1616The children of Keats are people like Rossetti, Walter Pater, Oscar Wilde,whose eyes were fixed sadly and languorously on the sunset of things.But the spilth of Shelley’s seed flooded foreign and innumerable fields:James Thompson, Swinburne, and other poets of revolution and passion areonly a minor branch of his great family. The reformers, the humanitarians,the feminists, the transcendentalists, from Bradlaugh and Huxley to Nietzscheand Anna Kingsford, were all suckled on that pale gold wine of Dionysuswhich issued from his martyred veins. The young lady was within her rightswhen she asked “What are Keats?”; and if she was a wise child she knew herown father to be Shelley.Keats remains perfect and imperishable like his own Greek Vase; he is thechief treasure of the Museum of Humanity; but Shelley is the High Priest ofthe Temple of Spiritual Progress, the Prophet of the most High God of Free-dom, and the King of the Republic of “gentleness, wisdom, virtue, and en-durance.”He is dynamic as Keats is static; and the nature of the Universe is Becom-ing rather than Being. The nineteenth century stripped the gilded rags ofreligion from the mummy of existence, and found a crumbling corpse, butthe twentieth sees that dust dissolve into a glittering film of motion and light.Modern physical and mathematical research are making it clearer everyday that the structure of matter is indeed that subtle spiritual vibration whichShelley perceived it to be. By a parallel argument, man himself is no longerconceived as a fixed quantity established in a world six thousand years old,and subject to a single law. He is an immutable Essence indeed, perhaps, insome ultimate spiritual sense, but his manifestation is mutable; his sensibleform is a vehicle of Energy surging in infinite variety against the shores ofexperience. Shelley speaks of an immanent Spirit of the Universe, and issufficiently a Pantheist to have identified himself, or any other existing thing,with that Spirit, had he been challenged directly on the point by, let us say,Mr. Eddington or Mr. Bertrand Russell. If Shelley is not always explicitly inline with the latest mathematico-mystical thinkers, it is because the worldwas so far behind his intuitive perception of truth that there was no intellec-tual instrument capable of registering his vibrations, except possibly theambiguous jargon of the school of Fludd. But he everywhere implies, moreby the sheer form and tone of his verses than by their rational meaning, thatexistence is an unconditioned Unity (or Nihil), which has invented infinitemodes of phantasmal and illusory duality for the purpose of becoming con-scious of itself. It is not necessary for an animal to use our arbitrary languageto express its feelings intelligibly; and, in point of fact, poets who have madePERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1717EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWthe attempt to explain their spiritual consciousness in terms of philosophyhave obscured their light rather than made it manifest. Blake is a notableexample of this circumstance. We learn more of the essence of his soul-struc-ture from Tiger, Tiger, The Crystal Cabinet, or The Mental Traveller than wedo from his professedly “prophetic” books. The English language, as under-stood by scholars and developed by them, is an instrument of doubtful valueto the poet. The soul of man lurks rather in the lilt of a lyric than in the mostimposing lavallière that glitters on the velvet of the shop-window of literaryeffort.Now Shelley was saturated with the spirit of the planet in its subtlest andstrongest distillation: and that spirit overflowed into song. He possessed theutter simplicity and self-confidence of an immortal; if our ears are attuned tohis thought, we can catch the choral rapture as it swings with the stars throughthe centuries. But his conscious efforts to express his essential idea are rela-tively lame.Identical phenomena occur in every connection; and this is the ultimatereason for the apparent failure of the poet to maintain his hold on our heartsas we reach an age when our spirits are less sensitive to subtle and subcon-scious stress. Mr. Augustine Birrell remarks that Browning in later life losthis enthusiasm for this “strange and unaccountable being.” We are not all,fortunately, so middle-class and middle-aged as either of these gentlemen;but, even so, it is hard to read Shelley with enjoyment after one has turnedforty. The reason, however, is this: one either has or has not assimilated theUnconscious of the poet in one’s youth; in the one case the verse seems amere husk, while in the other it screams the doom of spiritual death. Thedamned detest him, therefore, and the redeemed can only find pleasure inremembering the raptures which wrought the white-hot steel of their youthinto the shapes of royalty and righteousness.It is in the nature of things that even the greatest intellectual attempts tograpple with any given problem appear ill-adjusted in after years; for thethought has been frozen into crystalline beauty, while the problem has changedwith the succession of suns. It is always an error for an artist to abdicate histhrone in eternity in order to enter the lists of temporal things: ne sutor ultracrepidam. Few people, even among philosophers, seem to understand thateternity differs in quality from time. It is commonly supposed to be a mereunlimited extension thereof. Yet the consideration that time is but one of theconditions of dualistic consciousness ought to make the true aspect of thematter immediately apparent.

When, therefore, Shelley says“Next came Fraud, and he had on,Like Eldon, an ermined gown”he risks his intelligibility only in a slightly less degree than Mr. Frankau inOne of Us, or the ephemeral leader-writer of this Ile des Diurnales. Eldon isalready for us merely a judge who happened to annoy Shelley. One of Us is avery valuable historical document, of its kind, but the more it is history theless it is literature. It has already become difficult to identify the mournersfor Adonais, immortals though they be. And Shelley was pre-eminently the“Sun-treader”: — he should have remembered Phaeton.Much, however, of this defect of Shelley is inseparable from his supremequality as a technician. He was the first to realise the rhythmical power of theintonation of the English language, to see in it an armoury of striking andstabbing weapons. Shakespeare, with all his vigorous rhetoric, never under-stood the possibilities of pure form to play upon the passions; he trusted tothe rational meaning of the words themselves. Milton made but a slight ad-vance in this respect. Samuel Butler forged a hammer of the rhythm ofHudibras; but the stroke does not vary. Some of Shelley’s contemporariesmade the way plain for him by introducing freedom of metre; but none ofthem, not even Byron, was able to consummate the marriage of poetry andmusic. The result of the alliance was to unite the intellectual and emotionalpower of words with the direct spiritual action on the nerves which even theWest African drum or the Papuan bull-roarer can exercise.It is not too much to say, therefore, that Shelley was to the RevolutionaryEpoch what Shakespeare was to the Renaissance. He created, in fact, a newheavens and a new earth of language. The perfection of Keats, the sublimityof Blake, the simplicity of Wordsworth, the mystery of Coleridge, the inde-pendence of Byron: these are feathers in the scale against the sword of Shelley.For language is the word which “was with God,” and “was God”; it is themost intimate sheath of the soul, its first and simplest expression. The cre-ation of a new language is therefore a stupendously significant event in thehistory of a planet, as important as the invention of the wheel, or the discov-ery of a fundamental principle in Nature. The influence of Shakespeare andthe Bible is due not to their contents, or even their style, but to their havingconferred upon the English people a new intellectual instrument. We are notyet at a sufficient distance from Shelley to estimate the real effect of his work.PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1919EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWWe are apt to be misled: we observe the triumph of many of his ideas, andassociate that phenomenon with his success.

But the advance inthe development of the larynx marks off definitely man from monkey, andthe perfecting of the weapon of speech by Shelley made the essential differ-ence between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in England. The issueis masked for the moment by the Press. The English language is fallen intodisrepute and impotence. But the wood pulp period of brain and paper willsoon pass. Unless England is destroyed altogether by the vermin that aregnawing at her entrails, unless the speech of the greatest minds on earthsince the Fall of Rome is rotted through by the cancer of senseless slang,venal vulgarity, alien abominations, the weapon of Shelley will wing its waythrough the centuries, and enable mind to inform mind by virtue of subtlecadences, harmonies, and hammer-strokes.That is, above all, the problem of the day, now that the “hard facts” ofmaterialism are thawing into a gossamer dew.

Joel Blau, of Temple Peni-El, New York City, which recently ap-peared in The Atlantic Monthly, posed the Jewish problem in new dimen-sions. In America, where this problem is growing acute, wide interest wasaroused. I quote a few passages which are characteristic.“It is depressing to see the Jewish problem discussed, even by Jews, from without and not fromwithin, as if its inner aspect did not matter; at all events, as if this were something in which the worldat large need take no interest, it being the concern of a few Jewish zealots only. Over against thismistaken position these very Jewish zealots, who are far from obsolete, claim that the only way tosolve the Jewish problem is from within. Find the right solution for the internal problem of the Jew,and the external problem, created by the persistence of anti-Semitism, will solve itself.”“... he [the Pharisee] would rather lose the whole world than lose aught of the riches of his soul.“... As for pride, he admits it, yet holds himself guiltless. For pride is no sin, except when one willnot live up to it.“It [pride] is compounded of a clear knowledge of one’s place, a consciousness of both powers andlimitations, and a desire to participate wholeheartedly in the passionate business of living. This prideis the child of reverence, the last summing-up of the sanctities of Individuality.“Its presence is the distinguishing sign of divinely stubborn men, ‘terribly meek,’ who inherit theearth — and heaven, too.“Of peoples too, even as of persons, the same holds true; modesty is a sin in any people. The chiefduty that a people owes both itself and the world is reverence for its own soul, the mystic centre of itsbeing....“Personality spells the mystery of mysteries — the last word of life for which all the worlds and allthe ages are in ceaseless travail.”“The Jew must be led back to the Discovery of the Jewish Soul.”Despite these utterances, we find elsewhere in the essay that the only prac-tical solution in view is repatriation. A physical Zion is contemplated, andthis proposal implies the very materialism which the learned Rabbi deploresas the mark of the modern Sadducee. Now the division between Jew andGentile dates only from Abraham. The children of uncircumcision no lessthan those of the Covenant are of the seed of Adam, of mankind. It was bymeans of the secret tradition of the Hebrews that the leader of the hosts of thenew Law obtained “the knowledge and conversation of his Holy GuardianAngel,” whose words constitute the whole Law. This Law is the master-keyto the Future of Mankind, and the learned Rabbi, being a master in Israel, isable to interpret the Zeitgeist intuitively. Accordingly, he exhibits a profound"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2121EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWcomprehension of this Law; indeed, he actually expresses some of its corol-laries in various phrases. What then is the one weakness of his admirableessay? What is it that compels him to a sceptical conclusion, despite thesublimity of courage, pride, and sadness which informs his thought, and themagistral grasp of the situation? These qualities demand consummate re-spect; and yet their owner hesitates to articulate an “Everlasting Yea.” Thedifficulty arises from the interference of the learned Rabbi’s intellectual per-ception of the conditions of his environment with the truth of his soul. Hemust hold fast to this truth if it is to make him free. The Relative must not beapplied as a measure of the Absolute, of which it is but one of the infinitelynumerous symbolic representations. It is, then, here that the Rev. Joel Blau istempted to lose touch with the essential truth. He has still to pass through theordeal of being attacked by phenomena which threaten or allure, seeking toturn him from his spiritual integrity. It is the task of the initiate to learn toignore these seeming facts, to recognise that these are vapours of the void.Let me say at once that the Jewish spirit cannot be destroyed any more than agrain of sand or an ohm of electrical resistance. The problem is perennial. Ifevery Jew were instantaneously abolished, the Jewish problem* would re-main unaltered.The Rev. Joel Blau had himself demonstrated, with admirable clearness,that the “extraversion” of modern Sadducees has merely defiled their honour,and that reliance upon outworn formalism has failed to protect the integrityof the Pharisees.When Moses gave His new Law, His was the Word which expressed thespiritual truth fit for that age and that folk. Other Masters have appearedfrom time to time with other words. Thus the Buddha, proclaiming the ab-sence of Atman, emancipated the East from its time-rotted conditions.Mohammed, with His Word Allah, proclaimed a new æon in which the di-versity of phenomena should be referred to a single ultimate source.The solution of the Jewish Question has baffled society completely since* The historical aspect of this doctrine may be elucidated briefly as follows: — In the dawn ofhistory we have the Pagan period, when the central object of worship is Isis (or similar idea) theMother. Matriarchy abounds; the function of Man in reproduction is not understood. Then comes aperiod in which the Father is the main object of worship. We have Solar-Phallic religions, in whichthe Sun, and Man, must die to live again. Science has now shown that the Sun, and is showing thatMan, does not “die”; darkness is due to our being in the shadow of the earth; death to our being veiledfrom our Reality by our gross bodies. The New Law proclaims the Crowned and Conquering Childas the central idea which represents That Which Is.This subject is discussed at great length in The Equinox, Vol. I., Nos. I.-X., and Vol. III., No. I., inThe Book of Lies, in The Star in the West, by Capt. (now Col.) J. F. C. Fuller, and elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2222the earliest records. It is quite evident that before the Exodus Pharaoh wasconfronted by precisely the same dilemma as the Tsar of yesterday in Russiaand the President of to-day in America. It is the problem of an endothermicchemical compound. The instability of chloride of nitrogen does not lead usto “blame” either the nitrogen or the chlorine; the elements tend to fly apartwith destructive violence because neither of them is satisfying its own truenature to the full. Each has joined the other without enthusiasm because itcould find no more suitable element union with which would fulfil to theuttermost its need of a complement. Nitrogen chloride is not formed if thechlorine passes over moist sodium before reaching the ammonia, or if thatammonia has been mixed with nitric acid.Jew and Gentile have been forced into contact under innumerable varietiesof social condition. Friction has been at a minimum when the Jew has beenin contact either with Arabic civilisation or English jurisprudence. Thesetwo environments have a common factor: non-interference. English indiffer-ence and Moslem self-respect are agreed on the ethical principle: “Mindyour own business.” This is one of the moral postulates of true Law.The incompatibility between Jew and Gentile has been based, superficiallyindeed, upon prejudice, ignorance, and instinctive antipathy; but this seemshardly more than a disguise for the real motive, which may more probably bethe fear of alien aggression. The Jews are charged with many crimes, fromritual murder and usury to lack of patriotism. But all these charges are merelydiverse expressions of the feeling that there is an irreconcilable antagonismbetween two spirits whose juxtaposition is an offence to nature.Is it presumptuous to feel sure that so far one may count upon the assent ofthe learned Rabbi to this analysis? No? Then why not be bold enough toproceed to synthesis? Let us pursue the chemical analogy. In a mixture ofsodium chloride and sodium nitrate the atoms of nitrogen and chlorine areintimately mingled; but there is no tendency to explosion. The reason is thatboth elements have already — in the main matter — fulfilled their own na-tures. Neither is unsatisfied; neither is under stress.Is there no hint here to guide us to a practical proposal? It is useless totinker with the environment of chloride of nitrogen; the more we meddlewith the explosive, the more likely we are to provoke a crisis. We must pre-vent the formation of the substance altogether; and so long as either elementis unsatisfied, so long is there a risk of conditions occurring in which theywill combine disastrously with each other.

The patriotic passion ofthe Chroniclers, the plaintive cries of the Psalmists, the relentless rage of theProphets, the acrid agony of Ecclesiastes, each in its own way expresses thefact that the Jew has always wanted Something desperately, has never knownprecisely what it was, has never fooled himself for very long into fancyingthat he has found it. When national degradation and religious mummifica-tion had reduced the ragged remnant of repatriated refugees to despair, Paulproclaimed his Freudian Phantasm as the Messiah. But in vain did he try toconciliate his people, in vain did he prove that Christ fulfilled the prophe-cies, in vain did he seek to reconcile circumcision and crucifixion. Israelpreferred to die in the dark rather than stumble by the light of corpse-candlesinto the ditch of self-deception.The same spirit stamps the Jew to this day. He has endured every possiblepersecution; without faith, hope, or love to help him. He has not found him-self in wealth, power, or anything else. Neither Spinoza in philosophy, Heinein poetry, nor Einstein in science have found any way of escape from thefiend appointed to scourge Israel. From the most sublime complaints of themusician to the grossest grumblings of the Schnorrer, the same phrase re-curs: it is the cry from the Abyss, the shriek of the lost soul. The glories ofSolomon did not prevent him from seeing the vanity of all things; nor wouldrepatriation in Palestine delude one single Jew into supposing that his soulcould be satisfied by so romantically narcotic a remedy.The solution of the Jewish problem is simply this: “Shiloh shall come.”The Messiah must arise, and His name shall be called Anti-Christ. And thisshall be the sign of the Messiah, Anti-Christ, He who shall lead at last Hispeople Israel into the Holy Mountain, the True Zion: He shall come to under-stand the Magical Formula of Israel; He shall interpret the history of Israel;He shall declare unto Israel the nature of the spirit of the people; He shallexpress the true purpose of His people; He shall demonstrate to them thedirection of their destiny; He shall formulate their function in the physiologyof mankind.It may indeed be that this function is such that even its free fulfilment"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"2424would not satisfy it. He, the Messiah, Anti-Christ, shall know, as others donot, whether it be so. In our own bodies there are principles which nevercease to urge us. The secret of the Soul of Israel may be that it is a ferment;the history of humanity shows us this spirit constantly consuming everycivilisation with which it has been in contact. Israel has corrupted the world,whether by conquest, by conversion, or by conspiracy. The Jew has eaten hisway into everything. The caricature of Semitic thought, Christianity, rottedRoman virtue through introducing the moral subterfuge of vicarious atone-ment. The Eagles of Cæsar degenerated to the draggled buzzards ofConstantine. Soon they were no more than hens, dispersed and devoured bythe fierce hawks of Mohammed and the savage ravens of the North. Jewishcommercial cleverness has created cosmopolitanism. Jewish sympathy withsuffering has made the cliffs of caste to crumble. Jewish ethical exclusive-ness has created a tyranny of conventional formalities to replace the righ-teousness of self-respect. The Jew, living so long on sufferance, by subter-fuge, servility, and self-effacement, has taught his tricks to the whole world.Civilisation is an organised system of craft, concealment, cunning, camou-flage, of cringing cowardice and craven callousness. The world is one greatGhetto. The Jew has failed to realise himself; and, as the learned Rabbi sobrilliantly breaks out at the end of the third paragraph of his article, it is ininfamy that Gentile and Jew are reconciled at last. Gentile and Jew bend onthe same bench of the galley; the same whip drips with blood from the barebacks of the two brothers in bondage. We share the same suffering and shame;we eat the same bitter bread of exile.Neither of us has known who he is, dared to be himself, or willed to do hisWill. Neither has kept the Silence which alone preserved his soul from profa-nation. It was far better when ignorance and prejudice prevailed; we had atleast faith in our own fetiches. It is better to have something that one iswilling to die for, though it be but a lie; to have something to live for, thoughit be but a dream. To-day, Jew and Gentile alike are pursuing despicableobjects by dishonourable devices; and, having attained them, there is disillu-sion, disgust, and despair. We have swept away the superstitions which sus-tained our self-respect. We have discovered that the sun is only one star ofmany; and, perceiving our infinitesimal importance, we have lost our ownrespective stars — our self-esteem.We have still to complete analysis by synthesis.

The honour of each is to secure theharmony of all. It is the most fatal error of modern thought to interpret thedependence of each of us upon the rest as confounding us all in a commonvileness.One may appeal to the learned Rabbi then, out of his own mouth, to acceptthe Law of Thelema* as the foundation of the future of Israel. One may askhim to agree that the salvation of Israel depends upon understanding thespirit of that people in the light of history, ethnology, and psychology. Hav-ing understood its function, and formulated its will in a fixed phrase, it isonly necessary to keep its unswerving course, each Jew as his own soul showshim for himself, and for the race, as the soul of the race is shown him, by thespirit of Anti-Christ, the Messiah, who shall arise in Israel for this purpose.One word in reconciliation of an apparent antinomy. One must not thinkof Anti-Christ as opposed to Christ, any more than one thinks of the pleuraas opposed to the lungs which it bounds. Woman is not the opposite of man— the difference between them is necessary to their co-operation. Without it,neither could reproduce their common elements in either component. Everystar is necessarily different from every other star. The annihilation of onewould disturb the equilibrium of all, and destroy the universe. The Jewishspirit is an essential element of humanity. The pitiable tragedies of the past* This Law may be summarised: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The theory underlying this injunction is that “Every man and every woman is a star.” Each star isequally inviolable, eternal, individual. It has its own proper course through space. This physical facthas its moral parallel in, “There is no law beyond do what thou wilt”; that is to say, every individualhas his own necessary and proper direction, which is called his “true Will.”Similarly, just as there are certain groups of stars, there are groups of human beings which, whilepreserving the individual integrity of each unit, have a certain common direction.It is thus legitimate to calculate the destiny of a race, as the astronomer calculates the course of agalaxy.It is the first business of every individual to discover what his true Will is, and then to occupyhimself to doing that and nothing else. But he must also reckon with the drift of his race and ofhumanity as a whole.As soon as this Law is properly understood, its truth becomes self-evident. To fail to do one’s truewill is to stultify oneself, to create a conflict in oneself, to become morally insane.The school of Freud and Jung has rediscovered a part of this thesis by showing that self-suppres-sion leads to neurosis. The task of every man is to express himself fully, but he must take into consid-eration his relationship with the community, since it is a part of his true Will to be a member thereof;and any act of his which conflicts with the true Will of the community, conflicts to that extent with hisown true Will.This Law of Thelema is therefore the complete solution of all ethical problems.

Mechanics presumes opposition. Structuralisationdepends upon the co-operation of diverse unities, each of which is stubbornlyitself. Evolution is aristocratic. To aim at homogeneity is to revert to nullity.There is then no reason to fear that Anti-Christ, in establishing Israel, willinjure Christianity. He will, on the contrary, assist the Christian spirit tocleanse itself from the confused acquiescence in anarchical amiability whichit calls “charity,” and is really cowardice, really the slave’s shame of his owncondition, the sense of guilt which he soothes by minimising allmisdemeanours.Let Anti-Christ arise, let Him announce to Israel its integrity. Let Himmake clear the past, purged of all tribal jargon; let Him prove plainly howinevitably event came after event. Let Him gather the past to a point; let Himassign its proper position to the present by showing its relation with the axesof Space and Time. Let Him then calculate what forces are focussed at thatpoint, so that its proper course may be thereby determined.

In this matter of theDangerous Drugs Act Parliament seems to have been inspired by ignorancemade deeper by the wildest ravings of that class of newspaper which aspiresto thrill its readers — if reading it can be called — with blood-curdlinghorrors.And here is where the fallacy I mentioned comes in. We are all laudablybusy in “cleaning up” Sin in its hydra-headed and Protean forms. Very good:we hear that a woman abuses morphine, or a man goes mad and destroys hisfamily with an axe.We then argue that as the morphine and the axe can injure society, it mustbe made as difficult as possible for any one to buy these engines of atrocity.No! we do not do so in the case of the axe, because it is obvious to everybodythat there is a large class of very poor men whose livelihood would be takenaway if they could not get axes.Then why does not the same argument apply in the case of the morphine?Because the public is ignorant of the existence of “a large class of very poormen” who would die or go insane if morphine were withheld from them.Bronchitis and asthma, in particular, are extremely common among thelower classes, in consequence of exposure, bad air, and other insanitary con-ditions.

(It is, to begin with, infernally un-Englishand unsportsmanlike to spy upon professional men, the pharmacist as well asthe doctor.) All prescriptions for dangerous drugs are retained by the dis-penser. He can obtain drugs as he requires them from the wholesale houses,and the transfer must be reported to the Central Spy Station.

The spies note the quantities prescribed byeach physician, and sherlock him home. The statistics show that Dr. Blackhas prescribed 2 ounces 3 pennyweights 1 scruple 2#/8 grains of morphiaduring the last month, while Dr. White has only prescribed 4!/6 grains in thesame period. As Dr. White happens to be a kidney, and Dr. Black a cancer,specialist, the anomaly is not so remarkable as it appears to InspectorSmellemout, who has no knowledge of medicine whatever, and cares fornothing but the pleasures of bullying and the hopes of promotion. So he goesto Dr. Black, and warns him! The D. D. Act has nothing before its eyes but a(largely imaginary) class of “addicts.” Dr. Black is suspected of selling pre-scriptions to people who are not in real need of the drug. In America, trapsare laid for doctors. A detective, usually a “lady,” goes to the doctor with afalse story of symptoms read up for the purpose from a medical book. She notimprobably adds to the effect by shameless seduction; and if she gets theprescription, one way or another, the unhappy doctor is “railroaded” to jail.We have not reached that height of civilisation in England as yet; but wehave only to keep on going!Now what is the effect on Dr. Black? He has been, we may suppose, estab-lished as a physician, with perhaps an appointment at a leading hospital, forthe past thirty years. He has found it necessary to prescribe constantly in-creasing doses of morphia — as the only palliative — in hopeless cases ofcancer.

Strange! No law about it yet, either — shame-ful!The upshot of the Inspector’s visit is to make Dr. Black try to prescribe lessmorphia. In other words, the law tries to compel him, under pain of thepossible loss of his reputation or even of his diploma, to violate his oath as aphysician to use his judgement and experience for his patients’ benefit.And meanwhile, Dr. White, that good man, who prescribes so little morphia,has an even better brother, Dr. Snow White, who never prescribes it at all,but, being highly esteemed as a consultant, is often sent for in difficult casesby Continental physicians, and returns to England with a few pounds of vari-ous “Dangerous Drugs” safely bestowed and sells them discreetly at enor-mous prices to his exclusive clientèle of “fast” or “ultra-smart” people abouttown.My colleague from New York was a thousand times right to insist that thewhole question is one of moral education. And what does the D. D. Actactually do? It sets at naught the moral education which no self-respectingphysician or even pharmacist can have failed to acquire during his trainingin science. The Legislature deliberately determines to distrust the very peoplewho are legally responsible for the physical well-being of the nation, andputs them under the thumb of the police, as if they were potential criminals.It makes a diploma waste paper.

But now, apparently with the chari-table design of ensuring that none but the weakest, physically and morally,shall propagate their kind, we send our best men into a type of warfare whereneither courage nor intelligence can be of the slightest avail; we make poli-tics impossible for men of high principle or decent feeling; and we end bytelling those who have risked their lives time and again in the pursuit of thatknowledge which will enable us to prepare a stronger and cleaner race ofmen for the future that they are not to be trusted to prescribe for their ownpatients!We are patient, we physicians, we warriors in an age-long battle againstdisease, ninety-five per cent. of which is the direct result of ignorance, vice,and stupidity; that is perhaps why we remain quiet under the foul and sense-less insult of the Dangerous Drugs Act.But the inhibition acts in another way. Already, just as the best representa-tives of English life refuse to go into politics, we see that the best qualifiedmen and women refuse to be subjected to the ignominy inseparable from theprofession of teaching.Those who are already in the mire prefer to stay there, or feel that there isno way out. But they warn the new-comer against entering.Similarly, if the prestige of the pharmacist is to go, he will be forced toearn his living as he does in America by opening ice-cream-soda fountainsand similar undignified methods of compensating himself for the self-re-spect which insane legislation has torn from him; and the medical professionwill be filled by men who have no true love of knowledge or pity for human-ity, but are in a hurry to put up a brass plate, and push their way to the front.A story to end!

It was a perfect day for a final half round of golf; yet Ashford,plus 2, our captain, had gone up to town, excusing himself, with a certainbrusque solemnity, on the ground that he had to attend Grand Lodge, ofwhich he was, as books of reference attested, V.W.P. Pres. Brd. G. Pur.“Must have cost him over a thousand, one way and another,” remarked along lean sallow man in the corner, who looked as if he had spent most of hislife in the tropics.“Oh, then you are a Mason?” chirped our favourite club Wit, a cross be-tween a magpie and a monkey.“Try me and prove me,” murmured the dark man, without stirring.“I’m the 28th degree myself.”“Shake hands.”The Wit was rather embarrassed, but did not quite see how to refuse. Hecomplied, rather awkwardly.The long man grimly smiled.There was a curious tension among the crowd. We all felt as if we werepresent at some mysterious event, and as if the lean campaigner had us all athis mercy.Thompson, the Secretary, threw himself (in the name of us all) frankly onthat engaging quality.The tall man took the bitten vulcanite of his briar from between his bicus-pids.“Our friend,” he said slowly, “may belong to the 28th degree of the An-cient Order of Humbugs; but he isn’t a Mason at all.”Johnstone rose to the occasion, and saved the situation by suggesting ageneral adjournment to the tee.But I am convinced that I foozled my approach to the third by undue pon-dering upon the sinister incident of the smoking-room.It happens that I am a reader at the British Museum, and spend a good deal* The author of this article wishes to emphasize the fact that he regards his brother English CraftFreemasons as constituting the most high-minded and worthy class of men in the country, and theirfriendly and charitable activities as most useful and laudable.

However, I determined to findout as much as I could about Freemasonry from the “authorities.”Alas!Alas!!It took me a very few hours to discover that Waite was as ignorant as hewas pompous — and he was very very pompous.I was nearly led away by Mackey, but discovered in time that his book wasa system of deliberate falsification.John Yarker was learned, accurate, and sincere; but those very qualitiesmade him too cautious to assert what was doubtful. And about Masonry nearlyeverything is doubtful.It was hardly encouraging when one afternoon I found a smiling professo-rial face bending over my shoulder.“Studying Masonry, my young friend? I am the Grand Master of Germany,and I have studied it these forty years and more; and I know nothing what-ever about it.”He was kind enough, however, to help me considerably with my studies;and I am able to present a rudimentary Synoptic Table of the principal rites.I can make no pretence to completeness, to historical treatment — indeed,my main purpose is to show the utter impossibility of building a house evenof stacked cards on such shifting sand as Masonic History.I.

These rites seem to have been mere collections of all knowndegrees — as a connoisseur might collect bric-à-brac. The 97° is honorary:“Grand Hierophant,” the supreme ruler of these (united) rites. Many 96° —90°’s exist; but they have never gone through the degrees. There is, however,a Reduced Rite of Memphis of 33° of which the 20° corresponds with the 33°of the Scottish Rite; this is recognised by the Grand Orient of France andother civilised countries.The 32° of a well-known Rite in America is sold for so many dollars, likecanned pork. It even cadges for members. It is an association given over-much to graft of the most specious kind. Only master “craftsmen” attain the33°. It is a business, political, anti-Catholic hierarchy, tyrannical and treach-erous. Its conduct has made the decent citizen fight shy of even the commonCraft Freemason. This is the “Pike” rite, notoriously founded on the absurdforgery of a scoundrelly adventurer named Morin; its opponent, the Cerneacerite, has a legitimate title, from the Duke of Sussex; but its defeat has dis-graced it, and its present members are little better than the others.IIC.

I happened to know that the Chap-lain of the British Embassy in Z—— was Past Provincial Grand Organist ofa certain English town. He proposed me, found me a seconder, and I wasduly initiated, passed, and raised. I was warmly welcomed by numerous En-glish and American visitors to our Lodge; for Z—— is a very great city.I returned to England some time later, after “passing the chair” in myLodge, and, wishing to join the Royal Arch, called on its venerable secretary.I presented my credentials. “O Thou Great Architect of the Universe!” theold man sobbed out in rage, “why dost Thou not wither this impudent impos-tor with Thy fire from heaven? Sir, begone! You are not a Mason at all! As allthe world knows, the people in Z—— are atheists, and live with other men’swives.”I thought this a little hard on my Reverend Father in God my proposer; andI noted that, of course, every single English or American visitor to our Lodgein Z—— stood in peril of instant and irrevocable expulsion on detection. SoI said nothing, but walked to another room in Freemasons’ Hall over hishead, and took my seat as a Past Master in one of the oldest and most emi-nent Lodges in London!Kindly note, furthermore, that when each of those wicked Visitors returnedto their own Lodges after their crime, they automatically excommunicatedthe whole thereof; and as visiting is very common, it may well be doubtedwhether, on their own showing, there is a single “just, lawful, and regularMason” left alive on the earth!The above anecdote is exactly true in every detail, and shows one side —only one side — of the morass into which the narrow formalism of the au-thorities has plunged the Craft.***Now the Craft is the ABC of Masonry: it would be utterly impossible evento suggest the welter of the other degrees.

Not one Mason — of any degree — in tenthousand has the slightest idea what the whole weary business is about.Why then, in the name of King Solomon, should anyone become a Mason?What has that V.W.P. Pres. Brd. G. Pur. got for his thousands — to say noth-ing of the time he has devoted to attending stupid banquets, and learning byheart the interminable outpourings of — oh yes! of whom?The answer to this two-headed question is really simple enough.We ought to cross off the pettier human motives first: love of vanity, ofmystery, of display, of make-believe; but the average man in England be-comes a Mason for as serious a reason as he becomes a Church member or aTheosophist; and the average man is usually most abominably disillusioned.(Of course, we must eliminate the political of politico-religious motives whichare the rule in France and Italy, and their business correlatives in America,where the Christian elements of certain rituals have actually been removedso that Jews might become 33° Masons!)But back to our average man! He may join the Craft with some idea offellowship, because it is a tradition in his family to do so, or because he hopesto find in the Secret of the Mysteries something which he does not find in anyof the exoteric forms of religion.How is it that the same Order satisfies — more or less — aspirations sodiverse?We are brought at last face to face with the fundamental problem of theMasonic historian — the Origin of the whole business.Without any hesitation at all, one may confess that on this critical questionnothing is certainly known. It is true, indeed, that the Craft Lodges in En-gland were originally Hanoverian Clubs, as the Scottish Lodges were JacobiteClubs, and the Egyptian Lodges of Cagliostro revolutionary Clubs.But that no more explains the Origin of Freemasonry than the fact “ManySpaniards are Roman Catholics” explains why the priest says and does cer-tain things rather than others in the Mass.Now here is the tremendous question: we can admit all Mr. Yarker’s con-tentions, and more, as to the connection of Masonic and quasi-Masonic Riteswith the old customs of initiating people into the Trade Guilds; but whyshould such a matter be hedged about with so severe a wardenship, and whyshould the Central Sacrament partake of so awful and so unearthly a charac-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"3838ter?As Freemasonry has been “exposed” every few minutes for the last centuryor so, and as any layman can walk into a Masonic shop and buy the completeRituals for a few pence, the only omissions being of no importance to ourpresent point, it would be imbecile to pretend that the nature of the ceremo-nies of Craft Masonry is in any sense a “mystery.”There is therefore no reason for refraining from the plain statement that, toanyone who understands the rudiments of Symbolism, the Master’s Degreeis identical with the Mass. This is in fact the real reason for the Papal Anath-ema; for Freemasonry asserts that every man is himself the living, slain, andre-risen Christ in his own person.It is true that not one Mason in 10,000 in England is aware of this fact; buthe has only to remember his “raising” to realise the fundamental truth of thestatement.Well may Catholic and Freemason alike stand appalled at the stupendousblasphemy which is implied, as they ignorantly think, not knowing them-selves of the stuff and substance of the Supreme Self, each for himself alikeno less than Very God of Very God!But suppose that the sublimity of this conception is accepted, the identityadmitted: what sudden overwhelming billow from the past blasts their beati-tude? What but the words with which Freud concludes “Totem and Taboo”:In the Beginning was the Deed!For the “sacrifice of the Innocent” celebrated alike in Lodge and in Cathe-dral is this identical Murder of the Master by the Fellow-Craftsmen, that is ofthe Father by his Sons, when the ape-system of the “Father-horde” was re-placed by the tribal system which developed into the “military clan”!As against all the above, it may be objected that Freemasonry actuallyposes the perennial problem: If a man die, shall he live again?We can ignore antiquity, with a mere note that the impossibility of tracingthe origin of the Rite makes it impossible to argue that any given jurisdictionis “lawful.” As in other matters, the Rite in Might is the Rite in Right! Thequarrels which disgrace Freemasonry are only distinguishable by superiorpettiness from such questions as the validity of Anglican Orders.And it may be added that at this time of day it is abjectly ridiculous tocontinue the celebration of such totemistic tomfoolery with such tetanic ta-bus!The W.M. elect of a certain lodge not far from the birth-place of DaylightSaving used to learn his part by saying it over to his wife in bed. Reproachedby brother Masons, he replied quite calmly that the Secret of FreemasonryTHE CRISIS IN FREEMASONRY"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"3939EXCERPTS FROM THE ENGLISH REVIEWwas lost, and therefore he could not disclose it if he would!But is the Secret lost?Does not the insistence on so many senseless formalities lead us to surmisethat the Secret may have been locked away not in the ostensible words, grips,signs, tokens, et cetera, which are for the most part self-stultifying, but in theessential structure of the Rite?We can here merely refer to a rare and long since out of print volume, TheCanon, which shows that the proportions of certain fabulous or imaginarystructures testify to certain philosophical truths according to a symbolic sys-tem.The truth is — to speak plainly — that the Secret was lost, and is found.But those to whom it has been communicated, whatever their degree, arenot in the least likely to spread it broadcast before undiscerning Masons.Their condition is therefore, reasonably enough, that the whole unwieldysystem of pompous and meaningless formalities, with their outworn and mis-understood verbiage, their sectarian accretions, and their manifold confu-sion, should be swept away entirely. It is better so than that Masonry shouldstumble into the open sewer of obsolescence, as it is doing now. While no twojurisdictions can agree to recognise or tolerate the existence of any third,while women are clamouring for admission on the one hand and men de-spairingly dropping it on the other, while clandestine lodges already almostoutnumber the regular kind — what is worth saving?What was ever worth saving in Masonry? What was the original idea ofthe institution as such? The Secret and its Preservation.Even at this, the Secret pertains to the Past. It is part of the heritage ofHumanity. But the Rites of Freemasonry are after all those of Osiris, of theDying God; the Aeon of Horus, of the Crowned and Conquering Child, iscome; it is His rites that we should celebrate, His that liveth and reigneth,and hath His abode in every human heart!"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"4040If you are interested in Aleister Crowley, the true nature of theBeast 666 and Thelema, send a self-addressed, stampedenvelope ($1 deductible from your first order for fullinformation regarding Newaeon) toG.M.
