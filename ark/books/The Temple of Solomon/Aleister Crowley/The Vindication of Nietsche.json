It will come.*The cause is cant and hypocrisy, and the cause of the War was cant andhypocrisy, the strange, the pathetic, the craven determination to admit nofact for truth which all the men of science and all the poets of the reign ofQueen Victoria did so little to shake. The demonstrations of Darwin and thesonorities of Swinburne reached only the thinking classes, if one may use soplural a noun for the remnant that refused to bow the knee to the Baal ofRespectability and the Golden Calf of Commercialism.Entrenched in the morass of bibliolatry, crouching in the bastions of FortGrundy, the old Guard of Victorianism died and did not surrender. But as theOld Testament God fell before Paine and Ingersoll, as the sanguine and sac-rificial Christ was emasculated by Renan and Edwin Arnold, the ruin oforthodoxy left even the manhood of Puritanism eunuch. Havelock with hisbloody sword blowing 14,000 Sepoy prisoners from the muzzles of his gunsin a morning became no longer thinkable. Hypocrisy surpassed itself, de-nounced its own virtues for vices. As the Goddess Reason once presided inParis over panic, so the neuter deity Progress was worshipped by all thosewhom sloth, ease, security, prosperity had rotted. And the attendant demon-in-chief, Broken-Reed-in-Waiting to Its Majesty, was Humanitarianism.We had Progressed. Lady Pyjama Noisette had a headache to the tune of aparagraph — 10 lines. Sandsugar v.

They feellittle; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.”“But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in thedesert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with apure heart, and the serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in mybosom.

And that is play to what may come. Willnot human flesh be bought and sold in the markets before the war and itsattendant revolutions are over? Is there any man bold enough to call suchthings “impossible,” to invoke those fallen fishy gods “Progress” and “Civi-lization” and “The Higher Awakening of the Ethical Instincts of man?”Is there any man who still shuts his eyes to the plain fact that homo sapiensis but a primate, cousin of the gorilla, with a brain over-developed to thinkabominations, and a larynx evolved to aid their execution, a creature whoseprime pangs are hunger, lust, and hate, and his fundamental solaces rape,robbery, and murder? I laughed with open throat at the “atrocity” Press Cam-paigns in the Balkan War. “The half-civilized peoples of the Near East!” Isthe present war any less prolific of such stories when the compatriots ofTolstoi, and Gorky, and Goethe, and Anatole France, and Shelley are at war?And are the stories true? True or false in detail, I knew them true in essence,and I knew also that the primmest old maid in Dorchester whose palsiedhands dropped her knitting as she read of them was horrified because, al-though she did not know it, and could never be brought to know it, thoseatrocities were in her blood from everlasting. “There, but for the Grace ofGod, goes Charles Baxter” was the wisest remark that ever came from afool’s lips.

In fifty years will there remain so many monuments of what wewere two months ago as Egypt has of its Pharaohs, Greece of its Republics,Rome of its Cæsars?
