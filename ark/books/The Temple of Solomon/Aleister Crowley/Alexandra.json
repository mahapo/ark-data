What is mysecret? A simple one: I always believe the worst: once in a thousand times Imay be wrong, and it is only the next worst, but no matter.)Without prolonging the agony, I may say that it shortly transpired thatEuphemia Bugg — such is her name — has for years been the adored (Pla-tonic if not Aristotelian) mistress of a distinguished littérateur, whom I havebeen able with difficulty (the maid is modest, as one would expect from theNo 1 belle dame of either of these cicisbeos), with one of the gentlemenwhose name is on our title-page.

Yeatsor Robert Bridges with it. The only question is: did not perhaps the late LordTennyson foresee events, and leave it to be published when the right timecame? But in this case, how account for Euphemia’s possession of the daintything? Anyway, it’s not Tennyson: don’t worry: I was only teasing.She had originally picked up the unfinished M.S. to use as curl-papers. Itwas indeed written, as will be obvious from the style, on sheets of thinnest,softest (and I believe sterilised) paper of a delicate and pleasing pale canarycolour, mullioned at the shorter edges like a postage stamp.These she had placed on my mantelpiece for pipe-spills, and forgottenabout them.It is my pride and privilege through my old and esteemed consœur, as Isuppose I may say for the lady of confrère, to give the providentially rescuedmasterpiece; alas! too incomplete!! to the World of Society, though even thehumblest may enjoy (A navvy, when they were repairing the street, whom I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A BIRTHDAY ODE55asked up to taste my delicious T. — I think the abbreviation is so clever,don’t you? — and to whom I had read it, said: “B...y good, miss, b...y good”.A simple heartfelt tribute from the People).Alas! too incomplete.
