GermereBook Edition 2001"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears1FOREWORDIn 1943 Aleister Crowley met a lady who, hav-ing heard of his wide knowledge and experience,asked his advice on occult, spiritual, and practicalmatters.This chance connection resulted in a stimulatingexchange of letters. Crowley then asked others toput similar questions to him. The result was thiscollection of over eighty letters which are nowbeing issued over the title that he chose, “MAGICKWITHOUT TEARS”.Crowley did not keep copies of his early lettersto the above-mentioned lady, so was unable toinclude them in the collection that he planned topublish. Fortunately they have been preserved andare now included in the introduction to this book.Their original form has been retained with theopening and closing formulae which Crowley usedin all his letters.Crowley at first intended to call the book “AL-EISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING”, and sent thefollowing circular to his friends and disciples ask-ing them to suggest subjects for inclusion.ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.“Much gratified was the author of THE BOOKOF THOTH to have so many letters of appreciation,mostly from women, thanking him for not ‘puttingit in unintelligible language’, for ‘making it all soclear that even I with my limited intelligence canunderstand it, or think I do.’“Nevertheless and notwithstanding! For manyyears the Master Therion has felt acutely the need ofsome groundwork-teaching suited to those whohave only just begun the study of Magick and itssubsidiary sciences, or are merely curious about it,or interested in it with intent to study. Always he hasdone his utmost to make his meaning clear to theaverage intelligent educated person, but even thosewho understand him perfectly and are most sympa-thetic to his work, agree that in this respect he hasoften failed.“So much for the diagnosis — now for theremedy!“One genius, inspired of the gods, suggestedrecently that the riddle might be solved somewhaton the old and well-tried lines of ‘Dr. Brewer’sGuide to Science’; i.e., by having aspirants write tothe Master asking questions, the kind of problemthat naturally comes into the mind of any sensibleenquirer, and getting his answer in the form of aletter. ‘What is it?’ ‘Why should I bother my headabout it?’ ‘What are it’s principles?’ ‘What use isit?’ ‘How do I begin?’, and the like.“This plan has been put into action; the idea hasbeen to cover the subjects from every possibleangle. The style has been colloquiel and fluent;technical terms have either been carefully avoidedor most carefully explained; and the letter has notbeen admitted to the series until the querent hasexpressed satisfaction. Some seventy letters, up tothe present have been written, but still there seem tobe certain gaps in the demonstration, like thosewhite patches on the map of the World, whichlooked so tempting fifty years ago.“This memorandum is to ask for your collabora-tion and support. A list, indicating briefly the sub-ject of each letter already written, is appended.Should you think that any of those will help you inyour own problems, a typed copy will be sent to youat once ... Should you want to know anythingoutside the scope, send in your question (stated asfully and clearly as possible) ... The answer shouldreach you, bar accidents, in less than a month ... Itis proposed ultimately to issue the series in bookform.”———This has now been done.Karl J. GermerFrater Saturnus X°Frater Superior, O.T.O.January, 1954 e.v.Hampton, N.J.INTRODUCTIONLETTERS WRITTEN BY MASTERTHERION TO A STUDENTLetter No. AMarch 19, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawI was very glad to gather from your conversationyesterday afternoon that you have a serious inten-tion of taking up the Great Work in the proper spirit.Your criticisms of previous experience in the courseof your adventures appeared to be singularly saneand just. As I promised I am writing this letter tocover a few practical points which we had not timeto discuss and which in any case I think it better toarrange by correspondence.1) It is of the first importance that you shouldunderstand my personal position. It is not actuallywrong to regard me as a teacher, but it is certainlyliable to mislead; fellow-student, or, if you like,fellow-sufferer, seems a more appropriate defini-tion.The climax of my life was what is known as theCairo Working, described in the minutest detail inthe Equinox of the Gods. At that time most of TheBook of the Law was completely unintelligible tome, and a good deal of it — especially the thirdchapter — extremely antipathetic. I fought againstthis book for years; but it proved irresistible.I do not think I am boasting unfairly when I saythat my personal researches have been of the great-est value and importance to the study of the subjectof Magick and Mysticism in general, especially myintegration of the various thought-systems of theworld, notably the identification of the system of theYi King with that of the Qabalah. But I do assureyou that the whole of my life’s work, were itmultiplied a thousand fold, would not be worth onetithe of the value of a single verse of The Book of theLaw.I think you should have a copy of the Equinox ofthe Gods and make The Book of the Law yourconstant study. Such value as my own work maypossess for you should amount to no more than anaid to the interpretation of this book.2) It may be that later on you will want a copy ofEight Lectures on Yoga so I am putting a copyaside for you in case you should want it.3) With regard to the O.T.O., I believe I can findyou a typescript of all the official documents. If so,I will let you have them to read, and you can makeup your mind as to whether you wish to affiliate tothe Third Degree of the Order. I should conse-quently, in the case of your deciding to affiliate, gowith you through the script of the Rituals andexplain the meaning of the whole thing; communi-cating, in addition, the real secret and significantknowledge of which ordinary Masonry is not pos-sessed.4) The horoscope; I do not like doing these at all,but it is part of the agreement with the GrandTreasurer of the O.T.O. that I should undertakethem in worthy cases, if pressed. But I prefer to keepthe figure to myself for future reference, in case anysignificant event makes consultation desirable.Now there is one really important matter. Theonly thing besides The Book of the Law which is inthe forefront of the battle. As I told you yesterday,the first essential is the dedication of all that one isand all that one has to the Great Work, withoutreservation of any sort. This must be kept con-stantly in mind; the way to do this is to practiceLiber Resh vel Helios, sub figura CC, pp. 425-426— Magick. There is another version of these Ado-rations, slightly fuller; but those in the text are quitealright. The important thing is not to forget. I shallhave to teach you the signs and gestures which gowith the words.It is also desirable before beginning a formalmeal to go through the following dialogue: Knock3-5-3: say, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofthe Law.” The person at the other end of the tablereplies: “What is thy Will?” You: “It is my Will toeat and drink.” He: “To what end?” You: “That mybody may be fortified thereby.” He: “To whatend?” You: “That I may accomplish the GreatMAGICK WITHOUT TEARS(unabridged)by Aleister Crowley"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears2Work.” He: “Love is the law, love under will.”You, with a single knock: “Fall to.” When alonemake a monologue of it: thus, Knock 3-5-3. Dowhat, etc. It is my Will to, etc., that my body, etc.,that I may, etc., Love is, etc. Knock: and begin toeat.It is impossible to exaggerate the importance ofperforming these small ceremonies regularly, andbeing as nearly accurate as possible with regard tothe times. You must not mind stopping in themiddle of a crowded thoroughfare — lorries or nolorries — and saying the Adorations; and you mustnot mind snubbing your guest — or your host — ifhe or she should prove ignorant of his or her shareof the dialogue. It is perhaps because these mattersare so petty and trivial in appearance that theyafford so excellent a training. They teach you con-centration, mindfulness, moral and social courage,and a host of other virtues.Like a perfect lady, I have kept the tit bit to thelast. It is absolutely essential to begin a magicaldiary, and keep it up daily. You begin by an accountof your life, going back even before your birth toyour ancestry. In conformity with the practice whichyou may perhaps choose to adopt later, given inLiber Thisarb, sub figura CMXIII, paragraphs 27-28, Magick, pp. 420-422, you must find an answerto the question: “How did I come to be in this placeat this time, engaged in this particular work?” Asyou will see from the book, this will start you on thediscovery of who you really are, and eventuallylead you to your recovering the memory of previousincarnations.As it is difficult for you to come to Town exceptat rare and irregular intervals, may I suggest a planwhich has previously proved very useful, and thatis a weekly letter. Eliphas Lévi did this with theBaron Spedalieri, and the correspondence is one ofthe most interesting of his works. You ask suchquestions as you wish to have answered, and Ianswer them to the best of my ability. I, of course,add spontaneous remarks which may be elicited bymy observations on your progress and the perusalof your magical diary. This, of course, should bewritten on one side of the paper only, so that theopposite page is free for comments, and an arrange-ment should be made for it to be inspected at regularintervals.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666Letter No. BApril 20, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawI was very glad to have your letter, and am verysorry to hear that you have been in affliction. Aboutthe delay, however, I think I ought to tell you thatthe original Rule of the Order of A∴A∴ was thatthe introducer read over a short lection to theapplicant, then left him alone for a quarter of anhour, and on coming back received a “yes” or “no.”If there was any hesitation about it the applicant wasbarred for life.The reason for the relaxation of the rule was thatit was thought better to help people along in theearly stages of the work, even if there was no hopeof their turning out first-class. But I should like youto realize that sooner or later, whether in this incar-nation or another, it is put up to you to show perfectcourage in face of the completely unknown, and thepower of rapid and irrevocable decision withoutcounting the cost.I think that it is altogether wrong to allow your-self to be worried by “psychological, moral, andartistic problems.” It is no good your starting any-thing of any kind unless you can see clearly into thesimplicity of truth. All this humming and hawingabout things is moral poison. What is the use ofbeing a woman if you have not got an intuition, aninstinct enabling you to distinguish between thegenuine and the sham?Your state of mind suggests to me that you musthave been, in the past, under the influence of peoplewho were always talking about things, and neverdoing any real work. They kept on arguing all sortsof obscure philosophical points; that is all very well,but when you have succeeded in analyzing yourreactions you will understand that all this talk is justan excuse for not doing any serious work.I am confirmed in this judgment by your saying:“I don’t know if I want to enter into a great conflict.I need peace.” Fortunately you save yourself byadding: “Real peace, that is living and not stag-nant.” All life is conflict. Every breath that youdraw represents a victory in the struggle of thewhole Universe. You can’t have peace withoutperfect mastery of circumstance; and I take it thatthis is what you mean by “living, not stagnant.”But it is of the first consequence for you tosummon up the resolution to stamp on this sea ofswirling thoughts by an act of will; you must say:“Peace be still.” The moment you have understoodthese thoughts for what they are, tools of the enemy,invented by him with the idea of preventing youfrom undertaking the Great Work — the momentyou dismiss all such considerations firmly anddecisively, and say: “What must I do?” and havingdiscovered that, set to work to do it, allowing of nointerruption, you will find that living peace which(as you seem to see) is a dynamic and not a staticcondition. (There is quite a lot about this point inLittle Essays Toward Truth, and also in The Visionand the Voice.)Your postscript made me smile. It is not a verygood advertisement for the kind of people withwhom you have been associated in the past. Myown position is a very simple one. I obeyed theinjunction to “buy a perfectly black hen, withouthaggling.” I have spent over 100,000 pounds of myinherited money on this work: and if I had a thou-sand times that amount to-day it would all go in thesame direction. It is only when one is built in thisway, to stand entirely aloof from all considerationsof twopence halfpenny more or fourpence halfpennyless, that one obtains perfect freedom on this Planeof Discs.All the serious Orders of the world, or nearly all,begin by insisting that the aspirant should take avow of poverty; a Buddhist Bhikku, for example,can own only nine objects — his three robes, beg-ging bowl, a fan, toothbrush, and so on. The Hinduand Mohammedan Orders have similar regula-tions; and so do all the important Orders ofmonkhood in Christianity.Our own Order is the only exception of impor-tance; and the reason for this is that it is much moredifficult to retain one’s purity if one is living in theworld than if one simply cuts oneself off from it. Itis far easier to achieve technical attainments if oneis unhampered by any such considerations. Theseregulations operate as restrictions to one’s useful-ness in helping the world. There are terrible dan-gers, the worst dangers of all, associated with com-plete retirement. In my own personal judgment,moreover, I think that our own ideal of a natural lifeis much more wholesome.When you have found out a little about your pastincarnations, you should be able to understand thisvery clearly and simply.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666Letter No. CApril 30, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the LawThank you for your long letter of no date, butreceived two days ago. I am very sorry you are stillfeeling exhausted. I am not too good myself, for Ifind this weather very trying. I will answer yourvarious points as best I can.I am arranging to send you the official papersconnected with the O.T.O., but the idea that youshould meet other members first is quite impos-sible. Even after affiliation, you would not meetanyone unless it were necessary for you to work incooperation with them. I am afraid you have stillgot the idea that the Great Work is a tea-party.Contact with other students only means that youcriticize their hats, and then their morals; and I amnot going to encourage this. Your work is notanybody else’s; and undirected chatter is the worstpoisonous element in human society.When you talk of the “actual record” of the“Being called Jesus Christ,” I don’t know what youmean. I am not aware of the existence of any suchrecord. I know a great many legends, mostly bor-rowed from previous legends of a similar character.It would be better for you to get a copy of theEquinox of the Gods and study it. The Great Workis the uniting of opposites. It may mean the unitingof the soul with God, of the microcosm with themacrocosm, of the female with the male, of the egowith the non-ego — or what not.By “love under will” one refers to the fact thatthe method in every case is love, by which is meantthe uniting of opposites as above stated, such ashydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and soon. Any reaction whatever, any phenomenon, is aphenomenon of “love”, as you will understand"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears3when I come to explain to you the meaning of theword “point-event”. But love has to be “underwill,” if it is to be properly directed. You must findyour True Will, and make all your actions subser-vient to the one great purpose.Rahoor is the Sun God; Tahuti is the EgyptianMercury; Kephra is the Sun at midnight.About your problems; what I have to do is to tryto teach you to think clearly. You will be im-mensely stimulated by having all the useless trim-mings stripped from your thinking apparatus. Forinstance, I don’t think you know the first principlesof logic. You apparently take up a more or lessChristian attitude, but at the same time you likevery much the idea of Karma. You cannot haveboth.The question about money does not arise. Thisold and very good rule (which I have always kept)was really pertinent to the time when there wereactual secrets. But I have published openly all thesecrets. All I can do is to train you in a perfectlyexoteric way. My suggestion about the weeklyletter was intended to exclude this question, as youwould be getting full commercial value for any-thing paid.Your questions about the Spirit of the Sun, andso on, are to be answered by experience. Intellectualsatisfaction is worthless. I have to bring you to astate of mind completely superior to the mechanismof the normal mind.A good deal of your letter is rather difficult toanswer. You always seem to want to put the cartbefore the horse. Don’t you see that, if I were tryingto get you to do something or other, I should simplyreturn to you the kind of answer which I thoughtwould satisfy you, and make you happy? And thiswould be very easy to do because you have got noclear ideas about anything. For one thing, you keepon using terms about whose significance we are notyet in agreement. When you talk about the “Chris-tian path,” do you believe in vicarious atonementand eternal damnation — or don’t you? A greatdeal of the confusion that arises in all these ques-tions, and grows constantly worse as fellow-stu-dents talk them over — the blind leading the blind— is because they have no idea of the necessity ofdefining their terms.Then again, you ask me questions like “What ispurity?” that can be answered in a dozen differentways; and you must understand what is meant by a“universe of discourse.” If you asked me — “Is thissample of cloride of gold a pure sample?” I cananswer you. You must understand the value ofprecision in speech. I could go on rambling aboutpurity and selflessness for years, and no one wouldbe a penny the better.P.S. — or rather, I did not want to dictate this bit.— Your ideas about the O.T.O. remind me of somewomen’s idea of shopping. You want to maul aboutthe stock and then walk out with a proud glad smile:NO. Do you really think that I should muster all themost distinguished people alive for your inspectionand approval?The affiliation clause in our Constitution is aprivilege: a courtesy to a sympathetic body. Wereyou not a Mason, or Co-Mason, you would have tobe proposed and seconded, and then examined bysavage Inquisitors; and then — probably — thrownout on to the garbage heap. Well, no, it’s not as badas that; but we certainly don’t want anybody whochooses to apply. Would you do it yourself, if youwere on the Committee of a Club? The O.T.O. is aserious body, engaged on a work of Cosmic scope.You should question yourself: what can I contrib-ute?Secrets. There is one exception to what I havesaid about publishing everything: that is, the ulti-mate secret of the O.T.O. This is really too danger-ous to disclose; but the safeguard is that you couldnot use it if you knew it, unless you were anadvanced Adept; and you would not be allowed togo so far unless we were satisfied that you weresincerely devoted to the Great Work. (See One Starin Sight). True, the Black Brothers could use it; butthey would only destroy themselves.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666Letter No. DJune 8, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Thanks for your letter. I couldn’t find the O.T.O.typescript — and then it struck me that it would beuseful to await your reactions. If I were expectingsome presumably important papers by post, I shouldget anxious after 24 hours delay (at most) and startenquiries. Anyhow, I can’t find them for the mo-ment; but Mr. Bryant said he would lend you hisBlue Equinox: pages 195-270 give what you re-quire.But the real point of your affiliating is that itsaves me from constantly being on my guard lest Ishould mention something which I am sworn not toreveal. As in every serious society, members arepledged not to disclose what they may have learnt,whom they have met; it is so, even in Co-Masonry:isn’t it: but one may mention the names of memberswho have died. (See Liber LII, par. 2.) Be happythen; the late X... Y... was one of us. I hope that heand Rudolph Steiner will (between them) satisfyyour doubts.The A∴A∴ is totally different. One Star inSight tells you everything that you need to know.(Perhaps some of these regulations are hard tograsp: personally, I can never understand all thisBy-Law stuff. So you must ask me what, and why,and so on.)There is really only one point for your judgment.“By their fruits ye shall know them.” You have readLiber LXV and Liber VII; That shows you whatstates you can attain by this curriculum. Now read“A Master of the Temple” (Blue Equinox, pp. 127-170) for an account of the early stages of training,and their results. (Of course, your path might notcoincide with, or even resemble, his path.)But do get it into you head that “If the blind leadthe blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.” If youhad seen 1% of the mischief that I have seen, youwould freeze to the marrow of your bones at themere idea of seeing another member through thetelescope! Well, I employ the figure of hyperbole,that I admit; but it really won’t do to have a dozencooks at the broth! If you’re working with me,you’ll have no time to waste on other people.I fear your “Christianity” is like that of mostother folk. You pick out one or two of the figuresfrom which the Alexandrines concocted “Jesus”(too many cooks, again, with a vengeance!) andneglect the others. The Zionist Christ of Matthewcan have no value for you; nor can the Asiatic“Dying-God” — compiled from Melcarth, Mithras,Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Attis, Krishna, and others— who supplied the miraculous and ritualisticelements of the fable.Rightly you ask: “What can I contribute?” An-swer: One Book. That is the idea of the weeklyletter: 52 of yours and 52 of mine, competentlyedited, would make a most useful volume. Thiswould be your property: so that you get full mate-rial value, perhaps much more, for your outlay. Ithought of the plan because one such arrangementhas recently come to an end, with amazingly happyresults: they should lie open to your admiring gazein a few months from now. Incidentally, I person-ally get nothing out of it; secretarial work costsmoney these days. But there is another great advan-tage; it keeps both of us up to the mark. Also, in suchletters a great deal of odds and ends of knowledgeturn up automatically; valuable stuff, frequentenough; yes, but one doesn’t want to lose the thread,once one starts. Possibly ten days might be best.But please understand that this suggestion arosesolely from your own statement of what you thoughtwould help in your present circumstances. Any-way, as you say, decide! If it is yes, I should like tosee you before June 15 when I expect to go away fora few days; better to give you some groundwork tokeep you busy in my absence.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666Letter No. EAug. 18, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Much thought has gone into the construction ofyour Motto. “I will become” can be turned neatlyenough as “Let there be;” by avoiding the FirstPronoun one gets the idea of “the absorption of theSelf in the Beloved,” which is exactly what youwant.“The creative Force of the Universe” is quiteready-made. Pyramis,1 a pyramid, is that Force inits geometrical form; in its biological form it isPhallus,1 the Yang or Lingam. Both words have thesame numerical value, 831. These two words cantherefore serve you as the secret object of yourWork. How then can you construct the number1 In the original in Greek."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears4831?The Letter Kaph,1 Jupiter (Jehovah), the Wheelof Fortune in the Tarot — the Atu X is a picture ofthe Universe built up and revolving by virtue ofthose Three Principles: Sulphur, Mercury, Salt; orGunas: Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas — has the value 20.So also has the letter Yod1 spelt in full.One Gnostic secret way of spelling and pro-nouncing Jehovah is IAO2 and this has the value811. So has “Let there be,” Fiat, transliterating intoGreek.Resuming all these ideas, it seems that you canexpress your aspiration very neatly, very fully, bychoosing for your motto the words FIAT YOD.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. Please study this letter, and these explana-tory figures (the author, BAPHOMET X° O.T.O.,in the original spells each word, giving the numeri-cal equivalent of each letter in pyramis, etc. This ishere not copied.) and meditate upon them until youhave fully assimilated not only the matter underimmediate consideration, but the general method ofQabalistic research and construction. Note hownew cognate ideas arise to enrich the formula.666Letter No. FAug. 20, 1943Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Let me begin by referring to my letter about themotto and make clear to you the working of thisletter.In this motto you have really got several ideascombined, and yet they are really, of course, oneidea. Fiat, being 811, is identical with IAO, andtherefore FIAT YOD might be read not only as “letthere be” (or “Let me become”), the secret source ofall creative energy, but as “the secret source of theenergy of Jehovah.” The two words together, hav-ing the value of 831, they contain the secret mean-ings Pyramis and Phallos, which is the same idea indifferent forms; thus you have three ways of ex-pressing the creative form, in its geometrical aspect,its human aspect, and its divine aspect. I am makinga point of this, because the working out of this mottoshould give you a very clear idea of the sort of wayin which Qabalah should be used. I think it is ratheruseful to remember what the essence of the Qabalahis in principle; thus, in your correspondence forMalkuth, Yesod, and Hod you are simply writingdown some of the ideas which pertain to the num-bers 10, 9, and 8 respectively. Naturally, there is agreat deal of redundancy and overloading as soonas you get to ideas important enough to be compre-hensive; as is mentioned in the article on the Qabalahin Equinox Vol. I, No. 5, it is quite easy to prove 1 =2 = 3 = 4, etc.On the other hand, you must be careful to avoidtaking the correspondences given in the books ofreference without thinking out why they are sogiven. Thus, you find a camel in the number whichrefers to the Moon, but the Tarot card “the Moon”refers not to the letter Gimel which means camel,but to the letter Qoph, and the sign Pisces whichmeans fish, while the letter itself refers to the backof the head; and you also find fish has the meaningof the letter Nun. You must not go on from this, andsay that the back of your head is like a camel — theconnection between them is simply that they allrefer to the same thing.In studying the Qabalah you mention six months;I think after that time you should be able to realizethat, after six incarnations of uninterrupted study,you may realize that you can never know it; asConfucius said about the Yi King: “If a few moreyears were added to my life, I would devote ahundred of them to the study of the Yi.”If, however, you work at the Qabalah in the sameway as I did myself, in season and out of season, youought to get a very fair grasp of it in six months. Iwill now tell you what this method is: as I walkedabout, I made a point of attributing everything I sawto its appropriate idea. I would walk out of the doorof my house and reflect that door is Daleth, andhouse Beth; now the word “dob” is Hebrew forbear, and has the number 6, which refers to the Sun.Then you come to the fence of your property andthat is Cheth — number 8, number of Tarot Trump7, which is the Chariot: so you begin to look aboutfor your car. Then you come to the street and thefirst house you see is number 86, and that is Elohim,and it is built of red brick which reminds you ofMars and the Blasted Tower, and so on. As soon asthis sort of work, which can be done in a quitelighthearted spirit, becomes habitual, you will findyour mind running naturally in this direction, andwill be surprised at your progress. Never let yourmind wander from the fact that your Qabalah is notmy Qabalah; a good many of the things which Ihave noted may be useful to you, but you mustconstruct your own system so that it is a livingweapon in your hand.I think I am fair if I say that the first step on theQabalah which may be called success, is when youmake an actual discovery which throws light onsome problem which has been troubling you. Aquarter of a century ago I was in New Orleans, andwas very puzzled about my immediate course ofaction; in fact I may say I was very much distressed.There seemed literally nothing that I could do, so Ibethought myself that I had better invoke Mercury.As soon as I got into the appropriate frame of mind,it naturally occurred to me, with a sort of joy, “ButI am Mercury.” I put it into Latin — Mercuriussum, and suddenly something struck me, a sort ofnameless reaction which said: “That’s not quiteright.” Like a flash it came to me to put it into Greek,which gave me “Hermes Eimi”, and adding that uprapidly, I got the number 418, with all the marvel-lous correspondences which had been so abun-dantly useful to me in the past (See Equ. of theGods, p. 138). My troubles disappeared like a flashof lightning.Now to answer your questions seriatum; it isquite all right to put questions to me about TheBook of the Law; a very extended commentary hasbeen written, but it is not yet published. I shallprobably be able to answer any of your questionsfrom the manuscript, but you cannot go on after thatwhen it would become a discussion; as they say inthe law-courts, “You must take the witness’ an-swer.”II. The Qabalah, both Greek and Hebrew, alsovery likely Arabic, was used by the author of TheBook of the Law. I have explained above the properuse of the Qabalah. I cannot tell you how the earlyRosicrucians used it, but I think one may assumethat their methods were not dissimilar to our own.Incidentally, it is not very safe to talk aboutRosicrucians, because their name has become asignal for letting loose the most devastating floodsof nonsense. What is really known about the origi-nal Rosicrucians is practically confined to the threedocuments which they issued. The eighteenth cen-tury Rosicrucians may, or may not, have beenlegitimate successors of the original brotherhood— I don’t know. But from them the O.T.O. derivedits authority; The late O.H.O. Theodor Reuss pos-sessed a certain number of documents which dem-onstrated the validity of his claim according to him;but I only saw two or three of them, and they werenot of very great importance. Unfortunately he diedshortly after the last War, and he had got out oftouch with some of the other Grand Masters. Thedocuments did not come to me as they should havedone; they were seized by his wife who had an ideathat she could sell them for a fantastic price; and wedid not feel inclined to meet her views. I don’t thinkthe matter is of very great importance, the workbeing done by members of the Order all over theplace is to me quite sufficient.III. The Ruach contains both the moral andintellectual worlds, which is really all that we meanby the conscious mind; perhaps it even includescertain portions of the subconscious.IV. In initiation from the grade of Neophyte tothat of Zelator, one passes by this way. The mainwork is to obtain admission to, and control of, theastral plane.Your expressions about “purifying the feelings”and so on are rather vague to enter into a scientificsystem like ours. The result which you doubtlessrefer to is attained automatically in the course ofyour experiments. You very soon discover the sortof state of mind which is favourable or unfavourableto the work, and you also discover what is helpfuland harmful to these states in your way of life. Forinstance, the practice like the non-receiving of giftsis all right for a Hindu whose mind is branded for tenthousand incarnations by the shock of accepting acigarette or a cup of tea.

All the terms you use are veryindefinite. I hope it will not take too long to get youout of the way of thinking in these terms. Forinstance, the word “initiation” includes the wholeprocess, and how to distinguish between it andenlightenment I cannot tell you. “Probation,” more-over, if it means “proving,” continues throughoutthe entire process. Nothing is worse for the studentthan to indulge in these mild speculations aboutambiguous terms.V. You can, if you like, try to work out a progressof Osiris through Amennti on the Tree of Life, butI doubt whether you will get any satisfactory result.It seems to me that you should confine yourselfvery closely to the actual work in front of you. At thepresent moment, of course, this includes a good dealof general study; but my point is that the termsemployed in that study should always be capable ofprecise definition. I am not sure whether you havemy Little Essays Toward Truth. The first essay inthe book entitled “Man” gives a full account of thefive principles which go to make up Man accordingto the Qabalistic system. I have tried to define theseterms as accurately as possible, and I think you willfind them, in any case, clearer than those to whichyou have become accustomed with the Easternsystems. In India, by the way, no attempt is evermade to use these vague terms. They always have avery clear idea of what is meant by words like“Buddhi,” “Manas” and the like. Attempts at trans-lation are very unsatisfactory. I find that even withsuch a simple matter as the “Eight limbs of Yoga,”as you will see when you come to read my EightLectures.I am very pleased with your illustrations; that isexcellent practice for you. Presently you have tomake talismans, and a Lamen for yourself, andeven to devise a seal to serve as what you might calla magical coat-of-arms, and all this sort of thing isvery helpful.It occurs to me that so far we have done nothingabout the astral plane and this path of Tau of whichyou speak. Have you had any experience of travel-ling in the astral? If not, do you think that you canbegin by yourself on the lines laid down in Liber O,sections 5 and 6? (See Magick, pp. 387-9). If notyou had better let me take you through the firstgates.

Whenyou are better equipped, you will see that theQabalah is the best (and almost the only) means bywhich an intelligence can identify himself. AndGematria methods serve to discover spiritual truths.Numbers are the network of the structure of theUniverse, and their relations the form of expressionof our Understanding of it.

In Greek and Hebrew there isno other way of writing numbers; our 1, 2, 3 etc.comes from the Phoenicians through the Arabs.You need no more of Greek and Hebrew than thesevalues, some sacred words — knowledge grows byuse — and books of reference.One cannot set a pupil definite tasks beyond thegroundwork I am giving you, and we should findthis correspondence taking clear shape of its ownaccord.

And I can only tell you what the right tasks— out of hundreds — are by your own reactions toyour own study and practice.“Osiris in Amennti” — see the Book of theDead.

Still, yours thegain!1. That verse (AL. I, 44) condenses the wholemagical technique. It makes clear — when youhave understood it — the secret of success in theGreat Work. Of course at first it appears a paradox.You must have an aim, and one aim only: yet on noaccount must you want to achieve it!!!Those chapters of the Book of Lies quoted in mylast letter1 do throw some light onto this Abyss ofself-contradiction; and there is meaning much deeperthan the contrast between the Will with a capital W,and desire, want, or velleity. The main point seemsto be that in aspiring to Power one is limited by theTrue Will. If you use force, violating your ownnature either from lack of understanding or frompetulant whim, one is merely wasting energy; thingsgo back to normal as soon as the stress is removed.This is one small case of the big Equation “FreeWill = Necessity” (Fate, Destiny, or Karma: it’s allmuch the same idea). One is most rigidly bound bythe causal chain that has dragged one to where oneis; but it is one’s own self that has forged the links.Please refrain from the obvious retort: “Then, inthe long run, you can’t possibly go wrong: so itdoesn’t matter what you do.” Perfectly true, ofcourse! (“There is no single grain of dust that shallnot attain to Buddhahood”: with some such wordsdid the debauched old reprobate seek to consolehimself when Time began to take its revenge.) Butthe answer is simple enough: you happen to be thekind of being that thinks it does matter what courseyou steer; or, still more haughtily, you enjoy thepleasure of sailing.No, there is this factor in all success: self-confi-dence. If we analyze this, we find that it means thatone is aware that all one’s mental and physicalfaculties are working harmoniously. The deadliestand subtlest enemy of that feeling is anxiety aboutthe result; the finest gauze of doubt is enough to dimone’s vision, to throw the entire field out of focus.Hence, even to be aware that there is a result inprospect must militate against that serenity of spiritwhich is the essence of self-confidence. As you willknow, all our automatic physiological functionsare deranged if one is aware of them. This then, isthe difficulty, to enjoy consciously while not dis-turbing the process involved. The obvious physicalcase is the sexual act: perhaps its chief importanceis just that it is a type of this exceptional spiritual-mental condition. I hope, however, that you willremember what I have said on the subject in para-graphs 15-17 of my 3rd Lecture on Yoga forYellowbellies (pp. 71-72); there is a way of obtain-1 A letter dated Oct. 12, ’43 constituted No. 48 inMagick Without Tears and the following chaptersfrom the Book of Lies: — “Peaches”, “Pilgrim-Talk”, “Buttons and Rosettes”, “The Gun-Barreland the Mountaineer”."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears6ing ecstacy from the most insignificant physiologi-cal function. Observe that in transferring the wholeconsciousness to (say) one’s little finger or big toeis not trying to interfere with the normal exercise ofits activities, but only to realize what is going on inthe organism, the exquisite pleasure of a function inits normal activity. With a little imagination onecan conceive the analogical case of the Universeitself; and, still less fettered by even the mildestlimitation which material symbols necessarily (how-ever little) suggest, “Remember all ye that exist-ence is pure joy; ...” (AL, II, 9).Is it too bold to suggest that the gradual mergingof all these Ways into an interwoven unity may betaken as one mode of presentation of the Accom-plishment of the Great Work itself?At least, I feel fairly satisfied that meditation ofthem severally and jointly may help you to ananswer to your first question.2. Most people in my experience either cook upa hell-broth of self-induced obstacles to success inAstral traveling, or else shoot forth on the wings ofromantic imagination and fool themselves for therest of their lives in the manner of the Village Idiot.Yours, luckily, is the former trouble.But — is it plain obstinacy? — you do notexercise the sublime Art of Guru-bullying. Youshould have made one frenzied leap to my dyingbed, thrust aside the cohorts of MourningArchimandrites, and wrung my nose until I madeyou do it.And you repeatedly insist that it is difficult. Itisn’t. Is there, however, some deep-seated inhibi-tion — a (Freudian) fear of success? Is there someconnection with that sense of guilt which is born inall but the very few?But you don’t give it a fair chance. There is, Iadmit, some trick, or knack, about getting properlyacross; a faculty which one acquires (as a rule)quite suddenly and unexpectedly. Rather like mas-tering some shots at billiards. Practice has taughtme how to communicate this to students; only inrare cases does one fail. (It’s incredible: one mansimply could not be persuaded that intense physicalexertion was the wrong way to to it. There he sat,with the veins on his forehead almost on the point ofbursting, and the arms of my favourite chair visiblytrembling beneath his powerful grip!) In your case,I notice that you have got this practice mixed upwith Dharana: you write of “Emptying my mind ofeverything except the one idea, etc.” Then you goon: “The invoking of a supersensible Being isimpossible to me as yet.” The impudence! Thearrogance! How do you know, pray madam? (Dialnumbers at random: the results are often surpris-ingly delightful!) Besides, I didn’t ask you to in-voke a supersensible (what a word! Meaning?)Being right away, or at any time: that supersensibleis getting on my nerves: do you mean “not in normalcircumstances to be apprehended by the senses?” Isuppose so.In a word: do fix a convenient season for goingon the Astral Plane under my eye: half an hour (witha bit of luck) on not more than four evenings wouldput you in a very different frame of mind. You willsoon “feel your feet” and then “get your sea-legs”and then, much sooner than you think “Afloat in theaethyr, O my God! my God!” ..... “White swan,bear thou ever me up between thy wings!”3. Now then to your old Pons Asinorum aboutthe names of the Gods! Stand in the corner for halfan hour with your face to the wall! Stay in afterschool and write Malka be-Tharshishim v-Ruachothb-Schehalim 999 times!My dear, dear, dear sister, a name is a formula ofpower. How can you talk of “anachronism” whenthe Being is eternal? For the type of energy iseternal.Every name is a number: and “Every number isinfinite; there is no difference.” (AL I, 4). But oneName, or system of Names, may be more conve-nient either (a) to you personally or (b) to the workyou are at. E.g. I have very little sympathy withJewish Theology or ritual; but the Qabalah is sohandy and congenial that I use it more than almostany — or all the others together — for daily use andwork. The Egyptian Theogony is the noblest, themost truly magical, the most bound to me (or ratherI to it) by some inmost instinct, and by the memoryof my incarnation as Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, that I use it(with its Graeco-Phoenician child) for all work ofsupreme import. Why stamp my vitals, madam!The Abramelin Operation itself turned into thisform before I could so much as set to work on it! likethe Duchess’ baby (excuse this enthusiasm; but youhave aroused the British Lion-Serpent.)Note, please, that the equivalents given in 777are not always exact. Tahuti is not quite Thoth, stillless Hermes; Mercury is a very much more compre-hensive idea, but not nearly so exalted: Hanumanhardly at all. Nor is Tetragrammaton IAO, thougheven etymology asserts the identity.In these matters you must be catholic, eclectic,even syncretic. And you must consider the nature ofyour work. If I wanted to evoke Taphthartharath,there would be little help indeed from any but theQabalistic system; for that spirit’s precise formsand numbers are not to be found in any other.The converse, however, is not so true. TheQabalah, properly understood, properly treated, isso universal that one can vamp up a ritual to suitalmost “any name and form.” But in such a case onemay expect to have to reinforce it by a certainamount of historical, literary, or philosophic study— and research.4. Quite right, dear lady, about your incarnationmemories acting as a “Guide to the Way Back.” Ofcourse, if you “missed an Egyptian Incarnation,”you would not be so likely to be a little Martha,worried “about much serving.” Don’t get surfeitedwith knowledge, above all things; it is so veryfascinating, so dreadfully easy; and the danger ofbecoming a pedant — “Deuce take all your ped-ants! say I.” Don’t “dry-rot at ease ’till the Judg-ment Day.”No, I will NOT recommend a book. It should nothurt you too much to browse on condensed hay (orthistles) such as articles in Encyclopedias. TakeRoget’s Thesaurus or Smith’s Smaller ClassicalDictionary (and the like) to read yourself to sleepon. But don’t stultify yourself by taking up suchstudy too seriously. You only make yourself ridicu-lous by trying to do at 50 what you ought to havedone at 15. As you didn’t — tant pis! You can’tpossibly get the spirit; if you could, it would meanmerely mental indigestion. We have all read howCato started to learn Greek at 90: but the storystops there.

But don’t you darecome up for a test until you’ve been at it — andhard — for at least 100 exercises.I think this is your trouble about being “left in theair.” When I “present many new things” to you, thesting is in the tail — the practice that vitalizes it.Doctrinal stuff is fine “Lazily, lazily, drowsily,drowsily, in the noo-on-dye shaun!” An ounce ofyour practice is worth a ton of my teaching.

I must write at length about the Higher Selfor “God within us,” too easy to get muddled aboutit, and the subject requires careful preparation.666LCHAPTER IWHAT IS MAGICK?Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.What is Magick? Why should anyone study andpractice it? Very natural; the obvious preliminaryquestions of any subject soever. We must certainlyget all this crystal clear; fear not that I shall fail toset forth the whole business as concisely as possibleyet as fully, as cogently yet as lucidly, as may provewithin my power to do.At least I need not waste any time on telling youwhat Magick is not; or to go into the story of how theword came to be misapplied to conjuring tricks, andto sham miracles such as are to this day foisted bycharlatan swindlers, either within or without theRoman Communion, upon a gaping crew of piousimbeciles.First let me go all Euclidean, and rub your nosein the Definition, Postulate and Theorems given inmy comprehensive (but, alas! too advanced and tootechnical) Treatise on the subject. Here we are!I. DEFINITION:Magick is the Science and Art of causing Changeto occur in conformity with Will.(Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World ofcertain facts within my knowledge. I therefore take“magical weapons,” pen, ink, and paper; I write“incantations” — these sentences — in the “magi-cal language” i.e. that which is understood bypeople I wish to instruct. I call forth “spirits” suchas printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth,and constrain them to convey my message to thosepeople. The composition and distribution is thus anact of — MAGICK — by which I cause Changes totake place in conformity with my Will.2)II. POSTULATE:ANY required Change may be effected by appli-cation of the proper kind and degree of Force in theproper manner through the proper medium to theproper object.(Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chlo-ride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid, nitro-hydrochloric and no other, in sufficient quantityand of adequate strength, and place it, in a vesselwhich will not break, leak or corrode, in such amanner as will not produce undesirable results,with the necessary quantity of Gold, and so forth.Every Change has its own conditions.In the present state of our knowledge and powersome changes are not possible in practice; we can-not cause eclipses, for instance, or transform leadinto tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it istheoretically possible to cause in any object anychange of which that object is capable by nature;and the conditions are covered by the above postu-late.)III. THEOREMS:1. Every intentional act is a Magical Act.3(Illustration: See “Definition” above.)2. Every successful act has conformed to thepostulate.3. Every failure proves that one or more require-ments of the postulate have not been fulfilled.(Illustrations: There may be failure to under-stand the case; as when a doctor makes a wrongdiagnosis, and his treatment injures his patient.There may be failure to apply the right kind of force,as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light.There may be failure to apply the right degree offorce, as when a wrestler has his hold broken. Theremay be failure to apply the force in the right manner,as when one presents a cheque at the wrong windowof the Bank. There may be failure to employ thecorrect medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci foundhis masterpiece fade away. The force may be ap-plied to an unsuitable object, as when one tries tocrack a stone, thinking it a nut.)4. The first requisite for causing any change isthorough qualitative and quantitative understand-ing of the condition.(Illustration: The most common cause of failurein life is ignorance of one’s own True Will, or of themeans by which to fulfill that Will. A man mayfancy himself a painter, and waste his life trying tobecome one; or he may be really a painter, and yetfail to understand and to measure the difficultiespeculiar to that career.)5. The second requisite of causing any change isthe practical ability to set in right motion the neces-sary forces.(Illustration: A banker may have a perfect graspof a given situation, yet lack the quality of decision,or the assets, necessary to take advantage of it.)6. “Every man and every woman is a star.” Thatis to say, every human being is intrinsically anindependent individual with his own proper charac-ter and proper motion.7. Every man and every woman has a course,depending partly on the self, and partly on theenvironment which is natural and necessary foreach. Anyone who is forced from his own course,either through not understanding himself, or throughexternal opposition, comes into conflict with theorder of the Universe, and suffers accordingly.(Illustration: A man may think it his duty to actin a certain way, through having made a fancypicture of himself, instead of investigating his ac-tual nature. For example, a woman may makeherself miserable for life by thinking that she preferslove to social consideration, or vice versa. Onewoman may stay with an unsympathetic husbandwhen she would really be happy in an attic with alover, while another may fool herself into a roman-tic elopement when her only true pleasures arethose of presiding at fashionable functions. Again,a boy’s instinct may tell him to go to sea, while hisparents insist on his becoming a doctor. In such acase, he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy inmedicine.8. A man whose conscious will is at odds with hisTrue Will is wasting his strength. He cannot hope toinfluence his environment efficiently.(Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation,it is in no condition to undertake the invasion ofother countries. A man with cancer employs hisnourishment alike to his own use and to that of theenemy which is part of himself. He soon fails toresist the pressure of his environment. In practicallife, a man who is doing what his conscience tellshim to be wrong will do it very clumsily. At first!)9. A man who is doing his True Will has the1 Greek letters in the original.2 In one sense Magick may be defined as thename given to Science by the vulgar.3 By “intentional” I mean “willed”. But evenunintentional acts so seeming are not truly so. Thus,breathing is an act of the Will-to-live."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears8inertia of the Universe to assist him.(Illustration: The first principle of success inevolution is that the individual should be true to hisown nature, and at the same time adapt himself tohis environment.)10. Nature is a continuous phenomenon, thoughwe do not know in all cases how things are con-nected.(Illustration: Human consciousness depends onthe properties of protoplasm, the existence of whichdepends on innumerable physical conditions pecu-liar to this planet; and this planet is determined bythe mechanical balance of the whole universe ofmatter. We may then say that our consciousness iscausally connected with the remotest galaxies; yetwe do not know even how it arises from — or with— the molecular changes in the brain.)11. Science enables us to take advantage of thecontinuity of Nature by the empirical application ofcertain principles whose interplay involves differ-ent orders of idea, connected with each other in away beyond our present comprehension.(Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumb methods. We do not know what con-sciousness is, or how it is connected with muscularaction; what electricity is or how it is connectedwith the machines that generate it; and our methodsdepend on calculations involving mathematicalideas which have no correspondence in the Uni-verse as we know it.1)12. Man is ignorant of the nature of his ownbeing and powers. Even his idea of his limitations isbased on experience of the past. and every step in hisprogress extends his empire. There is, therefore, noreason to assign theoretical limits2 to what he maybe, or to what he may do.(Illustration: Two generations ago it was sup-posed theoretically impossible that man shouldever know the chemical composition of the fixedstars. It is known that our senses are adapted toreceive only an infinitesimal fraction of the possiblerates of vibration. Modern instruments have en-abled us to detect some of these supra-sensibles byindirect methods, and even to use their peculiarqualities in the service of man, as in the case of therays of Hertz and Roentgen. As Tyndall said, manmight at any moment learn to perceive and utilizevibrations of all conceivable and inconceivablekinds. The question of Magick is a question ofdiscovering and employing hitherto unknown forcesin nature. We know that they exist, and we cannotdoubt the possibility of mental or physical instru-ments capable of bringing us in relation with them.)13. Every man is more or less aware that hisindividuality comprises several orders of existence,even when he maintains that his subtler principlesare merely symptomatic of the changes in his grossvehicle. A similar order may be assumed to extendthroughout nature.(Illustration: One does not confuse the pain oftoothache with the decay which causes it. Inanimateobjects are sensitive to certain physical forces, suchas electrical and thermal conductivity; but neitherin us nor in them — so far as we know — is there anydirect conscious perception of these forces. Imper-ceptible influences are therefore associated with allmaterial phenomena; and there is no reason why weshould not work upon matter through those subtleenergies as we do through their material bases. Infact, we use magnetic force to move iron, and solarradiation to reproduce images.)14. Man is capable of being, and using, anythingwhich he perceives; for everything that he perceivesis in a certain sense a part of his being. He may thussubjugate the whole Universe of which he is con-scious to his individual Will.(Illustration: Man has used the idea of God todictate his personal conduct, to obtain power overhis fellows, to excuse his crimes, and for innumer-able other purposes, including that of realizinghimself as God. He has used the irrational andunreal conceptions of mathematics to help him inthe construction of mechanical devices. He hasused his moral force to influence the actions even ofwild animals. He has employed poetic genius forpolitical purposes.)15. Every force in the Universe is capable ofbeing transformed into any other kind of force byusing suitable means. There is thus an inexhaust-ible supply of any particular kind of force that wemay need.(Illustration: Heat may be transformed into lightand power by using it to drive dynamos. The vibra-tions of the air may be used to kill men by soordering them in speech as to inflame war-likepassions. The hallucinations connected with themysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuationof the species.)16. The application of any given force affects allthe orders of being which exist in the object to whichit is applied, whichever of those orders is directlyaffected.(Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, hisconsciousness, not his body only, is affected by myact; although the dagger, as such, has no directrelation therewith. Similarly, the power of mythought may so work on the mind of another personas to produce far-reaching physical changes in him,or in others through him.)17. A man may learn to use any force so as toserve any purpose, by taking advantage of theabove theorems.(Illustration: A man may use a razor to makehimself vigilant over his speech, by using it to cuthimself whenever he unguardedly utters a chosenword. He may serve the same purpose by resolvingthat every incident of his life shall remind him of aparticular thing, Making every impression the start-ing point of a connected series of thoughts ending inthat thing. He might also devote his whole energiesto some particular object, by resolving to do noth-ing at variance therewith, and to make every actturn to the advantage of that object.)18. He may attract to himself any force of theUniverse by making himself a fit receptacle for it,establishing a connection with it, and arrangingconditions so that its nature compels it to flowtoward him.(Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I diga well in a place where there is underground water;I prevent it from leaking away; and I arrange to takeadvantage of water’s accordance with the laws ofHydrostatics to fill it.)19. Man’s sense of himself as separate from, andopposed to, the Universe is a bar to his conductingits currents. It insulates him.(Illustration: A popular leader is most successfulwhen he forgets himself, and remembers only “TheCause.” Self-seeking engenders jealousies andschism. When the organs of the body assert theirpresence otherwise than by silent satisfaction, it is asign that they are diseased. The single exception isthe organ of reproduction. Yet even in this case self-assertion bears witness to its dissatisfaction withitself, since in cannot fulfill its function until com-pleted by its counterpart in another organism.)20. Man can only attract and employ the forcesfor which he is really fitted.(Illustration: You cannot make a silk purse outof a sow’s ear. A true man of science learns fromevery phenomenon. But Nature is dumb to thehypocrite; for in her there is nothing false.3)21. There is no limit to the extent of the relationsof any man with the Universe in essence; for as soonas man makes himself one with any idea, the meansof measurement cease to exist. But his power toutilize that force is limited by his mental power andcapacity, and by the circumstances of his humanenvironment.(Illustration: When a man falls in love, the wholeworld becomes, to him, nothing but love boundlessand immanent; but his mystical state is not conta-gious; his fellow-men are either amused or an-noyed. He can only extend to others the effect whichhis love has had upon himself by means of hismental and physical qualities. Thus, Catullus, Dante,and Swinburne made their love a mighty mover ofmankind by virtue of their power to put their thoughtson the subject in musical and eloquent language.Again, Cleopatra and other people in authoritymoulded the fortunes of many other people byallowing love to influence their political actions.The Magician, however well he succeeds in makingcontact with the secret sources of energy in nature,can only use them to the extent permitted by his1 For instance, “irrational,” “unreal,” and “infi-nite” expressions.2 i.e. except — possibly — in the case of logicallyabsurd questions, such as the schoolmen discussedin connection with “God.”3 It is no objection that the hypocrite is himselfpart of Nature.

Every individual is essentially sufficient tohimself. But he is unsatisfactory to himself until hehas established himself in his right relation with theUniverse.(Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, isuseless in the hands of savages. A poet, howeversublime, must impose himself upon his generationif he is to enjoy (and even to understand) himself, astheoretically should be the case.)23. Magick is the Science of understandingoneself and one’s conditions. It is the Art of apply-ing that understanding in action.(Illustration: A golf club is intended to move aspecial ball in a special way in special circum-stances. A Niblick should rarely be used on the tee,or a Brassie under the bank of a bunker. But, also,the use of any club demands skill and experience.)24. Every man has an indefeasible right to bewhat he is.(Illustration: To insist that anyone else shallcomply with one’s own standards is to outrage, notonly him, but oneself, since both parties are equallyborn of necessity.)25. Every man must do Magick each time that heacts or even thinks, since a thought is an internal actwhose influence ultimately affects action, though itmay not do so at the time.(Illustration: The least gesture causes a changein a man’s own body and in the air around him: itdisturbs the balance of the entire universe and itseffects continue eternally throughout all space.Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has itseffect on the mind. It stands as one of the causes ofevery subsequent thought, and tends to influenceevery subsequent action. A golfer may lose a fewyards on his drive, a few more with his second andthird, he may lie on the green six bare inches too farfrom the hole; but the net result of these triflingmishaps is the difference of a whole stroke, and soprobably between having and losing the hole.)26. Every man has a right, the right of self-preservation, to fulfill himself to the utmost.1(Illustration: A function imperfectly performedinjures, not only itself, but everything associatedwith it. If the heart is afraid to beat for fear ofdisturbing the liver, the liver is starved for blood,and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting diges-tion, which disorders respiration, on which cardiacwelfare depends.)27. Every man should make Magick the keynoteof his life. He should learn its laws and live by them.(Illustration: The Banker should discover thereal meaning of his existence, the real motive whichled him to choose that profession. He should under-stand banking as a necessary factor in the economicexistence of mankind, instead of as merely a busi-ness whose objects are independent of the generalwelfare. He should learn to distinguish false valuesfrom real, and to act not on accidental fluctuationsbut on considerations of essential importance. Sucha banker will prove himself superior to others;because he will not be an individual limited bytransitory things, but a force of Nature, as imper-sonal, impartial and eternal as gravitation, as pa-tient and irresistible as the tides. His system will notbe subject to panic, any more than the law of InverseSquares is disturbed by Elections. He will not beanxious about his affairs because they will not behis; and for that reason he will be able to direct themwith the calm, clear-headed confidence of an on-looker, with intelligence unclouded by self-interestand power unimpaired by passion.)28. Every man has a right to fulfill his own willwithout being afraid that it may interfere with thatof others; for if he is in his proper path, it is the faultof others if they interfere with him.(Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actu-ally appointed by destiny to control Europe, heshould not be blamed for exercising his rights. Tooppose him would be an error. Anyone so doingwould have made a mistake as to his own destiny,except in so far as it might be necessary for him tolearn the lessons of defeat. The sun moves in spacewithout interference. The order of Nature providesa orbit for each star. A clash proves that one or theother has strayed from its course. But as to each manthat keeps his true course, the more firmly he acts,the less likely are others to get in his way. Hisexample will help them to find their own paths andpursue them. Every man that becomes a Magicianhelps others to do likewise. The more firmly andsurely men move, and the more such action isaccepted as the standard of morality, the less willconflict and confusion hamper humanity.)Well, here endeth the First Lesson.That seems to me to cover the ground fairly well;at least, that is what I have to say when seriousanalysis is on the agenda.But there is a restricted and conventional sensein which the word may be used without straying toofar from the above philosophical position. Onemight say: —“Magick is the study and use of those forms ofenergy which are (a) subtler than the ordinaryphysical-mechanical types, (b) accessible only tothose who are (in one sense or another) ‘Initiates’.”I fear that this may sound rather obscurum perobscurius; but this is one of these cases — we arelikely to encounter many such in the course of ourresearches — in which we understand, quite wellenough for all practical purposes, what we mean,but which elude us more and more successfully themore accurately we struggle to define their import.We might fare even worse if we tried to clearthings up by making lists of events in history,tradition, or experience and classifying this as be-ing, and that as not being, true Magick. The border-land cases would confuse and mislead us.But — since I have mentioned history — I thinkit might help, if I went straight on to the latter partof your question, and gave you a brief sketch ofMagick past, present and future as it is seen from theinside. What are the principles of the “Masters”?What are They trying to do? What have They donein the past? What means do They employ?As it happens, I have by me a sketch written byM. Gerard Aumont of Tunis some twenty yearsago, which covers this subject with reasonableadequacy.I have been at the pains of translating it from hisFrench, I hope not too much reminiscent of the oldtraduttore, traditore. I will revise it, divide it (likeGaul) into Three Parts and send it along.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER IITHE NECESSITY OF MAGICK FOR ALLCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Right glad am I to hear that you have been sothoroughly satisfied with my explanation of whatMagick is, and on what its theories rest. It is good,too, hearing how much you were interested in theglimpse that you have had of some of its work in theworld; more, that you grasped the fact that thisapparently recondite and irrelevant informationhas an immediate bearing on your personal life oftoday. Still, I was not surprised that you should add:“But why should I make a special study of, anddevote my time and energy to acquiring proficiencyin, the Science and Art of Magick?Ah, well then, perhaps you have not understoodmy remarks at one of our earliest interviews asperfectly as you suppose! For the crucial point ofmy exposition was that Magick is not a matterextraneous to the main current of your life, asmusic, gardening, or collection jade might be. No,every act of your life is a magical act; wheneverfrom ignorance, carelessness, clumsiness or whatnot, you come short of perfect artistic success, youinevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration.Luckily for all of us, most of the acts essential tocontinued life are involuntary; the “unconscious”has become so used to doing its “True Will” thatthere is no need of interference; when such needarises, we call it disease, and seek to restore themachine to free spontaneous fulfillment of its func-tion.But this is only part of the story. As things are, wehave all adventured into an Universe of immeasur-able, of incalculable, possibilities, of situationsnever contemplated by the trend of Evolution. Manis a marine monster; when he decided that it wouldbe better for him somehow to live on land, he had to1 Men of “criminal nature” are simply at issuewith their true Wills. The murderer has the Will-to-live; and his will to murder is a false will at variancewith his true Will, since he risks death at the handsof Society by obeying his criminal impulse."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears10grow lungs instead of gills. When we want to travelover soft snow, we have to invent ski; when we wishto exchange thoughts, we must arrange a conven-tional code of sounds, of knots in string, of carvedor written characters — in a word — embark uponthe boundless ocean of hieroglyphics or symbols ofone sort or another. (Presently I shall have to ex-plain the supreme importance of such systems; infact, the Universe itself is not, and cannot be, any-thing but an arrangement of symbolic characters!)Here we are, then, caught in a net of circum-stances; if we are to do anything at all beyondautomatic vegetative living, we must consciouslyapply ourselves to Magick, “the Science and Art”(let me remind you!) “of causing change to occur inconformity with the Will.” Observe that the leastslackness or error means that things happen whichdo not thus conform; when this is so despite ourefforts, we are (temporarily) baffled; when it is ourown ignorance of what we ought to will, or lack ofskill in adapting our means to the right end, then weset up a conflict in our own Nature: our act issuicidal. Such interior struggle is at the base ofnearly all neuroses, as Freud recently “discovered”— as if this had not been taught, and taught withouthis massed errors, by the great teachers of the past!The Taoist doctrine, in particular, is most preciseand most emphatic on this point; indeed, it mayseem to some of us to overshoot the mark; fornothing is permissible in that scheme but friction-less adjustment and adaptation to circumstance.“Benevolence and righteousness” are actually dep-recated! That any such ideas should ever haveexisted (says Lao-tse) is merely evidence of theuniversal disorder. Taoist sectaries appear to as-sume that Perfection consists in the absence of anydisturbance of the Stream of Nescience; and this isvery much like the Buddhist idea of Nibbana.We who accept the Law of Thelema, even shouldwe concur in this doctrine theoretically, cannotadmit that in practice the plan would work out; ouraim is that our Nothing, ideally perfect as it is initself, should enjoy itself through realizing itself inthe fulfillment of all possibilities. All such phenom-ena or “point-events” are equally “illusion”; Noth-ing is always Nothing; but the projection of Noth-ing on this screen of the phenomenal does not onlyexplain, but constitutes, the Universe. It is the onlysystem which reconciles all the contradictions in-herent in Thought, and in Experience; for in it“Reality” is “Illusion”, “Free-will” is “Destiny”,the “Self” is the “Not-Self”; and so for every puzzleof Philosophy.Not too bad an analogy is an endless piece ofstring. Like a driving band, you cannot tie a knot init; all the complexities you can contrive are “TomFool” knots, and unravel at the proper touch. Al-ways either Naught or Two! But every new re-arrangement throws further light on the possibletangles, that is, on the Nature of the String itself. Itis always “Nothing” when you pull it out; butbecomes “Everything” as you play about with it,1since there is no limit to the combinations that youcan form from it, save only in your imagination(where the whole thing belongs!) and that growsmightily with Experience. It is accordingly wellworth while to fulfill oneself in every conceivablemanner.It is then (you will say) impossible to “do wrong”,since all phenomena are equally “Illusion” and theanswer is always “Nothing”. In theory one canhardly deny this proposition; but in practice — howshall I put it? “The state of Illusion which forconvenience I call my present consciousness is suchthat the course of action A is more natural to me thatthe course of action B?”Or: A is a shorter cut to Nothing; A is less likelyto create internal conflict.Will that serve?Offer a dog a juicy bone, and a bundle of hay; hewill naturally take the bone, whereas a horse wouldchoose the hay. So, while you happen to imagineyourself to be a Fair Lady seeking the HiddenWisdom, you come to me; if you thought you werea Nigger Minstrel, you would play the banjo, andsing songs calculated to attract current coin of theRealm from a discerning Public! The two actionsare ultimately identical — see AL I, 22 — and yourperception of that fact would make you an Initiateof very high standing; but in the work-a-day world,you are “really” the Fair Lady, and leave the min-strel to grow infirm and old and hire an orphan boyto carry his banjo!Now then, what bothers me it this: Have I or haveI not explained this matter of “Magick” — “Whyshould I (who have only just heard of it, at least asa serious subject of study) acquire a knowledge ofits principles, and of the powers conferred by itsmastery?” Must I bribe you with promises of health,wealth, power over others, knowledge, thau-maturgical skill, success in every worldly ambition— as I could quite honestly do? I hope there is nosuch need — and yet, shall I confess it? — it wasonly because all the “good things of life” weresuddenly seen of me to be worthless, that I took thefirst steps towards the attainment of that Wisdomwhich, while enjoying to the full the “Feast of Life,”guarantees me against surfeit, poison or interrup-tion by the knowledge that it is all a Dream, andgives me the Power to turn that dream at will intoany form that happens to appeal to my Inclination.Let me sum up, very succinctly; as usual, myenthusiasm has lured me into embroidering mysage discourse with Poets’ Imagery!Why should you study and practice Magick?Because you can’t help doing it, and you had betterdo it well than badly. You are on the links, whetheryou like it or not; why go on topping your drive, andslicing your brassie, and fluffing your niblick, andpulling your iron, and socketing your mashie andnot being up with your putt — that’s 6, and you arenot allowed to pick up. It’s a far cry to the Nine-teenth, and the sky threatens storm before the immi-nent night.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER IIIHIEROGLYPHICS: LIFE ANDLANGUAGE NECESSARILY SYMBOLICCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Very natural, the irritation in your last! Youwrite: —“But why? Why all this elaborate symbolism?Why not say straight out what you mean? Surelythe subject is difficult enough in any case — mustyou put on a mask to make it clear? I know you wellenough by now to be sure that you will not fob meoff with any Holy-Willie nonsense about the inef-fable, about human language being inadequate toreveal such Mysteries, about the necessity of con-structing a new language to explain a new system ofthought; of course I know that this had to be done inthe case of chemistry, of higher mathematics, in-deed of almost all technical subjects; but I feel thatyou have some other, deeper explanation in reserve.After all, most of what I am seeking to learn fromyou has been familiar to many of the great minds ofhumanity for many centuries. Indeed, the Qabalahis a special language, and that is old enough; thereis not much new material to fit into that structure.But why did they, in the first place, resort to thissymbolic jargon?”You put it very well; and when I think it over, Ifeel far from sure that the explanation which I amabout to inflict upon you will satisfy you, or evenwhether it will hold water! In the last resort, I shallhave to maintain that we are justified by experience,by the empirical success in communicating thoughtwhich has attended, and continues to attend, ourendeavors.But to give a complete answer, I shall have to goback to the beginning, and restate the originalproblem; and I beg that you will not suppose that Iam evading the question, or adopting the Irishmethod of answering it by another, though I knowit may sound as if I were.Let me set out by restating our original problem;what we want is Truth; we want an even closerapproach to Reality; and we want to discover anddiscuss the proper means of achieving this object.Very good; let us start by the simplest of allpossible enquiries — and the most difficult —“What is anything?” “What do we know?” andother questions that spring naturally from these.I see a tree.I hear it — rustling or creaking in the wind.I touch it — hard.I smell it — acrid.I taste it — bitter.Now all the information given by these fivesenses has to be put together, although no two agreein any sort of way. The logic by which we build upour complex idea of a tree has more holes than asponge.1 N ± N = Two or Naught; one is the Magical, theother the mystical, process. You will hear a lotabout this one day!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears11But this is to jump far ahead: we must firstanalyze the single, simple impression. “I see a tree.”This phenomenon is what is called a “point-event.”It is the coming together of the two, the seer and theseen. It is single and simple; yet we cannot conceiveof either of them as anything but complex. And thePoint-Event tells us nothing whatever about either;both, as Herbert Spencer and God knows how manyothers have shown, unknowable; it stands by itself,alone and aloof. It has happened; it is undeniablyReality. Yet we cannot confirm it; for it can neverhappen again precisely the same. What is evenmore bewildering is that since it takes time for theeye to convey an impression to the consciousness (itmay alter in 1,000 ways in the process!) all thatreally exists is a memory of the Point-Event. not thePoint-Event itself. What then is this Reality ofwhich we are so sure? Obviously, it has not got aname, since it never happened before, or can happenagain! To discuss it at all we must invent a name,and this name (like all names) cannot possibly beanything more than a symbol.Even so, as so often pointed out, all we do is to“record the behaviour of our instruments.” Nor arewe much better off when we’ve done it; for oursymbol, referring as it does to a phenomenon uniquein itself, and not to be apprehended by another, canmean nothing to one’s neighbors. What happens, ofcourse, is that similar, though not identical, Point-Events happen to many of us, and so we are able toconstruct a symbolic language. My memory of themysterious Reality resembles yours sufficiently toinduce us to agree that both belong to the sameclass.But let me furthermore ask you to reflect on theformation of language itself. Except in the case ofonomatopoeic words and a few others, there is nological connection between a thing and the sound ofour name for it. “Bow-wow” is a more rationalname than “dog”, which is a mere conventionagreed on by the English, while other nations preferchien, hund, cane, kalb, kutta and so on. Allsymbols, you see, my dear child, and it’s no goodyour kicking!But it doesn’t stop there. When we try to conveythought by writing, we are bound to sit downsolidly, and construct a holy Qabalah out of noth-ing. Why would a curve open to the right, sound likethe ocean, open at the top, like you? And all thesearbitrary symbolic letters are combined by just assymbolic and arbitrary devices to take on conven-tional meanings, these words again combined intophrases by no less high-handed a procedure.And then folk wonder how it is that there shouldbe error and misunderstanding in the transmissionof thought from one person to another! Ratherregard it as a miraculous intervention of Providencewhen even one of even the simplest ideas “getsacross.” Now then, this being so, it is evidently goodsense to construct one’s own alphabet, with one’sown very precise definitions, in order to handle anabstruse and technical subject like Magick. The“ordinary” words such as God, self, soul, spirit andthe rest have been used so many thousand times inso many thousand ways, usually by writers whoknew not, or cared not for the necessity of definitionthat to use them to-day in any scientific essay isalmost ludicrous.That is all, just now, sister; no more of yourcavilling, please; sit down quietly with your 777,and get it by heart!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER IVTHE QABALAH, THE BEST TRAININGFOR MEMORYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Now you must learn Qabalah. Learn this Alpha-bet of Magick. You must take it on trust, as a childdoes his own alphabet. No one has ever found outwhy the order of the letters is what it is. Probablythere isn’t any answer.If you only knew what I am grappling with in theYi King! the order of the sixty-four hexagrams. I amconvinced that it is extremely significant, that itimplies a sublime system of philosophy. I’ve got farenough to be absolutely sure that there is a neces-sary rhythm; and it’s killing me by millimetres,finding out why each pair succeeds the last. Forgivethese tears!But our Magical Alphabet is primarily not let-ters, but figures, not sounds but mathematical ideas.Sir Humphrey Davy, coming out of his famousillumination (with some help from Nitrous Oxidehe got in) exclaimed: The Universe is composedsolely of ideas. We, analyzing this a little, say: TheUniverse is a mathematical expression.Sir James Jeans might have said this, only hisbanker advised him to cash in on God. The simplestform of this expression is 0 = 2, elsewhere ex-pounded at great length. This 2 might itself beexpressed in an indefinitely great number of ways.Every prime number, including some not in theseries of “natural numbers”, is an individual. Theother numbers with perhaps a few exceptions (e.g.418) are composed of their primes.Each of these ideas may be explained, investi-gated, understood, by means very various. Firstly,the Hebrew, Greek and Arabic numbers are alsoletters. Then, each of these letters is further de-scribed by one of the (arbitrarily composed) “ele-ments of Nature;” the Four (or Five) Elements, theSeven (or Ten) Planets, and the Twelve Signs of theZodiac.All these are arranged in a geometrical designcomposed of ten “Sephiroth” (numbers) and twenty-two “paths” joining them; this is called the Tree ofLife.Every idea soever can be, and should be, attrib-uted to one or more of these primary symbols; thusgreen, in different shades, is a quality or function ofVenus, the Earth, the Sea, Libra, and others. So alsoabstract ideas; dishonesty means “an afflicted Mer-cury,” generosity a good, though not always strong,Jupiter; and so on.The Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart; youmust know it backwards, forwards, sideways, andupside down; it must become the automatic back-ground of all your thinking. You must keep onhanging everything that comes your way upon itsproper bough.At first, of course, all this is dreadfully confus-ing; but persist, and a time will come when all theodd bits fit into the jig-saw, and you behold — withwhat adoring wonder! — the marvellous beautyand symmetry of the Qabalistic system.And then — what a weapon you will haveforged!What power to analyze, to order, to manipulateyour thinking!And please remember when people complimentyou on your memory or the clarity of your thought,to give credit to the Qabalah!That’s fine, I seem to hear you purr; that looks alovely machine. The Design is just elegant; thatscarf-pin of yours is perfectly sweet. There’s onlyone point: how to make the damn thing work?Ah yes, like the one in the Apocalypse, the stingis in your tail.Honest, you needn’t worry; it works on ball-bearings, and there’s always those “Thirteen Foun-tains of Magnificent Oil flowing down the Beard ofMacroprosopus” in case it creaks a little at first. Butseriously, all the mathematics you need is simpleAddition and Multiplication.“Yeah!” you rudely reply. “That’s what youthink; but you haven’t got very far in the Qabalah!”Too true, sister.The Book of the Law itself insists upon the factthat it contains a Qabalah which was beyond me atthe time of its dictation, is beyond me now, andalways will be beyond me in this incarnation. Letme direct your spiritual attention to AL I, 54; I, 56;II, 54-55; II, 76; III, 47.Now there was enough comprehensible at thetime to assure me that the Author of the Book knewat least as much Qabalah as I did: I discoveredsubsequently more than enough to make it certainwithout error that he knew a very great deal more,and that of an altogether higher order, than I knew;finally, such glimmerings of light as time and des-perate study have thrown on many other obscurepassages, to leave no doubt whatever in my mindthat he is indeed the supreme Qabalist of all time....“I asked you how to work it.”Don’t be so peevish, querulous, and impatient;your zeal is laudable, but it’s wasting your owntime to hurry me.Well, when you’ve got this Alphabet of Num-bers (in its proper shape) absolutely by heart, withas many sets of attributions as you can commit tomemory without getting confused, you may try afew easy exercises, beginning with the past.(“How many sets of attributions?” — Well,certainly, the Hebrew and Greek Alphabets withthe names and numbers of each letter, and itsmeaning: a couple of lists of God-names, with aclear idea of the character, qualities, functions, and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears12importance of each; the “King-scale” of colour, allthe Tarot attributions, of course; then animals,plants, drugs, perfumes, a list or two of archangels,angels, intelligences and spirits — that ought to beenough for a start.)Now you are armed! Ask yourself: why is theinfluence of Tiphareth transmitted to Yesod by thePath of Samekh, a fence, 60, Sagittarius, the Ar-cher, Art, blue — and so on; but to Hod by the Pathof Ayin, an eye, 70, Capricornus, the Goat, theDevil, Indigo, κ.τ.λ.Thirteen is the number of Achad, Unity, andAhebah, Love; then what word should arise whenyou expand it by the Creative Dyad, and get 26;what when you multiply it by 4, and get 52? Then,suppose the Pentagram gets busy, 13 x 5 = 65, whatthen?Now don’t you dare to come round crawling tome for the answers; work it out yourself what sort ofwords they ought to be, and then check your resultby looking up those numbers in the SepherSephiroth: Equinox Vol. I, No. 8, Supplement.When you are a real adept at all these well-known calculations “prepare to enter the Immea-surable Region” and dig out the Unknown.You must construct your own Qabalah!Nobody can do it for you. What is your own trueNumber? You must find it and prove it to be correct.In the course of a few years, you should have builtyourself a Palace of Ineffable Glory, a Garden ofIndescribable Delight. Nor Time nor Fate can tamethose tranquil towers, those Minarets of Music, orfade one blossom in those avenues of Perfume!Humph! Nasty of me: but it has just struck methat it might be just as well if you made a SepherSephiroth of your own! What a positively beastlything to suggest! However, I do suggest it.After all, it’s simple enough. Every word youcome across, add it up, stick it down against thatnumber in a book kept for the purpose. That mayseem tedious and silly; why should you do all overagain the work that I have already done for you?Reason: simple. Doing it will teach you Qabalah asnothing else could. Besides, you won’t be all clut-tered up with words that mean nothing to you; andif it should happen that you want a word to explainsome particular number, you can look it up in mySepher Sephiroth.By this method, too, you may strike a rich veinof words of your own that I have altogether missed.No doubt, a Really Great Teacher would havesaid: “Beware! Use my Dictionary, and mine alone!All others are spurious!” But then I’m not a R.G.T.of that kind.For a start, of course, you should put down thewords that are bound to come in your way in anycase: numbers like 11, 13, 31, 37, and their mul-tiples; the names of God and the principal angels;the planetary and geomantic names; and your ownprivate and particular name with its branches. Afterthat, let your work on the Astral Plane guide you.When investigating the name and other words com-municated to you by such beings as you meet there,or invoke, many more will come up in their properconnections. Very soon you will have quite a nicelittle Sepher Sephiroth of your very own. Remem-ber to aim, above all things, at coherence.It is excellent practice, by the way, to do somemental arithmetic on your walks; acquire the habitof adding up any names that you have come acrossin your morning’s reading. Nietzsche has well ob-served that the best thoughts come by walking; andit has happened to me, more than once or twice, thatreally important correspondences have come, as bya flashlight, when I was padding the old hoof.You will have noticed that in this curt expositionI have confined myself to Gematria, the directrelation of number and work, omitting any refer-ence to Notariqon, the accursed art of makingwords out of initials, like (in profane life) Wren andGestapo and their horrid brood, or to Temurah, theart of altering the position of the letters in a word, asort of cipher; for these are almost always frivolous.To base any serious calculations on them would beabsurd.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. You should study the Equinox Vol. I, No. 5,“The Temple of Solomon the King” for a moreelaborate exposition of the Qabalah.CHAPTER VTHE UNIVERSE. THE 0 = 2 EQUATIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Yes, I admit everything! It is all my fault. Look-ing over my past writings, I do see that my only one-pointed attempt to set forth a sound ontology wasmy early fumbling letter brochure Berashith.1 Sincethen, I seem to have kept assuming that everybodyknew all about it; referring to it, quoting it, butnever sitting down seriously to demonstrate thethesis, or even to state it in set terms. Chapter 0 ofMagick in Theory and Practice skates gently overit; the “Naples Arrangement” in The Book of Thothdodges it with really diabolical ingenuity. I askmyself why. It is exceedingly strange, becauseevery time I think of the Equation, I am thrilled witha keen glow of satisfaction that this sempiternalRiddle of the Sphinx should have been answered atlast.So then let me now give myself the delight, andyou the comfort, of stating the problem from itsbeginning, and proving the soundness of the solu-tion — of showing that the contradiction of thisEquation is unthinkable. — Are you ready? For-ward! Paddle!A. We are aware.B. We cannot doubt the existence (whether “real”or “illusory” makes no difference) of something,because doubt itself is a form of awareness.C. We lump together all that of which we areaware under the convenient name of “Existence”,or “The Universe”. Cosmos is not so good for thispurpose; that word implies “order”, which in thepresent stage of our argument, is a mere assump-tion.D. We also tend to think of the Universe ascontaining things of which we are not aware; butthis is altogether unjustifiable, although it is diffi-cult to think at all without making some suchassumption. For instance, one may come upon anew branch of knowledge — say, histology orHammurabi or the language of the Iroquois or thepoems of the Hermaphrodite of Panormita. It seemsto be there all ready waiting for us; we simplycannot believe that we are making it all up as we goalong. For all that, it is sheer sophistry; we maymerely be unfolding the contents of our own minds.Then again, does a thing cease to exist if we forgetit? The answer is that one cannot be sure.Personally, I feel convinced of the existence ofan Universe outside my own immediate awareness;but it is true, even so, that it does not exist for meunless and until it takes its place as part of myconsciousness.E. All this paragraph D is in the nature of adigression, for what you may think of it does not atall touch the argument of this letter. But it had to beput in, just to prevent your mind from raisingirrelevant objections. Let me continue, then, fromC.F. Something is.2 This something appears incal-culably vast and complex. How did it come to be?This, briefly, is the “Riddle of the Universe,”which has been always the first preoccupation of allserious philosophers since men began to think at all.G. The orthodox idiot answer, usually wrappedup in obscure terms in the hope of concealing fromthe enquirer the fact that it is not an answer at all, butan evasion, is: God created it.Then, obviously, who created God? Sometimeswe have a Demiurge, a creative God behind whomis an eternal formless Greatness — anything toconfuse the issue!Sometimes the Universe is supported by an el-ephant; he, in turn, stands on a tortoise ... by thattime it is hoped that the enquirer is too tired andmuddled to ask what holds up the tortoise.Sometimes, a great Father and Mother crystal-lize out of some huge cloudy confusion of “Ele-ments” — and so on. But nobody answers thequestion; at least, none of these God-inventingmules, with their incurably commonplace minds.H. Serious philosophy has always begun bydiscarding all these puerilities. It has of necessitybeen divided into these schools: the Nihilist, theMonist, and the Dualist.I. The last of these is, on the surface, the mostplausible; for almost the first thing that we notice oninspecting the Universe is what the Hindu schoolscall “the Pairs of Opposites.”This too, is very convenient, because it lendsitself so readily to orthodox theology; so we haveOrmuzd and Ahriman, the Devas and the Asuras,Osiris and Set, et cetera and da capo, personifica-1 See Crowley, Collected Works.2 You must read The Soldier an The Hunch-back: ! and ? in the Equinox I, 1."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears13tions of “Good” and “Evil.” The foes may be fairlymatched; but more often the tale tells of a revolt inheaven. In this case, “Evil” is temporary; soon,especially with the financial help of the devout, the“devil” will be “cast into the Bottomless Pit” and“the Saints will reign with Christ in glory for everand ever, Amen!” Often a “redeemer,” a “dyingGod,” is needed to secure victory to Omnipotence;and this is usually what little vulgar boys might calla “touching story!”J. The Monist (or Advaitist) school, is at oncesubtler and more refined; it seems to approach theultimate reality (as opposed to the superficial ex-amination of the Dualists) more closely.It seems to me that this doctrine is based upon asorites of doubtful validity. To tell you the hid-eously shameful truth, I hate this doctrine so rabidlythat I can hardly trust myself to present it fairly! ButI will try. Meanwhile, you can study it in theUpanishads, in the Bhagavad-Gita, in ErnstHaeckel’s The Riddle of the Universe, and dozensof other classics. The dogma appears to excite itsdupes to dithyrambs. I have to admit the “poetry” ofthe idea; but there is something in me which vehe-mently rejects it with excruciating and vindictiveviolence. Possibly, this is because part of our ownsystem runs parallel with the first equations oftheirs.K. The Monists perceive quite clearly and cor-rectly that it is absurd to answer the question “Howcame these Many things (of which we are aware) tobe?” by saying that they came from Many; and“Many” in this connection includes Two. The Uni-verse must therefore be a single phenomenon: makeit eternal and all the rest of it — i.e. remove all limitof any kind — and the Universe explains itself. Howthen can Opposites exist, as we observe them to do?Is it not the very essence of our original Sorites thatthe Many must be reducible to the One? They seehow awkward this is; so the “devil” of the Dualistis emulsified and evaporated into “illusion;” whatthey call “Maya” or some equivalent term.“Reality” for them consists solely of Brahman,the supreme Being “without quantity or quality.”They are compelled to deny him all attributes, eventhat of Existence; for to do so would instantly limitthem, and so hurl them headlong back in to Dual-ism. All that of which we are aware must obviouslypossess limits, or it could have no intelligible mean-ing for us; if we want “pork,” we must specify itsqualities and quantities; at the very least, we mustbe able to distinguish it from “that-which-is-not-pork.”But — one moment, please!L. There is in Advaitism a most fascinatingdanger; that is that, up to a certain point, “ReligiousExperience” tends to support this theory.A word on this. Vulgar minds, such as are happywith a personal God, Vishnu, Jesus, Melcarth,Mithras, or another, often excite themselves — callit “Energized Enthusiasm” if you want to be sarcas-tic! — to the point of experiencing actual Visions ofthe objects of their devotion. But these people havenot so much as asked themselves the original ques-tion of “How come?” which is our present subject.Sweep them into the discard!M. Beyond Vishvarupadarshana, the vision ofthe Form of Vishnu, beyond that yet loftier visionwhich corresponds in Hindu classification to our“Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guard-ian Angel”, is that called Atmadarshana, the vision(or apprehension, a much better word) of theUniverse as a single phenomenon, outside all limi-tations, whether of time, space, causality, or whatnot.Very good, then! Here we are with direct realiza-tion of the Advaitist theory of the Universe. Every-thing fits perfectly. Also, when I say “realization,”I want you to understand that I mean what I say ina sense so intense and so absolute that it is impos-sible to convey my meaning to anyone who has notundergone that experience.1How do we judge the “reality” of an ordinaryimpression upon consciousness? Chiefly by its in-tensity, by its persistence, by the fact that nobodycan argue us out of our belief in it. As people said ofBerkeley’s ‘Idealism’ — “his arguments are irre-futable but they fail to carry conviction.” No scep-tical, no idealist queries can persuade us that a kickin the pants is not ‘real’ in any reasonable sense ofthe word. Moreover memory reassures us. How-ever vivid a dream may be at the time, however itmay persist throughout the years (though it is rarefor any dream, unless frequently repeated, or linkedto waking impressions by some happy conjunctionof circumstances, to remain long in the mind withany clear-cut vision) it is hardly ever mistaken foran event of actual life. Good: then, as waking life isto dream, so — yes, more so! — is ReligiousExperience as above described to that life commonto all of us. It is not merely easy, it is natural, notmerely natural, but inevitable, for anyone who hasexperienced “Samadhi” (this word convenientlygroups the higher types of vision2) to regard normallife as “illusion” by comparison with this state inwhich all problems are resolved, all doubts drivenout, all limitations abolished.But even beyond Atmadarshana comes the expe-rience called Sivadarshana,3 in which this Atman(or Brahman), this limit-destroying Universe, isitself abolished and annihilated.(And, with its occurrence, smash goes the wholeof the Advaitist theory!)It is a commonplace to say that no words candescribe this final destruction. Such is the fact; andthere is nothing one can do about it but put it downboldly as I have done above. It does not matter toour present purpose; all that we need to know is thatthe strongest prop of the Monist structure has bro-ken off short.Moreover, is it really adequate to postulate anorigin of the Universe, as they inevitably do? Merelyto deny that there ever was a beginning by sayingthat this “one” is eternal fails to satisfy me.What is very much worse, I cannot see that to callEvil “illusion” helps us at all. When the ChristianScientist hears that his wife has been savagelymauled by her Peke, he has to smile, and say that“there is a claim of error.” Not good enough.N. It has taken a long while to clear the ground.That I did not expect; the above propositions are sofamiliar to me, they run so cleanly through mymind, that, until I came to set them down in order,I had no idea what a long and difficult business it allwas.Still, it’s a long lane, etc. We have seen that“Two” (or “Many”) are unsatisfactory as origin, ifonly because they can always be reduced to “One”;and “One” itself is no better, because, among otherthings, it finds itself forced to deny the very pre-mises on which it was founded.Shall we be any better off if we assume that “Exnihilo nihil fit” is a falsehood, that the origin of AllThings is Nothing? Let us see!O. Shall we first glance at the mathematicalaspect of Nothing? (Including its identical equationin Logic.) This I worked out so long ago as 1902e.g. in Berashith, which you will find reprinted inThe Sword of Song, and in my Collected Works,Vol. I.The argument may be summarized as follows.When, in the ordinary way of business, we write0, we should really write 0n. For 0 implies that thesubject is not extended in any dimension underdiscussion. Thus a line may be two feet in length,but in breadth and depth the coefficient is Zero. Wecould describe it as 2f + 0b + 0d, or n2f + 0b + 0d.What I proposed in considering “What do wemean by Nothing?” was to consider every possiblequality of any object as a dimension.For instance, one might describe this page asbeing nf + n’b + n”d + 0 redness + 0 amiability +0 velocity + 0 potential and so on, until you hadnoted and measured all the qualities it possesses,and excluded all that it does not. For convenience,we may write this expression as Xf+b+d+r+a+v+p —using the initials of the qualities which we calldimensions.Just one further explanation in pure mathemat-ics. To interpret X1, X1+1 or X2, and so on, weassume the reference to be to spatial dimensions.Thus suppose X1 to be a line a foot long, X2 will bea plane a foot square, and X3 a cube measuring afoot in each dimension. But what about X4? Thereare no more spatial dimensions. Modern mathemat-ics has (unfortunately, I think) agreed to considerthis fourth dimension as time. Well, and X5? Tointerpret this expression, we may begin to considerother qualities, such as electric capacity, colour,moral attributes, and so on. But this remark, al-though necessary, leads us rather away from ourmain thesis instead of toward it.1 I have discussed this and the following pointsvery fully in Book 4 Part I, pp. 63-892 “Vision” is a dreadfully bad word for it; “trance”is better, but idiots always mix it up with hypnotism.3 Possibly almost identical with the BuddhistNeroda-Samapatti."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears14P. What happens when we put a minus signbefore the index (that small letter up on the right)instead of a plus? Quite simple. X2 = X1+1 = X1 + X1.With a minus, we divide instead of multiplying.Thus, X3-2 = X3 ÷ X2 = X1, just as if you had merelysubtracted the 2 from the 3 in the index.Now, at last, we come to the point of real impor-tance to our thesis: how shall we interpret X0? Wemay write it, obviously, as X1-1 or Xn-n. Good,divide. Then X1 ÷ X1 = 1. This is the same, clearlyenough, whatever X may be.Q. Ah, but what we started to do was discover themeaning of Nothing. It is not correct to write itsimply as 0; for that 0 implies an index 01, or 02, or0n. And if our Nothing is to be absolute Nothing,then there is not only no figure, but no index either.So we must write it as 00.What is the value of this expression? We proceedas before; divide.Of course 0n ÷ 1 remains 0; but 1 ÷ 0n = ∞.That is, we have a clash of the “infinitely great”with the “infinitely small;” that knocks out the“infinity” (and Advaitism with it!) and leaves uswith an indeterminate but finite number of uttervariety. That is: 00 can only be interpreted as “TheUniverse that we know.”R. So much for one demonstration. Some peoplehave found fault with the algebra; but the logicalEquivalent is precisely parallel. Suppose I wish todescribe my study in one respect: I can say “No dogsare in my study,” or “Dogs are not in my study.” Ican make a little diagram: D is the world of dogs; Sis my study. Here it is:The squares are quite separate. The whole worldoutside the square D is the world of no dogs: outsidethe square S, the world of no-study. But supposenow that I want to make the Zero absolute, like our00, I must say “No dogs are not in my study.”Or, “There is no absence-of-dog in my study.”That is the same as saying: “Some doge are in mystudy;” diagram again:In Diagram 1, “the world where no dogs are”included the whole of my study; in Diagram 2 thatabsence-of-dog is no longer there; so one or more ofthem must have got in somehow.That’s that; I know it may be a little difficult atfirst; fortunately there is a different way — theChinese way — of stating the theorem in very muchsimpler terms.S. The Chinese, like ourselves, begin with theidea of “Absolute Nothing.” They “make an effort,and call it the Tao;” but that is exactly what the Taocomes to mean, when we examine it. They see quitewell, as we have done above, that merely to assertNothing is not to explain the Universe; and theyproceed to do so by means of a mathematicalequation even simpler than ours, involving as itdoes no operations beyond simple addition andsubtraction. They say “Nothing obviously meansNothing; it has no qualities nor quantities.” (TheAdvaitists said the same, and then stultified them-selves completely by calling it One!) “But,” con-tinue the sages of the Middle Kingdom, “it is alwayspossible to reduce any expression to Nothing bytaking any two equal and opposite terms.” (Thus n+ (-n) = 0.) “We ought therefore to be able to get anyexpression that we want from Nothing; we merelyhave to be careful that the terms shall be preciselyopposite and equal.” (0 = n + (-n).) This then theydid, and began to diagrammatize the Universe asthe Î — a pair of opposites, the Yang or active male,and the Yin or passive Female, principles. Theyrepresented the Yang by an unbroken ( ——— ),the Yin by a broken ( ——— ), line. (The firstmanifestation in Nature of these two is Thâi Yang,the Sun, and the Thâi Yin, the Moon.) This being alittle large and loose, they doubled these lines, andobtained the four Hsiang. They then took themthree at a time, and got the eight Kwa.

To remind you, and to amplify certainpoints of the above, let me quote from Magick pp.152-3 footnote 2.“All elements must at one time have been sepa-rate — that would be the case with great heat. Nowwhen atoms get to the sun, we get that immenseextreme heat, and all the elements are themselvesagain. Imagine that each atom of each elementpossesses the memory of all his adventures in com-bination. By the way, that atom (fortified with thatmemory) would not be the same atom; yet it is,because it has gained nothing from anywhere ex-cept this memory. Therefore, by the lapse of time,and by virtue of memory, a thing could becomesomething more than itself; thus a real developmentis possible. One can then see a reason for anyelement deciding to go through this series of incar-nations, because so, and only so, can he go; and hesuffers the lapse of memory which he has duringthese incarnations, because he knows he will comethrough unchanged.“Therefore you can have an infinite number ofgods, individual and equal though diverse, each onesupreme and utterly indestructible. This is also theonly explanation of how a “Perfect Being” couldcreate a world in which war, evil, etc., exist. God isonly an appearance, because (like “good”) it cannotaffect the substance itself, but only multiply itscombinations. This is something the same as mysticmonotheism; but the objection to that theory is thatGod has to create things which are all parts ofhimself, so that their interplay is false. If we presup-pose many elements, their interplay is natural.“It is no objection to this theory to ask who madethe elements — the elements are at least there, andGod, when you look for him, is not there. Theism isobscurum per obscurius. A male star is built upfrom the centre outwards; a female from the circum-ference inwards. This is what is meant when we saythat woman has no soul. It explains fully the differ-ence between the sexes.”Every “act of love under will” has the dual result(1) the creation of a child combining the qualities ofits parents, (2) the withdrawal by ecstasy into Noth-ingness.

Gerard Aumont’spromised essay;1 it was originally called “The ThreeSchools of Magick”. (Don’t be cross, please, be-cause it is not in the form of a personal letter!)1 A few amendments — very few — have beennecessitated by the lapse of time."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears15There is today much misunderstanding of themeaning of the term “Magick”. Many attemptshave been made to define it, but perhaps the best forour present purpose of historical-ideological expo-sition will be this — Magick is the Science of theIncommensurables.This is one of the many restricted uses of theword; one suited to the present purpose.It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so oftenmixed up in the popular idea of a religion, hasnothing to do with it. It is, in fact, the exact oppositeof religion; it is, even more than Physical Science,its irreconcilable enemy.Let us define this difference clearly.Magick investigates the laws of Nature with theidea of making use of them. It only differs from“profane” science by always keeping ahead of it. AsFraser has shown, Magick is science in the tentativestage; but it may be, and often is, more than this. Itis science which, for one reason or another, cannotbe declared to the profane.Religion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore thelaws of Nature, or to escape them by appeal to apostulated power which is assumed to have laidthem down. The religious man is, as such, inca-pable of understanding what the laws of Naturereally are. (They are generalizations from the orderof observed fact.)The History of Magick has never been seriouslyattempted. For one reason, only initiates pledged tosecrecy know much about it; for another, everyhistorian has been talking about some more or lessconventional idea of Magick, not of the thing itself.But Magick has led the world from before thebeginning of history, if only for the reason thatMagick has always been the mother of Science. It is,therefore, of extreme importance that some effortshould be made to understand something of thesubject; and there is, therefore, no apology neces-sary for essaying this brief outline of its historicalaspects.There have always been, at least in nucleus,three main Schools of Philosophical practice. (Weuse the word “philosophical” in the old good broadsense, as in the phrase “Philosophical Transactionsof the Royal Society for the Advancement of Knowl-edge.”)It is customary to describe these three Schools asYellow, Black, and White. The first thing necessaryis to warn the reader that they must by no means beconfounded with racial distinctions of colour; andthey correspond still less with conventional sym-bols such as yellow caps, yellow robes, black mag-ick, white witchcraft, and the like. The danger isonly the greater that these analogies are often asalluring as they prove on examination to be mis-leading.These Schools represent three perfectly distinctand contrary theories of the Universe, and, there-fore, practices of spiritual science. The magicalformula of each is as precise as a theorem oftrigonometry. Each assumes as fundamental a cer-tain law of Nature, and the subject is complicatedby the fact that each School, in a certain sense,admits the formulae of the other two. It merelyregards them as in some way incomplete, second-ary, or illusory. Now, as will be seen later, theYellow School stands aloof from the other two bythe nature of its postulates. But the Black Schooland the White are always more or less in activeconflict; and it is because just at this moment thatconflict is approaching a climax that it is necessaryto write this essay. The adepts of the White Schoolconsider the present danger to mankind so great thatthey are prepared to abandon their traditional policyof silence, in order to enlist in their ranks the profaneof every nation.We are in possession of a certain mystical docu-ment1 which we may describe briefly, for conve-nience sake, as an Apocalypse of which we hold thekeys, thanks to the intervention of the Master whohas appeared at this grave conjuncture of Fate. Thisdocument consists of a series of visions, in which wehear the voice of various Intelligences whose natureit would be hard to define, but who are at the veryleast endowed with knowledge and power far be-yond anything that we are accustomed to regard asproper to the human race.We must quote a passage from one of the mostimportant of these documents. The doctrine is con-veyed, as is customary among Initiates, in the formof a parable. Those who have attained even amediocre degree of enlightenment are aware thatthe crude belief of the faithful, and the crude infidel-ity of the scoffer, with regard to matters of fact, aremerely childish. Every incident in Nature, true orfalse, possesses a spiritual significance. It is thissignificance, and only this significance, that pos-sesses any philosophical value to the Initiate.The orthodox need not be shocked, and theenlightened need not be contemptuous, to learn thatthe passage which we are about to quote, is aparable based on the least decorous of the Biblicallegends which refer to Noah. It simply captures forits own purposes the convenience of Scripture.(Here follows the excerpt from the Vision.)“And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shalluncover the nakedness of the Most High, for he isdrunken upon the wine that is the blood of theadepts. And BABALON hath lulled him to sleepupon her breast, and she hath fled away, and left himnaked, and she hath called her children togethersaying: Come up with me, and let us make a mockof the nakedness of the Most High.“And the first of the adepts covered His shamewith a cloth, walking backwards, and was white.And the second of the adepts covered his shamewith a cloth, walking sideways, and was yellow,And the third of the adepts made a mock of Hisnakedness, walking forwards, and was black. Andthese are the three great schools of the Magi, whoare also the three Magi that journeyed untoBethlehem; and because thou hast not wisdom,thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or ifthe three schools be not one.”We are now ready to study the philosophicalbases of these three Schools. We must, however,enter a caveat against too literal an interpretation,even of the parable. It may be suspected, for reasonswhich should be apparent after further investiga-tion of the doctrines of the Three Schools, that thisparable was invented by an Intelligence of theBlack School, who was aware of his iniquity, andthought to transform it into righteousness by thealchemy of making a boast of it. The intelligentreader will note the insidious attempt to identify thedoctrine of the Black School with the kind of blackmagic that is commonly called Diabolism. In otherwords, this parable is itself an example of an ex-ceedingly subtle black magical operation, and thecontemplation of such devices carried far enoughbrings us to an understanding of the astoundinglyophidian processes of Magicians. Let not the pro-fane reader dismiss such subtleties from his mind asnegligible nonsense. It is cunning of this kind thatdetermines the price of potatoes.The above digression is perhaps not so inexcus-able as it may seem on a first reading. Careful studyof it should reveal the nature of the thought-pro-cesses which are habitually used by the secretMasters of the human race to determine its destiny.When everyone has done laughing, I will askyou to compare the real effects produced on thecourse of human affairs by Caesar, Attila, andNapoleon, on the one hand; of Plato, theEncyclopaedists, and Karl Marx2 on the other.The Yellow School of Magick considers, withcomplete scientific and philosophical detachment,the fact of the Universe as a fact. Being itself apartof that Universe, it realizes its impotence to alter thetotality in the smallest degree. To put it vulgarly, itdoes not try to raise itself from the ground by pullingat its socks. It therefore opposes to the current ofphenomena no reaction either of hatred or of sym-pathy. So far as it attempts to influence the courseof events at all, it does so in the only intelligent wayconceivable. It seeks to diminish internal friction.It remains, therefore, in a contemplativeattitude. To use the terms of Western philoso-phy, there is in its attitude something of thestoicism of Zeno; or of the Pickwickianism, ifI may use the term, of Epicurus. The idealreaction to phenomena is that of perfect elas-ticity. It possesses something of the cold-bloodedness of mathematics; and for this rea-son it seems fair to say, for the purposes ofelementary study, that Pythagoras is its mostadequate exponent in European philosophy.Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, how-ever, we have no need to take our ideas atsecond-hand. The Yellow School of Magickpossesses one perfect classic. The Tao Teh1 Liber CDXVIII, The Vision and the Voice,edition with Introduction and Commentary by 666.Thelema Publishing Co., Barstow, California.2 It is interesting to note that the three greatestinfluences in the world today are those of TeutonicHebrews: Marx, Hertz, and Freud."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears16King.1It is impossible to find any religion which ad-equately represents the thought of this masterpiece.Not only is religion as such repugnant to scienceand philosophy, but from the very nature of thetenets of the Yellow School, its adherents are notgoing to put themselves to any inconvenience forthe enlightenment of a lot of people whom theyconsider to be hopeless fools.At the same time, the theory of religion, as such,being a tissue of falsehood, the only real strength ofany religion is derived from its pilferings of Magi-cal doctrine; and, religious persons being by defini-tion entirely unscrupulous, it follows that any givenreligion is likely to contain scraps of Magical doc-trine, filched more or less haphazard from oneschool or the other as occasion serves.Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriouslyof trying to get a grasp of this subject by means ofsiren analogies. Taoism has as little to do with theTao Teh King as the Catholic Church with theGospel.The Tao Teh King inculcates conscious inac-tion, or rather unconscious inaction, with the objectof minimizing the disorder of the world. A fewquotations from the text should make the essence ofthe doctrine clear.X. 3: “Here is the Mystery of Virtue. It createthall and nourisheth all; yet it doth not adhere to them.It operateth all; but knoweth not of it, nor proclaimethit; it directeth all, but without conscious control.”XXII. 2: “Therefore the sage concentrateth uponone Will, and it is as a light to the whole world.Hiding himself, he shineth; withdrawing himself,he attracteth notice; humbling himself, he gainethforce to achieve his Will. Because he striveth not, noman may contend against him.”XLIII. 1-2: “The softest substance hunteth downthe hardest. The Unsubstantial penetrateth wherethere is no opening. Here is the Virtue of Inertia.“Few are they who attain: whose speech is Si-lence, whose Work is Inertia.”XLVIII. 3: “He who attracteth to himself all thatis under Heaven doth so without effort. He whomaketh effort is not able to attract it.”LVIII. 3: “The wise man is foursquare andavoideth aggression; his corners do not injure oth-ers. He moveth in a straight line, and turneth notaside therefrom; he is brilliant, but doth not blindwith his brightness.”LXIII. 2: “Do great things while they are yetsmall, hard things while they are yet easy; for allthings, how great or hard soever, have a beginningwhen they are little and easy. So thus the wise manaccomplisheth the greatest tasks without undertak-ing anything important.”LXXVI. 2-4: “So then rigidity and hardness arethe stigmata of death; elasticity and adaptability oflife.“He then who putteth forth strength is not victo-rious; even as a strong tree filleth the embrace.“Thus the hard and rigid have the inferior place,the soft and elastic the superior.”Enough, I think, for this part of the essay.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER VIITHE THREE SCHOOLS OF MAGICK (2)Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Hoping that you are now recovered from thedevastating revelations in the matter of the YellowSchool, I must ask you to brace yourself for disclo-sures even more formidable about the Black. Donot confuse with the Black Lodge, or the BlackBrothers. The terminology is unfortunate, but itwasn’t I that did it. Now then, to work!The Black School of Magick, which must by nomeans be confused with the School of Black Mag-ick or Sorcery, which latter is a perversion of theWhite tradition, is distinguished fundamentally fromthe Yellow School in that it considers the Universenot as neutral, but as definitely a curse. Its primarytheorem is the “First Noble Truth” of the Buddha— “Everything is Sorrow.” In the primitive classicsof this School the idea of sorrow is confused withthat of sin. (This idea of universal lamentation ispresumably responsible for the choice of black as itssymbolic colour. And yet? Is not white the Chinesehue of mourning?)The analysis of the philosophers of this Schoolrefers every phenomenon to the category of sorrow.It is quite useless to point out to them that certainevents are accompanied with joy: they continuetheir ruthless calculations, and prove to your satis-faction, or rather dissatisfaction, that the more ap-parently pleasant an event is, the more malignantlydeceptive is its fascination. There is only one way ofescape even conceivable, and this way is quitesimple, annihilation. (Shallow critics of Buddhismhave wasted a great deal of stupid ingenuity ontrying to make out that Nirvana or Nibbana meanssomething different from what etymology, tradi-tion and the evidence of the Classics combine todefine it. The word means, quite simply, cessation:and it stands to reason that, if everything is sorrow,the only thing which is not sorrow is nothing, andthat therefore to escape from sorrow is the attain-ment of nothingness.)Western philosophy has on occasion approachedthis doctrine. It has at least asserted that no knownform of existence is exempt from sorrow. Huxleysays, in his Evolution and Ethics, “Suffering is thebadge of all the tribe of sentient things.”The philosophers of this School, seeking, natu-rally enough, to amend the evil at the root, inquireinto the cause of this existence which is sorrow, andarrive immediately at the ‘Second Noble Truth’ ofthe Buddha: “The Cause of Sorrow is Desire”.They follow up with the endless concatenation ofcauses, of which the final root is Ignorance. (I amnot concerned to defend the logic of this School: Imerely state their doctrine.) The practical issue ofall this is that every kind of action is both unavoid-able and a crime. I must digress to explain that theconfusion of thought in this doctrine is constantlyrecurrent. That is part of the blackness of the Igno-rance which they confess to be the foundation oftheir Universe. (And after all, everyone has surelythe right to have his own Universe the way he wantsit.)This School being debased by nature, is not sofar removed from conventional religion as eitherthe White or the Yellow. Most primitive fetishisticreligions may, in fact, be considered fairly faithfulrepresentatives of this philosophy. Where animismholds sway, the “medicine-man” personifies thisuniversal evil, and seeks to propitiate it by humansacrifice. The early forms of Judaism, and that typeof Christianity which we associate with the Salva-tion Army, Billy Sunday and the Fundamentalistsof the back-blocks of America, are sufficientlysimple cases of religion whose essence is the propi-tiation of a malignant demon.When the light of intelligence begins to dawndimly through many fogs upon these savages, wereach a second stage. Bold spirits muster courage toassert that the evil which is so obvious, is, in somemysterious way, an illusion. They thus throw backthe whole complexity of sorrow to a single cause;that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid. Theproblem then assumes a final form: How is thatillusion to be destroyed.A fairly pure example of the first stage of thistype of thought is to be found in the Vedas, of thesecond stage, in the Upanishads. But the answer tothe question, “How is the illusion of evil to bedestroyed?”, depends on another point of theory.We may postulate a Parabrahm infinitely good, etc.etc. etc., in which case we consider the destructionof the illusion of evil as the reuniting of the con-sciousness with Parabrahm. the unfortunate part ofthis scheme of things is that on seeking to defineParabrahm for the purpose of returning to Its purity,it is discovered sooner or later, that It possesses noqualities at all! In other words, as the farmer said, onbeing shown the elephant: There ain’t no sichanimile. It was Gautama Buddha who perceivedthe inutility of dragging in this imaginary pachy-derm. Since our Parabrahm, he said to the Hinduphilosophers, is actually nothing, why not stick toour original perception that everything is sorrow,and admit that the only way to escape from sorrowis to arrive at nothingness?We may complete the whole tradition of theIndian peninsula very simply. To the Vedas, theUpanishads, and the Tripitaka of the Buddhists,we have only to add the Tantras of what are calledthe Vamacharya Schools. Paradoxical as it may1 Unfortunately there is no translation at presentpublished which is the work of an Initiate. Allexisting translations have been garbled by peoplewho simply failed to understand the text. An ap-proximately perfect rendering is indeed available,but so far it exists only in manuscript. One object ofthis letter is to create sufficient public interest tomake this work, and others of equal value availableto the public."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears17sound the Tantrics are in reality the most advancedof the Hindus. Their theory is, in its philosophicalultimatum, a primitive stage of the White tradition,for the essence of the Tantric cults is that by theperformance of certain rites of Magick, one doesnot only escape disaster, but obtains positive bene-diction. The Tantric is not obsessed by the will-to-die. It is a difficult business, no doubt, to get any funout of existence; but at least it is not impossible. Inother words, he implicitly denies the fundamentalproposition that existence is sorrow, and he formu-lates the essential postulate of the White School ofMagick, that means exist by which the universalsorrow (apparent indeed to all ordinary observa-tion) may be unmasked, even as at the initiatory riteof Isis in the ancient days of Kehm. There, a Neo-phyte presenting his mouth, under compulsion, tothe pouting buttocks of the Goat of Mendez, foundhimself caressed by the chaste lips of a virginalpriestess of that Goddess at the base of whose shrineis written that No man has lifted her veil.The basis of the Black philosophy is not impos-sibly mere climate, with its resulting etiolation ofthe native, its languid, bilious, anaemic, fever-prostrated, emasculation of the soul of man. Weaccordingly find few true equivalents of this Schoolin Europe. In Greek philosophy there is no trace ofany such doctrine. The poison in its foulest andmost virulent form only entered with Christianity.1But even so, few men of any real eminence werefound to take the axioms of pessimism seriously.Huxley, for all of his harping on the minor key, wasan eupeptic Tory. The culmination of the Blackphilosophy is only found in Schopenhauer, and wemay regard him as having been obsessed, on the onehand, by the despair born of that false scepticismwhich he learnt from the bankruptcy of Hume andKant; on the other, by the direct obsession of theBuddhist documents to which he was one of theearliest Europeans to obtain access. He was, so tospeak, driven to suicide by his own vanity, a curiousparallel to Kiriloff in The Possessed of Dostoiewsky.We have, however, examples plentiful enoughof religions deriving almost exclusively from theBlack tradition in the different stages. We havealready mentioned the Evangelical cults with theirferocious devil-god who creates mankind for thepleasure of damning it and forcing it to crawl beforehim, while he yells with druken glee over the agonyof his only son.2 But in the same class, we mustplace Christian Science, so grotesquely afraid ofpain, suffering and evil of every sort, that its dupescan think of nothing better than to bleat denials of itsactuality, in the hope of hypnotizing themselvesinto anaesthesia.Practically no Westerns have reached the thirdstage of the Black tradition, the Buddhist stage. It isonly isolated mystics, and those men who rankthemselves with a contemptuous compliance underthe standard of the nearest religion, the one whichwill bother them least in their quest of nothingness,who carry the sorites so far.The documents of the Black School of Magickhave already been indicated. They are, for the mostpart, tedious to the last degree and repulsive toevery wholesome-minded man; yet it can hardly bedenied that such books as The Dhammapada andEcclesiastes are masterpieces of literature. Theyrepresent the agony of human despair at its utmostdegree of intensity, and the melancholy contempla-tion which is induced by their perusal is notfavourable to the inception of that mood whichshould lead every truly courageous intelligence tothe determination to escape from the ferule of theBlack Schoolmaster to the outstretched arms of theWhite Mistress of Life.Let us leave the sinister figure of Schopenhauerfor the mysteriously radiant shape of Spinoza! Thislatter philosopher, in respect at least of his Panthe-ism, represents fairly enough the fundamental the-sis of the White tradition. Almost the first observa-tion that we have to make is that this White traditionis hardly discoverable outside Europe. It appearsfirst of all in the legend of Dionysus. (In thisconnection read carefully Browning’s Apollo andthe Fates.)The Egyptian tradition of Osiris is not dissimi-lar. The central idea of the White School is that,admitted that “everything is sorrow” for the pro-fane, the Initiate has the means of transforming it to“Everything is joy”. There is no question of anyostrich-ignoring of fact, as in Christian Science.There is not even any more or less sophisticatedargument about the point of view altering the situ-ation as in Vedantism. We have, on the contrary, anattitude which was perhaps first of all, historicallyspeaking, defined by Zoroaster, “nature teaches us,and the Oracles also affirm, that even the evil germsof Matter may alike become useful and good.”“Stay not on the precipice with the dross of Matter;for there is a place for thine Image in a realm eversplendid.” “If thou extend the Fiery Mind to thework of piety, thou wilt preserve the fluxible body.”3It appears that the Levant, from Byzantium andAthens to Damascus, Jerusalem, Alexandria andCairo, was preoccupied with the formulation of thisSchool in a popular religion, beginning in the daysof Augustus Caesar. For there are elements of thiscentral idea in the works of the Gnostics, in certainrituals of what Frazer conveniently calls the AsiaticGod, as in the remnants of the Ancient Egyptiancult. The doctrine became abominably corrupted incommittee, so to speak and the result was Christian-ity, which may be regarded as a White ritual over-laid by a mountainous mass of Black doctrine, likethe baby of the mother that King Solomon non-suited.We may define the doctrine of the White Schoolin its purity in very simple terms.Existence is pure joy. Sorrow is caused by fail-ure to perceive this fact; but this is not a misfortune.We have invented sorrow, which does not matter somuch after all, in order to have the exuberantsatisfaction of getting rid of it. Existence is thus asacrament.Adepts of the White School regard their brethrenof the Black very much as the aristocratic EnglishSahib (of the days when England was a nation)regarded the benighted Hindu. Nietzsche expressesthe philosophy of this School to that extent withconsiderable accuracy and vigour. The man whodenounces life merely defines himself as the manwho is unequal to it. The brave man rejoices ingiving and taking hard knocks, and the brave manis joyous. The Scandinavian idea of Valhalla maybe primitive, but it is manly. A heaven of popularconcert, like the Christian; of unconscious repose,like the Buddhist; or even of sensual enjoyment,like the Moslem, excites his nausea and contempt.He understands that the only joy worth while is thejoy of continual victory, and victory itself wouldbecome as tame as croquet if it were not spiced byequally continual defeat.The purest documents of the White School arefound in the Sacred Books of Thelema. The doc-trine is given in excellent perfection both in the bookof the Heart Girt with the Serpent and the book ofLapis Lazuli. A single passage is adequate to ex-plain the formula.“7. Moreover I beheld a vision of a river. Therewas a little boat thereon; and in it under purple sailswas a golden woman, an image of Asi wrought infinest gold. Also the river was of blood, and the boatof shining steel. Then I loved her; and, loosing mygirdle, cast myself into the stream.“8. I gathered myself into the little boat, and formany days and nights did I love her, burning beau-tiful incense before her.“9. Yea! I gave her of the flower of my youth.“10. But she stirred not; only by my kisses Idefiled her so that she turned to blackness beforeme.“11. Yet I worshipped her, and gave her of theflower of my youth.“12. Also it came to pass, that thereby shesickened, and corrupted before me. Almost I castmyself into the stream.“13. Then at the end appointed her body waswhiter than the milk of the stars, and her lips red andwarm as the sunset, and her life of a white heat likethe heat of the midmost sun.“14. Then rose she up from abyss of Ages ofSleep, and her body embraced me. Altogether Imelted in her beauty and was glad.“15. The river also became the river of Amrit,and the little boat was the chariot of the flesh, andthe sails thereof the blood of the heart that beareth1 Anti-semite writers in Europe — e.g. Weininger— call the Black theory and practice Judaism,while by a curious confusion, the same ideas arecalled Christian among Anglo-Saxons. In 1936 e.v.the “Nazi” School began to observe this fact.2 N.B. Christianity was in its first stage a JewishCommunism, hardly distinguishable from Marx-ism.3 This passage appears to be a direct hint at theFormula of the IX° O.T.O., and the preparation ofthe Elixir of Life."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears18me, that beareth me.”Liber LXV, Cap. II.We find even in profane literature this doctrineof the White School of Magick: —O Buddha! couldst thou nowhere restA pivot for the universe?Must all things be alike confessedMere changes rung upon a curse?I swear by all the bliss of blueMy Phryne with her powder onIs just as false — and just as true —As your disgusting skeleton.Each to his taste: if you preferThis loathly brooding on Decay;I call it Growth, and lovelierThan all the glamours of the day.You would not dally with DoreenBecause her fairness was to fade,Because you know the things uncleanThat go to make a mortal maid.I, if her rotten corpse were mine,Would take it as my natural food,Denying all but the DivineAlike in evil and in good.Aspasia may skin me close,And Lais load me with disease.Poor pleasures, bitter bargains, these?I shall despise Diogenes.Follow your fancy far enough!At last you surely come to God.There is thus in this School no attempt to denythat Nature is, as Zoroaster said, “a fatal and evilforce”; but Nature is, so to speak, “the First Matterof the Work”, which is to be transmuted into gold.The joy is a function of our own part in this al-chemy. For this reason we find the boldest and mostskillful adepts deliberately seeking out the mostrepugnant elements of Nature that their triumphmay be the greater. The formula is evidently one ofdauntless courage. It expresses the idea of vitalityand manhood in its most dynamic sense.The only religion which corresponds to thisSchool at all is that of ancient Egypt; possibly alsothat of Chaldea. This is because those religions areMagical religions in the strict technical sense; thereligious component of them is negligible. So far asit exists, it exists only for the uninitiate.There are, however, traces of the beginning ofthe influence of the School in Judaism and inPaganism. There are, too, certain documents of thepure Greek spirit which bear traces of this. It is whatthey called Theurgy.The Christian religion in its simplest essence, bythat idea of overcoming evil through a Magicalceremony, the Crucifixion, seems at first sight a fairexample of the White tradition; but the idea of sinand of propitiation tainted it abominably with Black-ness. There have been, however, certain Christianthinkers who have taken the bold logical step ofregarding evil as a device of God for exercising thejoys of combat and victory. This is, of course, aperfectly White doctrine; but it is regarded as themost dangerous of heresies. (Romans VI. 1, 2, etal.)For all that, the idea is there. The Mass itself isessentially a typical White ritual. Its purpose is totransform crude matter directly into Godhead. It isthus a cardinal operation of Talismanic Magick.But the influence of the Black School has corrodedthe idea with theological accretions, metaphysicalon the one hand, and superstitious on the other, socompletely as to mask the Truth altogether.At the Reformation, we find a nugatory attemptto remove the Black element. The Protestant think-ers did their best to get rid of the idea of sin, but itwas soon seen that the effort could only lead toantinomianism; and they recognized that this wouldinfallibly destroy the religious idea as such.Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made afurther attempt to free Christianity from the darkcloud of iniquity. They joined hands with the Sufisand the Vedantists. But this again led to the meredenial of the reality of evil. Thus drawing away,little by little, from clear appreciation of the facts ofNature, their doctrine became purely theoretical,and faded away, while the thundercloud of sinsettled down more heavily than ever.The most important of all the efforts of the WhiteSchool, from an exoteric point of view, is Islam. Inits doctrine there is some slight taint, but much lessthan in Christianity. It is a virile religion. It looksfacts in the face, and admits their horror; but itproposes to overcome them by sheer dint of man-hood. Unfortunately, the metaphysical conceptionsof its quasi-profane Schools are grossly materialis-tic. It is only the Pantheism of the Sufis whicheliminates the conception of propitiation; and, inpractice, the Sufis are too closely allied to theVedantists to retain hold of reality.That will be all for the present.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER VIIITHE THREE SCHOOLS OF MAGICK (3)Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It has been a long — I hope not too tedious —voyage; but at last the harbour is in sight.Our Essay approaches its goal; the theory of Lifeto which initiation tends.Let us continue!There is in history only one movement whoseobject has been to organize the isolated adepts of theWhite School of Magick, and this movement wastotally unconnected with religion, except in so far asit lent its influence to the reformers of the Christianchurch. Its appeal was not at all to the people. Itmerely offered to open up relations with, and com-municate certain practical secrets of wisdom to,isolated men of science through Europe. This move-ment is generally known by the name ofRosicrucianism.The word arouses all sorts of regrettable corre-spondences; but the adepts of the Society havenever worried themselves in the least about theabuse of their name for the purposes of charlatan-ism, or about the attacks directed against them byenvious critics. Indeed, so wisely have they con-cealed their activities that some modern scholars ofthe shallower type have declared that no such move-ment ever existed, that it was a kind of practical jokeplayed upon the curiosity of the credulous MiddleAges. It is at least certain that, since the originalproclamations, no official publications have beenput forward. The essential secrets have been main-tained inviolate. If, during the last few years, aconsiderable number of documents have been pub-lished by them, though not in their name, it is onaccount of the impending crisis to civilization, ofwhich mention will later be made.There is no good purpose, even were there li-cense, to discuss the nature of the basis of scientificattainment which is the core of the doctrines of theSociety. It is only necessary to point out that itscorrespondence with alchemy is the one genuinefact on the subject which has been allowed totranspire; for the Rosicrucian, as indicated by hiscentral symbol, the barren cross on which he hasmade a rose to flower, occupies himself primarilywith spiritual and physiological alchemy. Takingfor “The First Matter of the Work” a neutral or inertsubstance (it is constantly described as the com-monest and least valued thing on earth, and mayactually connote any substance whatever) he delib-erately poisons it, so to speak, bringing it to a stageof transmutation generally called the Black Dragon,and he proceeds to work upon this virulent poisonuntil he obtains the perfection theoretically pos-sible.Incidentally, we have an almost precise parallelwith this operation in modern bacteriology. Theapparently harmless bacilli of a disease are culti-vated until they become a thousand times morevirulent than at first, and it is from this culture thatis prepared the vaccine which is an efficaciousremedy for all the possible ravages of that kind ofmicro-organism........We have been obliged to expose, perhaps at tooconsiderable a length, the main doctrines of thethree Schools. The task, however tedious, has beennecessary in order to explain with reasonable lucid-ity their connection with the world which their ideasdirect; that is to say, the nature of their politicalactivities.The Yellow School, in accordance with its doc-trine of perfectly elastic reaction and non-interfer-ence, holds itself, generally speaking, entirely apartfrom all such questions. We can hardly imagine itsufficiently interested in any events soever to reactaggressively. It feels strong enough to deal satisfac-torily with anything that may turn up: and generallyspeaking, it feels that any conceivable action on itspart would be likely to increase rather than todiminish the mischief.It remains somewhat contemptuously aloof fromthe eternal conflict of the Black School with theWhite. At the same time, there is a certain feelingamong the Yellow adepts that should either of these"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears19Schools become annihilated, the result might wellbe that the victor would sooner or later turn hisreleased energy against themselves.In accordance, therefore, with their general planof non-action, as expressed in the Tao Teh King, ofdealing with mischief before it has become toostrong to be dangerous, they interfere gently fromtime to time to redress the balance.During the last two generations the Masters ofthe Yellow School have been compelled to takenotice of the progressive ruin of the White adepts.Christianity, which possessed at least the semblanceof a White formula, is in the agonies of decomposi-tion, even before it is actually dead. Materialisticscience has overwhelmed the faith and hope of theChristians (they never possessed any charity tooverwhelm) with a demonstration of the sorrow,transitoriness and cruel futility of the Universe. Avast wave of pessimism has engulfed the fortress ofMansoul.It was indeed a deadly blow to the adepts of theWhite School when Science, their own familiarfriend in whom they trusted, lifted up his heelagainst them. It was in this conjuncture that theYellow adepts sent forth into the Western world amessenger, Helena Petrowna Blavatsky, with thedistinct mission to destroy, on the one hand, thecrude schools of Christianity, and, on the other, toeradicate the materialism from Physical Science.She made the necessary connection with EdwardMaitland and Anna Kingsford, who were tryingrather helplessly to put the exoteric formulae of theWhite School into the hands of students, and withthe secret representatives of the Rosicrucian Broth-erhood. It is not for us in this place to estimate thedegree of success with which she carried out herembassy; but at least we see today that PhysicalScience is at last penetrating to the spiritual basis ofmaterial phenomena. The work of Henry Poincarè,Einstein, Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell is suffi-cient evidence of this fact.Christianity, too, has fallen into a lower degreeof contempt than ever. Realizing that it was mori-bund, it made a supreme and suicidal effort, andplunged into the death-spasm of the first world-war.It was too far corrupt to react to the injections of theWhite formula which might have saved it. We seetoday that Christianity is more bigoted, furtherdivorced from reality, than ever. In some countriesit has again become a persecuting church.With horrid glee the adepts of the Black Schoollooked on at these atrocious paroxysms. But it didmore. It marshalled its forces quietly, and preparedto clean up the debris of the battlefields. It is atpresent (1924 e.v.) pledged to a supreme attempt tochase the manly races from their spiritual halidom.(The spasm still [1945 e.v.] continues; note well thepro-German screams of Anglican Bishops, and theintrigues of the Vatican.)The Black School has always worked insidi-ously, by treachery. We need then not be surprisedby finding that its most notable representative wasthe renegade follower of Blavatsky, Annie Besant,and that she was charged by her Black masters withthe mission of persuading the world to accept for itsTeacher a negroid Messiah. To make the humilia-tion more complete, a wretched creature was cho-sen who, to the most loathsome moral qualities,added the most fatuous imbecility. And then blewup!.......This, then, is the present state of the war of theThree Schools. We cannot suppose that humanity isso entirely base as to accept Krishnamurti; yet thatsuch a scheme could ever have been conceived is asymptom of the almost hopeless decadence of theWhite School.1 The Black adepts boast openly thatthey have triumphed all along the line. Their for-mula has attained the destruction of all positivequalities. It is only one step to the stage when theannihilation of all life and thought will appear as afatal necessity. The materialism and vital scepti-cism of the present time, its frenzied rush for plea-sure in total disregard of any idea of building for thefuture, testifies to a condition of complete moraldisorder, of abject spiritual anarchy.The White School has thus been paralysed. Weare reminded of the spider described by Fabre, whoinjects her victims with a poison which paralyzesthem without killing them, so that her own youngmay find fresh meat. And this is what is going tohappen in Europe and America unless something isdone about it, and done in very short order.The Yellow School could not remain impassivespectators of the abominations. Madame Blavatskywas a mere forerunner. They, in conjunction withthe Secret Chiefs of the White School in Europe,Chiefs who had been compelled to suspend allattempts at exoteric enlightenment by the generalmoral debility which had overtaken the races fromwhich they drew their adepts, have prepared a guidefor mankind. This man, of an extreme moral forceand elevation, combined with a profound sense ofworldly realities, has stood forth in an attempt tosave the White School, to rehabilitate its formula,and to fling back from the bastions of moral free-dom the howling savages of pessimism. Unless hisappeal is heard, unless there comes a truly virilereaction against the creeping atrophy which is poi-soning them, unless they enlist to the last man underhis standard, a great decisive battle will have beenlost.This prophet of the White School, chosen by itsMasters and his brethren, to save the Theory andPractice, is armed with a sword far mightier thanExcalibur. He has been entrusted with a new Magi-cal formula, one which can be accepted by thewhole human race. Its adoption will strengthen theYellow School by giving a more positive value totheir Theory; while leaving the postulates of theBlack School intact, it will transcend them and raisetheir Theory and Practice almost to the level of theYellow. As to the White School, it will remove fromthem all taint of poison of the Black, and restorevigour to their central formula of spiritual alchemyby giving each man an independent ideal. It will putan end to the moral castration involved in theassumption that each man, whatever his nature,should deny himself to follow out a fantastic andimpracticable ideal of goodness. Incidentally, thisformula will save Physical Science itself by makingnegligible the despair of futility, the vital scepticismwhich has emasculated it in the past. It shows thatthe joy of existence is not in a goal, for that indeedis clearly unattainable, but in the going itself.This law is called the Law of Thelema. It issummarized in the four words, “Do what thouwilt.”It should not be necessary to explain that a fullappreciation of this message is not to be obtained bya hasty examination. It is essential to study it fromevery point of view, to analyse it with the keenestphilosophical acumen, and finally to apply it as akey for every problem, internal and external, thatexists. This key, applied with skill, will open everylock.From the deepest point of view, the greatestvalue of this formula is that it affords, for the firsttime in history, a basis of reconciliation between thethree great Schools of Magick. It will tend to ap-pease the eternal conflict by understanding thateach type of thought shall go on its own way,develop its own proper qualities without seeking tointerfere with other formulae, however (superfi-cially) opposed to its own.What is true for every School is equally true forevery individual. Success in life, on the basis of theLaw of Thelema, implies severe self-discipline.Each being must progress, as biology teaches, bystrict adaptation to the conditions of the organism.If, as the Black School continually asserts, thecause of sorrow is desire, we can still escape theconclusion by the Law of Thelema. What is neces-sary is not to seek after some fantastic ideal, utterlyunsuited to our real needs, but to discover the truenature of those needs, to fulfill them, and rejoicetherein.This process is what is really meant by initiation;that is to say, the going into oneself, and makingone’s peace, so to speak, with all the forces that onefinds there.It is forbidden here to discuss the nature of TheBook of the Law, the Sacred Scripture of Thelema.Even after forty years of close expert examination,it remains to a great extent mysterious; but the littlewe know of it is enough to show that it is a sublimesynthesis of all Science and all ethics. It is by virtueof this Book that man may attain a degree offreedom hitherto never suspected to be possible, aspiritual development altogether beyond anythinghitherto known; and, what is really more to thepoint, a control of external nature which will makethe boasted achievements of the last century appearno more than childish preliminaries to an incompa-rably mighty manhood.1 Note. This passage was written in 1924 e.v.The Master Therion arose and smote him. Whatseemed a menace is now hardly even a memory."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears20It has been said by some that the Law of Thelemaappeals only to the élite of humanity. No doubt hereis this much in that assertion, that only the highestcan take full advantage of the extraordinary oppor-tunities which it offers. At the same time, “the Lawis for all.” Each in his degree, every man may learnto realise the nature of his own being, and to developit in freedom. It is by this means that the WhiteSchool of Magick can justify its past, redeem itspresent, and assure its future, by guaranteeing toevery human being a life of Liberty and of Love.Such, then, are the words of Gérard Aumont. Ishould not like to endorse every phrase; but thewhole exposition is so masterly in its terse, tensevigour, and so unrivalled by any other document atmy disposal, that I thought it best to let you have itin its own original form, with only those few alter-ations which lapse of time has made necessary.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. Our own School unites the ruby red ofBlood with the gold of the Sun. It combines the bestcharacteristics of the Yellow and the White Schools.In the light of M. Aumont’s exposition, it is easy tounderstand.To us, every phenomenon is an Act of Love,Every experience is necessary, is a Sacrament, is ameans of Growth. Hence, “...existence is pure joy;...”(AL II, 9) “A feast every day in your hearts in the joyof my rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and thepleasure of uttermost delight!” (AL II, 42-43).Let this soak in!CHAPTER IXTHE SECRET CHIEFSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Very glad I am, since at one time I was obligedto be starkly stern about impertinent curiosity, tonote that your wish to be informed about the SecretChiefs of the A∴A∴ is justified; it is most certainlyof the first importance that you and I should be quiteclear in our minds about Those under whose juris-diction and tutelage we both work.The question is beset with thickets of toughthorn; what is worse, the path is so slippery thatnothing is easier than to tumble head first into thespikiest bush of them all.You justly remind me that one of my earliestslogans was “Mystery is the enemy of Truth;” howthen is it that I acquiesce in the policy of conceal-ment in a matter so cardinal?Perhaps the best plan is for me to set down thefacts of the case, so far as is possible; from them itmay appear that no alternative policy is feasible.The first condition of membership of the A∴A∴is that one is sworn to identify one’s own GreatWork with that of raising mankind to higher levels,spiritually, and in every other way.Accordingly, it stands to reason that those chargedwith the conduct of the Order should be at leastMasters of the Temple, or their judgment would beworthless, and at least Magi (though not that par-ticular kind of Magus who brings the Word of aNew Formula to the world every 2,000 years or so)or they would be unable to influence events on anyscale commensurate with the scope of the Work.Of what nature is this Power, this Authority, thisUnderstanding, this Wisdom — Will?(I go up from Geburah to Chokmah.)Of the passive side it is comparatively easy toform some idea; for the qualities essential are mainlyextensions of those that all of us possess in somedegree. And whether Understanding — Wisdom is“right” or “wrong” must be largely a matter ofopinion; often Time only can decide such points.But for the active side it is necessary to postulatethe existence of a form of Energy at their disposalwhich is able “to cause change to occur in confor-mity with the Will” — one definition of “Magick”.Now this, as you know, is an exceedingly com-plex subject; its theory is tortuous, and its practiceencompassed with every kind of difficulty.Is there no simple method?Yes: the thaumaturgic engine disposes of a typeof energy more adaptable than Electricity itself, andboth stronger and subtler than this, its analogy in theworld of profane science. One might say, that it iselectrical, or at least one of the elements in the“Ring-formula” of modern Mathematical Physics.In the R.R. et A.C., this is indicated to the AdeptMinor by the title conferred upon him on his initia-tion to that grade: Hodos Camelionis: — the Path ofthe Chameleon. (This emphasizes the omnivalenceof the force.) In the higher degrees of O.T.O. — theA∴A∴ is not fond of terms like this, which vergeon the picturesque — it is usually called “theOphidian Vibrations”, thus laying special stressupon its serpentine strength, subtlety, its control oflife and death, and its power to insinuate itself intoany desired set of circumstances.It is of this universally powerful weapon that theSecret Chiefs must be supposed to possess completecontrol.They can induce a girl to embroider a tapestry, orinitiate a political movement to culminate in aworld-war; all in pursuit of some plan wholly be-yond the purview or the comprehension of thedeepest and subtlest thinkers.(It should go without saying that the adroit use ofthese vibrations enables one to perform all theclassical “miracles.”)These powers are stupendous: they seem almostbeyond imagination to conceive.“Hic ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono;Imperium sine fine dedi.”as Vergil, that mighty seer and magician ofRome at her perihelion says in his First Book of theAenead. (Vergil whose every line is also an Oracle,the leaves of his book more sacred, more signifi-cant, more sure than those of the Cumaean Sibyl!)These powers move in dimensions of time andspace quite other than those with which we arefamiliar. Their values are incomprehensible to us.To a Secret Chief, wielding this weapon, “The niceconduct of a clouded cane” might be infinitely moreimportant than a war, famine and pestilence such asmight exterminate a third part of the race, to pro-mote whose welfare is the crux of His oath, and thesole reason of His existence!But who are They?Since They are “invisible” and “inaccessible,”may They not merely be figments invented by aself-styled “Master,” not quite sure of himself, toprop his tottering Authority?Well, the “invisible” and “inaccessible” criti-cism may equally be leveled at Captain A. andAdmiral B. of the Naval Intelligence Department.These “Secret Chiefs” keep in the dark for preciselythe same reasons; and these qualities disappearinstantaneously the moment They want to get holdof you.It is written, moreover, “Let my servants be few& secret: they shall rule the many & the known.”(AL I, 10)But are They then men, in the usual sense of theword? They may be incarnate or discarnate: it is amatter of Their convenience.Have They attained Their position by passingthrough all the grades of the A∴A∴?Yes and no: the system which was given to me toput forward is only one of many. “Above the Abyss”all these technical wrinkles are ironed out. One manwhom I suspect of being a Secret Chief has hardlyany acquaintance with the technique of our systemat all. That he accepts The Book of the Law isalmost his only link with my work. That, and his useof the Ophidian Vibrations: I don’t know which ofus is better at it, but I am sure that he must be a verylong way ahead of me if he is one of Them.You have already in these pages and elsewherein my writings examples numerous and varied ofthe way in which They work. The list is far fromcomplete. The matters of Ab-ul-Diz and ofAmalantrah show one method of communication;then there is the way of direct “inspiration,” as in thecase of “Hermes Eimi” in New Orleans.1Again, They may send an ordinary living man,whether one of Themselves or no I cannot feel sure,to instruct me in some task, or to set me right whenI have erred. Then there have been messages con-veyed by natural objects, animate or inanimate.2Needless to say, the outstanding example in my lifeis the whole Plan of Campaign concerning TheBook of the Law. But is Aiwaz a man (presumablya Persian or Assyrian) and a “Secret Chief,” or is Hean “angel” in the sense that Gabriel is an angel? IsAb-ul-Diz an Adept who can project himself intothe aura of some woman with whom I happen to beliving, although she has no previous experience ofthe kind, or any interest in such matters at all? Or is1 I will remember to give you details of theseincidents when the occasion arises.2 One thing I regard from my own experience ascertain: when you call, They come.

But I felt is improper to assume any otherinitiative. Just a point of good manners, perhaps?You ask whether, contact once made, I am ableto renew it should I so wish. Again, yes and no. Butthe real answer is that no such gesture on my partcan ever be necessary. For one thing, the “Chief” isso far above me that I can rely on Him to take thenecessary steps, whenever contact would be useful;for another, there is one path always open which isperfectly sufficient for all possible contingencies.Elsewhere I will explain why they picked out sowoebegone a ragamuffin as myself to proclaim theWord of the Aeon, and do all the chores appurtenantto that particular Work.The Burden is heavier as the years go by; but —Perdurabo.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. Reading this typescript over for “literals,” itstruck me that you would ask, very reasonably:“But if the Secret Masters have these boundlesspowers, why do They allow you to be plagued byprinters, held up for lack of secretaries, worried byall sorts of practical problems? ... Why, in a word,does anything ever go wrong?”There are several lines of reply; coalescing, theysuffice:1. What is “wrong?” Since four wars is Theiridea of “right,” you may well ask by what standardyou may judge events.2. Their Work is creative; They operate on thedull mass of unrealized possibilities. Thus theymeet, firstly, the opposition of Inertia; secondly, therecoil, the reaction, the rebound.3. Things theoretically feasible are practicallyimpossible when (a) desirable though their accom-plishment may be, it is not the one feat essential tothe particular Work in hand at the moment; (b) thesum total of available energy being used up by thatspecial task, there is none available for side-issues;(c) the opposition, passive or active, is too strong,temporarily, to overcome.More largely, one cannot judge how a plan isprogressing when one has no precise idea what it is.A soldier is told to “attack;” he may be intended towin through, to cover a general retreat, or to gaintime by deliberate sacrifice. Only the Commanderin Chief knows what the order means, or why heissues it; and even he does not know the issue, orwhether it will display and justify his military skilland judgment.Our business is solely to obey orders: our re-sponsibility ends when we have satisfied ourselvesthat they emanate from a source which has the rightto command.P.P.S. A visitor’s story has just reminded me ofthe possibility that I am a Secret Chief myselfwithout knowing it: for I have sometimes beenrecognized by other people as having acted as such,though I was not aware of the fact at the time.CHAPTER XTHE SCOLEX SCHOOLCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You actually want to know how to distinguishgold from copper pyrites — “fool’s gold” theycalled it in ’49 California — no! I wasn’t there —or “absolute” alcohol and Liqueur Whisky from“alki” (commercial alcohol — see Jack London’sThe Princess, a magnificent story — don’t miss it!)and Wartime Scotch as sold in most British pubs in1944, era vulgari.One pretty good plan is to take a masterpiece,pick out a page at random, translate it into Frenchor German or whatever language you like best,walk around your chair three times (so as to forgetthe English) and then translate it back again.You will gather a useful impression of the valueof the masterpiece by noticing the kind of difficultythat arises in the work of translation; more, byobserving the effect produced on you by readingover the result; and finally, by estimating the re-translation; has the effect of the original been en-hanced by the work done on it? Has it become morelucid? Has it actually given you the informationwhich it purported to do?(I am giving you credit for very unusual ability;this test is not easy to make; and, obviously, youmay have spoilt the whole composition, especiallywhere its value depends on its form rather than onits substance. But we are not considering poetry, orpoetic prose; all we want is intelligible meaning.)It does not follow that a passage is nonsensicalbecause you fail to understand it; it may simply betoo hard for you. When Bertrand Russell writes“We say that a function R is ‘ultimately Q-conver-gent α’ if there is a member y of the conversedomain of R and the field of Q such that the valueof the function for the argument y and for anyargument to which y has the relation Q is a memberof α.” Do we?But you do not doubt that if you were to learn themeaning of all these unfamiliar terms, you wouldbe able to follow his thought.Now take a paragraph from an “occult teacher.”What’s more, I’ll give you wheat, not tares; itseems terrifyingly easy for sound instruction todegenerate into a “pi-jaw.” Here goes!“To don Nirmanakaya’s humble robe is to foregoeternal bliss for self, to help on man’s salvation. Toreach Nirvana’s bliss but to renounce it, is thesupreme, the final step — the highest onRenunciation’s Path.”Follows a common-sense comment by FraterO.M.“All this about Gautama Buddha having re-nounced Nirvana is apparently all a pure inventionof Mme. Blavatsky, and has no authority in theBuddhist canon. The Buddha is referred to, againand again, as having ‘passed away by that kind ofpassing away which leaves nothing whatever be-hind.’ The account of his doing this is given in theMahaparinibbana Sutta; and it was the contentionof the Toshophists that this ‘great, sublime Nibbanastory’ was something peculiar to Gautama Bud-dha. They began to talk about Parinibbana, super-Nibbana, as if there were some way of subtractingone from one which would leave a higher, superiorkind of a nothing, or as if there were some way ofblowing out a candle which would leave Moses ina much more Egyptian darkness than we eversupposed when we were children.“This is not science. This is not business. This isAmerican Sunday journalism. The Hindu and theAmerican are very much alike in this innocence,this ‘naiveté’ which demands fairy stories with everbigger giants. They cannot bear the idea of anythingbeing complete and done with. So, they are alwaystalking in superlatives, and are hard put to it whenthe facts catch up with them, and they have to inventnew superlatives. Instead of saying that there arebricks of various sizes, and specifying those sizes,they have a brick and a super-brick, and ‘one’ brick,and ‘some’ brick; and when they have got to the endthey chase through the dictionary for some otherepithet to brick, which shall excite the sense ofwonder at the magnificent progress and super-progress — I present the American public with thisword — which is supposed to have been made.Probably the whole thing is a bluff without a singlefact behind it. Almost the whole of the Hindupsychology is an example of this kind of journal-ism. They are not content with the supreme God.The other man wishes to show off by having asupremer God than that, and when a third mancomes along and finds them disputing, it is up tohim to invent a supremest super-God.“It is simply ridiculous to try to add to thedefinition of Nibbana by this invention ofParinibbana, and only talkers busy themselves withthese fantastic speculations. The serious studentminds his own business, which is the business inhand. The President of a Corporation does not payhis bookkeeper to make a statement of the countlessbillions of profit to be made in some future year. Itrequires no great ability to string a row of zeros aftera significant figure until the ink runs out. What iswanted is the actual balance of the week.“The reader is most strongly urged not to permithimself to indulge in fantastic flights of thought,which are the poison of the mind, because theyrepresent an attempt to run away from reality, adispersion of energy and a corruption of moralstrength. His business is, firstly, to know himself;secondly, to order and control himself; thirdly, todevelop himself on sound organic lines little bylittle.

Read this: —“One day quite soon an entirely different kind ofelectricity will be discovered which will bring asmany profound changes into human living as thefirst type did. This new electricity will move in afiner ether than does our familiar kind, and thus willbe nearer in vibration to the fifth dimension, to theinnermost source of things, that realm of ‘withinness’wherein all is held poised by a colossal force, thatsame force which is packed within the atom.

This question is of the very first impor-tance: the whole theory of Education depends upona correct standard. There are facts and facts: onewould not necessarily be much the wiser if one gotthe Encyclopaedia Britannica by heart, or theTables of Logarithms. The one aim of Mathemat-ics, in fact — Whitehead points this out in his littleShilling Arithmetic — is to make one fact do thework of thousands.What we are looking for is a working Hierarchyof Facts.That takes us back at once to our original “addi-tion and subtraction” remark in my letter on Mind.Classification, the first step, proceeds by puttingsimilar things together, and dissimilar things apart.One asset in the Audit of a fact is the amount ofknowledge which it covers. (2 + 5)2 = 49; (3 + 4)2= 49; (6 + 2)2 = 64; (7 + 1)2 = 64; (9 + 4)2 = 169 areisolated facts, no more; worse, the coincidences of49 and 64 might start the wildest phantasies in yourhead — “something mysterious about this.” But ifyou write “The sum of the squares of any twonumbers is the sum of the square of each plus twicetheir multiple” — (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 — youhave got a fact which covers every possible case,and exhibits one aspect of the nature of numbersthemselves. The importance of a word increases asits rank, from the particular and concrete to thegeneral and abstract. (It is curious that the highestvalues of all, the “Laws of Nature,” are neverexactly “true” for any two persons, for one personcan never observe the identical phenomena sen-sible to another, since two people cannot be inexactly the same place at exactly the same time: yetit is just these facts that are equally true for all men.)Observe, I pray, the paramount importance ofmemory. From one point of view (bless your heart!)you are nothing at all but a bundle of memories.When you say “this is happening now,” you are afalsifier of God’s sacred truth! When I say “I see ahorse”, the truth is that “I record in those terms myprivate hieroglyphic interpretation of the unknownand unknowable phenomenon (or ‘point-event’)which has more or less recently taken place at theother end of my system of receiving impressions.”(Is this clear? I do hope so; if not, make me go onat it until it is.)Well, then! You realize, of course, how manymillions or billions of memories there must be tocompose any average well-trained mind. Thosestrings of adjectives all sprang spontaneously; I didnot look them up in books of reference; so imaginethe extent of my full vocabulary!

They held to the Pla-tonic dogma of archetypes. They maintained thatthere was an original (divine) idea such as “green-ness” or a “pig,” and that a green pig, as observedin nature, was just one example of these two idealessences. They were opposed by the “nominalists,”who said, to the contrary, that “greenness” or “apig” were nothing in themselves; they were merenames (nominalism from Lat. nomen, a name)invented for convenience of grouping. This doc-trine is plain commonsense, and I shall waste notime in demolishing the realists.All à priori thinking, the worst kind of thinking,goes with “realism” in this sense.And now you look shocked and surprised! Andno wonder! What (you exclaim) is the wholeQabalistic doctrine but the very apotheosis of this“realism”? (It was also called “idealism”, appar-ently to cheer and comfort the student on his roughand rugged road!) Is not Atziluth the “archetypalworld?” is not —Oh, all right, all right! Keep your blouse on! Ididn’t go for to do it. You’re quite right: the Tree ofLife is like that, in appearance. But that is the wrongway to look at it. We get our number two, forexample, as “that which is common to a bird’s legs,a man’s ears, twins, the cube root of eight, thegreater luminaries, the spikes of a pitchfork,” etc.but, having got it, we must not go on to argue thatthe number two being possessed of this and thatproperty, therefore there must be two of somethingor other which for one reason or another we cannotcount on our fingers.The trouble is that sometimes we can do so; weare very often obliged to do so, and it comes outcorrect. But we must not trust any such theorem; itis little more than a hint to help us in our guesses.Example: an angel appears and tells us that hisname is MALIEL (MLIAL) which adds to 111, thethird of the numbers of the Sun. Do we concludethat his nature is solar? In this case, yes, perhaps,because, (on the theory) he took that name for thevery reason that it chimed with his nature. But aman may reside at 81 Silver Street without being alunatic, or be born at five o’clock on the 5th of May,1905, and make a very poor soldier.“No, no, my dear sister, how tempted soever,To nominalism be faithful forever!”(If you want to be very learned indeed, read upBertrand Russell on “Classes”.)Enough, more than enough, of this: let us returnto the relative value of various types of thought.I think you already understand the main point:you must structuralise your thinking. You mustlearn how to differentiate and how to integrate yourthoughts. Nothing exists in isolation; it is alwaysconditioned by its relations with other things; in-deed, in one sense, a thing is no more than the sumof these relations. (For the only “reality,” in the longrun, is, as we have seen, a Point of View.)Now, this task of organizing the mind, of erect-ing a coherent and intelligible structure, is enor-mously facilitated by the Qabalah.When, in one of those curious fits of indisposi-tion of which you periodically complain, and ofwhich the cause appears to you so obscure, you seepink leopards on the staircase, mmmmm “Ah! thecolour of the King Scale of Tiphareth — Oh! theform of Leo, probably in the Queen Scale” andthereby increase your vocabulary by these twoitems. Then, perhaps, someone suggests that indis-cretion in the worship of Dionysus is responsible forthe observed phenomena — well, there’s Tipharethagain at once; the Priest, moreover, wears a leop-ard-skin, and the spots suggest the Sun. Also, Sol isLord of Leo: so there you are! pink leopards areexactly what you have a right to expect!Until you have practiced this method, all day andevery day, for quite a long while, you cannot tellhow amazingly your mnemonic power increases byvirtue thereof. But be careful always to range thenew ideas as they come along in their right order ofimportance.It is not unlike the system of keys used in bigestablishments, such as hotels. First, a set of keys,each of which opens one door, and one door only.Then, a set which opens all the doors on one flooronly. And so on, until the one responsible personwho has one unique key which opens every lock inthe building.There is another point about this whole Systemof the Qabalah. It does more than merely increasethe mnemonic faculty by 10,000% or so; the habitof throwing your thoughts about, manipulatingthem, giving them a wash and brush-up, packingthem away into their proper places in you “CrystalCabinet,” gives you immensely increased powerover them.In particular, it helps you to rid them of theemotional dirt which normally clogs them;1 youbecome perfectly indifferent to any implication buttheir value in respect of the whole system; and thisis of incalculable help in the acquisition of newideas. It is the difference between a man trying topick a smut out of his wife’s eye with clumsy,greasy fingers coarsened by digging drains, and anoculist furnished with a speculum and all the instru-ments exactly suited to the task.Yet another point. Besides getting rid of theemotions and sensations which cloud the thought,the fact that you are constantly asking yourself“Now, in which drawer of which cabinet does thisthought go?” automatically induces you to regardthe system as the important factor in the operation,if only because it is common to every one of them.So not only have you freed Sanna (perception)from the taint of Vedana (sensation) but raised it (ordemolished it, if your prefer to look at it in thatlight!) to be merely a member of the Sankhâra(tendency) class, thus boosting you vigorously tothe fourth stage, the last before the last! of thepractice of Mahasatipathana.Just one more word about the element of Vedana.The Intellect is a purely mechanical contrivance, asaccurate and as careless of what it turns out as aCash Register. It receives impressions, calculates,states the result: that is A double L, ALL!Try never to qualify a thought in any way, to seeit as it is in itself in relation to those other elementswhich are necessary to make it what it is.Above all, do not “mix the planes.” A daggermay be sharp or blunt, straight or crooked; it is not“wicked-looking,” or even “trusty,” except in so faras the quality of its steel makes it so. A cliff is not“frowning” or “menacing.” A snow-covered gla-cier is not “treacherous:” to say so means only thatAlpine Clubmen and other persons ignorant ofmountain craft are unable to detect the position ofcovered crevasses.All such points you must decide for yourself; theimportant thing is that you should challenge anysuch ideas.Above all, do not avoid, or slur, unwelcometrains of thought or distressing problems. Don’t say“he passed on” when you mean “he died,” and don’tcall a spade a bloody shovel!Thresh out such matters with Osiris’ flail; on thewinnowing-fan of Iacchus!Truth in itself is beautiful, and the best bower-anchor of your ship; every truth fits all the rest oftruth; and the most alluring lies will never do that.“The toad, ugly and venomous,Wears yet a precious jewel in its head”and the result of letting“Two ghastly scullions concoct messWith brimstone, pitch, vitriol, and devil’s dung”in the end repay investigation.The Vision and the Voice again, please! Thatfrightful Curse — how every phrase turns out to bea Blessing!I shall break off this brief note at this point, sothat you may have time to tell me if what I have sofar said covers the whole ground of your enquiry.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XIITHE LEFT-HAND PATH — “THE BLACKBROTHERS”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It is the introduction of the word “self” that hasraised such prickly questions. It really is a littlebewildering; the signpost “Right-hand Path”, “Left-hand Path”, seems rather indecipherable; and then,for such a long way, they look exactly alike. Atwhat point do they diverge?1 I hope there is no need to repeat that whetherany given thought is pleasant, or undersirable, orotherwise soiled by Vedana, is totally irrelevant."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears24Actually, the answers are fairly simple.As far as the achievement or attainment is con-cerned, the two Paths are in fact identical. In fact,one almost feels obliged to postulate some inmostfalsity, completely impossible to detect, inherent atthe very earliest stages.For the decision which determines the catastro-phe confronts only the Adeptus Exemptus 7° = 4.Until that grade is reached, and that very fullyindeed, with all the buttons properly sewed on, oneis not capable of understanding what is meant by theAbyss. Unless “all you have and all you are” isidentical with the Universe, its annihilation wouldleave a surplus.Mark well this first distinction: the “Black Ma-gician” or Sorcerer is hardly even a distant cousinof the “Black Brother.” The difference between asneak-thief and a Hitler is not too bad an analogy.The Sorcerer may be — indeed he usually is —a thwarted disappointed man whose aims are per-fectly natural. Often enough, his real trouble isignorance; and by the time he has become fairly hotstuff as a Black Magician, he has learnt that he isgetting nowhere, and finds himself, despite himself,on the True Path of the Wise.“Invoking Zeus to swell the power of Pan,The prayer discomfits the demented man;Lust lies as still as Love.”Thereupon he casts away his warlock apparatuslike a good little boy, finds the A∴A∴, and liveshappily ever after.The Left-hand Path is a totally different matter.Let us start at the beginning.You remember my saying that only two opera-tions were possible in Nature: addition and subtrac-tion. Let us apply this to magical progress.What happens when the Aspirant invokes Diana,or calls up Lilith? He increases the sum of hisexperiences in these particular ways. Sometimes hehas a “liaison-experience,” which links two mainlines of thought, and so is worth dozens of isolatedgains.Now, if there is any difference at all between theWhite and the Black Adept in similar case, it is thatthe one, working by “love under will” achieves amarriage with the new idea, while the other, merelygrabbing, adds a concubine to his harem of slaves.The about-to-be-Black Brother constantly re-stricts himself; he is satisfied with a very limitedideal; he is afraid of losing his individuality —reminds one of the “Nordic” twaddle about “race-pollution.”Have you seen the sand-roses of the Sahara?Such is the violence of the Khamsin that it whipsgrains of sand together, presses them, finally buildsthem into great blocks, big enough and solid enoughto be used for walls in the oasis. And beautiful!Whew! For all that, they are not real rocks. Leavehem in peace, with no possible interference — whathappens? (I brought some home, and put them “insafety” as curiosities, and as useful psychometricaltests.) Alas! Time is enough. Go to the drawerwhich held them; nothing remains but little piles ofdust.“Now Master!” (What reproach in the tone ofyour voice!) All right, all right! Keep your hair on!— I know that is the precise term used in The Visionand the Voice, to describe the Great White Brotheror the Babe of the Abyss; but to him it meansvictory; to the Left-Hander it would mean defeat,ruin devastating, irremediable, final. It is exactlythat which he most dreads; and it is that to which hemust in the end come, because there is no compen-sating element in his idea of structure. Nationsthemselves never grow permanently by smash-and-grab methods; one merely acquires a sore spot, as inthe case of Lorraine, perhaps even Eire. (ThoughEire is using just that formula of Restriction, shut-ting herself up in her misery and poverty and idiotpride, when a real marriage with and dissolution in,a real live country would give her new life. The“melting-pot” idea is the great strength of America.)Consider the Faubourg St. Germain aristocracy— now hardly even a sentimental memory. Theguillotine did not kill them; it was their own refusalto adapt themselves to the new biological condi-tions of political life. It was indeed their restrictionthat rotted them in the first instance; had Lafayetteor Mirabeau been trusted with full power, andsupplied with adequate material, a younger genera-tion of virtue, the monarchy might still be rulingFrance.But then (you ask) how can a man go so farwrong after he has, as an Adeptus Minor, attainedthe “Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel”?Recall the passage in the 14th Aethyr “Seewhere thine Angel hath led Thee”, and so on.Perhaps the Black Brother deserts his Angel whenhe realises the Programme.Perhaps his error was so deeply rooted, from thevery beginning, that it was his Evil Genius that heevoked.In such cases the man’s policy is of course tobreak off all relations with the Supernal Triad, andto replace it by inventing a false crown, Daäth. Tothem Knowledge will be everything, and what isKnowledge but the very soul of Illusion?Refusing thus the true nourishment of all hisfaculties, they lose their structural unity, and mustbe fortified by continuous doses of dope in an-guished self-preservation. Thus all its chemicalequations become endothermic.I do hope I am making myself clear; it is adreadfully subtle line of thought. But I think youought to be able to pick up the essential theorem;your own meditations, aided by the relevant pas-sages in Liber 418 and elsewhere, should do therest.To describe the alternative attitude should clarify,by dint of contrast; at least the contemplation shouldbe a pleasant change.Every accretion must modify me. I want it to doso. I want to assimilate it absolutely. I want to makeit a permanent feature of my Temple. I am not afraidof losing myself to it, if only because it also ismodified by myself in the act of union. I am notafraid of its being the “wrong” thing, because everyexperience is a “play of Nuit,” and the worst thatcan happen is a temporary loss of balance, which isinstantly adjusted, as soon as it is noticed, by recall-ing and putting into action the formula of contradic-tion.Remember the Fama Fraternitatis: when theyopened the Vault which held the Pastos of ourFather Christian Rosencreuz, “all these colourswere brilliant and flashing.” That is, if one panelmeasured 10\" × 40\", the symbol (say, yellow)would occupy 400 square inches, and the back-ground (in that case, violet) the other 400 squareinches. Hence they dazzled; the limitation, restric-tion, demarcation, disappeared; and the result wasan equable idea of form and colour which is beyondphysical understanding. (At one time Picasso triedto work out this idea on canvas.) Destroy thatequilibrium by one tenmillionth of an inch, and theeffect is lost. The unbalanced item stands out like acivilian in the middle of a regiment.True, this faculty, this feeling for equilibriummust be acquired; but once you have done so, it isan unerring guide. Instant discomfort warns one;the impulse to scratch it (the analogy is too apt toreject!) is irresistible.And oh! how imperative this is!Unless your Universe is perfect — and perfec-tion includes the idea of balance — how can youcome even to Atmadarshana? Hindus may main-tain that Atmadarshana, or at any rate Shiva-darshana, is the equivalent of crossing the Abyss.Beware of any such conclusions! The Trances aresimply isolated experiences, sharply cut off fromnormal thought-life. To cross the Abyss is a perma-nent and fundamental revolution in the whole ofone’s being.Much more, upon the brink of the Abyss. If therebe missing or redundant even one atom, the entiremonstrous, the portentous mass must tend to movewith irresistible impact, in such direction as torestore the equilibrium. To deflect it — well, thinkof a gyroscope! How then can you destroy it in onesole stupendous gesture? Ah! Listen to The Visionand the Voice.Perhaps the best and simplest plan is for me topick out the most important of the relevant passagesand put them together as an appendix to this letter.Also, by contrast, those allusions to the “BlackBrothers” and the “Left-hand Path.” This ought togive you a clear idea of what each is, and does; ofwhat distinguishes their respective methods in someways so confusingly alike. I hope indeed mostsincerely that you will whet your Magical Daggeron the Stone of the Wise, and wield most deftly anddeterminedly both the White-handled and the Black-handled Burin. In trying to express these opinions,I am constantly haunted by the dread that I may bemissing some crucial point, or even allowing a merequibble to pass for argument. It makes it only all theworse when one has become so habituated byNeschamic ideas, to knowing, even before one says"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears25it, that what one is going to say is of necessityuntrue, as untrue as it is contradictory. So what canit possibly matter what one says?Such doubts are dampers!“Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!”Here follow the quotations from The Vision andthe Voice.“The Angel Re-appears”“The blackness gathers about, so thick, so cling-ing, so penetrating, so oppressive, that all the otherdarkness that I have ever conceived would be likebright light beside it.“His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that artmaster of the fifty gates of Understanding, is not mymother a black woman? O thou that art master ofthe Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg?Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul,and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shutup, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.“I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of manwith the lust of light. I am the sightless storm in thenight that wrappeth the world about with desola-tion. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Knowthou that the darkness of the earth is ruddy, and thedarkness of the air is grey, but the darkness of thesoul is utter blackness.“The egg of the spirit is a basilisk egg, and thegates of the understanding are fifty, that is the signof the Scorpion. The pillars about the Neophyte arecrowned with flame, and the vault of the Adepts islighted by the Rose. And in the abyss is the eye of thehawk. But upon the great sea shall the Master of theTemple find neither star nor moon.“And I was about to answer him: ‘The light iswithin me.’ But before I could frame the words, heanswered me with the great word that is the Key ofthe Abyss. And he said: Thou hast entered the night;dost thou yet lust for day? Sorrow is my name andaffliction. I am girt about with tribulation. Here stillhangs the Crucified One, and here the Motherweeps over the children that she hath not borne.Sterility is my name and desolation. Intolerable isthine ache, and incurable thy wound. I said, ‘Let thedarkness cover me;’ and behold, I am compassedabout with the blackness that hath no name. O thou,who hast cast down the light into the earth, so mustthou do for ever. And the light of the sun shall notshine upon thee and the moon shall not lend thee ofher luster, and the stars shall be hidden because thouart passed beyond these things, beyond the need ofthese things, beyond the desire of these things.“What I thought were shapes of rocks, rather feltthan seen, now appear to be veiled Masters, sittingabsolutely still and silent. Nor can any one bedistinguished from the others.“And the Angel sayeth: Behold where thineAngel hath led thee! Thou didst ask fame, powerand pleasure, health and wealth and love, andstrength and length of days. Thou didst hold lifewith eight tentacles, like an octopus. Thou didstseek the four powers and the seven delights and thetwelve emancipations, and lo! thou art become asone of These. Bowed are their backs, whereonresteth the Universe. Veiled are their faces, thathave beheld the glory Ineffable.“These adepts seem like Pyramids — their hoodsand robes are like Pyramids.“And the Angel sayeth: Verily is the Pyramid aTemple of Initiation. Verily also is it a tomb.Thinkest thou that there is life within the Masters ofthe Temple that sit hooded, encamped upon theSea? Verily, there is no life in them.“Their sandals were the pure light, and they havetaken them from their feet and cast them downthrough the abyss; for this Aethyr is holy ground.“Herein no forms appear, and the vision of Godface to face, that is transmuted in the Athanor calleddissolution, or hammered into one in the forge ofmeditation, is in this place but a blasphemy and amockery.“And the Beatific Vision is no more, and theglory of the Most High is no more. There is no moreknowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no morepower, There is no more beauty. For this is thePalace of Understanding; for thou art one with thePrimeval things.“Drink in the myrrh of my speech, that is bruisedwith the gall of the roc, and dissolved in the ink ofthe cuttle-fish, and perfumed with the deadly night-shade.“This is thy wine, who wast drunk upon the wineof Iacchus. And for bread shalt thou eat salt, O thouon the corn of Ceres that didst wax fat! For as purebeing is pure nothing, so is pure wisdom pure ...,1and so is pure understanding silence, and stillness,and darkness. The eye is called seventy, and thetriple Aleph whereby thou perceivest it, dividethinto the number of the terrible word that is the Keyof the Abyss.“I am Hermes, that am sent from the Father toexpound all things discreetly in these the last wordsthat thou shalt hear before thou take thy seat amongthese, whose eyes are sealed up and whose ears arestopped, and whose mouths are clenched, who arefolded in upon themselves, the liquor of whosebodies is dried up, so that nothing remains but alittle pyramid of dust.“And that bright light of comfort, and that pierc-ing sword of truth, and all the power and beauty thatthey have made of themselves, is cast from them, asit is written, ‘I saw Satan like lightning fall fromheaven.’ And as a flaming sword is it dropt thoughthe Abyss, where the four beasts keep watch andward. And it appeareth in the heaven of Jupiter as amorning star, or as an evening star. And the lightthereof shineth even unto the earth, and bringethhope and help to them that dwell in the darkness ofthought, and drink of the poison of life. Fifty are thegates of Understanding, and one hundred and sixare the seasons thereof. And the name of everyseason is Death.”(The Vision and the Voice. 14th Aethyr.)And for his Work thereafter?“So we enter the earth, and there is a veiledfigure, in absolute darkness. Yet it is perfectlypossible to see in it, so that the minutest details donot escape us. And upon the root of one flower hepours acid so that the root writhes as if in torture.And another he cuts, and the shriek is like the shriekof a Mandrake, torn up by the roots. And another hesears with fire, and yet another he anoints with oil.“And I said: Heavy is the labour, but greatindeed is the reward.“And the young man answered me: He shall notsee the reward; he tendeth the garden.“And I said: What shall come unto him?“And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is itrevealed by the letters that are the totems of thestars, but only by the stars.“And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: Theman of earth is the adherent. The lover giveth his lifeunto the work among men. The hermit goeth soli-tary, and giveth only of his light unto men.“And I ask him: Why does he tell me that?“And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself,for thou hast pondered thereupon for many days,and hast not found light. And now that thou artcalled NEMO, the answer to every riddle that thouhast not found shall spring up in thy mind, unsought.Who can tell upon what day a flower shall bloom?“And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world,and that shall be thy garden. And concerning timeand death, thou hast naught to do with these things.For though a precious stone be hidden in the sand ofthe desert, it shall not heed for the wind of the desert,although it be but sand. For the worker of workshath worked thereupon; and because it is clear, it isinvisible; and because it is hard, it moveth not.“All these words are heard by everyone that iscalled NEMO. And with that doth he apply himselfto understanding. And he must understand the vir-tue of the waters of death, and he must understandthe virtue of the sun and of the wind, and of theworm that turneth the earth, and of the stars that roofin the garden. And he must understand the separatenature and property of every flower, or how shall hetend his garden?”(Ibid. 13th Aethyr.)Thus for the Masters of the Temple; for theBlack Brothers, how?“For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excre-ment of these three paths, and therefore is his headraised unto Daäth, and therefore have the BlackBrotherhood declared him to be the child of Wis-dom and Understanding, who is but the bastard ofthe Svastika. And this is that which is written in theHoly Qabalah, concerning the Whirlpool and Le-viathan, and the Great Stone.”(Ibid. 3rd Aethyr)“Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy againstBabalon, for she hath shut herself up; and thereforeis she the Queen of all those wicked devils that walkupon the earth, those that thou sawest even as littleblack specks that stained the Heaven of Urania.And all these are the excrement of Choronzon.“And for this is BABALON under the power of1 I suppose that only a Magus could have heardthis word."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears26the Magician, that she hath submitted herself untothe work; and she guardeth the Abyss. And in her isa perfect purity of that which is above, yet she is sentas the Redeemer to them that are below. For there isno other way into the Supernal mystery but throughher and the Beast on which she rideth; and theMagician is set beyond her to deceive the brothersof blackness, lest they should make unto them-selves a crown; for if there were two crowns, thenshould Ygdrasil, that ancient tree, be cast out intothe Abyss, uprooted and cast down into the Outer-most Abyss, and the Arcanum which is in theAdytum should be profaned; and the Ark should betouched, and the Lodge spied upon by them that arenot masters, and the bread of the Sacrament shouldbe the dung of Choronzon; and the wine of theSacrament should be the water of Choronzon; andthe incense should be dispersion; and the fire uponthe Altar should be hate. But lift up thyself; stand,play the man, for behold! there shall be revealedunto thee the Great Terror, the thing of awe thathath no name.”(Ibid. 3rd Aethyr.)“And now She cometh forth again, riding upona dolphin. Now again I see those wandering souls,that have sought restricted love, and have not un-derstood that the ‘word of sin is restriction.’“It is very curious; they seem to be looking forone another, or for something, all the time, con-stantly hurrying about. But they knock up againstone another and yet will not see one another, orcannot see one another, because they are so shut upin their cloaks.“And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for theone that hath shut himself up and made himself fastagainst the universe. For they that sit encampedupon the sea in the city of the Pyramids are indeedshut up. But they have given their blood, even to thelast drop, to fill the cup of BABALON.“These that thou seest are indeed the BlackBrothers, for it is written: He shall laugh at theircalamity and mock when their fear cometh. Andtherefore hath he exalted them unto the plane oflove.“And yet again it is written: He desireth not thedeath of a sinner, but rather that he should turn fromhis wickedness. Now, if one of these were to cast offhis cloak he should behold the brilliance of the ladyof the Aethyr; but they will not.”And again: —“Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormousdeserts studded with great rocks; and I see littlelonely souls, running helplessly about, minute blackcreatures like men. And they keep up a very curioushowling, that I can compare to nothing that I haveever heard; yet it is strangely human.“And the voice says: These are they that graspedlove and clung thereto, praying ever at the knees ofthe great goddess. These are they that have shutthemselves up in fortresses of Love.”(Ibid. 7th Aethyr.)Moreover, this also:“And this is the meaning of the Supper of thePassover, the spilling of the blood of the Lambbeing a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they havesealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel ofDeath should enter therein. Thus do they shutthemselves off from the company of the saints. Thusdo they keep themselves from compassion and fromunderstanding.“Accursed are they, for they shut up their bloodin their heart.“They keep themselves from the kisses of myMother Babylon, and in their lonely fortresses theypray to the false moon. And they bind themselvestogether with an oath, and with a great curse. Andof their malice they conspire together, and they havepower, and mastery, and in their cauldrons do theybrew the harsh wine of delusion, mingled with thepoison of their selfishness.“Thus they make war upon the Holy one, send-ing forth their delusion upon men, and upon every-thing that liveth. So that their false compassion iscalled compassion, and their false understanding iscalled understanding, for this is their most potentspell.“Yet of their own poison do they perish, and intheir lonely fortresses shall they be eaten up byTime that hath cheated them to serve him, and bythe mighty devil Choronzon, their master, whosename is the second Death, for the blood that theyhave sprinkled on their Pylon, that is a bar againstthe Angel Death, is the key by which he enterethin.1”(Ibid. 12th Aethyr.)Finally:“Yet must he that understandeth go forth untothe outermost Abyss, and there must he speak withhim that is set above the four-fold terror, the Princeof Evil, even with Choronzon, the mighty devil thatinhabiteth the outermost Abyss. And none mayspeak with him, or understand him, but the servantsof Babylon, that understand, and they that arewithout understanding, his servants.“Behold! it entereth not into the heart, nor intothe mind of man to conceive this matter; for thesickness of the body is death, and the sickness of theheart is despair, and the sickness of the mind ismadness. But in the outermost Abyss is sickness ofthe aspiration, and sickness of the will, and sicknessof the essence of all, and there is neither word northought wherein the image of its image is reflected.“And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss,except he be of them that understand, holdeth outhis hands, and boweth his neck, unto the Chains ofChoronzon. And as a devil he walketh about theearth, immortal, and be blasteth the flowers of theearth, and he corrupteth the fresh air, and he makethpoisonous the water; and the fire that is the friend ofman, and the pledge of his aspiration, seeing that itmounteth ever upward as a Pyramid, and seeingthat man stole it in a hollow tube from Heaven, eventhat fire he turneth into ruin, and madness, andfever, and destruction. And thou, that art an heap ofdry dust in the city of the Pyramids, must under-stand these things.“Beware, therefore, O thou who art appointed tounderstand the secret of the Outermost Abyss, for inevery Abyss thou must assume the mask and formof the Angel thereof. Hadst thou a name, thou wertirrevocably lost. Search, therefore, if there be yetone drop of blood that is not gathered into the cup ofBabylon the Beautiful: for in that little pile of dust,if there could be one drop of blood, it should beutterly corrupt; it should breed scorpions, and vi-pers, and the cat of slime.“And I said unto the Angel: ‘Is there not oneappointed as a warden?’“And he said:“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani.“Such an ecstasy of anguish racks me that Icannot give it voice, yet I know it is but as theanguish of Gethsemane.”(Ibid. 11th Aethyr)Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XIIISYSTEM OF THE O.T.O.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You inform me that the Earnest Inquirer of yourambit has been asking you to explain the differencebetween the A∴A∴ and the O.T.O.; and that al-though your own mind is perfectly clear about it,you find it impossible to induce a similar lucidity inhis. You add that he is not (as one might at firstsuppose) a moron. And will I please do what I canabout it?Well, here’s the essential difference ab ovousque ad mala; the A∴A∴ concerns the indi-vidual, his development, his initiation, his passagefrom “Student” to “Ipsissimus”; he has no contactof any kind with any other person except the Neo-phyte who introduces him, and any Student orStudents whom he may, after becoming a Neo-phyte, introduce.The details of this Pilgrim’s Progress are veryfully set forth in One Star in Sight; and I shouldindeed be stupid and presumptuous to try to dobetter than that. But it is true that with regard to theO.T.O. there is no similar manual of instruction. Inthe Manifesto, and other Official Pronunciamenti,there are, it is true, what ought to be adequate data;but I quite understand that they are not as orderedand classified as one would wish; there is certainlyroom for a simple elementary account of the originsof the Order, of its principles, of its methods, of itsdesign, of the Virtue of its successive Grades. ThisI will now try to supply, at least in a brief outline.Let us begin at the beginning. What is a Dra-matic Ritual? It is a celebration of the Adventuresof the God whom it is intended to invoke. (TheBacchae of Euripides is a perfect example of this.)Now, in the O.T.O., the object of the ceremonies1 (I think the trouble with these people was, thatthey wanted to substitute the blood of someone elsefor their own blood, because they wanted to keeptheir personalities.)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears27being the Initiation of the Candidate, it is he whosePath in Eternity is displayed in dramatic form.What is the Path?1. The Ego is attracted to the Solar System.2. The Child experiences Birth.3. The Man experiences Life.4. He experiences Death.5. He experiences the World beyond Death.6. This entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawninto Annihilation.In the O.T.O. these successive stages are repre-sented as follows: —1. — 0° (Minerval)2. — I° (Initiation)3. — II° (Consecration)4. — III° (Devotion)5. — IV° (Perfection, or Exaltation)6. — P.I. (Perfect Initiate)Of these Events or Stations upon the Path all butthree (II°) are single critical experiences. We, how-ever, are concerned mostly with the very variedexperiences of Life.All subsequent Degrees of the O.T.O. are ac-cordingly elaborations of the II°, since in a singleceremony it is hardly possible to sketch, even in thebriefest outline, the Teaching of Initiates with re-gard to Life. The Rituals V°-IX° are then instruc-tions to the Candidate how he should conducthimself; and they confer upon him, gradually, theMagical Secrets which make him Master of Life.It is improper to disclose the nature of theseceremonies; firstly, because their Initiates are boundby the strictest vows not to do so; secondly, becausesurprise is an element in their efficacy; and thirdly,because the Magical Formulae explicitly or implic-itly contained therein are, from a practical point ofview, both powerful and dangerous. Automaticsafeguards there are, it is true; but a Black Magi-cian of first-class ability might find a way to over-come these obstacles, and work great mischief uponothers before the inevitable recoil of his artillerydestroys him.Such cases I have known. Let me recount brieflyone rather conspicuous disaster. The young manwas a genius — and it was his bane. He got hold ofa talisman of enormous power which happened tobe exactly what he wanted to fulfill his heart’sdearest wish. He knew also the correct way ofgetting it to work; but this way seemed to him far toolong and difficult. So he cast about for a short cut.By using actual violence to the talisman, he sawhow he could force it to carry out his design; he useda formula entirely alien to the spirit of the wholeoperation; it was rather like extracting informationfrom a prisoner by torture, when patient courtesywould have been the proper method. So he crashedthe gate and got what he wanted. But the nectarturned to poison even as he drained the cup, and hisprevious anguish developed into absolute despair.Then came the return of the current, and theybrought it in “while of unsound mind.” A mostaccurate diagnosis!I do beg you to mark well, dear sister, that a trueMagical Operation is never “against Nature.” Itmust go smoothly and serenely according to Herlaws. One can bring in alien energies and compel anendothermic reaction; but — “Pike’s Peak or bust?”The answer will always be BUST!To return for a moment to that question ofSecrecy: there is no rule to prohibit you fromquoting against me such of my brighter remarks as“Mystery is the enemy of Truth;” but, for one thing,I am, and always have been, the leader of theExtreme Left in the Council-Chamber of the City ofthe Pyramids, so that if I acquiesce at all in thesystem of the O.T.O. so far as the “secret of secrets”of the IX° is concerned, it is really on a point ofpersonal honour. My pledge given to the late FraterSuperior and O.H.O., Dr. Theodor Reuss. For allthat, in this particular instance it is beyond questiona point of common prudence, both because theabuse of the Secret is, at least on the surface, so easyand so tempting, and because, if it became a matterof general knowledge the Order itself might be indanger of calumny and persecution; for the secret iseven easier to misinterpret that to profane.Lege! Judica! Tace!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XIVNOISECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You ask me what is, at the present time, thegreatest obstacle to human progress.I answer in one word: NOISE.You will recall that in Yoga the concise compen-dium of Initiated Instruction is:Sit stillStop thinkingShut up, andGet out.The second of these postulates the third; for onecan neither think nor stop thinking with all that rowgoing on.Then again, the Fourth Power of the Sphinx isSilence; on this subject I must refer you to LittleEssays Toward Truth (No. 14, p. 75).We are really trying to discuss something totallydifferent; something practical in daily life. Verywell, then; you remark that Goetia actually means“howling”, that we use officially the Bell, the Tom-Tom, the Incantations, the Mantras and so on. Allquite true, about Magick; but none of it applies toYoga, for even with the Mantra the practice is to gofaster and more quietly as one proceeds, until itbecomes “Mental Muttering.” M is the letter that ispronounced with the lips firmly closed; and Silenceis the meaning of the MU root of Mystery.However, we must admit the value of rhythmi-cal, one-pointed sound; that is very different fromNoise. Old French has noise, nose, a debate, quar-rel, noise; Provinçal noisa, nausa, nueiza. ButDiez claims the derivation from nausea — and bythe Living Jingo, I consider Diez a hundred per centwhite man!Now, most modern talking is little better than aseries of conventional grunts; most people seem toaim deliberately at not saying anything with mean-ing, at least in normal conversation. (James BranchCabell is exceedingly funny in his displays of thisintolerable habit.)I once had a most wholesome lesson: how diffuseand therefore unnecessary is much of even our mostwould-be-compressed speech.I had been charged by my Superior with thereconstruction of a certain ritual. This was in 1912;already the tempo of the world had speeded upmercilessly; to get people to learn even short pas-sages by heart would be no easy job. So, warned bythe prolix, pious, priggish and platitudinous horrorsof Freemasonry (especially the advanced degrees ofthe Scottish and Egyptian Rites), I resolved to cutthe cackle and come to the ’osses in the most drasticmanner of which I was capable.It was a great success.But then we had a candidate who was stone deaf.(Not “a little hard of hearing;” his tympana wereburst.)Obviously, one could show him slips of paper, asone did in talking to him. But then in much of theceremony the candidate must be hoodwinked! Noth-ing for it but to communicate by the deaf and dumbalphabet on his fingers. This I did — and found thatI could cut out on the spur of the moment at leastforty per cent of the “Irreducible minimum” with-out doing any damage at all to the effect of the ritual.“That larned ’im!”Of course, there is such a thing as the Art ofConversation; I have been lucky enough to knowthree, perhaps four, of the world’s best talkers; butthat is not to the point. As well object to impastobecause it wastes paint.What I am out to complain of is what I seriouslybelieve to be an organized conspiracy of the BlackLodges to prevent people from thinking.Naked and unashamed! In some countries therehas already been compulsory listening-in to Gov-ernment programmes; and who knows how long itwill be before we are all subjected by law to thebleatings, bellowings, belchings of the boring bal-derdash of the B.B.C.-issies?They boast of the freedom of religious thought;yet only the narrowest sectarian propaganda isallowed to approach the microphone. I quite expectcensorship of books — that of the newspapers,however vehemently denied, is actually effective— and even of private letters. This will mean anenormous increase in parasitic functionaries whocan be trusted to vote for the rascals that inventedtheir sinecures. That was, in fact, the poison ivy thatstrangled the French poplar!But these soul-suffocationg scoundrels knowwell their danger. There are still a few people aboutwho have learnt to think; and they are palsied withterror lest, as might happen at any moment thesepeople realized the peril, organized, and made aclean sweep of the whole brood of scolex!So nobody must be allowed to think at all. Down"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears28with the public schools! Children must be drilledmentally by quarter-educated herdsmen, whosewages would stop at the first sign of disagreementwith the bosses. For the rest, deafen the whole worldwith senseless clamour. Mechanize everything! Givenobody a chance to think. Standardize “amuse-ment.” The louder and more cacophonous, thebetter! Brief intervals between one din and the nextcan be filled with appeals, repeated ’till hypnoticpower gives them the force of orders, to buy this orthat product of the “Business men” who are the realpower in the State. Men who betray their country asobvious routine.The history of the past thirty years is eloquentenough, one would think. What these sodden imbe-ciles never realize is that a living organism mustadapt itself intelligently to its environment, or gounder at the first serious change of circumstance.Where would England be today if there had notbeen one man, deliberately kept “in the wilderness”for decades as “unsound”, “eccentric”, “danger-ous”, “not to be trusted”, “impossible to workwith”, to take over the country from the bewildered“safe” men?And what could he have done unless the peoplehad responded? Nothing. So then there is still aremnant whose independence, sense of reality, andmanhood begin to count when the dear, good,woolly flock scatter in terror at the wolf’s first howl.Yes, they are there, and they can get us back ourfreedom — if only we can make them see that theenemy in Whitehall is more insidiously fatal thanthe foe in Brownshirt House.On this note of hope I will back to my silence.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XVSEX MORALITY(INCLUDES ARTEMIS IOTA)Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Thank you! I am to cover the whole question ofsex in a few well-chosen words? Am I to supposethat you want to borrow money? Such fulsomeflattery suggests the indirect approach.As a matter of fact, your proposal is not sooutrageous as it sounds at first; for as far as theEnglish language goes, there is really hardly any-thing worth reading. 98.138 per cent of it is whatFrances Ridley Ravergal used to call “fiddlesticks,blah, boloney, Bull-shit, and the bunk.”However, quite recently I issued an Encyclicalto the Faithful with the attractive title of ArtemisIota, and I propose that we read this into the record,to save trouble, and because it gives a list of practi-cally all the classics that you ought to read. Also, itcondenses information and advice to “beginners,”with due reference to the positive injunctions givenin The Book of the Law.Still, for the purpose of these letters, I should liketo put the whole matter in a nutshell. The Tree ofLife, as usual, affords a convenient means of clas-sification.1. To the physical side of it psychological lawsapply. “Don’t monkey with the buzz-saw!” as JohnWesley might have put it, though I doubt whetherhe did.2. The “moral” side. As in the case of the voltageof a cissoid, there isn’t one. Mind your own busi-ness! is the sole sufficient rule. To drag in social,economic, religious, and such aspects is irrelevanceand impurity.3. The Magical side. Sex is, directly or indi-rectly, the most powerful weapon in the armoury ofthe Magician; and precisely because there is nomoral guide, it is indescribably dangerous. I havegiven a great many hints, especially in Magick, andThe Book of Thoth — some of the cards are almostblatantly revealing; so I have been rapped ratherseverely over the knuckles for giving childrenmatches for playthings. My excuse has been thatthey have already got the matches, that my explana-tions have been directed to add conscious precau-tions to the existing automatic safeguards.The above remarks refer mainly to the techniqueof the business; and it is going a very long way to tellyou that you ought to be able to work out theprinciples thereof from your general knowledge ofMagick, but especially the Formula of Tetra-grammaton, clearly stated and explained in Mag-ick, Chap. III. Combine this with the heart of Chap.XII and you’ve got it!But there is another point at issue. This inciden-tally, is where the “automatic safeguards” come in.“...thou hast no right but to do thy will.” (AL I, 42)means that to “go anwhoring after strange” pur-poses can only be disastrous. It is possible, inchemistry, to provoke an endothermic reaction; butthat is only asking for trouble. The product bearswithin its own heart the seed of dissolution. Accord-ingly, the most important preliminary to any Magi-cal operation is to make sure that its object is notonly harmonious with, but necessary to, your GreatWork.Note also that the use of this supreme methodinvolves the manipulation of energies ineffablysecret and most delicately sensitive; it compareswith the operations of ordinary Magick as the lastword in artillery does with the blunderbuss!I ought to have mentioned the sexual instinct orimpulse in itself, careless of magical or any otherconsiderations soever: the thing that picks you upby the scruff of the neck, slits your weasand with acavalry sabre, and chucks the remains over thenearest precipice.What is the damn thing, anyway?That’s just the trouble; for it is the first of themasks upon the face of the True Will; and that maskis the Poker-Face!As all true Art is spontaneous, is genius, isutterly beyond all conscious knowledge or control,so also is sex. Indeed, one might class it as deeperstill than Art; for Art does at least endeavour to findan intelligible means of expression. That is muchnearer to sanity than the blind lust of the sex-impulse. The maddest genius does look fromChokmah not only to Binah, but to the fruit of thatunion in Daäth and the Ruach; the sex-impulse hasno use for Binah to understand, to interpret, totransmit. It wants no more than an instrumentwhich will destroy it.“Here, I say, Master, have a heart!”Nonsense! (I continue) What I say is the plainfact, and well you know it! More, damned up,hemmed in, twisted and tortured as it has been byreligion and morality and all the rest of it, it haslearnt to disguise itself, to appear in a myriad formsof psychosis, neurosis, actual insanity of the mostdangerous types. You don’t have to look beyondHitler! Its power and its peril derive directly fromthe fatal fact that in itself it is the True Will in itspurest form.What then is the magical remedy? Obviousenough to the Qabalist. “Love is the law, love underwill.” It must be fitted at its earliest manifestationswith its proper Binah, so as to flow freely along thePath of Daleth, and restore the lost Balance. At-tempts to suppress it are fatal, to sublime it are falseand futile. But guided wisely from the start, by thetime it becomes strong it has learnt how to use itsvirtues to the best advantage.And what of the parallel instinct in a woman?Except in (rather rare) cases of congenital disease ordeformity, the problem is never so acute. For Binah,even while she winks at Chokmah, has the other eyewide-open, swivelled on Tiphareth. Her True Willis thus divided by Nature from the start, and hertragedy is if she fails to unite these two objects. Oh,dear me, yes, I know all about “spretae injuriaformae” and “furens quid femina possit”; but thatis only because when she misses her bite she feelsdoubly baffled, robbed not only of the ecstaticPresent, but of the glamorous Future. If she eatindependently of the Fruit of the Tree of Life whenunripe, she has not only the bad taste in the mouth,but indigestion to follow. Then, living as she does somuch in the world of imagination, constantly livingshadow-pictures of her Desire, she is not nearly soliable to the violent insanities of sheer blind lust, asis the male. The essential difference is indicated bythat of their respective orgasms, the female undula-tory, the male catastrophic.The above, taken all in all, may not be fullycomprehensive, not wholly satisfying to the soul,but one thing with another, enough for a cow tochew the cud on.Good night!Love is the law, love under will,Fraternally, 666LARTEMIS IOTAvelDe coituScholia Triviae“Dianae sumus in fide Puellae et pueri integriDianam pueri integri Puellaeque canamus.”— Catullus.“The word of Sin is Restriction.

There is no bond that can unite the di-vided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed!Accursed be it to the aeons!”Consent or refusal are to be determined by theimpulse itself, without reference to any other mo-tives such as commonly influence action.“So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thywill.”Every thought, word, or act without exception issubject to this law. “Do what thou wilt” does notgive license to do anything else; lest this be notunderstood, the doctrine is here explicit: “thou hastno right but to do thy will.”Every particle of energy must be built into thissingle-track machine of will; directly or indirectly,it must serve the one purpose. A very small hole inthe hull may sink a very large ship.Every act, therefore, with the thoughts and wordswhich determine its performance, is a sacrament........Now of all acts the most intrinsically importantis the act of love. Firstly, because the ecstasy whichaccompanies its due performance is a physicalimage, or hint, of the state of Samadhi, since theconsciousness of the Ego is temporarily in abey-ance; secondly, because its normal effect on thematerial plane is, or may be, incalculably vast. (Theemphasis upon the word “due” is absolute.) Pre-cisely because it is so powerful a weapon, its use ishedged in with manifold precautions, and its abusedeprecated in injunctions heavily charged withmenace.“... Also, take your fill and will of love as ye will,when, where and with whom ye will!

Thisact is a definite electrical or magnetic phenomenon.No other considerations apply. (It will thereforeoccasionally seem, to the outsider, unreasonable.)The only exception — it is only apparently so — iswhen satisfaction of the impulse would manifestlythwart the True Will more than it would help tofulfill it; any such case must be judged on its merits.“But always unto me.” The word “always”admits to no exception; “unto me” may be para-phrased as the “fulfillment of one possibility neces-sary to the achievement of the Great Work.” Everyact is a sacrament, but this pre-eminently so. Thetext continues with a plain threat: “if the ritual benot ever unto me: then expect the direful judgmentsof Ra Hoor Khuit!” To profane this sacrament ofsacraments is the most fatal of errors and offences;for it is high treason to the Great Work itself.The next verse repeats: “if the ritual be not everunto me:” and it is emphasized and fortified with athreat. The offender is no longer in free enjoymentof the caresses of the Goddess of Love; he is cast outinto the penal constraint of the merciless and ter-rible God of Chapter III.1“... Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fineapparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines andwines that foam! Also, take your fill and will oflove as ye will, ...”This refers to the technique of the art; it will beexplained later in this essay.“... with whom ye will!”This repeats what has been said already above inthe notes to AL I, 41.Verse 53 asserts the importance of this dogma.Neglect of these prescriptions has been responsiblefor the endless and intolerable agonies, the hideousand unmitigable disasters of the past.The Qabalist may note that “To me!” at the endof this verse not only repeats the adjuration, but isa Magical Seal set upon the dogma. (Verse 54 is ahint to seek the secret.)In Greek letters TO MH adds to 418; it isidentical with Abrahadabra, the cipher of the GreatWork. Meditation should lead the student to con-siderations even deeper and more fruitful........“Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law,love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; forthere are love and love. There is the dove, andthere is the serpent. Choose ye well! He, myprophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of thefortress, and the great mystery of the House ofGod.”“Beauty and strength, leaping laughter anddelicious languor, force and fire, are of us.”“I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge &Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts ofmen with drunkenness. To worship me take wineand strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet,& be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all.It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure ofinnocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy allthings of sense and rapture: fear not that any Godshall deny thee for this.”“Behold! these be grave mysteries; for thereare also of my friends who be hermits.

There is the dissolution, and eternal ecstasy inthe kisses of Nu.”These verses refer once more to the concomi-tants of the act; they indicate the adjuvants to thetechnique; and they indicate the spirit in which itshould be approached. The detached scientific atti-tude of enquiry and preparation is preliminary; theobject is to foresee hindrances, to facilitate and todirect the current: but the impulse itself is Enthusi-asm........“There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veilof the modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & thepall of death: this is none of me.

Genius is there, or is not there; nor wit norwork avail if it be absent. Yet one may maintain thatit is always there, since “Every man and everywoman is a star.” In any case only technique re-sponds to study and exercise; it has been written thatit “demands as much study as theology, and asmuch practice as billiards.” All one can do is (a) tounleash, (b) to direct, the latent genus. In countrieshostile to civilization (“horribilesque ultimosqueBrittanos”) and their colonies, past and present, thetechnique is almost non-existent; individuals whopossess it in any degree of perfection owe their pre-eminence, in almost every case, to tuition andtraining under the natives of happier and less bar-barian parts of the world. Each type of race orculture has its own especial virtues.A. Study: The student should study, bear inmind, and take to heart, such classics as the Ananga-Ranga, the Bagh-i-Muattar of Abdullah el Haji,the Kama Shastra, the Kama Sutra, the ScentedGarden of the Sheikh Nefzawi, and certain scien-tific or pseudo-scientific treatises (usually upon thedeformities of nature, or the abuses of ignorance) bynumerous authors, mostly French, German, Aus-trian, or Italian. “Energized Enthusiasm,” (TheEquinox, Vol. I, No. 9) is of palmary virtue. (LiberLXVI, Liber CCCLXX, Liber DCCCXXXI, LiberCLXXV, Liber CLVI and others, also in The Equi-nox are official publications of the A∴A∴) Thereare also various classics of the subject, helpful toassimilate the romantic and enthusiastic atmosphereproper to the practice of the Art; one may instanceCatullus, Juvenal, (especially the “Sixth Satire”),Martial, Petronius Arbiter, Apuleius, Boccaccio,Masucci, François Rabelais, de Balzac (“ContesDrôlatiques”), de Sade (Justine, Juliette, et al.),André de Nerciat, Alfred de Musset et GeorgesSand (Gamiani: ou Deux nuits d’excès), SacherMasoch (Venus in Furs), with English and Ameri-can too numerous to list, but notably the poets inHoly Orders: Swift, Sterne, Herrick, Donne andHerbert.There is also a complete literature of mysticismwhich approaches or implies this matter; but thistype of work is, for the younger student, as danger-ous as it is superficially attractive. It encourages thesense of guilt, teaches the venomous art of self-exculpation, and extols that very hypocrisy whichFreedom notably condemns.“...Tear down that lying spectre of the centu-ries:...” (AL II, 52).B. Practice. No one teacher, however gifted, canpossibly cover one hundredth part of the ground-work of this Art. The best tuition is that of trainedand consecrated experts; next, that of men andwomen of natural genius.C. Original Research. This should be basedupon the broadest possible knowledge, and thedeepest understanding of the same; and upon theresults of the scope and intensity of one’s practice.“But exceed! exceed!” (AL II, 71).......“But always unto me.” (AL I, 51)CHAPTER XVION CONCENTRATIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You wisely ask me for a special letter on Con-centration; you point out that I have implied itconstantly, but never given plain instruction.It hope I have not been so vague as to allow youto suppose that Concentration Camps are evidencethat benevolent and enlightened governments are atlast seriously concerned to educate the world toYoga; but I do agree that it cannot do great harm ifI take a dose of my own medicine, and gather intoone golden sheaf all the ripe corn of my wisdom onthis subject.For concentration does indeed unlock all doors;it lies at the heart of every practice as it is of theessence of all theory; and almost all the variousrules and regulations are aimed at securing adeptshipin this matter. All the subsidiary work — aware-ness, one-pointedness, mindfullness and the rest —is intended to train you to this.All the greetings, salutations, “Saying Will,”periodical adorations, even saying “apo pantoskakodaimonos” with a downward and outwardsweep of the arm, the eyes averted, when one sees aperson dressed in a religious (Christian) uniform:all these come under “Don’t stroke the cat thewrong way!” or, in the modern pseudo-scientificjournalese jargon “streamlining life.”Let us see if Frater Perdurabo has anything to thepoint! Of course, Part I of Book 4 is devoted to it;but there is too much, and not enough, to be usefulto us just now.What you really need is the official Instruction inThe Equinox, and the very fullest and deepestunderstanding of Eight Lectures on Yoga; butthese lectures are so infernally interesting that whenI look into the book for something to quote, itcarries me away with it. I can’t put it down, I forgetall about this letter. Rather a back-handed adver-tisement for Concentration!The best way is the hardest; to forget all this andstart from the beginning as if there had never beenanything on the subject written before.I must keep always in mind that you are assumedto know nothing whatever about Yoga and Magick,or anything else beyond what the average educatedperson may be assumed to have been taught.What is the problem? There are two.Beta: To train the mind to move with the maxi-mum speed and energy, with the utmost possibleaccuracy in the chosen direction, and with theminimum of disturbance or friction. That is Magick.Alpha: To stop the mind altogether. That isYoga.The rules, strangely enough, are identical in bothcases; at least, until your “Magick” is perfect; Yogamerely goes on a step further. In Beta you havereduced all movements from many to One; in Alphayou reduce that One to Zero.Now then, with a sigh of relief, know you this:that every possible incident in the Beta training ismutatis mutandis, perfectly familiar to the engi-neer.The material must be chosen and prepared in thekind and in the manner, best suited to the design ofthe intended machine; the various parts must be puttogether with the utmost precision; every obstacleto the function must be removed, and every sourceof error eliminated. Now cheer up, child! In the caseof a machine that he has devised and constructedhimself with every condition in his favour, he thinkshe is doing not too badly if he gets some fifteen ortwenty per cent of the calculated efficiency out ofthe instrument; and even Nature, with millions ofyears to adjust and improve, very often cannot boastof having done much better. So you have no reasonto be discouraged if success does not smile uponyou in the first week or so of your Work, starting asyou do with material of whose properties you aremiserably ignorant, with means pitifully limited,with Laws of Nature which you do not understand;in fact, with almost everything against you butindomitable Will and unconquerable courage.(I know I’m a poor contemptible Lowbrow; butI refuse to be ashamed for finding Kipling’s If andHenley’s Don’t-remember-the-title; they may notbe poetry — but they are honest food and damnedgood beer for the plebeian wayfarer. It was suchmanhood, not the left-wing high-brow Bloomsburysissies, that kept London through the blitz. Prayforgive the digression!)There is only one method to adopt in suchcircumstances as those of the Aspirant to Magickand Yoga: the method of Science. Trial and error.You must observe. That implies, first of all, thatyou must learn to observe. And you must recordyour observations. No circumstance of life is, or canbe irrelevant. “He that is not with me is against me.”In all these letters you will find only two things:either I tell you what is bad for you, or what is goodfor you. But I am not you; I don’t know every detailof your life, every trick of your thought. You mustdo ninety percent of the work for yourself. Whetherit is love, or your daily avocation, or diet, or friends,or amusement, or anything else, you must find outwhat helps you to your True Will and what hinders;cherish the one and eschew the other.I want to insist most earnestly that concentrationis not, as we nearly all of us think, a matter of gettingthings right in the practices; you must make everybreath you draw subservient to the True Will, tofertilize the soil for the practices. When you sitdown in your Asana to quiet your mind, it is mucheasier for you if your whole life has tended to"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears31relative quietude; when you knock with your Wandto announce the opening of an Invocation, it isbetter if the purpose of that ceremony has beensimmering in the background of your thought sincechildhood!Yes indeed: background!Deep down, on the very brink of the subcon-scious, are all those facts which have determinedyou to choose this your Great Work.Then, the ambition, conscious, which arrangesthe general order and disposition of your life.Lastly, the practices themselves. And my beliefis that the immense majority of failures have theirneglect to brush up their drill to thank for it.For technical advice on all these subjects, I shallrefer you to those official works mentioned in theearly part of this letter; I shall be happy if you willtake to heart what I am now so violently thrustingat you, this Middle Work of Concentration.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XVIIASTRAL JOURNEY, EXAMPLE. HOW TODO IT: HOW TO VERIFY YOUREXPERIENCESCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.There is no better way of training the memorythan the practice of the Holy Qabalah.The whole mechanism of memory depends onjoining up independent data. You must go on add-ing a little to little, always joining the simple im-pressions by referring them to others which aremore general; and so on until the whole of youruniverse is arranged like the brain and the nervoussystem. This system in fact, becomes the Universe.When you have got everything properly correlated,your central consciousness understands and con-trols every tiniest detail. But you must begin at thebeginning — you go out for a walk, and the firstthing you see is a car; that represents the Atu VII, theChariot, referred to Cancer. Then you come to afishmonger, and notice certain crustacea, very malachostomous. This comes under the same sign ofCancer. The next thing you notice is an amber-coloured dress in Swan and Edgar’s; amber also isthe colour of Cancer in the King’s Scale. Now thenyou have a set of three impressions which is joinedtogether by the fact that they all belong to theCancer class; experience will soon teach that youcan remember all three very much more clearly andaccurately than you could any one of the threesingly.You have not increased the burden on yourmemory, but diminished it.What you say about tension and eagerness andhaste is very true. See The Book of the Law,Chapter I, 44.“For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, deliv-ered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.”This, from a practical point of view, is one of themost important verses in the book.The unusual word “unassuaged” is very inter-esting. People generally suppose that “will” is theslave of purpose, that you cannot will a thingproperly unless you are aiming at a definite goal.But this is not the case. Thinking of the goalactually serves to distract the mind. In these fewwords is included the whole method without all thebombastic piety of the servile doctrine of mysticismabout the surrender of the Will. Nor is this idea ofsurrender actually correct; the will must be identi-fied with the Divine Will, so-called. One wants tobecome like a mighty flowing river, which is notconsciously aiming at the sea, and is certainly notyielding to any external influence. It is acting inconformity with the law of its own nature, with theTao. One can describe it, if necessary, as “passivelove”; but it is love (in effect) raised to its highestpotential. We come back to the same thing: whenpassion is purged of any “lust of result” it is irresist-ible; it has become “Law.” I can never understandwhy it is that mystics fail to see that their smarmydoctrine of surrender actually insists upon the dual-ity which they have set out to abolish!I certainly have no intention of “holding youdown” to “a narrow path of work” or any path. AllI can do is to help you to understand clearly the lawsof your own nature, so that you may go aheadwithout extraneous influence. It does not followthat a plan that I have found successful in my owncase will be any use to you. That is another cardinalmistake of most teachers. One must have become aMaster of the Temple to annihilate one’s ego. Mostteachers, consciously or unconsciously, try to getothers to follow in their steps. I might as well dressyou up in my cast-off clothing! (In the steps of theMaster. At the feet of the Master. Steward!)Please observe that the further you get on, thehigher your potential, the greater is the tendency toleak, or even to break the containing vessel. I canhelp you by warning you against setting up ob-stacles, real or imaginary, in your own path; whichis what most people do. It is almost laughable tothink that the Great Work consists merely in “let-ting her rip;” but Karma bumps you from one sideof the toboggan slide to the other, until you “comeinto the straight.” (There’s a chapter or two in theBook of Lies about this, but I haven’t got a copy. Imust find one, and put them in here. Yes: p. 22)“O thou that settest out upon the Path, false is thePhantom that thou seekest. When thou hast it thoushalt know all bitterness, thy teeth fixed in theSodom-Apple.“Thus hast thou been lured along that Path,whose terror else had driven thee far away.“O thou that stridest upon the middle of the Path,no phantoms mock thee. For the stride’s sake thoustridest.“Thus art thou lured along that Path, whosefascination else had driven thee far away.“O thou that drawest toward the End of ThePath, effort is no more. Faster and faster dost thoufall; thy weariness is changed into Ineffable Rest.“For there is no Thou upon that Path: thou hastbecome The Way.”As in the Yi King, the 3rd hexagram has departedfrom the original perfection, and it takes all the restof the hexagrams to put things right again. Theresult, it is true, is superior; the perfection of theoriginal has been enhanced and enriched by itsexperience.There is another way of defining the Great Work.That explains to us the whole object of manifesta-tion, of departing from the perfection of “Nothing”towards the perfection of “everything”, and onemay consider this advantage, that it is quite impos-sible to go wrong. Every experience, whatever maybe its nature, is just another necessary bump.Naturally one cannot realize this until one be-comes a Master of the Temple; consequently one isperpetually plunged in sorrow and despair. Thereis, you see, a good deal more to it than merelylearning one’s mistakes. One can never be surewhat is right and what is wrong, until one appreci-ates that “wrong” is equally “right.” Now then onegets rid of the idea of “effort” which is associatedwith “lust of result.” All that one does is to exercisepleasantly and healthfully one’s energies.It will not do to regard “man” as the “final cause”of manifestation. Please do not quote myself againstme.“Man is so infinitely small,In all these stars, determinate.Maker and master of them all,Man is so infinitely great.”The human apparatus is the best instrument ofwhich we are, at present, aware in our normalconsciousness; but when you come to experiencethe Conversation of the higher intelligences, youwill understand how imperfect are your faculties. Itis true that you can project these intelligences asparts of yourself, or you can suppose that certainhuman vehicles may be temporally employed bythem for various purposes; but these speculationstend to be idle. The important thing is to makecontact with beings, whatever their nature, who aresuperior to yourself, not merely in degree but itkind. That is to say, not merely different as a GreatDane differs from a Chihuahua, but as a buffalodiffers from either.Of course you are perfectly right about thesenses, though I would not agree to confine themeaning to the five which are common to mostpeople. There must, one might suspect, be ways ofapprehending directly such phenomena as magne-tism, electrical resistance, chemical affinity and thelike. Let me direct you once more to The Book of theLaw, Chapter II, vs. 70-72.“There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdomsays: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Benot animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drinkby the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love,exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, letthere be subtlety therein!“But exceed! exceed!“Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine— and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous! —death is the crown of all.”"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears32The mystic’s idea of deliberately stupefying andstultifying himself is an “abomination unto theLord.” This, by the way, does not conflict with therules of Yoga. That kind of suppression is compa-rable to the restrictions in athletic training, or diet insickness.Now we get back to the Qabalah — how to makeuse of it.Let us suppose that you have been making aninvocation, or shall we call it an investigation, andsuppose you want to interpret a passage of Bach. Toplay this is the principal weapon of your ceremony.In the course of your operation, you assume yourastral body and rise far above the terrestrial atmo-sphere, while the music continues softly in thebackground. You open your eyes, and find that it isnight. Dark clouds are on the horizon; but in thezenith is a crown of constellations. This light helpsyou, especially as your eyes become accustomed tothe gloom, to take in your surroundings. It is a bleakand barren landscape. Terrific mountains rim theworld. In the midst looms a cluster of blue-blackcrags. Now there appears from their recesses agigantic being. His strength, especially in his handsand in his loins, it terrifying. He suggests a combi-nation of lion, mountain goat and serpent; and youinstantly jump to the idea that this is one of the rarebeings which the Greeks called Chimaera. So for-midable is his appearance that you consider itprudent to assume an appropriate god-form. Butwho is the appropriate god? You may perhapsconsider it best, in view of your complete ignoranceas to who he is and where you are, to assume thegod-form of Harpocrates, as being good defence inany case; but of course this will not take you veryfar. If you are sufficiently curious and bold, youwill make up your mind rapidly on this point. Thisis where your daily practice of the Qabalah willcome in useful. You run through in your mind theseven sacred planets. The very first of them seemsquite consonant with what you have so far seen.Everything suits Saturn well enough. To be on thesafe side, you go through the others; but this is avery obvious case — Saturn is the only planet thatagrees with everything. The only other possibilitywill be the Moon; but there is no trace noticeable ofany of her more amiable characteristics. You willtherefore make up your mind that it is a Saturniangod-form that you need. Fortunate indeed for youthat you have practiced daily the assumption ofsuch forms! Very firmly, very steadily, very slowly,very quietly, you transform your normal astralappearance into that of Sebek. The Chimaera, rec-ognizing your divine authority, becomes less formi-dable and menacing in appearance. He may, insome way, indicate his willingness to serve you.Very good, so far; but it is of course the firstessential to make sure of his integrity. Accordinglyyou begin by asking his name. This is vital; becauseif he tells you the truth, it gives you power over him.But if, on the other hand, he tells you a lie, heabandons for good and all his fortress. He becomesrather like a submarine whose base has been de-stroyed. He may do you a lot of mischief in themeantime, of course, so look out!Well then, he tells you that his name is Ottilia.Shall we try to spell it in Greek or in Hebrew. By thesound of the name and perhaps to some extent by hisappearance one might plump for the former; butafter all the Greek Qabalah is so unsatisfactory. Wegive Hebrew the first chance — we start withhaylyei. Let us try this lettering for a start. It adds upto 135. I daresay that you don’t remember what theSepher Sephiroth tells you about the number; butas luck will have it, there is no need to inquire; for135 = 3 × 45. Three is the number, is the firstnumber of Saturn, and 45 the last. (The sum of thenumbers in the magic square of Saturn is 45.) Thatcorresponds beautifully with everything you havegot so far; but then of course you must know if heis “one of the beliving Jinn.” Briefly, is he a friendor an enemy? You accordingly say to him “Theword of the Law is Θελημα.” It turns out that hedoesn’t understand Greek at all, so you were cer-tainly right in choosing Hebrew. You put it to him,“What is the word of the Law?” and he repliesdarkly. “The word of the Law is Thora.” Thatmeans nothing to you; any one might know as muchas that, Thora being the ordinary word for theSacred Law of Israel, and you accordingly ask himto spell it to make sure you have heard aright; andhe gives you the letters, perhaps by speaking them,perhaps by showing them: Teth, Resh, Ayin. Youadd these up and get 279. This again is divisible bythe Saturnian 3, and the result is 93; in other words,he has been precisely right. On the plane of Saturnone may multiply by three and therefore he hasgiven you the correct word “Thelema” in a formunfamiliar to you. You man now consider yourselfsatisfied of his good faith, and may proceed toinspect him more closely. The stars above his headsuggest the influence of Binah, whose number alsois three, while the most striking thing about him isthe core of his being: the letter Yod. (One does notcount the termination “AH”: being a divine suffix itrepresents the inmost light and the outermost light.)This Yod, this spark of intense brilliance, is of thepale greenish gold which one sees (in this world) inthe fine gold leaf of Tibet. It glows with ever greaterintensity as you concentrate upon observing him,which you could not do while you were preoccu-pied with investigating his credentials.Confidence being thus established, you inquirewhy he as appeared to you at this time and at thisplace; and the answer to this question is of courseyour original idea, that is to say, he is presenting toyou in other terms that “mountainous Fugue” whichinvoked him. You listen to him with attention,make such enquiries as seem good to you, andrecord the proceedings.The above example is, of course, pure imagina-tion, and represents a very favourable case. You areonly too likely, and that not only at the beginning,to meet all sorts of difficulties and dangers.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XVIIITHE IMPORTANCE OF OURCONVENTIONAL GREETINGS, ETC.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.From time to time I have exhorted you with mineaccustomed matchless eloquence never to neglectthe prescribed Greetings: but I think it just as wellto collect the various considerations connected withtheir use — and in “Greetings” I include “sayingWill” before set meals, the four daily adorations ofthe Sun (Liber CC, vel Resh) and the salutation ofOur Lady the Moon. I propose to deal with thegeneral object of the combined rituals, not with thespecial virtues of each separately.The practice of Liber III vel Jugorum1 is thecomplement of these grouped customs. By sharpphysical self-chastisement when you think, say, ordo whatever it is that you have set yourself to avoiddoing, you set a sentry at the gate of your mindready to challenge all comers, and so you acquirethe habit of being on the alert. Keep this in mind, andyou will have no difficulty in following the argu-ment of this letter.When you are practicing Dharana2 concentra-tion, you allow yourself so many minutes. It is asteady, sustained effort. The mind constantlystruggles to escape control. (I hope you rememberthe sequence of “breaks.” In case you don’t, Isummarize them.(1) Immediate physical interruptions: Asanashould stop these.(2) Things that are “on your mind.”(3) Reverie, and “Wouldn’t it help if Iwere to — ?”(4) Atmospherics — e.g. voices apparently fromsome alien source.(5) Aberrations of the control itself; and theresult itself. (Remember the practice of some Hinduschools: “Not that, not that!” to whatever it is thepresents itself as Tat Sat — reality, truth).Need I remind you how urgent the wish to escapewill assuredly become, how fantastic are the mind’sdevices and excuses, amounting often to deliberaterevolt? In Kandy I broke away in a fury, and dasheddown to Colombo with the intention of painting thevery air as red as the betel-spittle on the pavements!But after three days of futile search for satisfyingdebauchery I came back to my horses, and, sureenough, it was merely that I had gone stale; therelaxation soothed and steadied me; I resumed thediscipline with redoubled energy, and Dhyanadawned before a week had elapsed.I mention this because it is the normal habit ofthe mind to organize these counter-attacks thatmakes their task so easy. What you need is a mindthat will help rather than hinder your Work by itsnormal function.This is where these Greetings, and Will-sayings,1 See Magick in Theory and Practice, pp. 427-429.2 Book 4, Part I."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears33and Adorations come in.It is not a concentration-practice proper; I haven’ta good word for it. “Background-concentration” or“long-distance-concentration” are clumsy, and nottoo accurate. It is really rather like a public schooleducation. One is not constantly “doing a betterthing than one has ever done;” one is not droppingone’s eye-glass every two minutes, or being a littlegentleman in the act of brushing one’s hair. Thepoint is that one trains oneself to react properly atany moment of surprise. It must become “secondnature” for “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofthe Law” to spring to the forefront of the mind whenone is introduced to a stranger, or comes down tobreakfast, or hears the telephone bell, or observesthe hour of the adoration, (these are to be thesuperficial reactions, like instinctively rising whena lady enters the room), or, at the other end, inmoments of immediate peril, or of sudden appre-hension, or when in one’s meditation, one approachesthe deepest strata.One need not be dogmatic about the use ofthese special words. One might choose a for-mula to represent one’s own particular TrueWill. It is a little like Cato, (or Scipio, was it?)who concluded every speech, whether aboutthe Regulations of the Roman Bath or theproposal to reclaim a marsh of the Maremma,with the words: “And moreover, in my opin-ion, Carthage ought to be destroyed.”Got it?You teach the mind to push your thoughtautomatically to the very thing from which itwas trying to wander. “Yes, I get you Stephen!... But, Uncle Dudley, come clean, do youalways do all this yourself? Don’t you some-times feel embarrassed, or fear that you maydestroy the effect of your letter, or “create ascene” in the public street when you suddenlystop and perform these incomprehensible an-tics, or simply forget about the whole thing?”Yes, I do.Peccavi.Mea culpa, mea macima culpa.I am not your old and valued friend, AdamQadmon, the Perfect Man.I am a pretty poor specimen.I am nothing to cable about to Lung Peng Choung,or Himi, or Monsalvat.I do forget now and again; though, I am glad tosay, not nearly as often as I used to do. (As the habitis acquired, it tends to strengthen itself). But oftenI deliberately omit to do my duty. I do funk it. I doresent it. I do feel that it’s too much bother.As I said above, Adam Qadman is not my middlename.Well now, have I any shadow of an excuse? Yes,I have, after a fashion; I don’t think it good mannersto force my idiosyncrasies down people’s throats,and I don’t want to appear more of an eccentric thanI need. It might detract from my personal influence,and so actually harm the Work that I am trying toperform ...“Yes, that’s all very well, Alibi Ike; you areexceedingly well know as a Scripture-quoting Sa-tan, as a Past-Master in self-justification. Trainedfrom infancy by the Plymouth Brethern, who forcasuistry leave the Jesuits at the post!” “Yes, yes,but — — —.”“You needn’t but me no buts, you old he-goat!Wasn’t there once a Jonas Hanway, the first man tosport an umbrella? Wouldn’t your practice be natu-ral, and right, and the cream of the cream of goodmanners as soon as a few hundred people of positiontook to doing it? And wouldn’t Thomas, Richard,and Henry, three months later, make a point ofdoing the same as their betters?” (That was Con-science speaking.)All right, you win.Love is the law, love under will.Yours Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XIXTHE ACT OF TRUTHCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It seems that last Wednesday I so far forgotmyself as to refer to the “Act of Truth” in conversa-tion, and never mentioned what it is when it’s athome, or why anyone should perform it, or whathappens when one does perform it!All right, I will remedy that; luckily, it is a verysimple matter; very important, perfectly paradoxi-cal and devastatingly effective.Analysed, it is to make the assumption thatsomething which seems very wrong is actually allright, that an eager wish is an accomplished fact, areasonable anxiety, entirely unfounded — and toact accordingly.For instance, I’m in some desolate place, depen-dent for my food supply on a weekly messenger. Ifhe is a day late, it is awkward; if two, it meanshardship; if three, serious risk. One is naturallyanxious as the day approaches; perhaps the weather,or some similar snag, makes it likely that he will belate. From one cause or another, I have ratherexceeded my ration. There is nothing I can do aboutit, materially.The sensible course of action is to draw inmy horns, live on the minimum necessary tolife, which involves cutting the day’s workdown to almost nothing, and hope for the best,expecting the worst.But there is a Magical mode of procedure. Yousay to yourself: I am here to do this Work inaccordance with my true Will. The Gods have gotto see to it that I’m not baulked by any blinkingmessenger. (But take care They don’t overhearyou; They might mistake it for Hybris, or presump-tion. Do it all in the Sign of Silence, under the aegisof Harpocrates, the “Lord of Defence and Protec-tion”; be careful to assume his God-form, as stand-ing on two crocodiles.) Then you increase yourconsumption, and at the same time put in a whole lotof extra Work. If you perform this “Act of Truth”properly, with genuine conviction that nothing cango wrong, your messenger will arrive a day early,and bring an extra large supply.This, let me say at once, is very difficult, espe-cially at first, until one has gained confidence in theefficacy of the Formula; and it is very nastily easyto “fake.” Going through the motions (as they say)is more futile here than in most cases, and the resultsof messing it up are commonly disastrous.1You must invent your act to suit your case, everytime; suppose you expect a cable next Friday week,transferring cash to your account. You need $500to make up an important payment, and you don’tknow whether they will send even $200. What areyou going to do about it? Skimp, and save yourexpenses, and make yourself miserable and inca-pable of vigorous thought or action? You maysucceed in saving enough to swing the deal; but youwon’t get a penny beyond the amount actuallyneeded — and look at the cost in moral grandeur!No, go and stand yourself a champagne lun-cheon, and stroll up Bond Street with an 8½ “Hoyode Monterey,” and squander $30 on some utterlyuseless bauble. Then the $500 will swell to $1000,and arrive two days early at that!There are one or two points to consider verycarefully indeed before you start: —1. The proposed Act must be absurd; it won’t doat all if by some fluke, however unlikely, it mightaccomplish your aim. For instance, it’s no usebacking an outsider. there must be no causal link.2. The Act must be one which makes the situa-tion definitely worse. E.g.: suppose you are count-ing on a new dress to make a hit at a Reception, anddoubt whether it is so much better than your presentbest, or whether it will be finished in time. Then,wear that present best to-night (wet, of course),knowing you are sure to soil it.3. Obviously, all the usual conditions of a Magi-cal Operation apply in this as in all cases; your aimmust conform with your True Will, and all that; butthere is one curious point about an Act of Truth:this, that one should resort to it only when there is noother method possible. In the explorer’s case, above,it won’t do if he has any means of hurrying up themessenger.It seems to me that the above brief sketch shouldsuffice an intelligent and imaginative student likeyourself; but if any point remains darkling, let meknow, and I will follow up with a postscript.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. — I thought it might help you if I were tomake a few experiments. I have done so. Result: thisis much more difficult and delicate an affair than Ihad thought when I wrote this letter. For instance,one single thought of a “second string” — e.g. “if itfails, I had better do so and so” — is enough to killthe whole operation stone dead. Of course, I amtotally out of practice; but, even so ......1 Do not be misled by any apparent superficialresemblance to “Christian Science” and “Coueism”and their cackling kin. They miss every essentialfeature of the formula."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears34CHAPTER XXTALISMANS: THE LAMEN: THEPANTACLECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Really you comfort me when you turn fromthose abstruse and exalted themes with which youhave belaboured me so often of late to dearcuddlesome little questions like this in our letterreceived this morning: “Do please, dear Master,give me some hints about how to make Talismans(that’s the same as Telesmata, isn’t it? Yes, 666)and the Pantacle. The official instructions are quiteclear, of course; but somehow I find them just a littlefrightening.”Well, I think I know pretty well what you mean;so I will try to imitate the style of Aunt Tabitha in“The Flapper’s Fireside.”For one thing, you forgot to mention the Lamen.Now what are these things when they are at home?That’s easy enough.The Lamen is a sort of Coat of Arms. It expressesthe character and powers of the wearer.A talisman is a storehouse of some particularkind of energy, the kind that is needed to accom-plish the task for which you have constructed it.The Pantacle is often confused with both theothers; accurately, it is a “Minutum Mundum”,“the Universe in Little”; it is a map of all that exists,arranged in the Order of Nature. There is a chapterin Book 4, Part II, devoted to it (pp. 117-129); Icannot make up my mind whether I like it. At thebest it is very far from being practical instruction.(The chapter on the Lamen, pp. 159-161, is evenworse.)An analogy, not too silly, for these three; theChess-player, the Openings, and the Game itself.But — you will object — why be silly at all?Why not say simply that the Lamen, stating as itdoes the Character and Powers of the wearer, is adynamic portrait of the individual, while thePantacle, his Universe, is a static portrait of him?And that, you pursue flatteringly, is why you pre-ferred to call the Weapon of Earth (in the Tarot) theDisk, emphasizing its continual whirling move-ment rather than the Pantacle or Coin, as is moreusual. Once again, exquisite child of our Father theArcher of Light and of seaborn Aphrodite, yourwell-known acumen has “nicked the ninety andnine and one over” as Browning says when he (hetoo!) alludes to the Tarot.As you will have gathered from the above, aTalisman is a much more restricted idea; it is nomore than one of the objects in his Pantacle, one ofthe arrows in the quiver of his Lamen. As, then, youwould expect, it is very little trouble to design. Allthat you need is to “make considerations’ aboutyour proposed operation, decide which planet, sign,element or sub-element or what not you need toaccomplish your miracle.As you know, a very great many desirable ob-jects can be attained by the use of the talismans inthe Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon the King;also in Pietro di Abano and the dubious FourthBook of Cornelius Agrippa.You must on no account attempt to use thesquares given in the Book of the Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage until you have succeeded inthe Operation. More, unless you mean to perform it,and are prepared to go to any length to do so, you area fool to have the book in your possession at all.Those squares are liable to get loose and do thingson their own initiative; and you won’t like it.The late Philip Haseltine, a young composer ofgenius, used one of these squares to get his wife toreturn to him. He engraved it neatly on his arm. Idon’t know how he proceeded to set to work; but hiswife came back all right, and a very short timeafterwards he killed himself.Then there are the Elemental Tablets of SirEdward Kelly and Dr. John Dee. From these youcan extract a square to perform almost any conceiv-able operation, if you understand the virtue of thevarious symbols which they manifest. They areactually an expansion of the Tarot. (Obviously, theTarot itself as a whole is a universal Pantacle —forgive the pleonasm! Each card, especially is thistrue of the Trumps, is a talisman; and the whole mayalso be considered as the Lamen of Mercury. It isevidently an Idea far too vast for any human mindto comprehend in its entirety. For it is “the Wisdomwhereby He created the worlds.”)The decisive advantage of this system is not thatits variety makes it so adaptable to our needs, butthat we already posses the Invocations necessary tocall forth the Energies required. What is perhapsstill more to the point, they work without putting theMagician to such severe toil and exertion as isneeded when he has to write them out from his owningenium. Yes! This is weakness on my part, and Iam very naughty to encourage you to shirk thehardest path.I used often to make the background of myTalismans of four concentric circles, painting them,the first (inmost) in the King (or Knight) scale, thesecond in the Queen, the third in the Prince, and theoutermost in the Princess scale, of the Sign, Planet,or Element to which I was devoting it. On this,preferably in the “flashing” colours, I would paintthe appropriate Names and Figures.Lastly, the Talisman may be surrounded with aband inscribed with a suitable “versicle” chosenfrom some Holy book, or devised by the Magicianto suit the case.In the British Museum (and I suppose else-where) you may see the medal struck to commemo-rate the victory over the Armada. This is a repro-duction, perhaps modified, of the Talisman used byDee to raise the storm which scattered the enemyfleet.You must lay most closely to your heart thetheory of the Magical Link (see Magick pp. 107-122) and see well to it that it rings true; for withoutthis your talisman is worse than useless. It is dan-gerous; for all that Energy is bound to expend itselfsomehow; it will make its own links with anythinghandy that takes its fancy; and you can get into anysort of the most serious kind of trouble.There is a great deal of useful stuff in Magick;pp. 92-100, and pp. 179-189. I could go on all nightdoing nothing but indicating sources of informa-tion.Then comes the question of how to “charge” theTalisman, of how to evoke or to invoke the Beingsconcerned, and of — oh! of so much that you needa lifetime merely to master the theory.Remember, too, please, what I have pointed outelsewhere, that the greatest Masters have quiteoften not been Magicians at all, technically; theyhave used such devices as Secret Societies, Slogansand Books. If you are so frivolous as to try toexclude these from our discourse, it is merely evi-dence that you have not understood a single word ofwhat I have been trying to tell you these last fewhundred years!May I close with a stray example or so? EquinoxIII, 1, has the Neophyte’s Pantacle of FraterO.I.V.V.I.O. The Fontispiece of the original (4volume) edition of Magick, the colors vilely repro-duced, is a Lamen of my own Magick, or a Pantacleof the Science, I’m sure I’m not sure which!Most of my Talismans, like my Invocations,have been poems. This letter must be like the Iliadin at least one respect: it does not end; it stops.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXIMY THEORY OF ASTROLOGYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.A few well-chosen words about Astrology?Madam, I am only too happy to oblige: our aim isto serve. The customer is usually wrong; but statis-tics indicate that it doesn’t pay to tell him so.It seems a long while since I set up your Nativity,and read it, but it is very clear in my mind that youwere astonished, as so many others have been, bythe simplicity and correctness of my reading. Itbegan, you remember, by your giving me the usualdata when we dropped in for tea at the Anglers’Rest,. I calculated the Ascendant on the spot, andremarked “Rubbish!” I looked at you again verycarefully; and, after many grunts, observed, “Morelikely half-past ten — within an hour one way or theother.” You insisted; I insisted. Unwilling to makea Fracas in the Inn, we decided to put you to thetrouble of writing to your mother to settle thedispute. Back came the answer: “within a fewminutes of eleven. I remember because your fatherhad hung on as long as he could — he had to takethe morning service.”This occurrence is very common in my experi-ence; I have contradicted what sounded like ascer-tained fact and proved on enquiry to have beenright; so, considering that the statistics I made manyyears ago showed me to have been right 109 timesout of 120, I think two things are fairly near proba-tion; firstly, I am not guessing — that doesn’tmatter much; but, secondly, which is of supreme"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears35importance, there is a definite connection betweenthe personal appearance and manner of the native,and the Sign of the Zodiac which was rising when hefirst drew air into his lungs.Let me add, to strengthen the argument, that onthe few occasions where I have erred there has beena good astrological reason for it. E.g. I might plumpfor Pisces rising when it was actually Capricornus;but in that case Saturn would have been afflicted bybeing in Cancer, with bad aspects from Venus andthe Moon, thus taking away all his rugged, male,laborious qualities, and in the Ascendant mighthave been Jupiter, suggesting many of the qualitiesof Pisces: and so forth.Now let me start! You want me to explain thesystem — or no-system! — which I use. I do not“move in a mysterious way My wonders to per-form;” for nothing could be simpler. For its originI have to thank Abramelin the Mage, who emptiesthe vials of his scorn upon the astrologers of his timewith their meticulous calculations of “the hours ofthe planets” and so on. I think he goes too far whenhe says that a planet can have no influence at all, orvery little, unless it is above the horizon; but hemeant well, bless him! And, though he does not sayso, I believe that I do my stuff in very much the sameway as he did.Modern astrologers multiply their charts untiltheir desks remind me of a Bargain Basement in therush hour! They compare and contrast until they arein bat-eyed bewilderment bemused; and when theanswer turns out absolutely false, exclaim, what ashout: “By Ptolemy, I forgot to look at the lastLuniation for Buda-Pesth!” But then they can al-ways find something or other which will explainhow they came to go wrong: naturally, when youhave several hundred factors, helplessly bound andgagged, it would be just too bad if you couldn’t pickout one to serve your turn — after the event! No,dear girl, it should be obvious to an unweaned brat:(a) they can’t see the wood for the trees, (b) they areusing Ruach on a proposition which demandsNeschamah. Intellect is quite inadequate; the prob-lem requires mother-wit, intuition, understanding.Here is my system in a Number 000 Ampoule.Put up the figure at birth: study it, make notes ofthe aspects and dignities, concentrate — and turn onthe Magical Tap!Occasionally, when I began, I set up the “pro-gressed figure” to see how the patient was doing thisweek, but it never seemed to help enough to com-pensate for the distraction caused by the complica-tion. What I do observe to examine the situation ofto-day is Transits. These I have found very reliable;but even with these I usually ignore aspects ofminor importance. Truth to tell, conjunctions meanvery much more than the rest put together.Talking of aspects, I think it ridiculous to allowvast “orbs” like 15° for Luna, and 12° for Sol.Astrologers go to extreme lengths to calculate the“solar revolution” figure not to a degree, not to aminute, but to a second: and that when they don’tknow the exact time of birth within half an hour ormore! Talk about straining at a gnat and swallow-ing a camel! Then what does an hour or so matteranyhow, if you are going to allow an aspect, whetherit is 2° or 10° off? This even with delicate aspectslike the quintile or semi-sextile. What would youthink of a doctor who had a special thermometermade to register −1/100 of a degree, and never tooknotice of the fact that the patient had just swalloweda cupful of scalding hot tea?In my own work, I disallow a deviation of 5° or6° from the exact aspect, unless there is some alienreason for thinking that it is actually operative.With the minor aspects, I dislike reckoning withthem if they are even 3° away.Nor do I see any sense in marking the oddminutes in the Ascendant, when one is not sure evenof the decan.That seems to be about all that is necessary formy “morning hate;” suppose we go on to the ques-tion of interpretation.Thousands of books have been written on As-trology; nobody could possible read them all thor-oughly, and he would be a great fool to try. But hemay do little harm by going into them far enough toobserve that hardly any half-dozen are agreed evenon the foundations of their system, hardly any twoupon the meaning of any given aspect, dignity, orposition; there is not always agreement even uponwhat questions pertain to which houses.There are a few completely quack systems, suchas those which mix up the science with Tosh-osophical hypotheses; naturally you discard these.But even of generally acceptable forms of Astrol-ogy, such as Mundane and Horary, I tend to bedistrustful. I ask, for instance, why, if Taurus rulesPoland and Ireland, as is no doubt the case, the crashand massacres of 1939 e.v. and later in the one didnot take place in the other. All the seaports of theworld naturally come under one of the three waterysigns; but we do not find that an affliction of Pisces,which hits Tunis, should do harm to all the otherharbours similarly ruled.This brings us to the first Big Jump in thesteeplechase of the whole science. We hear of thou-sands of people being killed at the same time (withinan hour or two, perhaps a minute or two) by earth-quake, shipwreck, explosion, battle or other form ofviolence. Was the horoscope of every one of thevictims marked with the probability of some suchend? I have known very strange cases of coinci-dence, but not to that extent!The answer, I believe, is manifold. It might be,for example, that Poland and Ireland are ruled bydifferent degrees of Taurus; that there are majorand minor figures, the former overruling the latter,so that the figure of the launching of the “Titanic”swallowed up the nativities of the victims of herwreck.Something of this sort is really an obvious truth.Flood in China, famine in India, pestilence any-where, evidently depend on maps of a scale far moreenormous than the personal.Then — on this point I feel reasonably sure —there may be one or more factors of which we knownothing at all, by which the basic possibilities of afigure are set to work. (Just as a car with enginerunning will not start until the clutch is put in.)I will conclude by announcing a rather remark-able position.1. I see no objection at all to postulating thatcertain “rays,” or other means of transmitting somepeculiar form or forms of energy, may reach usfrom the other parts of the solar system; for we canin fact point to perfectly analogous phenomena inthe discoveries of the last hundred years or so.But that is no more than a postulate.2. The objections to Astrology as such, indicatedby what I have already pointed out, and severalothers, would suffice to place me among the mostarrogant disbelievers in the whole study, were it notfor what follows.3. The facts with regard to the Ascendant are sopatent, so undeniable, and so inexplicable withoutthe postulate in (1), that I am utterly convinced ofthe fundamental truth of the basic principles of thescience.I said, “I will conclude”; and I meant it. For nowthat (or so I hope) you respect sufficiently myconviction that Astrology is a genuine science andnot a messy mass of Old Wives’ Tales, you willobviously demand instruction as to how to learn it,that you may verify my opinion in the light of yourown experiments.This will look much better if I put it in a separateletter.’Till then —Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXIIHOW TO LEARN THE PRACTICE OFASTROLOGYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Up guards, and at ’em!” First, you must knowyour correspondences by heart backwards and up-side down (air connu.) They are practically all inThe Book of Thoth; but “if anyone anything lacks,”look for it in 777.Then, get a book on Astrology, the older thebetter. Raphael’s Shilling Handbook is probablyenough for the present purpose. Get well into yourhead what the menu says about the natures of theplanets, the influence of the aspects, what is meantby dignities, the scope of the houses, and so on.Dovetail all this with your classical knowledge;the character and qualities, the powers and theexploits, of the several deities concerned.Next, learn how to set up a figure of the heavens.This need not take an average intelligent personmore than an hour at the most. You can learn it froma book. Lastly, get Barley’s 1001 Notable nativi-ties and More Nativites. Also any other collectionsavailable. Practice setting up the horoscopes. Usethe Chaldean square system; it shows at the firstglance what is happening in the angular houses,which are the keys of the whole figure."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears36Compare and contrast what you know of thenatives, from history, with what is said of theaspects (and the rest) in the books you have read.Put together similar horoscopes; e.g. a dozenwhich have Sagittarius rising, another lot withJupiter in the mid-heaven, and so on; see if you canfind a similarity in their lives with what the bookswill have led you to expect.Don’t be afraid to criticise; on the contrary, dosome research work on your own, and find caseswhich seem to contradict tradition.Instance: Saturn in the M.C. is said to cause aspectacular rise in a man’s career, ending in anequally notable crash. Examples: Napoleon I andIII, Oscar Wilde, Woodrow Wilson, LordNorthcliffe, Hitler. Look for figures with Saturnthus placed, whose natives have jogged along equa-bly and died in the odour of sanctity. Find out whywhat worked in some cases failed in the others.By the time you have studied (say) 500 nativitiesyou will be already a fairly competent judge. Workyour bloody guns! as Kipling says; get a friend —just this once I allow you human intercourse — toset up for you figures of historical importance, orwith some outstanding characteristic (e.g. murder-ers, champions of sport, statesmen, monsters, phi-lanthropists, heresiarchs) without telling you towhom it refers.Build up the character, profession, story fromthe nativity. It sounds incredible; but more than ascore of times I have been actually able to namehim!By the time you have got good at this game —and a most amusing game it is — you may callyourself a very competent astrologer.Sometimes, even now, you may assign the figureof the Archbishop of York to Jabez Balfour orCatherine de Medici; or mix up Moody and Sankeywith Brown and Kennedy; don’t be discouraged;perhaps there may be something to be said for youafter all!I believe, as I hope, that you will be surprised atthe speed with which you acquire proficiency.All this time, moreover, you have not beenwholly idle. You will have been running about likea demented rabbit, and trying to spot the rising signof everybody you know. Look at them full-face,then profile; and note salient characteristics, pendu-lous lips, receding chins, bulbous noses, narrowforeheads, stuck-out ears, pimples, squints, warts,shape of face (three main types; thin, jutting, forcardinal signs; square, steadfast for cherubic; weak,nondescript, for the rest); then the stature, whetherlithe, well-knit, sturdy, muscular, fat or what not; inshort every bodily feature in turn; make up yourmind what sign was rising at birth, and stick to it!Now to verify your suspicions. The conversa-tion may run thus:You: “Can you answer a question without an-swering another which you were not asked?”It, surprised: “Why, yes, of course I can.”You: “Good. Then, do you know the date of theBattle of Waterloo?”It: “1815.”You probably have to explain! In any case youbegin all over again, when he has contented himselfwith “Yes” or “No” you say “Do you know the hourof your birth?” If he says “No,” you ask if he canfind out, and so on. It he says “Yes;” “Then tell meeither the hour or the day and month; but not both.”If he gives you the hour, you calculate a bit, and say:“Then you were born on the nth of Xember, withina fortnight either way.”If he tells you his birthday, work it out as beforeand then: “You were born at P in the morning withinan hour either way.” (This makes it about 11 to 1against your being right, in either case, on purechance.)Again, you can practise this in cafés, when youvisit civilized countries, and it is often possible toscrape acquaintance with people who look spe-cially interesting, and do not, as in England, in-stantly suspect you of dishonourable advances, andget them to play up. This is sometimes easier whenyou are already with that friend which I was so laxas to allow you; and it is, I own, very helpful todiscuss strange faces if only to make it quite clear toyour own mind why you decide on one as Virgo,another as Taurus.A strange thing happened once; I had explainedall this to the girl that I happened to be living with:that is, I taught her the names of the signs; she knewno Astrology, not even the simple correspondences.After about a month, she was better at it than I was!(“Why strange?” you mutter rudely. “Quite right,my dear! I have always been a wretched reader ofcharacter. Bless my soul! there was a time when Ihad hopes of you,” I savagely retort.) She hadpicked up the knack, the trick of it; she could select,eliminate, re-compose, compare with past experi-ence, and form a judgment, without knowing thenames of its materials.When you have got your sea-legs at both theseparts of your astrological education, you may (Ithink) put out to sea with some confidence. Perhapsa fair test of your fitness would be when you gotthree people right out of four, in a total of a score orso. Well, allow for my being in a “mood” to-night;call it two out of three. If it were guesswork, afterall, that means you are bringing it off at seven toone. Obviously, when you do go wrong, set up thefigure, study it more carefully than ever, and findout what misled you.Remember constantly that the Statistical Methodis your one and only safeguard against self-decep-tion.Within the limits of a letter I could hardly hopeto go into matters much more fully or deeply than Ihave done; but ’pon my soul! I think that what Ihave said should be enough for an intelligent andassiduous student. Let me insist that all that is worthwhile comes by experience. Learning one thing willgive you the clue to another.Well do I know to my sorrow how hard it is, asa rule, to learn how to do a thing solely from writteninstruction; so perhaps you had better arrange to seeme one day about the actual setting-up of a figure.Probably, too, there will be a few points that youwould like to discuss.I will end by betting you six clothing coupons toa pound of sugar that in two years’ concentratedwork on these lines you will become a better as-trologer than ever I was. (This is very cunning ofme; in two years we shall all be getting clotheswithout coupons.)Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXIIIIMPROVISING A TEMPLECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.(This letter has been provoked by points dis-cussed in your recent visit.)As some of your daily practices are ceremonial,it should not come amiss to vouchsafe a few hints ofpractical service. For in ritual Magick, it will ofcourse be the first care to get everything balancedand tidy.If you propose to erect a regular Temple, themost precise instructions in every detail are given inBook 4, Part II. (But I haven’t so much as seen acopy for years!) There is a good deal scatteredabout in Part III (Magick, which you have) espe-cially about the four elemental weapons.But if circumstances deny you for the momentthe means of carrying out this Aedification as theIdeal would have it, you can certainly do your bestto create a fairly satisfactory — above all, workable— substitute.(By the way, note the moral aspect of a house, asdisplayed in our language. “Edification” — “house-making”: from Latin Aedes, “house”. “Economy”— “house-ruling”: from the Greek “οικος”,“House” and “νομος”, “law”.)I was often reduced to such expedients whenwandering in strange lands, camping on glaciers,and so on. I fixed it workably well. In Mexico, D.F.for instance, I took my bedroom itself for the Circle,my night-table for the Altar, my candle for theLamp; and I made the Weapons compact. I had aWand eight inches long, all precious stones andenamel, to represent the Tree of Life; within, an irontube containing quick-silver — very correct, lordly,and damsilly. What a club! Also, bought, a silver-gilt Cup; for Air and Earth I made one sachet ofrose-petals in yellow silk, and another in green silkpacked with salt. In the wilds it was easy, agreeableand most efficacious to make a Circle, and build analtar, of stones; my Alpine Lantern served admira-bly for the Lamp. It did double duty when required:e.g. in partaking of the Sacrament of the FourElements, it served for Fire. But your conditions arenot so restricted as this.Let us consider what one can do with an ordinaryhouse, such as you are happy enough to possess.First of all, it is of immense advantage to have aroom specially consecrated to the Work, never usedfor any other purpose, and never entered by anyother person than yourself, unless it were another"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears37Initiate, either for inspection or in case you wereworking together.The aura accumulates with the regularity andfrequency of Use.The first point is the Banishing: Everything is tobe removed from the room which is not absolutelynecessary to the Work.In this country, one must attend to the heating.An electric stove in the East or the South, is best: itmust not need attention. One can usually buy stoveswith excellent appropriate symbolism. (Last time Idid this — 13 e.v. — I got a perfect Ferranti atHarrods. The circular copper bowl, with the centralDisk as the source of heat, is unsurpassable.) Thewalls should be “self-coloured,” a neutral tint —green, grey or blue-grey? and entirely bare, unlessyou put up, in the proper quarters, the properdesigns, such as the “Watch Towers” — see TheEquinox I, 7.Remember that your “East,” your Kiblah, isBoleskine House, which is as near as possible dueNorth from Plymouth. Find North by the shadow ofa vertical rod at noon, or by the Pole-Star. Work outthe angle as usual.The Stélé of Revealing may be just on the N.Wall to make your “East.”Next, your Circle. The floor ought to be “Earth”green; but white will serve, or black. (A Masoniccarpet is not at all bad.) The Circle itself should beas shown in Book 4, Part II; but as this volume isprobably unavailable, ask me to show you the largepainted diagram in my portfolio when next you visitme, and we can arrange for it to be copied.This should then be painted in the correct colourson the floor: the Kether Square to the North, your“East.”The Altar must fit exactly the square of Tiphareth;it is best made as a cupboard; of oak or acacia, bypreference. It can then be used to hold reserves ofincense and other requisites.Note that the height of the Altar has to suit yourconvenience. It is consequently in direct relationwith your own stature; in proportion, it is a doublecube. This then determines the size of your circle; infact the entire apparatus and furniture is a geometri-cal function of yourself. Consider it all as a projec-tion of yourself in terms of these conventionalformulae. (A convention does really mean “thatwhich is convenient.” How abject, then to obey aself-styled convention which is actually as inconve-nient as possible!)Next, the Lamp. This may be of silver, or silver-gilt, (to represent the Path of Gimel) and is to behung from the ceiling exactly above the centre of thealtar. There are plenty of old church lamps whichserve very well. The light is to be from a wick in afloating cork in a glass of olive oil. (I hope you canget it!) It is really desirable to make this as near the“Ever-burning Lamp of the Rosicrucians” as pos-sible; it is not a drawback that this implies frequentattention.Now for the Weapons!The Wand. Let this be simple, straight and slim!Have you an Almond or Witch Hazel in yourgarden — or do I call it park? If so, cut (with themagick knife — I would lend you mine) a bough, asnearly straight as possible, about two feet long. Peelit, rub it constantly with Oil of Abramelin (this, andhis incense, from Wallis and Co., 26 New CavendishStreet, W.1) and keep wrapped in scarlet silk,constantly, I wrote, and meant it; rub it, whensaying your mantra, to the rhythm of that same.(Remember, “A ka dua” is the best; ask me to intoneit to you when you next visit me.)The Cup. There are plenty of chalices to bebought. It should be of silver. If ornamented, thebest form is that of the apple. I have seen suitablecups in many shops.The Sword. The ideal form is shown in the Aceof Swords in the Tarot. At all events, let the blade bestraight, and the hilt a simple cross. (The 32°Masonic Sword is not too bad; Kenning or Spencerin Great Queen Street, W.C.2 stock them — or usedto do.)The Disk. This ought to be of pure gold, withyour own Pantacle, designed by yourself after pro-longed study, graved thereupon. While getting readyfor this any plain circle of gold will have to serveyour turn. Quite flat, of course. If you want a goodsimple design to go on interim, try the Rosy Crossor the Unicursal Hexagram.So much for the Weapons! Now, as to yourpersonal accoutrements, Robe, Lamen, Sandals andthe like, The Book of the Law has most thoughtfullysimplified matters for us. “I charge you earnestly tocome before me in a single robe, and covered witha rich headdress.” (AL I, 61.) The Robe may well bein the form of the Tau Cross; i.e. expanding fromaxilla to ankle, and from shoulder to — whateveryou call the place where your hands come out.(Shape well shown in the illustration Magick face p.360). You being a Probationer, plain black is cor-rect; and the Unicursal Hexagram might be embroi-dered, or “applique” (is it? I mean “stuck on”),upon the breast. The best head-dress is the Nemyss:I cannot trust myself to describe how to make one,but there are any number of models in the BritishMuseum, or in any Illustrated Hieroglyphic text.The Sphinx wears one, and there is a photograph,showing the shape and structure very clearly, in theEquinox I, 1, frontispiece to Supplement. You caneasily make one yourself out of silk; broad black-and-white stripes is a pleasing design. Avoid “artis-tic” complexities.Well, that ought to be enough to keep you out ofmischief for a little while; but I feel moved to add aline of caution and encouragement.Listen!Faites attention!Achtung!Khabardar karo!Just as soon as you start seriously to prepare aplace for magical Work, the world goes more cock-eyed than it is already. Don’t be surprised if youfind that six weeks’ intense shopping all over Lon-don fails to provide you with some simple requisitethat normally you could buy in ten minutes. Per-haps your fires simply refuse to burn, even whenliberally dosed with petrol and phosphorus, with ahandful of Chlorate of Potash thrown in just to showthere is no ill feeling! When you have almostdecided that you had better make up your mind todo without something that seems really quite unob-tainable — say, a sixty-carat diamond which wouldlook so well on the head-dress — a perfect strangercomes along and makes you a present of one. Or, along series of quite unreasonable obstacles or sillyaccidents interfere with your plans: or, the worstdifficulty in your way is incomprehensibly removedby some extraordinary “freak of chance.” Or, ...In a word, you seem to have strolled into a worldwhere — well, it might be going too far to say thatthe Law of Cause and Effect is suspended; but atleast the Law of Probability seems to be playingpractical jokes on you.This means that your manoeuvres have some-how attracted the notice of the Astral Plane: yournew neighbours (May I call them?) are taking aninterest in the latest Tenderfoot, some to welcome,to do all they can to help you to settle down, othersindignant or apprehensive at this disturbance ofroutine. This is where your Banishings and Invoca-tions come to the rescue. Of course, I am not herereferring to the approach to Sanctuaries which ofnecessity are closely guarded, but merely to therecognition of a new-comer to that part of the worldin general.Of course all these miracles are very naughty ofyou; they mean that your magical power has sprunga few small leaks; at least, the water is oozingbetween some planks not sealed as Hermetically asthey should be. But oh and this is naughtier still —it is a blessed, blessed comfort that they happen, thatchance, coincidence and all the rest will simply notexplain it all away, that your new vision of life is nota dream, but part and parcel of Experience forevermore, as real as any other manifestation ofReality through sense such as is common to all men.And this brings us — it has been a long wayround — from the suggestion of your visit to thequestion (hitherto unanswered) in your letter.You raise so vast and razor-edged a questionwhen you write of the supposed antinomy of “soul”and “sense” that it seemed better to withhold com-ment until this later letter; much meditation wasmost needful to compress the answer within reason-able limits; even to give it form at all is no easymatter. For this is probably the symptom of theearliest stirring of the mind of the cave-man toreflection, thereunto moved by other symptoms —those of the morning after following upon the nightbefore. It is — have we not already dealt with thatmatter after a fashion? — evidence of disease whenan organ become aware of its own modes of motion.Certainly the mere fact of questioning Life bearswitness to some interruption of its flow, just as aripple on an even stream tells of a rock submerged.The fiercer the torrent and the bigger the obstacle,the greater the disturbance to the surface — have I"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears38not seen them in the Bralduh eight feet high?Lethargic folk with no wild impulse of Will mayget through Life in bovine apathy; we may well notethat (in a sense) the rage of the water seems to ourperturbed imagining actually to increase and mul-tiply the obstructions; there is a critical point be-yond which the ripples fight each other!That, in short, is a picture of you!You have mistaken the flurry of passing oversome actual snag for a snag in itself! You put theblame on to your own quite rational attempts toovercome difficulties. The secret of the trick ofgetting past the rocks is elasticity; yet it is that veryquality with which you reproach yourself!We even, at the worst, reach the state for whichBuddhism, in the East presents most ably the case:as in the West, does James Thomson (B.V.) in TheCity of Dreadful Night; we come to wish for — or,more truly to think that we wish for “blest Nirvana’ssinless stainless Peace” (or some such twaddle —thank God I can’t recall Arnold’s mawkish andunmanly phrase!) and B.V.’s “Dateless oblivionand divine repose.”I insist on the “think that you wish,” because, ifthe real You did really wish the real That, you couldnever have come to exist at all! (“But I don’t exist.”— “I know — let’s get on!”)Note, please, how sophistically unconvincingare the Buddhist theories of how we ever got intothis mess. First cause: Ignorance. Way out, then,knowledge. O.K., that implies a knower, a thingknown — and so on and so forth, through all theThree Waste Paper Baskets of the Law; analysed, itturns out to be nonsense all dolled up to look likethinking. And there is no genuine explanation of theorigin of the Will to be.How different, how simple, how self-evident, isthe doctrine of The Book of the Law!There are any number of passages dealing withthis matter in my writings: let’s forget them, andkeep to the Text!Cap. I, v. 26 “... my ecstasy, the consciousness ofthe continuity of existence, the omnipresence of mybody.”V. 30 “This is the creation of the world, that thepain of division is as nothing, and the joy of disso-lution all.” (There is a Qabalistic inner meaning inthis text; “the pain,” for instance, ΟΑΛΓΟΣ, maybe read XVII × 22 “the expression of Star-love,”and so on: all too complicated for this time andplace!)V. 32. “Then the joys of my love” (i.e. thefulfillment of all possible experiences) “will re-deem ye from all pain.”V. 58. “I give unimaginable joys on earth: cer-tainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace1unutterable, rest, ecstasy; ...”Cap. II, v. 9 “Remember all ye that existence ispure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows;they pass & are done; but there is that whichremains.”(The continuation is amusing! vv. 10 and 11read:“O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writ-ing. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I amstronger.”At that time I was a hard-shell Buddhist, sent outa New Year’s Card “wishing you a speedy termina-tion of existence!” And this as a young man, withthe world at my feet. It only goes to show .....)Vv. 19, 20. “Is a God to live in a dog? No! butthe highest are of us.... Beauty and strength, leapinglaughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are ofus.”This chapter returns over and over again to thistheme in one form or another.What is really more significant is the hidden, theunexpressed, soul of the Book; the way in which itleaps into wild spate of rhapsody on any excuse orno excuse.This is surely more convincing than some drearythesis plodding along doggedly with the “proof” (!)that “God is good,” every sentence creaking withyour chalk-stones and squeaking with the twingesof your toe!Yet just because I proclaim a doctrine of joy inthe language of joy, people — dull camels — say Iam not “serious.”Yet I have found pleasure in harnessing thewinged horses of the Sun to the ploughshare ofReason, in showing the validity of this doctrine indetail. It satisfies my sense of rhythm and of symme-try to explain that every experience, no matter what,must of necessity be a gain of grandeur, of grip, ofcomprehension and enjoyment ever growing ascomplexity and simplicity succeed each other insublime systole and diastole, in strophe andantistrope chanting against each other to the stars ofthe Night and of the Morning!Of course it is easy as pie to knock all this topieces by “lunatic logic,” saying: “Then toothacheis really as pleasant as strawberry shortcake:” Youare hereby referred to Eight Lectures of Yoga.None of the terms I am using have been, or can bedefined. All my propositions amount to no morethan tautology: A is A. You may even quote TheBook of the Law itself: “Now a curse upon Becauseand his kin! .... Enough of Because! Be he damnedfor a dog!” (AL II, 28-33). These things stink ofIgnoratio Elenchi, or something painfully like it: asort of slipping up a cog, of “confusing the planes”of willfully misunderstanding the gist of an argu-ment. (All magicians, by the way, ought to begrounded solidly in Formal Logic.)Never forget, at the least, how simple it is tomake a maniac’s hell-broth of any proposition,however plain to common sense.All the above, now: — Buddhism refuted. Yet itis a possibility and therefore one facet of Truth.“Rest” is an idea: so immobility is one of themoving states. A certain state of mind is (almost bydefinition) “eternal,” yet it most assuredly beginsand ends.And so on for ever — I fear it would be nugatory,pleonastic (and oh! several other lovely long adjec-tives!) to try to guard you from these hydra-headedand protean booby-traps; you must tackle themyourself as they arise, and deal with them as bestyou can: always remembering that often enoughyou cannot tell which is you and which is theMonkey Puzzle, or who has won. (“Everybody’swon; so everybody must have a prize” appliesbeautifully.) And none of it all matters a row ofharicots verts sautés; for the conclusion must al-ways be Doubt (see that beastly Book of Lies again— there’s a gorgeous chapter about it) and thepractical moral is this: these contradictions don’toccur (or don’t matter) in Neschamah.Also, it might help you quite a lot (by encourag-ing you when depressed, or amusing you when youwant to relax) to read Sir Palamede the Saracen;Supplement to The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 4. I expectquite a few of his tragi-comic misadventures will bealready familiar to you in one disguise or another.And if the above remarks should embolden youto exclaim: “Perhaps a little drink would do me nogreat harm” I shall feel that I have deserved well ofmy country!For — see Liber Aleph, after Rabelais — theWord of the Last Oracle is TRINC........This plaint of yours tails off — and perks up inso doing — with confession of Ambition, and con-siderations of what you must leave over to your nextlife. Very right! but all that is covered by yourgeneral programme. It is proper to assimilate theseideas with the fundamental structure of your mind:“Perhaps I had better leave ‘The Life and opinion ofBattling Bill, the Ballarat Bruiser’ till, shall we say,six incarnations ahead” — But perhaps you haveacquired that already.No, better still, concentrate on the Next Step!After all, it is the only one you can take, isn’t it!Without lust of result, please!And I shall leave anything else to the next letter.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. “Next letter,” yes, they are running into oneanother more than somewhat; it is better so, for lifeis like that. And we have the bold bad editor to sortthem out.CHAPTER XXIVNECROMANCY AND SPIRITISMCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Really, you make me ashamed of You! To writeto ignorant me to wise you up about necromancy,when you have at your elbow the one supremeclassic — Lévi’s Chapter XIII in the Dogme etRituel!2What sublimity of approach! What ingenuity of“considerations!” With what fatally sure steps1 “Peace”: the glow of satisfaction at achieve-ment. It is not “eternal,” rather, it whets the appetitefor another adventure. (Peace, η ειρηνη = 189 = 7× 9 × 13 the Venusian plus Lunar form of Unity.)2 Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, by EliphasLévi."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears39marches his preparation! With what superb tech-nique does he carry out his energized enthusiasm!And, finally, with what exact judicial righteousnessdoes he sum the results of his great Evocation ofApollonius of Tyana!Contrast with this elaborate care, rightness ofevery detail, earnestness and intentness upon thegoal — contrast, I say, the modern Spiritist in thedingy squalor of her foul back street in her suburbanslum, the room musty, smelling of stale food, thehideous prints, the cheap and rickety furniture,calling up any one required from Jesus Christ toQueen Victoria, all at a bob-a-nob!Faugh! Let us return to clean air, and analyseLévi’s experiment; I believe that by the applicationof the principles set forth in my other letters onDeath and Reincarnation, it will be simple to ex-plain his partial failure to evoke Apollonius. Youhad better read them over again, to have the matterclear and fresh in your mind.Now then, let me call your attention to theextreme care which Lévi took to construct a properMagical Link between himself and the AncientMaster. Alas! It was rather a case of building withbricks made without straw; he had not at his com-mand any fresh and vital object pertaining inti-mately to Apollonius. A “relic” would have beenimmensely helpful, especially if it had been conse-crated and re-consecrated through the centuries bydevout veneration. This, incidentally, is the greatadvantage that one may often obtain when invokingGods; their images, constantly revered, nourishedby continual sacrifice, serve as a receptacle for thePrana driven into them by thousands or millions ofworshippers. In fact, such idols are often alreadyconsecrated talismans; and their possession anddaily use is at least two-thirds of the battle.Apollonius was indeed as refractory a subject asLévi could possibly have chosen. All the cards wereagainst him.Why? Let me remind you of the sublimity of theman’s genius, and the extent of his attainment.Apollonius must certainly have made the closestlinks between his Ruach and his Supernal Triad,and this would have gone seeking a new incarnationelsewhere. All the available Ruach left floatingaround in the Akasha must have been compara-tively worthless odds and ends, true Qlipoth or“Shells of the Dead” — just those parts of him, in aword, which Apollonius would have deliberatelydiscarded at his death. So what use would they be toLévi? Even if there were among them a few suchelements as would serve his purpose, they wouldhave been devitalized and frittered away by themere lapse of the centuries, since they had lostconnection with the reality of the Sage. Alterna-tively, they might have been caught up and adoptedby some wandering Entity, quite probably somemalignant demon.Qliphoth — Shells of the Dead — ObsessingSpirits! Here we are back in the pestilent purlieus ofWalham Green, and the frowsty atmosphere of thefrowsy “medium” and the squalid séance. “Look!but do not speak to them!” as Virgil warned Dante.So let us look.No! Let us first congratulate ourselves that thissubject of Necromancy is so admirably documented.As to the real Art, we have not only Eliphas Lévi,but the sublimely simple account in the Old Testa-ment of the Witch of Endor, her conjuring up of theapparition of Samuel to King Saul. A third classicmust not be neglected: I have heard or read the storyelsewhere — for the moment I cannot place it. Butit is so brilliantly told in I Write as I Please byWalter Duranty that nothing could be happier thanto quote him verbatim.“It was the story of a Bolshevik who conversedwith a corpse. He told it to me himself, and undoubt-edly believed it, although he was an average toughBolshevik who naturally disbelieved in Heavenand Hell and a Life beyond the Grave. This manwas doing ‘underground’ revolutionary work in St.Petersburg when the War broke out; but he wascaught by the police and exiled to the far north ofSiberia. In the second winter of the War he escapedfrom his prison camp and reached an Eskimo vil-lage where they gave him shelter until the spring.They lived, he said, in beastly conditions, and theonly one whom he could talk to was the Shaman, ormedicine man, who knew a little Russian. TheShaman once boasted that he could foretell thefuture, which my Bolshevik friend ridiculed. Thenext day the Shaman took him to a cave in the sideof a hill in which there was a big transparent blockof ice enclosing the naked body of a man — a whiteman, not a native — apparently about thirty yearsof age with no sign of a wound anywhere. Theman’s head, which was clean-shaven, was outsidethe block of ice; the eyes were closed and thefeatures were European. The shaman then lit a fireand burnt some leaves, threw powder on themmuttering incantations, and there was a heavy aro-matic smoke. He said in Russian to the bolshevik,‘Ask what you want to know.’ The Bolshevikspoke in German; he was sure that the Shamanknew no German, but he was equally sure he sawthe lips move and heard it answer, clearly, in Ger-man. He asked what would happen to Russia, andwhat would happen to him. From the moving lips ofthe corpse came the reply that Russia would bedefeated in war and that there would be a revolu-tion; the Tzar would be captured by his enemies andkilled on the eve of rescue; he, the Bolshevik, wouldfight in the Revolution but would suffer no harm;later, he would be wounded fighting a foreignenemy, but would recover and live long.”“The Bolshevik did not really believe what hehad seen although he was certain that he had seen it.I mean that he explained it by hypnotism or auto-suggestion or something of the kind; but it was true,he said, that he passed unscathed through the Revo-lution and the Civil War and was wounded in thePolish War when the Red Army recovered Kiev.”So also we are most fortunate in possessing theaccount almost beyond Heart’s desire of Spiritism,in Robert Browning’s Mr. Sludge the Medium.You see that I write “Spiritism” not “Spiritualism.”To use the latter word in this connection is vulgarignorance; it denotes a system of philosophy whichflourished (more or less) is the Middle Ages — readyour Erdmann if you want the gruesome details.But why should you?The model for Mr. Sludge was David Dunbar (?Douglas) Home, who was really quite a distin-guished person in his way, and succeeded in pullingsome remarkably instructed and blue-blooded legs.Personally, I believe him to have been genuine,getting real results through pacts with elementals,demons or what not; for when he was in Paris,arrangements were made for him to meet EliphasLévi; forthwith “he abandoned the unequal contest,and fled in terror from the accursed spot.”What annoyed Browning was that he had addedto his collection of “Femora I have pulled”, thoseappendages of Elizabeth Barrett; and where R.B.was there was no room for anyone else — as in thecase of Allah!R.B. was accordingly as spiteful as he could be,and that was not a little. It is not fair to tar allmediums with the Sludge brush; there are manywho could advance quite sincerely some of theapologia of Sludge. Why should a medium beimmune to self-deception spurred by the Wish-Fiend? While there are people walking about out-side the Bug-house who can find Mrs. Simpson andGenerals de Gaulle, Franco, Allenby, Montgomeryand who else in the “Centuries” of Nostradamus,we should be stupid to assign everything to con-scious fraud.In that case what about poor Tiny Aleister? Doplease allow me the happy young Eagles of the OldTestament; what clearer prophecy of psychoanaly-sis, it’s only the English for Freud and Jung andAdler!No, by no means always fraud. Yet at any séancethe “investigators” take no magical precautionssoever — against, say, the impersonation of Iophielby Hismael, or the Doves of Venus by the A’arabZareq. All they attempt especially at “demonstra-tions” and “materializations,” is to guard with greatelaboration and (as a rule) complete futility againstthe deceptions of the common conjuror. They arenot expecting any genuine manifestation of the“Spirit World;” and this fact makes clear their truesubconscious attitude.As for those mediums who possess magicalability, they almost always come from the mostignorant classes — Celts are an exception to thisrule — and have no knowledge whatever of thetechnique of the business. Worse, they are usuallyof the type that delights in the secret dirty affinities,and so naturally and gladly attract entities of theQliphothic world to their magical circle. Hencetricksters, of the lowest elemental orders, at the best,come and vitalize odds and ends of the Ruach ofpeople recently deceased, and perform astonishingimpersonations. The hollow shells glow with infer-nal fire. Also, of course, they soak up vitality fromthe sitters, and from the medium herself."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears40Altogether, a most poisonous performance. Andwhat do they get out of it? Even when the “Spirits”are really spirits, they only stuff the party up with alot of trashy lies.To this summary the Laws of Probability insistthat there shall be occasional exceptions.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXVFASCINATIONS, INVISIBILITY,LEVITATION, TRANSMUTATIONS,KINKS IN TIMECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Dear me! dear me! The world’s indeed gonetopsy-turvy if you have to ask me for the secrets ofFascination! Altogether tohu-bohu and the TemurahThash raq!So much for a display of Old-World CourtlyManners; actually rubbish, for you might very wellbe fascinating without knowing how you workedthe trick. In fact, I think that is the case ninety-ninetimes in a hundred.Besides, I read your letter carelessly; I over-looked the phrase in which you mention that youuse the word as Lévi did; i.e. to cover all those typesof “miracle” which depend on distracting the atten-tion of, or otherwise composing, the miraclee — Iinvent a rather useful word, yes?So let us see what sort of miracles those are.To start with, I doubt if we can. Many of suchthaumaturgic phenomena contain elements of illu-sion in greater or less degree; if the miraclee’s mindis 100% responsible, I think the business becomesa mere conjuring trick.My dictionary defines the verb: “to charm, toenchant; to act on by some irresistible influence; tocaptivate; to excite and allure irresistibly or power-fully.”For the noun it gets even deeper into technicalMagic: “the act or power of fascinating or spellbinding, often to one’s harm; a mysterious, irresist-ible, alluring influence.” (Personally, I have alwaysused, or heard, it much less seriously: “attractive”hardly more.) Skeat, surprisingly, is almost dumb:p. part. of “to enchant” and “from L. fascinum, aspell.”Yes, surprisingly; for the word is one of the manythat means the Phallus. The implication is that thereis some sexual element in the exciting and alluringquality, which lifts it altogether above mere “pleas-ing.”To my mind the implication is that there is somequality inherent which is cognate to that too totallyirrational quasimagnetic force which has been re-sponsible not only for innumerable personal trag-edies — and comedies — but for the fall of dynas-ties and even the wreck of Empires.“Christ” is reported as having said: “If I be liftedup from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.”Interpret this in the light of the Cross as a Phallicemblem, and — how lurid a flash!Compare AL II, 26. “I am the secret Serpentcoiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. IfI lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droopdown mine head, and shoot forth venom, then israpture of the earth, and I and the earth are one.”This versicle is deep, devilish deep; and it ischock-a-block with the mysteries of Fascination.Dig into this, dear sister! dig with your Qabalistictrowel; don’t blame me if you don’t get a Mandrakewith the very first thrust!But most certainly I shall say nothing here. Yes,indeed, nothing was ever more sternly forbiddenthan prattle on subjects like this! Look! It goes righton: “There is great danger in me; for who doth notunderstand these runes shall make a great miss. Heshall fall down into the pit called Because, and therehe shall perish with the dogs of Reason.” (v. 27.)The pit is of course the Abyss: see The Vision andthe Voice, Xth Aethyr. A very sticky — or rather,unstuck! finish; so ’ware Hawk!To business! Fascination No! Invisibility, isobviously penny plain S.A. This is notably an affairof the subconscious; it often masters open dislikeand distaste; it never yields to reason. It destroys allsense of values. Its origin is usually obscure. Theleast irrational base of it is the sense of smell. It was,if I remember rightly, the Comte de St. Germainwho advised Loise de la Vallière to fix her exquis-itely broidered kerchief in such wise that it pro-tected her from contact with her saddle, and then,after a morning’s hard gallop, to find an excuse forusing it to wipe the brows of the perspiring king. Ittook him years to recover! The story is well known,and the plan widely adopted with remarkably un-varying success. But be careful not to overdo it; forif the source of the perfume is recognized the con-sciousness takes charge, and the result is antipathy.Many years ago I composed a scent based onsimilar principles, which I intended to market underthe title “Potted Sex Appeal.” We tried it out withthe assistance of a certain noble Marquess, whoseconsequent misadventures — won’t he laugh whenhe reads this!But there are other senses: “l’amour de l’oreille”may refer not only to Othello’s way of snaringDesdemona, but subtleties of timbre in the voice...Yes, yes, you say impatiently, but there isn’t anymiracle about all this in the ordinary sense of theword.True, but why the devil do you want me, so longas you’re getting what you need? Just being child-like, I suppose! No? Merely that you can explainsuch matters to yourself well enough. All right; onto No. 2. Shall we look at levitation for a change?This power — if it be one — is very curiousindeed. It connects more directly with magnetismthan almost any other. The first thing we think ofwhen someone says “magnet” is picking up ironfilings as a child.Age before honesty! Let Father Poulain S.J.speak first! He is obliged to admit the phenomenon,because the Church has done so. But preciselysimilar accounts of the levitation of pagans andheretics must be according to him, lies, or Works ofthe Devil. As for the method, “God employs theangels to raise the saint, so as to avoid the necessityof intervening Himself.” Lazy old parishioner!Now for a douche of common sense. Hatha-Yoga is quite clear and simple, even logical, aboutit. The method is plain Pranayama. Didn’t I tell youone time of the Four Stages of Success? 1. Perspi-ration — of a very special kind. 2. Sukshma-Khumbakam: automatic rigidity. One stiffens likea dog in a bell-jar when you pump in CarbonDioxide (is it?) 3. The Bhuchari-Siddhi, “jumpingabout like a frog.” One is wafted, without one’sAsana being disturbed, about the floor, rather asfragments of paper, or dry leaves, might be in aslight draught under the door. 4. If one is quiteperfectly balanced one cannot be moved sideways;so one rises. And there you are!Personally, I reached the Bhuchari-Siddhi quitea number of times; but I never observed No. 4. Onseveral occasions other people have seen me levi-tated, though never to a height of more than a footor so. Here is the best account of such an incident,of those at my immediate disposal.“Nearly midnight. At this moment we stoppeddictating, and began to converse. Then Fra. P. said:‘Oh, if I could only dictate a book like the Tao TehKing!’ Then he close his eyes as if meditating. Justbefore I had noticed a change in his face, mostextraordinary, as if he were no longer the sameperson; in fact, in the ten minutes we were talking heseemed to be any number of different people. Iespecially noticed the pupils of his eyes were soenlarged that the entire eye seemed black. (I trembleso and have such a quaking feeling inside, simply inthinking of last night, that I can’t form letters). Thenquite slowly the entire room filled with a thickyellow light (deep golden, but not brilliant. I meannot dazzling, but soft.) Fra. P. Looked like a personI had never seen but seemed to know quite well —his face, clothes and all were of the same yellow. Iwas so disturbed that I looked up to the ceiling to seewhat caused the light, but could only see the candles.Then the chair on which he sat seemed to rise; it waslike a throne, and he seemed to be either dead orsleeping; but it was certainly no longer Fra. P. Thisfrightened me, and I tried to understand by lookinground the room; when I looked back the chair wasraised, and he was still the same. I realized I wasalone; and thinking he was dead or gone — or someother terrible thing — I lost consciousness.”This discourse has been thus left unfinished: butit is only necessary to add that the capacity to extractsuch spiritual honey from these unpromising flow-ers is the mark of an adept who has perfected hisMagick Cup. This method of Qabalistic exegesis isone of he best ways of exalting the reason to thehigher consciousness. Evidently it started Fra. P. sothat in a moment he become completely concen-trated and entranced.Note that this has nothing at all to do with anyPranayama. It seems a matter of ecstatic concentra-tion, which chose this mode of expression instead ofbringing on Samadhi — though that, too, occurred"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears41in some of the cases.By the way, there is a fairly full account of thewhole business; I have just remembered — it is inmy Autohagiography.“Pranayama produced, firstly, a peculiar kind ofperspiration; secondly, an automatic rigidity of themuscles; and thirdly, the very curious phenomenonof causing the body, while still absolutely rigid, totake little hops in various directions. It seems as ifone were somehow raised, possibly an inch from theground, and deposited very gently a short distanceaway.“I saw a very striking case of this at Kandy.When Allan was meditating, it was my duty to bringhis food very quietly (from time to time) into theroom adjoining that where he was working. Oneday he missed two successive meals, and I thoughtI ought to look into his room to see if all was well.I must explain that I have known only two Euro-pean women and three European men who could sitin the attitude called Padmasana, which is thatusually seen in seated images of the Buddha. Ofthese men, Allan was one. He could knot his legs sowell that, putting his hands on the ground, he couldswing his body to and fro in the air between them.When I looked into his room I found him not seatedon his meditation mat, which was in the centre of theroom at the end farthest from the window, but in adistant corner ten or twelve feet off, still in hisknotted position, resting on his head and rightshoulder, exactly like an image overturned. I sethim right way up, and he came out of his trance. Hewas quite unconscious that anything unusual hadhappened. But he had evidently been thrown thereby the mysterious forces generated by Pranayama.“There is no doubt whatever about this phenom-enon; it is quite common. But the Yogis claim thatthe lateral motion is due to lack of balance, and thatif one were in perfect spiritual equilibrium onewould rise directly in the air. I have never seen anycase of levitation, and hesitate to say that it hashappened to me, though I have actually been seenby others, on several occasions, apparently poisedin the air. For the first three phenomena I have foundno difficulty in devising quite simple physiologicalexplanations. But I can form no theory as to how thepractice could counteract the force of gravitation,and I am unregenerate enough to allow this to makeme sceptical about the occurrence of levitation.Yet, after all, the stars are suspended in space. Thereis no à priori reason why the forces which preventthem rushing together should not come into opera-tion in respect of the earth and the body.”The Allan part of this is the best evidence at mydisposal. He couldn’t have got where he did byhopping, and he couldn’t have got into that positionintentionally; he must have been levitated, lostbalance, and dropped upside down. In any case,there is no trace of fascination about it, as there mayhave been in Soror Virakam’s observation.About invisibility, now? Of this I have so muchexperience that the merest outline could take us farbeyond the limits of a letter. In Mexico D.F., Iworked at acquiring the power by means of ritual.I worked desperately hard. I got to the point wheremy image in a pier-glass flickered, rather like thevery earliest films did. Possibly more work, aftermore skill had come to me, might have done thewhole trick. But I did not persist when I found outhow to do it by fascination. (Here we are at last!)Roughly, this is how to do it. If one is concen-trated to the point when what you are thinking of isthe only reality in the Universe, when you lose allawareness of who and where you are and what youare doing, it seems as though that unconsciousnesswere in some way contagious. The people aroundyou just can’t see anybody.At one time, in Sicily, this happened nearly everyday. Our party, strolling down to our bathing bay— the loveliest spot of its kind that I have ever seen— over a hillside where there wasn’t cover for arabbit, would lose sight of me, look, and fail to findme, though I was walking in their midst. At first,astonishment, bewilderment; at last, so normal hadit become: “He’s invisible again.”One incident I remember very vividly indeed; anold friend and I were sitting opposite each other inarmchairs in front of a large fire, smoking our pipes.Suddenly he lost sight of me, and actually cried outin alarm. I said: “What’s wrong?” That broke thespell; there I was, all present and correct.Did I hear you mutter “Transmutations?Werewolves? Golden Hawks?” Likely enough; it’stime we touched on that.In certain types of animal there appears, if tradi-tion have any weight, to be a curious quality of —sympathy? I doubt if that be the word, but can thinkof none better — which enables them to assume attimes the human form. No. 1 — and the rest are alsorans — is the seal. There is a whole body ofliterature about this. Then come wolves, hyaenas,large dogs of the hunting type; occasionally leop-ards. Tales of cats and serpents are usually the otherway round; it is the human (nearly always female)that assumes these shapes by witchcraft. But inancient Egypt they literally doted on this sort ofthing. The papyri are full of formulas for operatingsuch transmutations. But I think that this was mostlyto afford some relaxation for the spirit of the deadman; he nipped out of his sarcophagus, and paintedthe town all the colours of the rainbow in one animalshape or another.The only experience I have of anything of thissort was when I was in Pacific waters, mostly atHonolulu or in Nippon. I was practising Astralprojection. A sister of the Order who lived in HongKong helped me. I was to visit her, and the token ofperfect success was to be that I should knock a vaseoff the mantel-piece. We appointed certain days andhours — with some awkwardness, as my time-distance from her was constantly growing shorter— for me to pay my visit. We got some remarkableresults; our records of the interview used to tallywith surprising accuracy; but the vase remainedintact!This is not one of my notorious digressions; andthis is how transmutation comes into it. I found thatby first taking the shape of a golden hawk, andresuming my own form after landing in her “temple”— a room she had fitted ad hoc — the wholeoperation became incomparably easier. I shall notindulge in hypotheses of why this should have beenthe case.A little over four years later — in the meantimewe had met and worked at Magick together — weresumed these experiments in a somewhat differentform. The success was much greater; but though Icould move her, and even any objects which shewas touching, I could make no impression on inani-mate objects at a distance from her. The behaviourof her dogs, and of her cat, was very curious andinteresting. Strangest of all, there appeared those“kinks in Time” which profane science is justbeginning to discuss. Example: on one occasion ourrecords of an “interview” agreed with quite extraor-dinary precision; but, on comparing notes, it wasfound that owing to some stupid miscalculation ofmine, it was all over in Hong Kong some hoursbefore I had started from Honolulu! Again, don’task me why, or how, or anything!Talking of kinks in Time, I shall now maintainmy aforesaid evil notoriety — the story is totallyasynartete from fascinations of whatever variety —by recounting what is by far the most inexplicableset of facts that ever came my way.In the summer of 1910 e.v. I was living at 125Victoria Street, in a studio converted into a Templeby means of a Circle, an Altar and the rest. West ofthe Altar was a big fireplace with a fender settee; theEast wall was covered with bookshelves. Enter thelate Theodor Reuss, O.H.O. and Frater Superior ofthe O.T.O. He wanted me to join that Order. Irecommended him, in politer language to repeat theNovocastrian Experiment. Undeterred, he insisted:“But you must.”(Now we go back, or forward, I know not which,to a night when I found myself stranded in London.I asked hospitality of a stranger; it was readilyafforded. Some hours later my hostess fell asleep; Icould not do so; something was nagging me. Isuddenly took my notebook, and wrote a certainpassage in a certain book, since published.)“Must, my foot!” He persisted: “You have pub-lished the secret of the nth degree of O.T.O., andyou must take the corresponding oaths.” “I havedone nothing of the sort. I don’t know the secret. Idon’t want to know it. I don’t ...” He interrupted me;he strode across the room; he plucked a book fromthe shelves; he opened it; he thrust it under my nose;he pointed out a passage with a minatory index. Ibegan to stammer. “Yes, I wrote that. I don’t knowwhat it means; I don’t like it; I only put it in becauseit was written in rather curious circumstances, andI was too lazy — or perhaps a little afraid — toreject it and write what I wanted.” He fastened onone point: “You don’t know what it means?” Irepeated that I did not, even now that he had claimedit as important. He explained it to me, as to a child.I was merely surprised; it didn’t sound possible."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears42(Sister, all this while I’ve been lying to you like anArchbishop; it is connected with fascinations; in-deed, it has very little to do with anything else!)Finally, he won me over, I went down to hisG.H.Q., took the Oaths, was installed in the Throneof the X° of O.T.O. as National Sovereign GrandMaster General, and began to establish the Order asa going concern.Well, you say, that is a very simple story, nothingspecially hard to believe in it.True, but consider the dates.That scene in Victoria Street, is as clear andvivid in my mind, in every detail, as if it wereyesterday. That secret is published only in thatpassage of that book. And — the book was notpublished until three years later, and from an ad-dress of which in 1910 I had not so much as thoughtof. The date of my adhesion to the O.T.O. (which,by the way, upset every principle and plan that I hadever held) is equally certain by virtue of subsequentpublished writings.Now go away and explain that!Well I’ve given you a fair account of some of theprincipal fascinations; as to the rest, bewitchments,sorceries, inhibitions and all that lot, it is enough ifI say that they follow the regular Laws of Magick;in some, fascination proper plays a prominent part;in others, it is barely more than walking on to say“My lord, the carriage waits!” But — even that canbe done well or ill, and a small mistake may worka mighty mischief.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXVIMENTAL PROCESSES — TWO ONLYARE POSSIBLECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Occult” science is the most difficult of them all.For one thing, its subject-matter includes the wholeof philosophy, from ontology and metaphysics downto natural history. More, the most rarefied andrecondite of these has a direct bearing upon theconduct of life in its most material details, and thesimplest study of such apparently earthbound mat-ters as botany and mineralogy leads to the mostabstruse calculations of the imponderables.With what weapons, then, are we to attack soformidable a fortress?The first essential is clear thinking.In a previous letter I have dealt to some extentwith this subject; but it is so important that you mustforgive me if I return to it, and that at length, fromthe outset, and in detail.Let us begin but having our own minds clear ofall ambiguities, ignoring for the purpose of thisargument all metaphysical subtleties.1 I want toconfine it to the outlook of the “plain man.”What do we do when we “think”?There are two operations, and only two, possibleto thought. However complex a statement mayappear, it can always be reduced to a series of oneor other of these. If not, it is a sham statement;nonsense masquerading as sense in the cloak ofverbiage and verbosity.Analysis, and Synthesis; or, Subtraction, andAddition.1. You can examine A, and find that it is com-posed of B and C. A = B + C.2. You can find out what happens to B when youadd C to it. B + C = A.As you notice, the two are identical, after all; butthe process is different.Example: Raise Copper Oxide to a very hightemperature; you obtain metallic copper and oxy-gen gas. Heat copper in a stream of oxygen; youobtain copper oxide.You can complicate such experiments indefi-nitely, as when one analyzes coal-tar, or synthesizescomplex products like quinine from its elements;but one can always describe what happens as aseries of simple operations, either of the analyticalor the synthetic type.(I wonder if you remember a delightful passagein Anatole France where he interprets an “exalted”mystical statement, first by giving the words theirmeaning as concrete images, when he gets a mag-nificent hymn, like a passage from the Rig-Veda;secondly, by digging down to the original meaning,with an effect comical and even a little ribald. I fearI have no idea where to find it; in one of the “oddsand ends” compilations most likely. So please, looksomebody; you won’t have wasted your time!)This has been put in a sort of text, because thefirst stumbling-block to study is that one never hasany certainty as to what the author means, or thinkshe means, or is trying to persuade one that he means.Try something simple: “The soul is part of God.”Now then, when he writes “soul” does he meanAtma, or Buddhi, or the Higher Manas, or Purusha,or Yechidah,or Neschamah, or Nephesch, or Nous,or Psyche, or Phren, or Ba, or Khu, or Ka, orAnimus, or Anima, or Seele, or what?As everybody will he nill he, creates “God” in hisown image, it is perfectly useless to inquire what hemay happen to mean by that.But even this very plain word “part”. Does hemean to imply a quantitative assertion, as when onesays sixpence is part of a pound, or a factor indis-pensable, as when one says “A wheel is part of amotor-car”, or ... (Part actually means “a share, thatwhich is provided,” according to Skeat; and I amcloser to the place where Moses was when thecandle went out than I was before!)The fact is that very few of us know what wordsmean; fewer still take the trouble to enquire. Wecalmly, we carelessly assume that our minds areidentical with that of the writer, at least on thatpoint; and then we wonder that there should bemisunderstandings!The fact is (again!) that usually we don’t reallywant to know; it is so very much easier to drift downthe river of discourse, “lazily, lazily, drowsily,drowsily, In the noonday sun”.Why is this so satisfactory? Because althoughwe may not know what a word means, most wordshave a pleasant or unpleasant connotation, each forhimself, either because of the ideas or images thusbegotten, of hopes or memories stirred up, or merelyfor the sound of the word itself. (I have gone amonth’s journey out of my way to visit a town, justbecause I liked the sound of the name!)Then there are devices: style — rhythm, ca-dence, rime, ornamentation of a thousand kinds. Ithink one may take it that the good writer makes useof such artifice to make his meaning clear; the badwriter to obscure it, or to conceal the fact that he hasnone.One of the best items of the education system atthe Abbey in Cefalù was the weekly Essay. Every-one, including children of five or six, had to write on“The Housing Problem,” “Why Athens Decayed,”“The Marriage System,” “Buddhist Ethics” and thelike; the subject didn’t matter much; the point wasthat one had to discover, arrange and condenseone’s ideas about it, so as to present it in a givennumber of words, 93 or 156, or 418 as like as not,that number, neither more nor less. A superb disci-pline for any writer.I had a marvellous lesson myself some yearsearlier. I had cut down a certain ritual of initiationto what I thought were the very barest bones, chieflyto make it easy to commit to memory. Then came acandidate who was deaf — not merely “a little hardof hearing;” his tympana were ruptured — and thequestion was How?All right for most of it; one could show him thewords typed on slips. But during part of the cer-emony he was hoodwinked; one was reduced to thedeaf-and-dumb alphabet devised for such occa-sions. I am as clumsy and stupid at that as I am atmost things, and lazy, infernally lazy, on top of that.Well, when it came to the point, the communicationof the words became abominably, intolerably te-dious. And then! Then I found that about two-thirdsof my “absolutely essential” ritual was notnecesasary at all!That larned ’im.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXVIISTRUCTURE OF MIND BASED ON THATOF BODY(HAECKEL AND BERTRAND RUSSELL)Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Was the sudden cloudburst at the end of my lastletter somewhat of a surprise, and more than some-what of a shock? Cheer up! The worst is yet tocome.This is where clean thinking — a subject whosefringes I seem to remember having touched — winsthe Gold Medal of the Royal Humane Society.It is surely the wise course to accept the plain1 I mean criticisms such as “Definition is impos-sible;” “All arguments are circular;” “All proposi-tions are tautological.” These are true, but one isobliged to ignore them in all practical discussions."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears43facts; to try to explain them away, or to excuse them,is certain to involve one in a maelstrom of sophistry;and when, despite these laudable efforts, the factsjump up and land a short jab to the point, one is evenworse off than before.This has to be said, because Samma-sati is assur-edly one of the most useful, as well as one of themost trustworthy and most manageable, weaponsin the armoury of the Aspirant.You stop me, obviously with a demand for apersonal explanation. “How is it,” you write, “thatyou reject with such immitigable scorn the veryfoundation-stones of Buddhism, and yet refer dis-ciples enthusiastically to the technique of some ofits subtlest super-structures?”I laff.It is the old, old story. When the Buddha wasmaking experiments and recording the results, hewas on safe ground: when he started to theorize,committing (incidentally) innumerable logicalcrimes in the process, he is no better a guesser thanthe Arahat next door, or for the matter of that, theArahat’s Lady Char.So, if you don’t mind, we will look a little intothis matter of Sammasati: what is it when it’s athome?It may be no more than a personal fancy, but Ithink Allan Bennett’s translation of the term, “Rec-ollection,” is as near as one can get in English. Onecan strain the meaning slightly to include Re-col-lection, to imply the ranging of one’s facts, and thefitting of them into an organized structure. The term“sati” suggests an identification of Being withKnowledge — see The Soldier and the Hunchback— ! and ? (Equinox I, 1). So far as it applies to theMagical Memory, it lays stress on some such expe-dient, very much as is explained in Liber Thisarb(Magick, pp. 415-422).But is it not a little strange that “The Abomina-tion of Desolation should be set up in the HolyPlace,” as it were? Why should the whole-heartedsearch for Truth and Beauty disclose such hatefuland such hideous elements as necessary compo-nents of the Absolute Perfection?Never mind the why, for a moment; first let us besure that it is so. Have we any grounds for expectingthis to be the case?We certainly have.This is a case where “clean thinking” is mostabsolutely helpful. The truth is of exquisite texture;it blazons the escutcheon of the Unity of Nature insuch delicate yet forceful colours that the Postulantmay well come thereby to the Opening of theTrance of Wonder; yet religious theories and per-sonal pernicketiness have erected against its impactthe very stoutest of their hedgehogs of prejudice.Who shall help us here? Not the sonorous Vedas,not the Upanishads, not Apollonius, Plotinus,Ruysbroeck, Molinos; not any gleaner in the fieldof à priori; no, a mere devotee of natural history andbiology: Ernst Haeckel.Enormous, elephantine, his work’s bulk is al-most incredible; for us his one revolutionary dis-covery is pertinent to this matter of Samma-sati andthe revelations of one’s inmost subtle structure.He discovered, and he demonstrated, that thehistory of any animal throughout the course of itsevolution is repeated in the stages of the individual.To put it crudely, the growth of a child from thefertilized ovum to the adult repeats the adventuresof its species.This doctrine is tremendously important, and Ifeel that I do not know how to emphasize it as itdeserves. I want to be exceptionally accurate; yetthe use of his meticulous scientific terms, with anarmoury of quotations, would almost certainly re-sult in your missing the point, “unable to see thewood for the trees.”Let me put it that the body is formed by the super-position of layers, each representing a stage in thehistory of the evolution of the species. The foetusdisplays essential characteristics of insect, reptile,mammal (or whatever they are) in the order inwhich these classes of animal appeared in the world’shistory.Now I want to put forward a thesis — and as faras I know it is personal to myself, based on my workat Cefalù — to the effect that the mind is constructedon precisely the same lines.You will remember from my note on “Breaks”in meditation how one’s gradual improvement inthe practice results in the barring-out of certainclasses of idea, by classes. The ready-to-hand, re-cent fugitive thoughts come first and first they go.Then the events of the previous day or so, and thepreoccupations of the mind for that period.Next, one comes to the layer of reveries and otherforms of wish-phanstasm; then cryptomnesia getsbusy with incidents of childhood and the like;finally, there intrudes the class of “atmospherics,”where one cannot trace the source of the interrup-tion.All these are matters of the conscious rationalmind; and when I explored and classified thesefacts, in the very first months of my serious practiceof Yoga, I had no suspicion that they were no morethan the foam on a glass of champagne: nay, ratherof“Black wine in jars of jadeCooled all these months in hoarded snow,Black wine with purple starlight in its bosom,Oily and sweet as the soul of a brown maidBrought from the forenoon’s archipelago,Her brows bound bright with many a scarletblossomLike the blood of the slain that flowered freeWhen we met the black men knee to knee.”How apt the verses are! How close are wine andsnow to lust and slaughter!I have been digressing, for all that; let us returnto our goats!The structure of the mind reveals its history asdoes the structure of the body.(Capitals, please, or bang on something; that hasgot to sink in.)Just as your body was at one stage the body of anape, a fish, a frog (and all the rest of it) so did thatanimal at that stage possess a mind correlative.Now then! In the course of that kind of initiationconferred by Samma-sati, the layers are stripped offvery much as happens in elementary meditation(Dharana) to the conscious mind.(There is a way of acquiring a great deal ofstrange and unsuspected knowledge of these mat-ters by the use of Sulphuric Ether, [C2H5]2O, ac-cording to a special technique. I wrote a paper on itonce, 16 pp. 4to, and fearing that it might be lost hadmany copies made and distributed. Where is it? Imust write you a letter one day.)Accordingly, one finds oneself experiencing thethoughts, the feelings, the desires of a gorilla, acrocodile, a rat, a devil-fish, or what have you! Oneis no longer capable of human thoughts in theordinary sense of the word; such would be whollyunintelligible.I leave the rest to your imagination; doesn’t itsound to you a little like some of the accounts of“The Dweller on the Threshold?”Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXVIIINEED TO DEFINE “GOD”, “SELF”, ETC.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Artless remark!1 Oh you!Well, I suppose it’s a gift — to stir Hell to itsmost abysmal horror with one small remark slippedin at the end.

Higher. Here we fall straight into the arms ofFreud. Why “higher?” Because in a scrap it is easierto strangle him if you are on top. When very youngchildren watch their parents in actu coitus, a cir-cumstance exceedingly usual almost anywhereoutside England, and even here where houseroom isrestricted, the infant supposes that his mother, uponwhom he depends entirely for nourishment, is beingattacked by the intrusive stranger whom they wanthim to address as “Dad.” From this seed springs an“over-under complex,” giving rise later on, in cer-tain cases to whole legions of neuroses.Now then make it a little clearer, please, just1 Refers to a pious phrase at the end of her letter."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears44what you mean by “higher.”Skeat seems to connect it with hills, swellings,boils, the maternal breast; is that reason enough forus to connect it with the idea of advantage, or —“superiority” merely translates it into Latin! —worth, or — no, it’s really too difficult. Of course,sometimes it has a “bad” meaning, as of tempera-ture in fever; but nearly always it implies a condi-tion preferable to “low.”Applied to the “self,” it becomes a sort of tradename; nobody tells me if he means Khu, or Ba, orKhabs, or Ut of the Upanishads or Augoeides of theNeo-Platonists, or Adonai of the Bulwer-Lytton, or— — here we are with all those thrice-accurs’talternatives. There is not, cannot be, any specificmeaning unless we start with a sound skeleton ofontogenic theory, a well-mapped hierarchy of theCosmos, and define the term anew.Then why use it? To do so can only causeconfusion, unless the context helps us to clarify theimage. And that is surely rather a defeatist attitude,isn’t it?When I first set myself to put a name to my“mission” — the contemplation carried me half-way across South-West China — I considered thesealternatives. I thought to cut the Gordian Knot, andcall it by Abramelin’s title the “Holy GuardianAngel” because (I mused) that will be as intelligibleto the villagers of Pu Peng as to the most learnedPundits; moreover, the implied theory was so crudethat no one need be bound by it.All this is rubbish, as you will see when we reachthe discussion on “self:” To explain now wouldlead to too unwieldy a digression.2. “Within.” If you don’t mind, we’ll tackle thisnow, while “higher” is fresh in our minds; for it isalso a preposition. First you want to go up; then youwant to go in. Why?As “higher” gave the idea of aggression, ofconquest, “within” usually implies safety. Alwayswe get back to that stage of history when the socialunit, based on the family, was little less than condi-tion No. 1 of survival. The house, the castle, thefortified camp, the city wall; the “gens,” the clan,the tribe, the “patrie,” to be outside means dangerfrom cold, hunger and thirst, raiding parties, high-way robbers, bears, wolves, and tigers. To go outwas to take a risk; and, your labour and couragebeing assets to your kinsmen, you were also a badman; in fact, a “bounder” or “outsider.” “Debauch”is simply “to go out of doors!” St. John says:“without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongersand adulterers and idolaters and ...” — so on.We of Thelema challenge all this briskly. “Theword of Sin is Restriction.” (AL I, 41.) Our formula,roughly speaking, is to go out and grab what wewant. We do this so thoroughly that we growthereby, extending our conception of “I” by includ-ing each new accretion instead of remaining aclosely delineated self, proud of possessing otherthings, as do the Black Brothers.We are whole-hearted extroverts; the penalty ofrestricting oneself is anything from neurosis todown right lunacy; in particular, melancholia.You ask whether these remarks do not conflictwith my repeated definition of Initiation as the WayIn. Not at all; the Inmost is identical with the All. Asyou travel inward, you become able to perceive allthe layers which surround the “Self” from within,thus enlarging the scope of your vision of theUniverse. It is like moving from a skirmishingpatrol to G.H.Q.; and the object of so doing isobviously to exercise constantly increasing controlover the whole Army. Every step in rank enablesyou both to see more and to do more; but one’sattention is inevitably directed outward.When the entire system of the Universe is conter-minous with your comprehension, “inward” and“outward” become identical.But it won’t do at all to seek anything within buta point of view, for the simple reason that there isnothing else there!It is just like all those symbols in The Book ofThoth; as soon as you get to the “end” of anything,you suddenly find it is the “beginning.”To formulate the idea of “self” at all, you mustposit limitations; anything that is distinguishable isa mere temporary (and arbitrary) selection of thefinite from the infinite; whatever you chose to thinkof, it changes, it grows, it disappears.You have got to train your mind to canter throughthose leafy avenues of thought upon the good greenturf of Indifference; when you can do it withoutconscious effort, so that up-down, in-out, far-near,black-white (and so on for everything) appearsquite automatically, you are already as near anInitiate as makes no matter.3. “Self.” For a full discussion of this see LetterXLII.4. “God.” This is really too bad of you!Of all the hopelessly mangled words in the lan-guage, you settle with unerring Sadism on the mostbrutally butchered.Crippen1 was an amateur.Skeat hardly helps us at all, except by warning usthat “good” has nothing whatever to do with it.Dieu comes from Deus, with all its Sol-Jupiterreferences, and Deos, which Plato thought meant arunner; hence, Sun, Moon, Planets.The best I can do for you, honest Injun! is theRussian word for god Bog; connected probably,through the Lithuanian, with the Welsh Bwq aspectre or hobgoblin. Bugge, too. Not very inspir-ing, is it, to replace the Old Hundredth by “Hush!Hush! Hush! here come the Bogey Man.” Or is it?Enough of this fooling! Out, trusty rapier, andhome to the stone heart of the audacious womanthat wrote “God within us.”I know you thought you knew more or less whatyou meant when you wrote it; but surely that was amere slip. An instant’s thought would have warnedyou that the word wouldn’t stand even the mostsuperficial analysis.You meant “Something which seems to me themost perfect symbol of all that I love, worship,admire” — all that class of verb.But nobody else will have the same set of quali-ties in his private museum; you have, as every onehas always done, made another God in your ownimage.Then the Vedantists define God as “having nei-ther quality nor quantity;” and some Yogis have apractice of setting up images to knock them down atonce with “Not that! Not that!”And the Buddhists won’t admit any God at all inanything at all like the sense in which you use theword.2What’s worse, whatever you may mean by “God”conveys no idea to me: I can only guess by the lightof my exceedingly small knowledge of you andyour general habits of thought and action. Thenwhat sense was there in chucking it at my head?Half a brick would have served you better.You think you can explain to me viva voce,perhaps? Don’t you dare try! Whatever you said, Ishould prove to be nonsense, philosophically and ina dozen other ways. And the County Council Am-bulance would bundle you off in your battered andbewildered débris to the Bug-house, as is so etymo-logically indicated.Do see it simply; the word must in any eventconnote ideas of Neschamah, not of Ruach.“But you use the word all the time.” Yes, I do,and rely on the context to crystallize this most fluid— or gaseous — of expressions.5. “Us”. Why “Us”?Is this a reference to the Old School Tie, or thatFinishing School in Brussels, and the ticket to theRoyal enclosure at Ascot? I do not suppose for amoment that you meant it that way: but it’s there.And so —Anecdote of Lao-Tze.The Old One was surrounded as usual by agalaxy of adoring disciples, and they were trying toget him to show them where the Tao was to befound.It was in the Sun and Moon, he admitted; it wasin the Son of Heaven and in the Superior Man. (NotGeorge Nathaniel Curzon, however). It was in theBlossoms of Springtide, and in the chilling windsthat swept over from Siberia, and in the Wild Geesethat it bore Southward when their instinct badethem. In short, the catalogue began to look as if itwere going to extend indefinitely; and an impatientdisciple, pointing to certain traces left by a mule inits recent passage, asked: “And is the Tao also inthat?” The Master nodded, and echoed: “Also inthat.”.......Then what becomes of this privileged “us”? Weare obliged to extend it to include everything. Then,as we have just seen, “God” also is unfettered bydefinitions.1 Crippen was a famous English poisoner whowas caught and hung.2 One of the most amusing passages of irony is tobe found in The Questions of King Milinda wherethe Arhat Nagasena demolishes Maha Brahma."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears45Net result: “God within us” means preciselynothing at all.And so it does, By Brahman!“Bind nothing! Let there be no difference madeamong you between any one thing & any otherthing; for thereby there cometh hurt. But whosoavaileth in this, let him be the chief of all!” (AL I, 22-23)I implore you not to point out that, this being thecase, words like “hurt” and “chief” cannot possiblymean anything. The fact is that if we are to get onpeaceably in the Club, we have to know when totake any given expression in a Pickwickian sense.In the Ruach all the laws of logic apply: theydon’t in Neschamah.The real meaning of the passage is simple enough,if you understand that it refers to a specific result ofInitiation. You have to be able to reckon up theUniverse, as a whole and in every part; and to get ridof all its false or partial realities by discardingeverything but the One Reality which is the soletruth in, and of Illusion.There is one set of equations which express therelation of the Perceiver and the Perceived, adjustedin accordance with the particular limitations onboth sides; another cancels out all the finite terms,and leaves us with an ultimate x = o = O°.See?I know I’m a disheartening kind of bloke, and itdoes seem so unfriendly to jump down a fellow’sthroat every minute or so when she tries to put itever so nicely, and it is so easy — isn’t it? — to playthe game of Sanctimonious Grandiloquence, andsurely what was said was perfectly harmless, and ....No, N.O., no: not harmless at all.

Then when youget the results, you can try, albeit uselessly, to fityour own words to the facts, if you should wish tocommunicate, for any good reason, your experi-ences to other people.Then, despairing of your impotence, how gladyou will be that you have been trained not to letanyone fob you of with phrases.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally yours, 666CHAPTER XXIXWHAT IS CERTAINTY?Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Well, I suppose I ought to have expected you tocock that wise left eyebrow at me! Right you are towonder precisely what I mean by “certainty”, in thelight of:“On Soul’s curtainIs written this one certainty, that naught is certain.”Then there is that chapter in The Book of Lies(again!)“The Chinese cannot help thinking that the Oc-tave has five notes.“The more necessary anything appears to mymind, the more certain it is that I only assert alimitation.“I slept with Faith, and found a corpse in myarms on awaking.“I drank and danced all night with Doubt, andfound her a virgin in the morning.”I wouldn’t start to argue with the Chinese, if Iwere you; they might remind you that you exude thestench peculiar to corpses.Again, that other “Hymn to St. Thomas”, as Iought perhaps to have called it:“Doubt.“Doubt Thyself“Doubt even if thou doubtest thyself.“Doubt all“Doubt even if thou doubtest all.“It seems sometimes as if beneath all consciousdoubt there lay some deepest certainty. O kill it!slay the snake!“The horn of the Doubt-Goat be exalted!“Dive deeper, ever deeper, into the Abyss ofMind, until thou unearth the fox THAT. On, hounds!Yoicks! Tally-ho! Bring THAT to bay!“Then, wind the Mort!”Once more — what a book that is: I neverrealized it until now! it says — see that double pageat the onset, one with “?” and the other with “!”alone upon the blank. Moreover you should readthe long essay “The Soldier and the Hunchback: !and?” in the first volume and number of The Equi-nox.But every one of those — rather significant, nichwahr? — slides into a rhapsody of exaltation, adithyramb, a Paean.1 No good here. For what youwant is a penny plain pedestrian prose Probability-Percentage. You want to know what the Odds arewhen I say “certain”.A case for casuistry? At least, for classification.It depends rather on one’s tone of voice? Yes, ofcourse, and as to the classification, off we jog to theDivine Pymander, who saw, and stated, the quid-dity of our query with his accustomed lucidity. Hediscerns three degrees of Truth; and he distin-guishes accordingly: —1. True2. Certain without error3. Of all truth.Clear enough, the difference between 1 and 2:ask me the time, I say half-past two; and that’s trueenough. But the Astronomer Royal is by no mannerof means satisfied with any approximation of thatkind. He wants it accurate. He must know thelongitude to a second; he must have decided whatmethod of measuring time is to be used; he mustmake corrections for this and for that; and he musthave attached an (arbitrary) interpretation to thesystem; the whole question of Relativity pops up.And, even so, he will enter a caveat about everysingle ganglion in the gossamer of his calculations.Well then, all this intricate differentiation andintegration and verification and Lord knows whatleads at last to a statement which may be called“Certain without Error”.Excuse me just a moment! When I was stayingat the Consulate of Tengyueh, just inside the S.W.frontier of China, our one link with England, Home,and Beauty was the Telegraph Service from Pekin.One week it was silent, and we were anxious fornews, our last bit of information having been thatthere was rioting in Shanghai, seventeen Sikh po-licemen killed. For all we knew the whole countrymight rise en masse at any moment to expel the“Foreign Devils”. At last the welcome messengertrotted across from the city in the twilight with awhole sheaf of telegrams. Alas, save for the date ofdispatch, the wording in each one was identical:each told us that it was noon in Pekin!They had to be relayed at Yung Chang, and boththe operators had taken ten days off to smokeopium, sensible fellows!But Hermes Trismegistus is not content with anysuch fugues as the Astronomer, however cunningand colossal his Organ; his Third Degree demandsmuch more than this. The Astronomer’s estimatehas puttied every tiniest crack, he concedes it, but1 It seems natural to me — apodeictic after afashion — to treat Doubt as positive, even aggres-sive. There is none of the wavering, wobbling,woebegone wail of the weary and bewildered wage-slave; it is a triumphant challenge, disagreement forits own sake. Irish!Browning painted a quite perfect picture of myDoubt.“Up jumped Tokay on our table,Like a pigmy castle-warder,Dwarfish to see but stout and able,Arms and accoutrement all in order;And fierce he looked North, then wheeling SouthBlew with his bugle a challenge to Drouth,Cocked his flap-hat with the tosspot feather,Twisted his thumb in his red moustache,Jingled his huge brass spurs together,Tightened his waist with its Buda Sash,And then, with an impudence nought couldabashShrugged his hump-shoulder, to tell the be-holder,For twenty such knaves he should laugh but thebolder;And so, with his sword-hilt gallantly jutting,And dexter hand on his haunch abutting,Went the little man, Sir Ausbruch, strutting!”It’s not the least bit like Tokay; rather the Bull’sBlood its neighbor, or any rough strong red winelike Rioja. Curious, though, his making him ahunchbacked dwarf; there must be something inthis deep down. I wonder what! (Ask Jung!)"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears46then waves it brusquely away: all the time the dooris standing wide open!The Astronomer’s exquisitely tailored figurestands in abashed isolation, like a gawky youngman at his first Ball; he feels that he doesn’t belong.For this D.S.T., or Greenwich, or what not, how-ever exact in itself, is so only in reference to someother set of measurements which themselves turnout to be arbitrary; it is not of any ultimate import;nobody can dispute it, but it simply doesn’t matterto anybody, apart from the particular case. It is not“Of all Truth.”What Hermes means by this it will be well toenquire.May we call it “a truth of Religion?” (Don’t beshocked! The original word implies a binding-together-again, as in a “Body of Doctrine:” com-pare the word “Ligature”. It was only later bycorruption, that the word came to imply “piety;” re-ligens, attentive (to the gods) as opposed to neg-ligens, neglectful.)I think that Hermes was contemplating a Ruachclosely knitted together and anchored by incessantAspiration to the Supernal Triad; just such an one,in short, as appears in those remarks on the MagicalMemory, a God-man ready to discard his well-worn Instrument for a new one, brought up to datewith all the latest improvements (the movement ofthe Zeitgeist during his past incarnation, in particu-lar) well wrought and ready for his use.This being so, a truth which is “of all Truth”should mean any proposition which forms an essen-tial part of this Khu — this “Magical Identity” of aman.Now how curious it must appear at the firstglance to note that the truths of this order shouldprove to be what we call Axioms — or even Plati-tudes —...... What’s that noise?...... I think I hear Sir Ausbruch!And in full eruption too! And hasn’t he the right?For all this time we’ve bluffed our way breezilyahead over the sparkling seas, oblivious of that veryChinese Chinese-puzzle that we started with, theparadox (is it?) of the Chinese Gamut.(We shan’t get into doldrums; there’s always theway out from “?” to “!” as with any and everyintellectual problem whatsoever: it’s the only way.Otherwise, of course, we get to A is A, A is not-A,not-A is not-A, not-A is A, as is inevitable).“The more certain I am of anything, the morecertain it is that I am only asserting a limitation ofmy own mind.”Very good, but what am I to do about it? Someat least of such certainties must surely be “of allTruth”. The test of admission to this class ought tobe that, if one were to accept the contradictory of theproposition, the entire structure of the Mind wouldbe knocked to pieces, as is not at all the case with theAstronomer’s determination, which may turn out tobe wrong for a dozen different reasons withoutanybody getting seriously wounded in his tenderestfeelings.The Statesman knows instinctively, or at worst,by his training and experience, what sort of asser-tion, harmless enough on the surface, may be “dan-gerous thinking”, a death-blow to his own idea ofwhat is “of all Truth”, and strikes out wildly in apanic entirely justifiable from his own point ofview. Exhibit No. 1: Galileo and that lot. Whatcould it possibly matter to the Gospel story thatpeople should think that the Earth moves round theSun? (Riemann, and oh! such a lot of things, haveshewn that it didn’t and doesn’t! This sort of “Truth”is only a set of conventions.)“Oh, don’t gas away like this! I want to knowwhat to do about it. Am I to accept this caterwaulingGamut, and enlarge my Mind, and call it an Initia-tion? Or am I to nail my own of-all-Truth TonicSolfa to the Mast, and go down into the Maelstromof Insanity with colours flying?Do you really need Massed Bands to lull Baby tosleep?The Master of the Temple deals very simply andefficiently with problems of this kind. “The Mind”(says he) of this Party of the First Part, hereinafterreferred to as Frater N (or whatever his 8° = 3motto may be) is so constructed that the intervalfrom C to C is most harmoniously divided into nnotes; that of the Party of the Second Part hereinaf-ter referred to as — not a Heretic, an Atheist, aBolshie, a Die-hard, a Schismatic, an Anarchist, aBlack Magician, a Friend of Aleister Crowley, orwhatever may be the current term of abuse — Mr.A, Lord B, the Duke of C, Mrs. X, or whatever heor she may chance to be called — into five. TheStructure called of-all-Truth in neither of us isaffected in the least, any more than in the reading ofa Thermometer with Fahrenheit on one side andCentigrade on the other.You naturally object that this answer is littlebetter than an evasion, that it automatically pushesthe Gamut question outside the Charmed of-all-Truth Circle.No, it doesn’t really; for if you were able to putup a Projection of those two minds, there would be,firstly, some sort of compensation elsewhere than inthe musical section; and secondly, some Truth of ayet higher order which is common to both.Not unaware am I that these conceptions are atfirst exceedingly difficult to formulate clearly. Iwouldn’t go so far as to say that one would have tobe a Master of the Temple to understand them; butit is really very necessary to have grasped firmly thedoctrine that “a thing is only true insofar as itcontains its contradiction in itself.” (A good way torealize this is by keeping up a merry dance ofparadoxes, such as infest Logic and Mathematics.The repeated butting of the head against a brickwall is bound in the long run to shake up the littlegrey cells [as Poirot might say], teach you to dis-trust any train of argument, however apparentlyimpeccable the syllogisms, and to seek ever moreeagerly the dawn of that Neschamic consciousnesswhere all these things are clearly understood, al-though impossible to express in rational language.)The prime function of intellect is differentiation;it deals with marks, with limits, with the relations ofwhat is not identical; in Neschamah all this workhas been carried out so perfectly that the “roughworking” has passed clean out of mind; just so, yousay “I” as if it were an indivisible Unity, uncon-scious of the inconceivably intricate machinery ofanatomical, physiological, psychological construc-tion which issues in this idea of “I”.We may then with some confidence reaffirm thatour certainties do assert our limitations; but thiskind of limitation is not necessarily harmful, pro-vided that we view the situation in its proper per-spective, that we understand that membership of theof-all-Truth class does not (as one is apt to think atfirst sight) deepen the gulfs which separate mindfrom mind, but on the contrary put us in a positionto ignore them. Our acts of “love under will,” whichexpress our devotion to Nuit, which multiply thefulfillments of our possibilities, become continu-ally more efficacious, and more closely bound upwith our Formula of Initiation; and we progres-sively become aware of deeper and vaster Images ofthe of-all-Truth class, which reconcile, by includ-ing within themselves, all apparent antinomies.It is certain without error that I ought to go tobed.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXDO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You are quite right, as usual. True, we have goneover a great deal of the ground in various learneddisquisitions of Gods, Angels, Elves, et hoc genusomne.But God with a capital “G” in the singular is atotally different pair of Blüchers — nicht wahr?Let me go back just for a moment to the meaningof “belief”. We agreed that the word was senselessexcept as it implies an opinion, instinct, conviction— what you please! — so firmly entrenched in ournatures that we act automatically as if it were “true”and “certain without error,” perhaps even “of theessence of truth.” (Browning discusses this in Mr.Sludge the Medium.) Good: the field is clear for anenquiry into this word “God”.We find ourselves in trouble from the start.We must define; and to define is to limit; and tolimit is to reduce “God” to “a God” or at best “theGod”.He must be omniscient (3), omnipotent (Q), andomnipresent (P); yet to such a Being no purposewould be possible; so that all the apologies for theexistence of “evil” crash. If there be opposites ofany kind, there can be no consistency. He cannot beTwo; He must be One; yet, as is obvious, he isn’t.How do the Hindu philosophers try to get out ofthis quag? “Evil” is “illusion;” has no “real” exist-ence. Then what is the point of it? They say “Notthat, not that!” denying to him all attributes; He is“that which is without quantity or quality.” They"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears47contradict themselves at every turn; seeking toremove limit, they remove definition. Their onlyrefuge is in “superconsciousness.” Splendid! butnow “belief” has disappeared altogether; for theword has no sense unless it is subject to the laws ofnormal thought ... Tut! you must be feeling ityourself; the further one goes, the darker the path.All I have written is somehow muddled and ob-scure, maugre my frenzied struggle for lucidity,simplicity ...Is this the fault of my own sophistication? I askedmyself. Tell you what! I’ll trot round to my mas-seuse, and put it up to her. She is a simple countrysoul, by no means over-educated, but intelligent;capable of a firm grasp of the principles of her job;a steady church-goer on what she considers worth-while occasions; dislikes the rector, but praises hispolicy of keeping his discourse within bounds. Shehas done quite a lot of thinking for herself; distrustsand despises the Press and the Radio, has no use forready-made opinions. She shares with the flocktheir normal prejudices and phobias, but is notbigoted about them, and follows readily enough aline of simply-expressed destructive criticism whenit is put to her. This is, however, only a temporaryreaction; a day later she would repeat the previousinanities as if they had never been demolished. Inthe late fifties, at a guess. I sprang your question onher out of the blue, à la “doodle-bug;” premisingmerely that I had been asked the question, and waspuzzled as to how to answer it. Her reply wascurious and surprising: without a moment’s hesita-tion and with great enthusiasm, “Quickly, yes!”The spontaneous reservation struck me as extremelyinteresting. I said: of course, but suppose you thinkit over — and out — a bit, what am I to understand?She began glibly “He’s a great big —” and brokeoff, looking foolish. Then, although omnipotent,He needed our help — we were all just as powerfulas He, for we were little bits of each other — butexactly how, or to what end, she did not make clear.An exclamation: “Then there is the Devil!”She went on without a word from me for a longwhile, tying herself up into fresh knots with everyphase. She became irreverent, then downright blas-phemous; stopped short and began to laugh atherself. And so forth — but, what struck me ascurious and significant, in the main her argumentfollowed quite closely the lines which came natu-rally to me, at the beginning of this letter!In the end, “curiouser and curiouser,” she ar-rived at a practically identical conclusion: she be-lieved, but what she believed in was Nothing!As to our old criterion of what we imply inpractice when we say that we believe, she began bysaying that if we “helped” God in His mysteriousplan, He would in some fashion or other look afterus. But about this she was even more vague than inthe matter of intellectual conviction; “helping God”meant behaving decently according to one’s owninstinctive ideas of what “decently” means.It is very encouraging that she should have seen,without any prompting on my part, to what amuddle the question necessarily led; and very nicefor me, because it lets me out, cara soror!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. I thought it a good plan to put my fundamen-tal position all by itself in a postscript; to frame it.My observation of the Universe convinces me thatthere are beings of intelligence and power of a farhigher quality than anything we can conceive of ashuman; that they are not necessarily based on thecerebral and nervous structures that we know; andthat the one and only chance for mankind to ad-vance as a whole is for individuals to make contactwith such Beings.CHAPTER XXXIRELIGION — IS THELEMA A “NEWRELIGION?”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Would you describe your system as a newreligion?” A pertinent question, you doubtless sup-pose; whether it may happen to mean anything is —is — is — well, is what we must try to make clear.True, it’s a slogan of A∴A∴ “The method ofscience — the aim of religion.” Here the word“aim” and the context help the definition; it mustmean the attainment of Knowledge and Power inspiritual matters — or words to that effect: as soonas one selects a phrase, one starts to kick holes in it!Yet we both know perfectly well all the time whatwe do mean.But this is certainly not the sense of the word inyour question. It may clear our minds, as has sooften happened, if we examine it through the lens ofdear old Skeat.Religion, he says, Latin: religio, piety. Collec-tion or paying attention to: religens as opposed tonegligens, neglecting; the attitude of Gallio. But italso implies a binding together i.e. of ideas; in fact,a “body of doctrine.” Not a bad expression. Areligion then, is a more or less coherent and consis-tent set of beliefs, with precepts and prohibitionstherefrom deducible. But then there is the sense inwhich Frazer (and I) often use the word: as inopposition to “Science” or “Magic”. Here the pointis that religious people attribute phenomena to thewill of some postulated Being or Beings, placableand moveable by virtue of sacrifice, devotion, orappeal. Against such, the scientific or magical mindbelieves in the Laws of Nature, asserts “If A, thenB” — if you do so-and-so, the result will be so-and-so, aloof from arbitrary interference. Joshua, it isalleged, made the sun stand still by supplication,and Hezekiah in the same way caused it to “go backupon the dial of Ahaz;” Willett did it by putting theclock back, and getting an Act of Parliament toconfirm his lunacy. Petruchio, too “It shall be whato’clock I say it is!” The two last came close to themagical method; at least, to that branch of it whichconsists of “fooling all the people all the time.” Butsuch an operation, if true Magick were employed,would be beyond the power of any magician of myacquaintance; for it would mess up the solar systemcompletely. (You remember how this happened,and what came of it, in a rather clever short story byH.G. Wells.) For true Magick means “to employone set of natural forces at a mechanical advantageas against another set” — I quote, as closely asmemory serves, Thomas Henry Huxley, when heexplains that when he lifts his water-jug — or hiselbow — he does not “defy the Law of Gravitation.”On the contrary, he uses that Law; its equationsform part of the system by which he lifts the jugwithout spilling the water.To sum up, our system is a religion just so far asa religion means an enthusiastic putting-together ofa series of doctrines, no one of which must in anyway clash with Science or Magick.Call it a new religion, then, if it so please yourGracious Majesty; but I confess that I fail to seewhat you will have gained by so doing, and I feelbound to add that you might easily cause a greatdeal of misunderstanding, and work a rather stupidkind of mischief.The word does not occur in The Book of the Law.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXIIHOW CAN A YOGI EVER BE WORRIED?Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.That question I have been expecting for a verylong time! And what you expect is to see my middlestump break the wicket-keeper’s nose, with theballs smartly fielded by Third Man and Short Leg!I admit that it looks like a strong case. Here (youput it in your more elegant prose) we have a Yogi,nay more, a Paramahamsa, a Bodhisattva of thebest: yea, further, we have a Master of the Temple— and is not his Motto “Vi veri vniversom vivusvici”? and yet we find him fussing like an old henover the most trivial of troubles; we find him wrappedin the lacustrine vapours of Avernus, fretting him-self into a fever about imaginary misfortunes atwhich no normal person would do more than cast acontemptuous glance, and get on with the job.Yes, although you can scarcely evade indict-ment for unnecessarily employing the language ofhyperbole, I see what you mean. Yet the answer isadequate; the very terms of his Bargain with Des-tiny not only allow for, but imply, some suchreaction on the part of the Master to the Bludgeoningsof Fate. (W. E. Henley.1)There are two ways of looking at the problem.One is what I may call the mathematical. If I haveten and sixpence in the world and but a half-guineacigar, I have no money left to buy a box of matches.To “snap out of it” and recover my normal serenityrequires only a minute effort, and the whole of mymagical energy is earmarked for the Great Work. Ihave none left to make that effort. Of course, if theworry is enough to interfere with that Work, I mustdetail a corporal’s file to abate the nuisance.The other way may be called the Taoist aspect.1 An English poet."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears48First, however, let me explain the point of view ofthe Master of the Temple, as it is so similar. Youshould remember from your reading what happensin this Grade. The new Master is “cast out” into thesphere appropriate to the nature of his own particu-lar Great Work. And it is proper for him to act intrue accordance with the nature of the man as he waswhen he passed through that Sphere (or Grade) onhis upward journey. Thus, if he be cast out into 3°= 8, it is no part of his work to aim at the virtuesof a 4° = 7; all that has been done long before. It isno business of his to be bothering his head aboutanything at all but his Work; so he must react toevents as they occur in the way natural to himwithout trying to “improve himself.” (This, ofcourse, applies not only to worry, but to all hisfunny little ways.)The Taoist position differs little, but it isindependent of all considerations of the man’sattainment; it is an universal rule based on aparticular theory of things in general. Thus,“benevolence and righteousness” are not “vir-tues;” they are only symptoms of the world-disease, in that they should be needed. Thesame applies to all conditions, and to all modesof seeking to modify them. There is only oneproper reaction to event; that is, to adjust one-self with perfect elasticity to whatever hap-pens.That tiger across the paddy-field looks hungry.There are several ways of dealing with the situation.One can run away, or climb a tree, or shoot him, or(in your case) cow him by the Power of the HumanEye; but the way of the Tao is to take no particularnotice. (This, incidentally, is not such bad Magick;the diversion of your attention might very wellresult in your becoming invisible, as I have ex-plained in a previous letter.) The theory appears tobe that, although your effort to save yourself issuccessful, it is bound to create a disturbance ofequilibrium elsewhere, with results equally disas-trous. Even more so; it might be that to be eaten bya tiger is just what you needed in your careerthrough the incarnations; at that moment theremight well be a vacancy somewhere exactly whereit will do most good to your Great Work. When youpress on one spot, you make a corresponding bulgein another, as we often see a beautiful lady, un-happy about her waist-line, adopt drastic measures,and transform herself into the semblance of a PouterPuffin!In theory, I am particularly pleased about thisMethod, because it goes for everybody, requires noknowledge, no technical training, “no nuffin.” Allthe same, it won’t do for me, except in a muchmodified form, and in very special cases; becauseno course of action (or inaction) is conceivable thatwould do great violence to my nature.So let me worry along, please, with the accent onthe “along;” I will grin and bear it, or, if it gets so badthat I can’t do my Work, I will make the necessaryeffort to abate the nuisance, always most careful todo as little damage as possible to the main currentof my total Energy.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXIIITHE GOLDEN MEANCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You would think that one who like myself hasthe Sun, the Lord of His Horoscope, in Libra, withVenus who rules that sign in close conjunction withhim, with Saturn trine, Uranus sextile, Mars squareand Luna quincunx to him, would wear the GoldenMean as a breastplate, flaunt it on my banneret,quarter it on my escutcheon, and grave it on the two-edged blade of my thrice trusty falchion!Just so, objects that instinct itself! “Had youbeen born a few hours earlier, with Aries rising, itslord Mars aggravated by the square of Sol andVenus, you would indeed have been a Wild Man ofthe Woods, arrogant, bigoted, domineering, inca-pable of seeing a second side to any question,headstrong, haughty, a seething hell-broth of hate;and this fact disables your judgment.”All perfectly true. My equable nature is congeni-tally hostile to extreme measures, except in imagi-nation. I cannot bear sudden violent movements.Climbing rocks, people used to say that I didn’tclimb them, that I oozed over them!This explains, I think, my deep-seated dislike ofmany passages in The Boot of the Law. “O prophet!thou hast ill will to learn this writing. I see thee hatethe hand & the pen; but I am stronger.” (AL II, 10-11.)Well, what is the upshot of all this? It answersyour question about the value to be attached to thisGolden Mean. There is no rule about it; your ownattitude is proper for yourself, and has no value foranybody else. But you must make sure exactly whatthat attitude actually is, deep down.Let us go back for a moment to the passage abovequoted. The text goes on to give the reason for thefacts. “Because of me in Thee which thou knewestnot. for why? Because thou wast the knower, andme.” (AL II, 12-13.) The unexpected use or disuseof capitals, the queer syntax, the unintelligibility ofthe whole passage: these certainly indicate someprofound Qabalistic import in these texts.So we had better mark that Strictly Private, andforget it.One point, however, we have forgotten: althoughmy Libra inclinations do bias me personally, theyalso make me fair-minded, “a judge, and a goodjudge too” in the memorable phrase of the lateWilliam Schwenk Gilbert. So I will sum up what isto be said for and against this Golden Mean.As usual, nobody has taken the trouble to definethe term. We know that it was extolled by both theGreek and the Chinese philosophers; but I cannotsee that they meant much more than to counsel theavoidance of extremes, whether of measures or ofopinions; and to advocate moderation in all things.James Hilton has a most amusing Chinese in hisLost Horizon. When the American 100% he-man,mixer, joiner, and go-getter, agrees with him aboutbroadmindedness in religious beliefs, and ends “andI’m dead sure you’re right!” his host mildly rebukeshim, saying: “But we are only moderately sure.”Such thought plumbs the Abysses of Wisdom; atleast, it may quite possibly do so. Forgive me if Iemulate the teacher!But this is not as simple as it sounds. There isgreat danger in this Golden Mean, one of whosemain objects is to steer clear of shipwreck, Scyllabeing as fatal as Charybdis. No, this lofty andequable attitude is worse than wrong unless itderives from striking the balance between two verydistant opposites. One of the worst perils of thepresent time is that, in the reaction against ignorantbigotry, people no longer dare to make up theirminds about anything. The very practice, which theA∴A∴ so strongly and persistently advocates,tends to make people feel that any positive attitudeor gesture is certainly wrong, whatever may beright. They forget that the opposite may, within thelimit of the universe of discourse, amount to noth-ing.They fall into flabbiness.I avoid this — see the example at the very outsetof this letter — by saying: “Yes, I hate so-and-solike hell; I want to exterminate the very memory ofthe bastard from the earth, after I have personallysuperintended having him ‘Seven years a-killing’winding up by hanging, disembowelling, and quar-tering him. But of course I’m not necessarily rightabout this in any sense; it is merely that I happenedto be born the kind of man that feels like that!”Of course, in no case does the Golden Meanadvise hesitating, trimming, hedging, compromis-ing; the very object of ensuring an exact balance inyour weapon is that its blow may be clean andcertain.You know how all our faults love to disguisethemselves as virtues; very often, as what ourneighbours call virtues, not what we ourselvesthink them. We are all ashamed to be ourselves; andthis is sheer, stark stultification. For we are our-selves; we cannot get away from it; all our hypoc-risies and shams are just as much part of ourselvesas what we like to think is the real man. All that wedo when we make these pretenses is to set upinternal strain and conflict; there is nothing objec-tive in it. Instead of adding to our experience, whichis the Great Work, we shut ourselves up in thiscitadel of civil turmoil; it is the Formula of theBlack Brothers.The Golden Mean is more valuable as the ex-tremes which it summarizes are distant from eachother; that is the plain mechanics of the lever.So don’t pay too much attention to these re-marks; they are no more than the quiet firesidereflections of a man who has spent all his lifebreaking records. The Golden Mean at its best canonly keep you from extravagant blunders; it willnever get you anywhere.The Book of the Law constantly implies a verydifferent policy; listen to its climax-exhortation:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears49“But exceed! exceed!” (AL II, 71.)Remember that which is written: “Moderatestrength rings the bell: great strength returns thepenny.” It is always the little bit extra that bringshome the bacon. It is the last attack that breaksthrough the enemy position. Water will never boil,however long you keep it at 99° C. You may findthat a Pranayama cycle of 10-20-30 brings no resultin months; put it up to 10-20-40, and Dhyanacomes instantly. When in doubt, push just a little bitharder. You have no means of finding out what areexactly the right conditions for success in any prac-tice; but all practices are alike in one respect; thedesired result is in the nature of orgasm.I guess that’s about what I think.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXIVTHE TAO. ICara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.This is the hardest question you have yet put tome: to explain the Tao. The only proper answerwould be Silence, trusting to the slow dispersionand absorption of the disturbance created by yourasking it. In that sentence there lies, really, thewhole explanation; but I see well enough that itwon’t do for you. You are not yet old or wiseenough to understand that the only way to clearmuddy water is to leave it alone. Still, you doubtlessexpect me to tell you just how that comes to pass; Iwill not disappoint you. First of all, what is the Tao?No proposed equivalent in any other languagecomes within a billion light-years of giving even anapproximation. For one thing, it is itself a paradox;for another, it has several meanings which areapparently quite distinct. For instance, one sinologistcalls it “Reason”; another, “The Way”; another“Tat” or “Shiva”. These are all true in one sense oranother. My own “White Hope” (see The Book ofThoth) is to identify it with the Qabalistic Zero.This last attribution is useful, as I will show pres-ently, for hard practical reasons; it is an assumptionwhich indicates the method of the Old Wise Onewho approaches the Tao.As you know, the supreme classic of this subject,is the Tao Teh King; and I must suppose that youhave read this in at least one of the several transla-tions, else I should have to start by pushing my ownversion at you. (This has been ready for a quarter ofa century, and I seem to be unable to get it printed!)None of these published translations, learned andadmirable though they may be as such, can be of useexcept to familiarize you with the terminology; fornot one of these scholars has the most nebulous ideaof what Laotze was talking about. I can hardly hopeto emphasize sternly enough how deep and wide isthe “Great Gulf fixed” between the initiate and theprofane, when questions of this kind are on theMagic Carpet. Suppose you were transported (onthat Carpet!) to a planet where the highest means ofreproduction was germination; try to make thedenizens understand Catullus, Shelley, Rossetti, orEmily Brontë! It is, honestly, quite as bad as that.How can anyone grasp the idea of perfect andabsolute negation being at the same time the solemotive force of all that exists?“Tao hath no will to work;But by its influence evenThe Moon and Sun rejoice to runAmong the starry Seven.”King Kang Khing.The Book of the Law states the doctrine of Taovery succinctly:“...thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that,and no other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuagedof purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is everyway perfect.”(AL I, 42-44)“Thus also the Sage, seeking not any goal,attaineth all things; he does not interfere in theaffairs of his body, and so that body acteth withoutfriction. It is because he meddleth not with hispersonal aims that these come to pass with simplic-ity.”Tao Teh King, VII, 2.The ideal analogy seems to be that of a planet inits orbit. It has its “true motion;” it meets theminimum of friction from circumambient space.When it suffers the attraction of another body, itsways slightly to make the proper adjustment with-out effort or argument; it can, consequently, con-tinue indefinitely in its orbit.This is roughly the plan of the Taoist in hisattitude to life. Having ascertained the Path whichsatisfies the equations of his Nature (as we say,“found his True Will”) he continues “without lustof result,” acting only when it happens to be neces-sary to adjust himself to any external stress thataffects him, and so proceeds happily“thinking of a wayTo feed oneself on batter,And so go on from day to dayGetting a little fatter.”— assuming that his “True Will” is of that variety.Basil King Lamus asserts this in The Diary of ADrug Fiend when he says: “If I were a dog, I shouldbark; if I were an owl, I should hoot.” It is rather likethe pattern in the game of dominoes; you put thecard that matches. No other consideration comesinto it at all.It is the extreme simplicity of this idea whichbaffles people’s minds, and the universal quality ofimpatience which makes everybody fidget, and soinjure the delicacy of the “fine adjustment” which isthe essence of the work.When I used to climb rocks, I never jumped, Inever grabbed, I never made a sudden or a violentmovement; therefore, with thin smooth arms like ayoung girl’s, and legs, tough enough it is true butalways slow and steady, I used to find myself at thetop of pitches that had beaten all the gymnasts.In every sport worth the name one may observesimilar facts. Consider the delicacy required for bigbreaks at billiards; the problem is always to securefavourable readjustment with a minimum of distur-bance. Of course, there are positions which demanddrastic treatment; but that is the best evidence thatthe balls have got into the worst possible mess fromyour point of view. But it was an exquisitely deli-cate “safety shot” that got them like that. True, thereare games in which brute force is the way to victory;but such games never make progress in themselves.The “tug-of-war” or “tossing the caber” are exactlyas they were fifty — or five hundred — years ago.Contrast the advance in “positional” chess!Oh yes, this is all old stuff! Of course it is; but itremains a useful sort of basis for meditation whenyou are seeking to understand one aspect of theWay of the Tao.Anyhow (you protest) this is getting away fromthe question as to what Tao actually is. Good; butI want you to abstain from trying to make anintellectual image of it, still less to visualize it. Itried at one time to do something of the sort with theFourth Dimension: Hinton gives a practice involv-ing complex patterns of cubes; and I was never ableto make anything of it.As I said above, it is a matter of Neschamah; butwhat follows may help you.Why is the Tao translated “Reason”? Becauseby “Reason” is here meant the structure of the minditself; a Buddhist who had succeeded withMahasatipatthana might call it the Consciousnesssof the Tendency to Perceive the Sensation of Any-thing. For in the last resort, and through the pursuitof one line of analysis, this structure is all that wecan call our consciousness. Everything of which wecan in any way be aware may be interpreted as beingsome function of this structure.Note! Function. For now we see why Tao mayalso be translated “The Way”; for it is the motion ofthe structure that we observe. There is no Beingapart from Going.You are familiar with the Four Powers of theSphinx, attributed by the Adepts of old time to theirFour Elements. Air is to Know, Scire; Fire is toWill, Velle; Water is to Dare, Audere; and Earth isto Keep Silence, Tacere. But now that a fifth Ele-ment, spirit, is generally recognized in the Qabalah,I have deemed it proper to add a Fifth Powercorresponding: to Go, Ire. (Book of Thoth, p. 275)Then, as Spirit is the Origin, the Essence, and theSum of the other four, so is to Go in relation to thosepowers. And to Go is the very meaning of the nameGod, as elsewhere shewn in these letters; hence theEgyptian Gods were signalized as such by theirbearing the Ankh, which is a Sandal-strap, and in itsform the Crux Ansata, the Rosy Cross, the meanswhereby we demonstrate the Godhead of our Na-ture. See then how sweetly each idea slides into thenext! How right this is, that the Quintessence shouldbe dynamic and not static! For if there were someform of Being separate from Going, it would neces-sarily be subject to decay; and, in any case, a thingimpossible to apprehend, since apprehension isitself an Act, not an idea immobile which would bebound to change in the very moment of grasping it.As I have tried to shew in another letter, the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears50“Point-Event” (or whatever it is) of which we areaware is a change, or, less inaccurately, the memoryof one; the things that change remain relentlesslyunknown.It does seem to me, young woman, that youought to go over these ideas again and again,familiarizing yourself intimately with this processof passing from one to another, so intimately that itbecomes automatic and spontaneous for you to runround the circle in perfectly frictionless ease; forotherwise your mind will be forever pestering youall your life, and even your conscience reproachingyou; they will say “But you have never got adefinite answer to any single one of your originalquestions.” We are all — most of us, anyhow —born with this hankering after the definite; it is ourweakness that yearns for repose. We do not see thatthis is death; if any of these answers could be cut offshort and neatly trimmed with paper frills like aham, it would no longer be even an approximationto truth.I am quite sure that this is the Doctrine of theTao, and of opinion that no other body of teachingputs forward its thought more clearly or moresimply.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXVTHE TAO. IICara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You are only one of a number of people who areinterested in my translation of the Tao Teh King.Naturally, I want to publish it; but so many otherthings come first. So I am sending you the Introduc-tion, in the hope that it will stimulate that interest tothe point of getting some other publisher to give itsea-room.I bound myself to devote my life to Magick atEaster 1898 (era vulgari) and received my firstinitiation on November 18 of that year.My friend and climbing companion, OscarEckenstein, gave me my first instructions in learn-ing the control of the mind early in 1901, in MexicoCity. Shri Parananda, Solicitor General of Ceylon,an eminent writer upon, and teacher of, Yoga fromthe orthodox Shaivite standpoint, and BhikkhuAnanda Metteya, (Allan Bennett) the great EnglishAdept, who was one of my earliest instructors inMagick, and joined the Sangha in Burma in 1902,gave me my first groundings in mystical theory andpractice. I spent some months of 1901 in Kandy,Ceylon with the latter, until success crowned mywork.I also studied all varieties of Asiatic philosophy,especially with regard to the practical question ofspiritual development, the Sufi doctrines, theUpanishads, the Sankhra, Veda and Vedanta, theBaghavad-Gita and Purana, the Dammapada,and many other classics, together with numerouswritings on the Tantra and Yoga of such men asPatanjali, Vivekananda, etc., etc. Not a few of theseteachings are as yet wholly unknown to scholars. Imade the scope of my studies as comprehensive aspossible, omitting no school of thought howeverunimportant or repugnant.I made a critical examination of all these teach-ers in the light of my practical experience. Thephysiological and psychological uniformity ofmankind guaranteed that the diversity of expres-sion concealed a unity of significance. This discov-ery was confirmed, furthermore, by reference toJewish, Greek, and Celtic traditions. One quintes-sential truth was common to all cults, from theHebrides to the Yellow Sea; and even the mainbranches proved essentially identical. It was onlythe foliage that exhibited incompatibility.When I walked across China in 1905-6, I wasfully armed and accoutred by the above qualifica-tions to attack the till-then-insoluble problem of theChinese conception of religious truth. Practicalstudies of the psychology of such Mongolians as Ihad met in my travels, had already suggested to methat their acentric conception of the universe mightrepresent the correspondence in consciousness oftheir actual psychological characteristics. I wastherefore prepared to examine the doctrines of theirreligious and philosophic Masters without preju-dice such as had always rendered nugatory theefforts of missionary sinologists; indeed, all orien-tal scholars with the single exception of Rhys Davids.Until his time, translators had invariably assumed,with absurd naivété, or (more often) arrogant big-otry, that a Chinese writer must be putting fortheither a more or less distorted and degraded varia-tion of some Christian conception, or utterly puerileabsurdities. Even so great a man as Max Müller, inhis introduction to the Upanishads, seems only halfinclined to admit that the apparent triviality andfolly of many passages in these so-called sacredwritings might owe their appearance to our igno-rance of the historical and religious circumstances,a knowledge of which would render them intelli-gible.During my solitary wanderings among the moun-tainous wastes of Yun Nan, the spiritual atmo-sphere of China penetrated my consciousness, thanksto the absence of any intellectual impertinencesfrom the organ of knowledge. The Tao Teh Kingrevealed its simplicity and sublimity to my soul,little by little, as the conditions of my physical, noless than of my spiritual life, penetrated the sanctu-aries of my spirit. The philosophy of Lao Tzecommunicated itself to me, in despite of the persis-tent efforts of my mind to compel it to conform withmy preconceived notions of what the text mustmean. This process, having thus taken root in myinnermost intuition during those tremendous monthsof wandering Yun Nan, grew continually through-out succeeding years. Whenever I found myselfable once more to withdraw myself from the dissi-pations and distractions which contact with civili-zation forces upon a man, no matter how vigorouslyhe may struggle against their insolence, to thesacred solitude of the desert, whether among thesierras of Spain or the sands of the Sahara, I foundthat the philosophy of Lao Tze resumed its swayupon my soul, subtler and stronger on each succes-sive occasion.But neither Europe nor Africa can show anysuch desolation as America. The proudest,stubbornest, bitterest peasant of deserted Spain, themost primitive and superstitious Arab of the remot-est oases, are a little more than kin and never lessthan kind at their worst; whereas in the UnitedStates one is almost always conscious of an instinc-tive lack of sympathy and understanding with eventhe most charming and cultured people. It wastherefore during my exile in America that the doc-trines of Lao Tze developed most rapidly in mysoul, ever forcing their way outwards until I felt itimperious, nay inevitable, to express them in termsof conscious thought.No sooner had this resolve taken possession ofme than I realized that the task approximated toimpossibility. His very simplest ideas, the primitiveelements of his thought, had no true correspon-dences in any European terminology. The very firstword “Tao” presented a completely insoluble prob-lem. It had been translated “Reason”, “The Way”,“το ον”. None of these convey any true conceptionof the Tao.The Tao is reason in this sense, that the substanceof things may be in part apprehended as being thatnecessary relation between the elements of thoughtwhich determines the laws of reason. In other words,the only reality is that which compels us to connectthe various forms of illusion as we do. It is thusevidently unknowable, and expressible neither byspeech nor by silence. All that we can know aboutit is that there is inherent in it a power (whichhowever is not itself) by virtue whereof all beingsappear in forms congruous with the nature of neces-sity.The Tao is also “the Way” — in the followingsense. Nothing exists except as a relation with othersimilarly postulated ideas. Nothing can be knownin itself, but only as one of the participants in a seriesof events. Reality is therefore in the motion, not inthe thing moved. We cannot apprehend anythingexcept as one postulated element of an observedimpression of change.We may express this in other terms as follows.Our knowledge of anything is in reality the sum ofour observations of its successive movements, thatis to say, of its path from event to event. In this sensethe Tao may be translated as “the Way”. It is not athing in itself in the sense of being an object suscep-tible of apprehension by sense or mind. It is not thecause of any thing; it is rather the category underly-ing all existence or event, and therefore true and realas they are illusory, being merely landmarks in-vented for convenience in describing our experi-ences. The Tao possesses no power to cause any-thing to exist or to take place. Yet our experiencewhen analyzed tells us that the only reality of whichwe may be sure is this path or Way which resumesthe whole of our knowledge.As for το ον, which superficially might seem the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears51best translation of Tao as described in the text, it isthe most misleading of the three. For το ον pos-sesses an extensive connotation implying a wholesystem of Platonic concepts, than which nothingcan be more alien to the essential quality of the Tao.Tao is neither “being” nor “not being” in any sensewhich Europe could understand. It is neither exist-ence, nor a condition or form of existence. Equally,το μη ον gives no idea of Tao. Tao is altogetheralien to all that class of thought. From its connectionwith “that principle which necessarily underlies thefact that events occur” one might suppose that the“Becoming” of Heraclitus might assist us to de-scribe the Tao. But the Tao is not a principle at allof that kind. To understand it requires an altogetherdifferent state of mind to any with which Europeanthinkers in general are familiar. It is necessary topursue unflinchingly the path of spiritual develop-ment on the lines indicated by the Sufis, the Hindusand the Buddhists; and, having reached the trancecalled Nerodha-Sammapati, in which are destroyedall forms soever of consciousness, there appears inthat abyss of annihilation the germ of an entirelynew type of idea, whose principal characteristic isthis: that the entire concatenation of One’s previousexperiences and conceptions could not have hap-pened at all, save by virtue of this indescribablenecessity.I am only too painfully aware that the aboveexposition is faulty in every respect. In par-ticular, it presupposes in the reader consider-able familiarity with the subject, thus practi-cally begging the question. It must also provealmost wholly unintelligible to the averagereader, him in fact whom I especially aim tointerest.For his sake I will try to elucidate the matter byan analogy. Consider electricity. It would be absurdto say that electricity is any of the phenomena bywhich we know it. We take refuge in the petitioprincipii of saying that electricity is that form ofenergy which is the principal cause of such and suchphenomena. Suppose now that we eliminate thisidea as evidently illogical. What remains? We mustnot hastily answer “Nothing remains”. There issome thing inherent in the nature of consciousness,reason, perception, sensation, and of the universe ofwhich they inform us, which is responsible for thefact that we observe these phenomena and notothers; that we reflect upon them as we do, and nototherwise. But, even deeper than this, part of thereality of the inscrutable energy which determinesthe form of our experience, consists in determiningthat experience should take place at all. It should beclear that this has nothing to do with any of thePlatonic conceptions of the nature of things.The least abject asset in the intellectual bank-ruptcy of European thought is the Hebrew Qabalah.Properly understood, it is a system of symbolismindefinitely elastic, assuming no axioms, postulat-ing no principles, asserting no theorems, and there-fore adaptable, if managed adroitly, to describe anyconceivable doctrine. It has been my continualstudy since 1898, and I have found it of infinitevalue in the study of the “Tao Teh King.” By its aidI was able to attribute the ideas of Lao Tze to anorder with which I was exceedingly familiar, andwhose practical worth I had repeatedly proved byusing it as the basis of the analysis and classificationof all Aryan and Semitic religions and philosophies.Despite the essential difficulty of correlating theideas of Lao Tze with any others, the persistentapplication of the Qabalistic keys eventually un-locked his treasure-house. I was able to explain tomyself his teachings in terms of familiar systems.This achievement broke the back of my Sphinx.Having once reduced Lao Tze to Qabalistic form, itwas easy to translate the result into the language ofphilosophy. I had already done much to create anew language based on English with the assistanceof a few technical terms borrowed from Asia, andabove all by the use of a novel conception of the ideaof Number and of algebraic and arithmetical proce-dure to convey the results of spiritual experience tointelligent students.It is therefore not altogether without confidencethat I present this translation of the Tao Teh King tothe public. I hope and believe that careful study ofthe text, as elucidated by my commentary, willenable serious aspirants to the hidden Wisdom tounderstand (with fair accuracy) what Lao Tzetaught. It must however be laid to heart that theessence of his system will inevitably elude intellec-tual apprehension, unless it be illuminated fromabove by actual living experience of the truth. Suchexperience is only to be attained by unswervingapplication to the practices which he advocates.Nor must the aspirant content himself with the mereattainment of spiritual enlightenment, however sub-lime. All such achievements are barren unless theybe regarded as the means rather than the end ofspiritual progress; allowed to infiltrate every detailof the life, not only of the spirit, but of the senses.The Tao can never be known until it interprets themost trivial actions of every day routine. It is a fatalmistake to discriminate between the spiritual im-portance of meditation and playing golf. To do so isto create an internal conflict. “Let there be nodifference made among you between any one thing& any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.”He who knows the Tao knows it to be the source ofall things soever; the most exalted spiritual ecstasyand the most trivial internal impression are fromour point of view equally illusions, worthless masks,which hide, with grotesque painted pasteboard falseand lifeless, the living face of truth. Yet, fromanother point of view, they are equally expressionsof the ecstatic genius of truth — natural images ofthe reaction between the essence of one’s self andone’s particular environment at the moment of theiroccurrence. They are equally tokens of the Tao bywhom, in whom, and of whom, they are. To valuethem for themselves is to deny the Tao and to be lostin delusion. To despise them is to deny the omni-presence of the Tao, and to suffer the illusion ofsorrow. To discriminate between them is to set upthe accursed dyad, to surrender to the insanity ofintellect, to overwhelm the intuition of truth, and tocreate civil war in the consciousness.From 1905 to 1918 the Tao Teh King was mycontinual study. I constantly recommended it to myfriends as the supreme masterpiece of initiatedwisdom, and I was as constantly disappointed whenthey declared that it did not impress them, espe-cially as my preliminary descriptions of the bookhad aroused their keenest interest. I thus came to seethat the fault lay with Legge’s translation, and I feltmyself impelled to undertake the task of presentingLao Tze in language informed by the sympatheticunderstanding which initiation and spiritual expe-rience had conferred on me. During my GreatMagical Retirement on Aesopus Island in theHudson River during the summer of 1918, I setmyself to this work, but I discovered immediatelythat I was totally incompetent. I therefore appealedto an Adept named Amalantrah, with whom I wasat that time in almost daily communication. Hecame readily to my aid, and exhibited to me a codexof the original, which conveyed to me with absolutecertitude the exact significance of the text. I wasable to divine without hesitation or doubt the pre-cise manner in which Legge had been deceived. Hehad translated the Chinese with singular fidelity,yet in almost every verse the interpretation wasaltogether misleading. There was no need to refer tothe text from the point of view of scholarship. I hadmerely to paraphrase his translation in the light ofactual knowledge of the true significance of theterms employed. Any one who cares to take thetrouble to compare the two versions will be as-tounded to see how slight a remodeling of a para-graph is sufficient to disperse the obstinate obscu-rity of prejudice, and let loose a fountain and a floodof living light; to kindle the gnarled prose of stolidscholarship into the burgeoning blossom of lyricalflame.I completed my translation within three days,but during the last twenty years I have constantlyreconsidered every sentence. The manuscript hasbeen lent to a number of friends, scholars who havecommended my work, and aspirants who haveappreciated its adequacy to present the spirit of theMaster’s teaching. Those who had been disap-pointed with Legge’s version were enthusiasticabout mine. This circumstance is in itself sufficientto assure me that Love’s labour has not been lost,and to fill me with enthusiastic confidence that thepresent publication will abundantly contribute tothe fulfillment of my True Will for which I came toearth. Let us wring from labour and sorrow theutmost of which humanity is capable. Fulfill myWill to open the portals of spiritual attainment tomy fellowmen, to bring them to the enjoyment ofthat realization of Truth, beneath all veils of tempo-ral falsehood, which has enlightened mine eyes andfilled my mouth with song.So there you are.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears52CHAPTER XXXVIQUO STET OLYMPUS: WHERE THEGODS, ANGELS, ETC. LIVECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.We settled what Gods, angels, demons,elementals were some little while ago; we alsowrote of how they live, so now, insatiable Seeker,you ask where.But surely, even as a child — did you not singthat immemorial Gregorian plain-chant“There’s a Friend for little childrenAbove the bright blue sky.”Simple enough. A nice flat earth: sun, moon,stars, planets, satellites hung up to dry, with occa-sional meteorites and comets jazzing about to varythe monotony; above all that, this bright blue floorbased upon Reckitts’ and advertisements for theRiviera.Just like that. And above that again, the JewJeweller’s hashish dream of heaven: see the Apoca-lypse. A vulgarization of Baudelaire’s still, shin-ing, mirror world!How right Rome was when she put her foot downon great Galileo and his upstart kind! But she didnot do the job properly. She should have brewed abogus bogey-tale to frighten people off astronomyfor ever. But perhaps it was already too late! Themischief had struck roots too deep for her.What had these wizards wrought?Those lovely mediaeval Charts Celestial thatstill enchant us by sheer beauty and sublimity hadbeen made mockery by those sinister adepts ofsorcery!No more flat earth on four pillars — on? —In India the earth was supported by an elephantwho stood on tortoise — who ....? No floor above.Nothing but empty space with swarming galaxies;no room for “heaven”. Simpler to call Olympus orMeru the home of the Gods — believe it or not!don’t ask questions!Yet all the time the difficulty is of our own sillymaking. The most elementary consideration of thenature of Gods, angels, demons, and the rest, asshown by their peculiar faculties, stamps them allinstantly as Beings pertaining to more than threedimensions! Just as no number of lines is enough toproduce the smallest plain, as a cube is capable ofcontaining an infinite number of squares, so, farfrom there being no room for heaven, there isabsolutely nothing but room!Yet of course the nature of that space is for everincomprehensible, nay inconceivable, by any beingof a lower dimension. Only when we have suc-ceeded in uniting our Conscious (three-dimensional)with our Unconscious (four-dimensional) Self canwe expect even a symbolic conception of howthings go on “in them furrin parts.”Speculation on such points is unpardonably prof-itless; I have only devoted these few paragraphs tothe subject because it is useful to rebut the some-what soapbox type of critic who thinks to rebut thewhole thesis “Sunt Daemones” by the snook-cock-ing query “Quo Stet Olympus.”Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXVIIDEATH — FEAR — “MAGICALMEMORY”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You ask me, very naturally, for details of thepromise of Nuit (AL I, 58) “... certainty, not faith,while in life, upon death; ...”In the first place, I think that it means what itsays. There may be, probably is, some Qabalisticinner meaning: Those four nouns most assuredlylook as if there were; but I don’t feel at all sure whatthe Greek (or Hebrew, or Arabic) words would be;in any case, I have not yet made any attempt in thisdirection.To the straightforward promise, then! Certainlyno word more reassuring could be given. But avoidanxiety, of course; remember “without lust of re-sult,” and AL III, 16: “Deem not too eagerly to catchthe promises; ...” Now, full speed ahead!Like most promises of this type, it is, one mustsuppose, conditional.Such a power is clearly of the Siddhi; and myinstinct tells me that it is a result of devotion to OurLady of the Stars. Somehow I can’t think of it as asort of Birthday Present to a Favourite Nephew.“Why not?” You’re right, as usual: anything maybe a “Play of Nuit.” Still, I feel that this would be arare case.“But doesn’t everything have to happen to ev-erybody?” Yes, of course, in a sense; but don’t keepon interrupting! I was coming to something inter-esting.I insist of putting forth the immediately usefulpoint of view: “devotion to Nuit” must mean theeager pursuit of the fulfillment of all possibilities,however unpleasant.Good: now see how logical this is. For how elsecould one have reasonable “certainty,” as contrarywith “faith” (= interior conviction), otherwise thanby the acquisition of the “Magical Memory” — thememory of former lives. And this must evidentlyinclude that of former deaths. Indeed “Freudianforgetfulness” is very pertinacious on such themes;the shock of death makes it a matter of displayingthe most formidable courage to go over in one’smind the incidents of previous deaths. You recallthe Buddhist “Ten Impurities;” — The DrownedCorpse, the Gnawed-by-wild-beasts-Corpse, andthe rest.Magick (though I says it as shouldn’t) gives avery full and elaborate account of this Memory, andLiber CMXIII (Thisarb) a sound Official Instruc-tion on the two main methods of acquiring thisfaculty.(None of my writings, by the way, deal with theFirst Method; this is because I could never makeany headway with it; none at all. F∴ Iehi Aour, onthe other hand, was a wizard at it; he thought thatsome people could use that way, and others not:born so.If it should happen that you have that faculty,and no gift at all for the other, it’s just too bad; you’dbetter buzz off, and get another Holy Guru less one-legged.)There are, however, as I find on reading overwhat I have written elsewhere, quite a few lacunaein the exposition; and I may as well now do my bestto stop one or two obvious gaps.The period of my life which was the climax of mywork on this subject is those weeks of Thaumaturgyon the Hudson River — I fear the Magical DiaryThe Hermit of Aesopus Island is irretrievably lost— when I was shown the Codex of the Tao TehKing from which my (still unpublished) translationis taken, and when the veil was no more than ashimmering, scintillating gossamer, translucent tothe ineffable glory that glows behind it. For in thoseweeks I was able to remember and record a reallyconsiderable number of past lives. (I half believe,and hope, that the relevant passages were copiedinto one of my Cefalu diaries; but who will strugglethrough those still extant on the chance?)“But what about the intervals?” you ask,Shabash! Rem acu tetigisti.It strikes me with immense and poignant powera right shrewd blow — what of the other side? Whatof the periods between successive incarnations?Let us look back for a moment to Little EssaysToward Truth and see what it says about the Fabricof a man. (No, I’m not dodging your query: I’ll getthere in my own good time. Let a fellow breathe!)Nothing to our purpose, as your smiling shake ofthe head advises me. And yet — The theory is thatthe Supernal Triad constitutes (or, rather, is animage of) the “eternal” Essence of a man; that is, itis the positive expression of that ultimate “Point ofView” which is and is not and neither is nor is notetc. Quite indestructible.Now when a man spends his life (a) building upand developing the six Sephiroth of the Ruach sothat they cohere closely in proper balance andrelation, (b) in forging, developing and maintaininga link of steel between this solid Ruach and thatTriad, Death merely means the dropping off of theNephesch (Malkuth) so that the man takes over hisinstrument of Mind (Ruach) with him to his nextsuitably chosen vehicle. The tendency of the Ruachis of course to disintegrate more or less rapidlyunder the impact of its new experiences of after-death conditions.(Hence the supposed Messages from the MightyDead, usually Wish-phantasms or outbreaks of theduring-life-suppressed Subconscious, often verynasty. The “Medium” gets into communicationwith the “Shells of the Dead” — Qliphoth, theQabalah calls them. A month or so, perhaps a yearor so in the case of minds very solidly constructedor very passionately attached, and the Shells’ “Mes-sages” begin to be less and less coherent, more andmore fragmentary, more murderously modified bythe experiences it has met in its aimless wanderings.Soon it is altogether broken up, and no more is"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears53heard of it.)It is therefore of the very first importance to trainthe mind in every possible way, and to bind it to theHigher Principles by steady, by constant, by flam-ing Aspiration, fortified by the sternest discipline,and by continuously reformulated Oaths.Such a man will be fully occupied after his deathwith the unremitting search for his new instrument;he will brush aside — as he has made a habit ofdoing during life — the innumerable lures of “Re-ward” and the like. (I am not going to ask you towaste any time on the fantastic fairy tales ofDevachan, Kama Loka and the rest; this must comeup if you want to know about Paccheka-Buddhas,Skooshoks, the Brahma-lokas and so on — but notnow, please!)There is one Oath more important than all therest put together, from the point of view of theA∴A∴ You swear to refuse all the “rewards,” toacquire your new vehicle without a moment’s de-lay, so that you may carry on your work of helpingMankind with the minimum of interruption. Likeall true Magical Oaths, it is certain of success.So then we have a man not only very wellprepared to reincarnate at once — this means aboutsix months after his death, for his vehicle will be afoetus about three months old, but to extirpate moredeliberately all impressions that may assail its in-tegrity.Alternatively, there may be something in thenature of such impressions that is unsuitable forcarrying over into the conscious mind of the newman. Or there may be a rule — e.g. the draught ofthe waters of the River Lethe — and it might bepossible for some Adept (whose initiation is of ahigher degree than, or of a different type to, mine)to make his way through that particular barrier.Enough of may, might, perhaps, and all thatharpy brood! The plain fact is that I remembernothing at all of any Post Mortem experiences, andI have never known anyone else who does.There is one exception. I do remember the first,almost momentary, reaction. I am in my AstralForm, in my best Sunday-go-to-meeting Ceremo-nial Vestments, and with my Wand — I seem tohold this raised, attaching great importance to theact — looking down upon the corpse, exactly as onedoes at the outset of an “Astral Journey” in one’sdays of learning how to do it.I recall no impression at all made by this sight;neither regret nor relief nor even surprise.But there is one intensely strong reaction — Ifancy I have mentioned this already — when onefirst remembers one of one’s deaths: “By Jove! thatwas a narrow squeak!”What was it that one feared? I haven’t the foggi-est.And that is what I had to tell you about theMagical Memory........No: just one point to go to sleep on: suppose twoor more people claim simultaneously to have beenJulius Caesar, or Shakespeare, or — oh! alwaysone very great gun! Well, fifty or sixty years ago ormore there was a regular vogue for this sort of thing,especially among women. It was usually Cleopatraor Mary Queen of Scots or Marie Antoinette: some-thing regal and tragic preferred, but unsurpassablebeauty the prime essential as one would expect.Of the Mary Queen of Scots persuasion was oldLady Caithness, who seems moreover to have hada sense of humour into the bargain, for she gave adinner-party in Paris to twelve other ladies, each ofwhom had also been the luckless victim of HenryVIII’s failure to produce of his own loins a durablemale succession. (His marriages were so manydesperate efforts to save England from a secondinnings of the devastation of the Wars of the Roses,from which his father, who was not a miser, but asound financier and economist, had rescued thecountry. You must understand this if English His-tory is to be at all intelligible to you. The tragedybegan with the early death of the Black Prince; thesecond blow, that of Henry V coupled with thefutility of his son and the murder of Prince Edwardat Tewkesbury.)Well, that was a big laugh, of course; it tended todiscredit the whole theory of Reincarnation.Quite unnecessarily, if one looks a little deeper.What do I mean when I say that I think I wasEliphaz Lévi? No more than that I possess some ofhis most essential characteristics, and that some ofthe incidents in his life are remembered by me as myown. There doesn’t seem any impossibility aboutthese bundles of Sankhara being shared by two ormore persons. We certainly do not know enough ofwhat actually takes place to speak positively on anysuch point. Don’t lose any sleep over it.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XXXVIIIWOMAN — HER MAGICAL FORMULAIssa.Wine rots the liver; fever swells the spleen;Meat clogs the belly; dust inflames the eye;Stone irks the bladder: gout — plague — lep-rosy!Man born of woman is most full of trouble;God, a gorged fool that belches him, a bubble!But of all plagues wherewith a man is cursed,Take my word for it, woman is the worst!The World’s Tragedy.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Pibrock of Dhonuil Dhu,Kneel for the onset!”for this letter is to put Woman once and for ever inher place.But (as usual!) let us first of all make clear whatwe are to mean by Woman.Not that amorphous (or rather, as the poet says,“oniscoid with udders”) dull and clamorous lump,bovine, imbecile, giggling, truthless, nymphoma-niac yet sexless, malignant, interminable, of whomSchopenhauer rhapsodized in his most famous pan-egyric: apparently his sentimental softness under-stood only the best side of her. No! let us observe,shudder, and lay down the pen.That makes me feel better; my duty to con-science is done........The eternal antagonism between the sexes ismere illusion. As well suppose the male the enemyof the female screw. Understand the spiritual realityof each, grasp their magical formulae; the sublimenecessity of the apparent opposition will be appar-ent.The ultimate of Woman is Nuit; that of Man,Hadit. The Book of the Law speaks very fully andclearly in both cases. I quote the principal passages.A. Nuit.“Had! The manifestation of Nuit.” (1)“Come forth, o children, under the stars, & takeyour fill of love!“I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is inyours. My joy is to see your joy.“Above, the gemmed azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.The winged globe,the starry blue,Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!” (12-14)“... Since I am Infinite Space, and the InfiniteStars thereof, do ye also thus ...” (22)“... And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the con-sciousness of the continuity of existence, the omni-presence of my body1.” (26)“... O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it beever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but asNone; and let them speak not of thee at all, sincethou art continuous!” (27)“None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of thestars, and two.“For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chanceof union.“This is the creation of the world, that the pain ofdivision is as nothing, and the joy of dissolutionall.” (28-30)“Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of myknowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my lovewill redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it bythe vault of my body; by my sacred heart andtongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.”(32)“... the Law is for all.” (34)“I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty,not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutter-able, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacri-fice.“My incense is of resinous woods & gums; andthere is no blood therein: because of my hair thetrees of Eternity.“My number is 11, as all their numbers who are1 Dictated: “the unfragmentary non-atomic factof my universality ...

The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in theMiddle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black tothe blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing.Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.“But to love me is better than all things: if underthe night-stars in the desert thou presently burnestmine incense before me, invoking me with a pureheart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shaltcome a little to lie in my bosom....“... I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple,veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure andpurple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense,desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiledsplendour within you: come unto me!” (58-61)B. Hadit.“Nu! the hiding of Hadit.“Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath notyet been revealed. I, Hadit, am the complement ofNu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is thename of my House.“In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she,the circumference, is nowhere found.“Yet she shall be known & I never.” (1-4)“I am the flame that burns in every heart of man,and in the core of every star. I am Life, and the giverof Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of death.“I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am theaxle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. ‘Comeunto me’ is a foolish word: for it is I that go.“Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have wor-shipped me; ill, for I am the worshipper.” (6-8)“For I am perfect, being Not; and my number isnine by the fools; but with the just I am eight, andone in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed.The Empress and the King are not of me; for thereis a further secret.“I am the Empress & the Hierophant. Thuseleven, as my bride is eleven.” (15-16)“I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & De-light and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men withdrunkenness....” (22)“I am alone: there is no God where I am.” (23)“I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring:in my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I andmy Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, andshoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, andI and the earth are one.“There is great danger in me; for who doth notunderstand these runes shall make a great miss. Heshall fall down into the pit called Because, and therehe shall perish with the dogs of Reason.” (26-27)“Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thineheart?“Where I am these are not.“Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am notfor them. I console not: I hate the consoled & theconsoler.“I am unique & conqueror. I am not of the slavesthat perish....” (46-49)“Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: butthe red gleam is in my eyes; & my spangles arepurple & green.“Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher thaneyesight.” (50-51)Lest it should all prove too difficult, I have notquoted several passages which are completely be-yond my comprehension; even in those here setdown, there is quite a little that I should not care toboast that I had altogether clear in my own mind.Leaving out nearly everything, the only way tosimplify it is to call Hadit the “Point-of-view”, and“Anywhere” to be the radix of all possible “Point-Events,” or “experiences,” or “phenomena;” Nuitis the complement, the total possibilities of any suchradix. You can only get this properly into that partof your mind which is “above the Abyss,” i.e.Neschamah: even so, Neschamah must be verythoroughly fertilized by Chiah, and illuminated byJechidah, to make any sort of a job of it.But to come down from the contemplation ofAbstract Reality (which, being static and “infinite,”is ultimately immeasurable) to these Ideas in theirinteraction (and thus directly observable), it is easyenough to understand the Magical Formula of theirinteraction. Of course, whatever I say can be nomore than a rough approximation, even a sugges-tion rather than a statement; but I cannot help thenature of the case. Nuit is the centripetal energy,infinitely elastic because it must fit over the hardthrust directed against it; Hadit, the centrifugal,ever seeking to penetrate the unknown. Nuit is notto dissimilar from the Teh described in Lao-Tze.Nor would it be proper to ignore the Book ofLies:PEACHES“Soft and hollow, how thou dost overcome thehard and full!“It dies, it gives itself; to Thee is the fruit!“Be thou the Bride; thou shalt be the Motherhereafter.“To all impressions thus. Let them not overcomethee; yet let them breed within thee. The least of theimpressions, come to its perfection, is Pan.“Receive a thousand lovers; thou shalt bear butOne Child.“This child shall be the heir of Fate the Father.”(p. 12)I want you to realize that this collaboration of theequal opposites is the first condition of existence inany form. The trouble (I think) has always been thatnobody ever looked at things from outside; theywere always at one end or the other. This is becauseone haphazard collection of Point-Events choosesto think of itself as a Male; another, as a Female. Itis totally absurd to think of Winnie as a woman, andMartin as a man. The quintessence of each isidentical: “Every man and every woman is a star.”It is only a superficial accident that has made one setdetermine to function in one particular incarnationas the one or the other. I say function; for there is nodifference in the Quintessence.Yet, since it is with a Being in its presentfunction that one has to deal, it needs must that oneacts in practice as if “does” were the same as “was.”You might be described as one instance of the 0 =2 equation, and I as another; and any 0 = 2 isindistinguishable from any other. Yet you and I arenot identical, because all that I can know of you, oryou of me, is a presentation of a part of that 0 = 2“Universe;” if we were both equally conscious ofthat Whole, there would be no means of becomingaware, as we are in fact aware, of that distinction.Somewhat of this is perhaps intended in TheBook of the Law: “... Bind nothing! Let there be nodifference made among you between any one thing& any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.”“But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chiefof all!” (AL I, 22-23)Whoso availeth (i.e. can put to practical service)is of “presidential timber,” so to speak, because heis able to understand the Being behind the Function,and is accordingly not liable to be deceived by thefacet that happens to be presented to him in hisFunction corresponding.The case is not wholly unlike that of a man on amountain who should see two other peaks juttingup from a paten of cloud. Those tips give littleindication of the great mass that supports each; bothare equally of the one same planet; they are in factidentical save for the minute spire visible. Yet he,reconnoitering with intent to climb them observesclosely only that function of each crag and icefallwhich is relevant to his plan to reach their summits.He also is of that One Quintessence; but he must fithimself adroitly to each successive incident of therespective Functions of these mountains if he is tomake the contacts which will finally enable him torealize the Point-Events which he will summarizeas “I climbed Mount Collon and the Aiguille de laZa.”I don’t believe I can put it much better than that,and I’m too lazy to try; but I do want to emphasizethat Weininger (in Sex and Character) merelyscratched the surface. All of us, whether we are “fullof strange oaths and bearded like the pard” or “inour hours of ease Uncertain, coy, and hard toplease” do in every most minuscule sort of actexercise both the male and female functions almostequally; the determination is rarely more than amatter of a casting vote.It is so even in the embryo. It is much less than 1/10 of 1% that decides whether the foetus will turnout an Alexander or an Alice. Nature delights indelicate touches of this sort; it is one part of SulphuricAcid in I don’t remember how many million partsof water that is enough to turn blue litmus red; andeven with our own gross apparatus we can arrangefor a ten-thousandth part of a grain to send a scaledown with a bang. Think of a roulette ball hoveringon the edge at the end of a long spin! Think ofBuridan’s ass!So, once for all, shut up, you screaming parrot!Gabble, gabble, gabble, it’s enough to break one’stympana, and drive a man stark staring mad.Shut up!Shut up!!Shut UP!!!These women!"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears55Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. One ought, perhaps, to give an outline ofhow these facts work out in the social system ofThelema.It may be useful to classify women in threegroups, (I exclude the fourth, which anatomicallywoman, does not function in that capacity: the“spinster.”) corresponding to Isis, Osiris and Ho-rus.The Isis-Class consists of the mother-type. Tothem the man is no more than the necessary creatorand sustainer of her children.The Osiris-Class comprises those women whoare devoted to their man qua man, and to his career.Her children, if any, she values as reproductions ofthe Beloved; they carry him on into futurity byvirtue of her deathless love.The Horus-Class is composed of those womenwho remain children, the play-girls, who love onlyfor pleasure. To them a child is dull at the best, at theworst a nuisance.Each of these classes has its qualities and itsdefects; each should be held in equal, althoughdissimilar, honour.And what, you ask, has the man got to say aboutall this? Nothing simpler; all women are subordi-nate to his True Will. Only the Osiris-Class, pro-vided he can find one of them, are of more thantransient use to him; and even in this case, he mustbe careful to avoid being ensnared.But the really important issue is the recognitionof each type of True Will in woman.CHAPTER XXXIXPROPHECYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Now, now, now! I really had hoped that this atleast you might have spared me. Still, I have toadmit that your reason for asking me to go allpontifical about Prophecy is a good one; you wanta chucker-out for the loafers that come cadging intoyour Taverne de la Belle Sibylle, and waste yourtime with piffle about Pyramids.What a game!So naturally you need a Book of the Rules, anda list of the classes of offensive people, whetherprostitutes, policemen, or verminous persons. (Iquote from the Regulations for secular Pubs!) whothink the easiest of all possible refuges from theirFear (see other letters!) is reliance upon the mouldymumblings of moth-eater mountebanks.Perhaps it will be best to begin by setting downthe necessary conditions for a genuine prophecy.We shall find that most of the famous predictionsare excluded without need of more specific exami-nation.But — priority, please, as usual, for the etymol-ogy. Prophesy means “forth-speaking”, more orless equal to “inspired”. It has nothing to do withforetelling the future, though it may do so, as it maydo anything, being only the ravings of a poet,drunkard, or madman. (You remember how Saulcame upon a company of youths all prophesyingaway together to beat the band, and joined the merrythrong. So people said, “Is Saul also among theProphets?” meaning a man capable of the “divine”intoxication of love, song, eloquence, or whateverelse enthusiastic might possess him. Men seized bythe afflatus were found to be capable of extraordi-nary exploits; hence the condition was admired andenvied by the average clod. Also, imitated by theaverage crook!)For all that, I am going for once to yield topopular clamour, and use words in their popularsense. That seems to me, roughly this: Prediction isa forecast based on reason, prophecy one whichclaims the warrant of “magical” powers. You agree?Then we can get on.1. The prophecy must announce itself as such.We cannot have people picking up odds and endswhich may be perfectly irrelevant, and insisting thatthey conceal forecasts. This excludes Great Pyra-mid lunatics; it would be quite simple to do the samesham calculations with the Empire State Building;when the architects protested, it is simple to reply:why, but of course! God was most careful not to letthem know what they were really doing, or theywould have died of fright!This argument was actually put forward by theSpiritists when Zancig confessed that his music-hall exploits1 were accomplished by means of acode. It is quite useless to get any sense whateverinto the heads of these bigoted imbeciles. Here,A.C.! don’t forget your best-beloved Browning! InMr. Sludge the Medium, the detected cheat — itwas D.D. Home in real life — offers this sillysubterfuge:Why, when I cheatMean to cheat, do cheat, and am caught in theact,Are you, or rather, am I sure o’ the fact?(There’s verse again, but I’m inspired some-how)Well then I’m not sure! I may be perhaps,Free as a babe from cheating; how it began,My gift, — no matter; what ’tis got to beIn the end now, that’s the question; answer that!Had I seen, perhaps, what hand was holdingmine,Leading me whither, I had died of frightSo, I was made believe I led myself.2. The date of the prophecy must antecede thatof its fulfilment. The very greatest care must betaken to insure this. When both dates are remote, asin the case of “fulfilled” Biblical prophecies, this isoften impossible.3. The prophecy must be precise. This rules outcases where alternative verifications are possible.4. The prophecy must be more than a reason-able calculation of probability. This rules out stufflike “The Burden of Nineveh” and the like. Inci-dentally, “The Burden of Damascus” does not seemto have had much luck so far! By latest accounts,the old burg wasn’t feeling too badly.We may also refer to the Second Advent: “Be-hold! I come quickly.” There have been quite a fewfalse alarms to date. (It began with Jesus himself,snapping off the disciple’s head: “If I will that hetarry till I come, what is that to thee?” Well, some-body was disappointed.)5. The verification must be simple, natural,unique and unmistakable. Forced and far-fetchedexplanations, distortions of Qabalistic or othermathematical reasoning, are barred.6. The prophecy itself must possess the comple-ment of this precision. It must be so perfectlyunintelligible at the time that the elucidation ofthe answer makes it certain that the prophet knewprecisely the whole riddle.I feel that this condition is itself expressed in asomewhat oracular form; I will try to clarify byciting what I consider a perfect example.Perfect, I say, because the “must” is a little toostrong; there are degrees of excellence.“That stele they shall call the Abomination ofDesolation; count well its name, & it shall be to youas 718.” (AL III, 19)(The Stélé is that whose discovery culminated inthe writing of The Book of the Law.)Here the first part is still quite unintelligible tome: I have tried analysis of the original phrase in“Scripture,” and nearly everything else: entirely invain: One can see dimly how people, recognizingthat Stélé as the Talisman responsible for reducinghalf the cities of Europe to rubble, might very wellmake reference to those original prophecies. But, atthe best, that’s nothing to cable to Otaheite about!Now the second part. This was even more baf-fling than the other. “Count well its name”? howcan I? it never had a name! So I tried all sorts ofexperiments with 718. Shin, 300, the letter of Spirit,with our key-number 418, looks promising. Onlyone more pie-crust! I kept attacking, off and on, formany a long year, got out all sorts of fantasticsolutions, complex and confused; they simplyshouted their derision at me.It was one glorious night in Cefalù, too utterlysuperb to waste in sleep; I got up; I adored the Stars1 Mrs. Zancig sat on the stage, blindfolded. Herhusband wandered about the audience, taking oneobject or another from one or another of them, andasking her “Ready?” “What is this?” “And this?”“This now?” “Right, what’s this?” and so on. Theyhad worked out a list of some hundreds of questionsto cover any probable article, or to spell its name, orgive a number, as when asked the number of awatch or bus ticket — and so on. One evening atCambridge, I was explaining this to a group ofundergraduates; being doubted, I offered to do thesame trick with the help of one of them — acomplete stranger. I only stipulated to ten minutesalone with him “to hypnotize him.”Of course I won easily. They cut out one possibleway of communication after another; but I alwaysmanaged to exchange a few words with my “me-dium” or slip him a note, so as to have a new codenot excluded by the latest precaution."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears56and the Moon; I revelled in the Universe. Yet therewas something pulling at me. It pulled eftsoons mybody into my chair, and I found myself at this oldriddle of 718. Half-a-dozen comic failures. But Ifelt that there was something on the way. Idly, I putdown Stélé in the Greek, 52, and said, “Perhaps wecan make a ‘name’ out of the difference betweenthat and 718.”I jumped.718 - 52 = 666My own name!Why, of course, quoth he, in glee; it is in fact theStélé of 666; for it is the Stélé of Ankh-f-n-khonsu,my name in those past days.Oh, no! said Something, that’s not good enough!“Count well its name” — the Stélé of Ankh-f-n-khonsu: a name is something to which it answers,quite different from a title. That solution is clever,but it just won’t do, because that Stélé never had aname!You lie! I shouted, as the full light broke throughthe mists of my mind: In these three Thousand yearsit has once, if only once, had a name, by invokingwhich you could bring it up before you; its name is“Stélé 666” in the Catalogue of the Museum atBoulak!A single simple hammerstroke, and the nail isdriven home to the head!Compare this with the chaotic devices of the“bilateral-cipher” maniacs, by the application ofwhich it is easy to prove that Bernard Shaw wroteRudyard Kipling. Or anything else! you pay yourmoney, and you take your choice.7. Another strong point is that the prophecyshould on the surface mean something vague andplausible, and, interpreted, possess this samequality of unique accuracy.For instance (although it is not prediction) con-sider “Love is the law, love under will.” Yes, thatsounds very well; I dare say that is an excellentpoint of philosophy. — But! well, anyone might saythat. Oh, no! For when we use the Greek of thetechnical terms, we find αγαπη, Love, and Θελημα,Will, both of the value of 93 — and these only twoblossoms of the Tree whose root is 31, and the entirenumerical-verbal system based thereupon orga-nized with incredibly simple intricacy; well, that isan Eohippus of an entirely different tint! It is nomore the chance (if happy) statement of any smooth-tongued philosopher, but the evidence of, and thekey to, an incalculably vast design. As well at-tribute the Riemann-Christoffel Tensor to the “happythought” of some post-prandial mathematician.Here is another case.“Now then this two-in-One letter Z 1, is thethird Key to this Law; and on the discovery of thatfact, after years of constant seeking, what suddensplendours of Truth, sacred as secret, blazed in themidnight of my mind! Observe now; ‘... this circlesquared in its failure is a key also.’ Now I knew thatin the value of the letters Myhla, ‘the Gods’, the Jewshad concealed a not quite correct value of π, theratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, to4 places of decimals: 3.1415; nearer would be3.1416. If I prefix our Key, 31 putting Z1, Setor Satan, before the old Gods, I get 3.141593, πcorrect to six places, Six being my own number andthat of Horus the Sun.”And one more, this time an actual prediction.Here again is what might at first seem almost anevasion! “... one commeth after him, ...” indeed! Isuppose so. It fits anybody who discovers it orclaims to have done so.Not one little bit!For when the time came, and the Key was found,the finder’s name in the Order was — and had beenfrom the moment of his admission as a probationer— Achad, the Hebrew word for “One”. And hecame “after him” in the precise technical sense, thathe was in fact the next person to undertake theAdventure of the Abyss.I hope you are not getting the idea that myProphetic ambit is limited to these high-falutin’metaphysical masterpieces of Runic Lore. In caseyou do, I now propose to break your “seven greenwithes that were never dried” altogether, Delilah;for I shall keep my hair on. I shall go forth to war!From 1920 to 1923 my abode for a season was thehouse called the Horsel of the Abbey of Thelemathat lieth upon Santa Barbara, overlooking thetown of Telepylus — see Homer and Samuel ButlerII, but called later by the Romans Cephaloedium,and now Cefalù. There did I toil to expand my littlePart III of Book 4 to the portentous volume nowmore generally known as Magick in Theory andPractice. After numerous misadventures, it waspublished in 1928.I refer you to that book, page 96.“One last word on this subject. There is a Magi-cal Operation of maximum importance: the Initia-tion of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary toutter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed inblood. Before man is ready to accept the Law ofThelema, the Great War must be fought. ThisBloody Sacrifice is the critical point of the World-Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, theCrowned and Conquering Child, as Lord of theAeon.1“The whole matter is prophesied in The Book ofthe Law itself; let the student take note, and enter theranks of the Host of the Sun.”(It is a pity that I cannot prove my footnote, butthis Chapter XII was part of the original MS,advertised as to be published in 1912. You maytake my word for it, for once. And in any case wehave the prophecy of Bartzabel, the Spirit of Mars,in the early summer of 1910 that wars involving thedisaster of (a) Turkey and (b) Germany would befought within 5 years. See the New York World,December, 1914.)We now proceed to Magick, page 112.“But now observe how the question of the Magi-cal Link arises! No matter how mighty the truth ofThelema, it cannot prevail unless it is applied to andby mankind. As long as The Book of the Law wasin Manuscript, it could only affect the small groupamongst whom it was circulated. It had to be putinto action by the Magical Observation of publish-ing it. When this was done, it was done withoutproper perfection. Its commands as to how the workought to be done were not wholly obeyed. Therewere doubt and repugnance in FRATER PER-DURABO’s mind, and they hampered His work.He was half-hearted. Yet, even so, the intrinsicpower of the truth of the Law and the impact of thepublication were sufficient to shake the world sothat a critical war broke out, and the minds of menwere moved in a mysterious manner. The secondblow was struck by the re-publication of the Bookin September 1913, and this time the might of thisMagick burst out and caused a catastrophe to civi-lization. At this hour, the Master THERION isconcealed, collecting his forces for a final blow.When The Book of the Law and its Comment ispublished with the forces of His whole Will inperfect obedience to the instructions which have upto now been misunderstood or neglected, the resultwill be incalculably effective. The event will estab-lish the kingdom of the Crowned and ConqueringChild over the whole earth, and all men shall bow tothe Law, which is ‘love under will’.”This should be plain enough, and satisfactory.However, I thought it was time to draw publicattention to these matters more emphatically.In fulfillment of my pledge given above, and ofthe instructions originally given to me by the Mas-ters, I got out The Equinox of the Gods at 6:22 a.m.,Dec. 22. 1937, e.v.; and, to fulfill my condition No.1 (above) of a Prophecy, as well as to establish thedate, I got a reporter on the spot, with the resultfollowing:“These Names Make News.“Mixed Bag of Early Birds.“An Englishman, a Jew, an Indian, a Negro, aMalayan — no, it’s not one of those saloon-barjokes — assembled on the Embankment, byCleopatra’s Needle, soon after 6 a.m. yesterday.“They were there to assist at the publication of abook by 62 year-old magician, ALEISTER CROW-LEY.“Publication occurred at 6:22 sharp, when theSun entered Capricornus.“Crowley made a short speech; as ‘the Priest ofthe Princes’ proclaimed the Law of Thelema; handedcopies of book to white, red, brown, black, yellowrepresentatives.“Representative of the ‘black’ race was a danc-ing-girl. Indian was a non-English speaking BengaliMuslim, who seemed rather puzzled by the wholebusiness.“Book contains message dictated to Crowley atCairo in 1904 ‘by Aiwass, a Being whose nature hedoes not fully understand but who described Him-self as ‘The Minister of Hoor-Paar-Kraat’ (the Lordof Silence).’1 Note: This paragraph was written in the sum-mer 1911, e.v., just three years before its fulfilment.Second innings ’38 e.v., sqq."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears57“Prospectus of book says it’s been publishedthree times before; adds, sinisterly, that first publi-cation was nine months before outbreak of Balkanwar, second, nine months before outbreak of worldwar, third, nine months before outbreak of Sino-Japanese war.“No coincidence, it says: ‘the might of thisMagick burst out and caused a catastrophe tocivilisation.’“Well, we’ll see next September ....“‘It’s a bit hard of you to wish another war onus,’ I said to Crowley.“‘Oh, but if everyone will only do as I tell themto,’ he replied, ‘the catastrophe can be averted.’“Somehow I fear they won’t.”.......“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of theLaw.”Then I issued a prospectus for the book, givingthe facts as to previous publications and their re-sults, and leaving blank a space after “The FourthPublication” to wait the event.“THE FIRST PUBLICATION“nine months before the outbreak of the BalkanWar, which broke up the Near East.“When this was done it was done without properperfection. Its commands as to how the work oughtto be done were not wholly obeyed ... Yet, even so,the intrinsic power of the truth of the Law and theimpact of publication were sufficient to shake theworld, so that a critical war broke out, and the mindsof men were moved in a mysterious manner.“THE SECOND PUBLICATION“nine months before the outbreak of the WorldWar, which broke up the West.“The second blow was struck by the re-publica-tion of the Book in September, 1913, and this time... caused a catastrophe to civilisation.

As follows:“nine months before the Betrayal, which strippedBritain of the last rags of honour, prestige andsecurity, and will break up civilisation.”I have always maintained that Munich markedthe true outbreak of the war, because Hitler’s rapeof Czecho-Slovakia, however justifiable, was irrec-oncilably incompatible with our Foreign Policy;and Munich is Nine Months to a day after myGesture.This then I consider a completely documentedcase of Prophecy.And I shall be a completely documented case ofBrain-Fag unless I shut up NOW.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XLCOINCIDENCECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.When I was writing that letter about prophecy, Iwas hot and bothered all the time by my faithfulsentinel, the well-greaved Hoplite that stands at thepostern of my consciousness, ready to challengeevery thought — and woe to the intruder whocannot give the countersign! This time the dear oldruffian thought the matter serious enough to reportHigher Up. “It is put plainly enough, emphaticallyenough, incontrovertibly enough” was the gist ofhis communication “that the first and most irre-trievable trick of the enemy is to dupe you intopassing Captain Coincidence as ‘Friend,’ whereashe is naturally the most formidable of all your foeswhen it comes to a question of proof.”Quite right, Sergeant-Major! But it is not onlyabout prophecy, but about all sorts of things, inparticular, of course, the identification of angelsand similar problems.Well, we have captured quite a few lads of thecompany of Captain Coincidence; let us have themup for examination and learn what we can abouttheir weapons and other warlike matters!I take our first prisoner from Magick.“The most famous novel of Fielding is calledTom Jones. It happened that FRATER PER-DURABO was staying in a hotel in London. Hetelephoned a friend named Fielding at the latter’shouse, and was answered by Mr. Fielding’s secre-tary, who said that his employer had left the housea few minutes previously, and could only be reachedby telephoning a certain office in the City at be-tween 11 o’clock and a quarter past. FRATERPERDURABO had an appointment at 11 o’clockwith a music-hall star, the place being the entranceto a theatre. In order to remind himself, he made amental note that, as soon as he saw the lady, hewould raise his hand and say, before greeting her:‘Remind me that I must telephone at once to Field-ing,’ when he met her. He did this, and she advancedtoward Him with the same gesture, and said in thesame breath, ‘Remind me that I have to telephone toTom Jones’ — the name of a music-hall agentemployed by her.”Here comes another, this time completely crazy!Nothing “Literary” about it; no sense anywhere; apure freak.A friend of mine, A, rang up a friend of hers, B,at her flat in Holland Park, some 3 or 4 miles west,and a p’int to the Nor’rard, of Piccadilly Circus.After the usual series of “they don’t answer”, “line’sengaged”, “unobtainable”, “line’s out of order”,“line’s temporarily disconnected at the subscriber’srequest”, an appeal to “Supervisor” got her con-nected instantly. Yet another girl friend, C, appearsin, and vanishes from, the story; she said “Oh, whata pity, you’ve just missed her; she went out fiveminutes ago. I think she’ll be back in an hour’stime, try then.”A waited impatiently, and rang up once more.Again the series of nonsense-difficulties about get-ting the connection. At last the answer came. Thistime yet one more girl friend D. “Oh, what a pity!You’ve just missed her; she left the box not fiveminutes ago.” “Box,” screamed A, “what box?Have I got mixed up in a Trunk Murder?” “Why,this box,” replied D, calmly. “What — — box?”shouted A. “Isn’t that her flat?” “Her flat! are youcrazy? This is a call-box in Shaftesbury Avenue.”Collapse of A’s confidence in the sanity of Nature.One may note that there was no similarity in thenames of the exchanges, or in the numbers.It is the most grotesquely impossible case of“wrong number” that ever came my way.Now for one or two oddities. Recently, needingto relax, I borrowed three “thrillers” from differentsources. In every case, the plot turned on two menbeing so alike that no one could tell them apart.(Rupert of Hentzau, John Chilcote, M.P.,Melander’s Millions.)I traveled from Louisville to Detroit by a rail-road whose nickname was the “Big Four”, myobject being some business connected with myBook 4. The name of my express was the “BigFour” — it left from No. 4 platform at 4 p.m. Mysleeping berth was No. 4 in Car No. 4; and my ticketwas No. 44,444. It ought to have been April 4, Isuppose; but it wasn’t.Last week a letter from me appeared in theSunday Dispatch with regard to the Everest Mys-tery of 1921. I expressed my view that the two lostclimbers, last seen on an easy snow-slope near thesummit, had simply been blown into the air by oneof the sudden gusts of incredible fierce winds whichare common at those heights, and dashed to earthperhaps a mile away.After reading this, I went to a friend’s room toborrow a book, picked up her Shakespeare’s Histo-ries, and, opening it at random, came upon:“They that stand high have many blasts to shakethem,And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.”Richard III, Act I, Sc. 3.Now here’s a story that’s too good to lose; not themistiest phantasm of an ideogram how to class it;for one thing, it’s chock-a-block with moral lessonsand economic theories and political summats; butthere’s coincidence in it somewhere, and undercoincidence down it shall go. Even if only bycoincidence.From 1895 e.v. onwards I dealt with ColinLunn.“Of all the tobacconists under the sun,There is none, there is none, like the great ColinLunn —”"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears58of Sidney Street, Cambridge. When I startedround the world, alas for fidelity! I began to forgethim. By 1906 e.v. the operation was practicallycomplete.In ’42 e.v. I spent a few days with friends inCambridge. Sauntering along K.P. (King’s Paradeto you, madam!) on my way back to the station withhalf an hour or so to kill, I thought I would pop into Lunn’s new shop there, and pass the time of day.He might have something to take my fancy. So I did.Needless to say, I didn’t know the shopman fromAdam, as he did not offer me a view of his identifi-cation mark. I asked after old friends; we gossipedof old times and new; presently he observed, puttinga hand under the counter: “I think this is yours sir.”“How do you know who I am? I’ve never seen youbefore.” “Oh, yes sir, I was the odd-job boy at theold Sidney Street shop; I remember you quite well.”By this time there lay on the counter a strangefamiliar-unfamiliar object — a pipe that I had leftfor some minor repair before hurrying off to theEast 37 years before! I am smoking it now.And you can draw your own beastly conclusion!Here is a last, a passing strange account of acoincidence — or should it come under “Answersto Prayer.”A young enthusiastic “Heaven Born” (= I.C.S.)1parlous pious, was engaged to an exquisite chastedamosel in Lutterworth. Praised and promoted byhis appreciative chiefs in Bombay, he felt his futuresure enough to go home on leave, marry her, andbring her out to India. At their parting, she hadgiven him a ring; naturally, he set great store by it.But the climate had thinned him; it was loose;playing with it as he talked with a friend on the ship,it slipped from his finger, and fell into the harbour.He suppressed an expression of annoyance. “Wellthat’s past praying for,” laughed the friend —unhappily an infidel, not a true friend at all. Theyoung man stiffened. “It is?” he answered solemnlyand emphatically; “We shall see.” And he retired tohis cabin to lay his grief before the Lord.The ship arrived at Aden without incident. Whileshe was coaling, it was the idle habit of some sailorsto bait a hook with a large piece of pork, and fish forsharks. An hour later they caught a fine specimen,and hauled it aboard. They cut it open. No ring.I hope you don’t think I’m letting my pen runaway with me:“Pens! Good Lord,Who knows if you drive them or they driveyou?”No, I have not forgotten that I am here to instructas well as to amuse: also, to make certain observa-tions which will, I flatter myself, be rather new toyou.I plunge headlong.Everything that happens, no matter what, is aninconceivably improbable coincidence. You re-member how you had to begin when you first cameto me for help. I said to you, “Here are you, and noother person, come to see me, and no other person,in this room, and no other room, at this time, and notother time. How did that come about?” The answerto that question is the first entry in your MagicalDiary: and, with a slightly different object in view,the first step in the practice of Liber Thisharb andthe acquisition of Magical Memory.Why, hang it all; the events of the last hour, even,might have gone just an infinitesimally little bitdifferent, and the interview would not have takenplace as it did. Consider then, that factors stretchingback into Eternity — all the factors there are! —have each one contributed in its degree to bringingthis interview about. What a fantastic improbabil-ity! Yet here we are.Chance blindly rules the Universe. But what isChance? And where does purpose intervene? Towhat extent?I shall now conduct you, no less firmly than Mr.E. Phillips Oppenheim, to Monte Carlo.(Excuse me! I was just called to the telephone.Somebody of whose existence I was not aware hasfallen ill in Ireland — and bang went my plans fortomorrow.)You walk quietly into the Casino; it seems to youthat the excitement is even more noticeable thanusual. You see a friend at the table “Here in the nickof time!” he gasps. “Black has just turned up for the24th time running.” You press forward to plank themaximum on Red. The wheel spins; Black again!“Forty thousand she-devils in the belfry of St.Nicholas Rocambole-de-Ronchonot!”“But — but” (you stammer when spirits ofhartshorn have revived you) “in the whole historyof the tables a colour has never turned up more than24 times running!”My poor friend, what has that got to do with it?True, from the start it is countless millions to 1 thatthere will not be a run of 24 on the red or the black;but the probability on any single spin (ignoringzero) is always one to one. The black compartmentsdo not contract because the ball has fallen into anyone of them.Anyone who gambles at all is either a dilettante,a crook, or a B.F. If you could get the B.F.’s tounderstand the very elementary mathematics setforth above, good-night to gambling! And a goodriddance, at that! Well, there is one advantage in thesystem; it does help the intelligent man to steal amarch on his neighbours!In all this the important point for my presentpurpose is to show you how entirely this question ofprobability and coincidence is dependent on yourattention.The sequence B B B B B B B at roulette is mostunlikely to occur; but so, in exactly the same de-gree, is the sequence B R B R R B R or any othersequence. The one passes unnoticed, the other causessurprise, only because you have in your mind theidea of “a run on black.”Extend this line of thought a little, and link it upwith what I was saying about the Magical Diary;you realize that every phenomenon soever is equallyimprobable, and “infinitely” so. The Universe istherefore nothing but Coincidence!How then can any event be more improbablethan any other? Why, very simply. Go back toMonte; proclaim that at Table No. 3 Black will turnup 7 times running, after this next spin. (Or, ofcourse, any other series of 7.) Now you see howCoincidence links up with Prophecy!A fortiori, Coincidence is destroyed by Purpose,if, wishing to enlighten you on the subject, I writethis letter and post it to your address, your receipt ofit is no longer Coincidence. So then coincidencemust be entirely both unforeseen and unintentional;in other words, absolutely senseless. But we havejust proved that the Universe is nothing but Coinci-dence; it therefore is senseless.So, having established the asymptote of ourhyperbolic hyperbola, and shewn it to be asynartete,why should we not acquiesce, and say olive oil?Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XLI“ARE WE REINCARNATIONS OF THEANCIENT EGYPTIANS?”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.That accursed conscience of mine has been prick-ing me ever since I dashed off that rather curt andoff-hand letter card in answer to yours of the 18th.I had intended as a matter of fact to let you have thepresent coruscation as soon as I could get mysecretary in the offing, but I thought I would snapyour head off on the strength of your question assalutary chastisement.I do wish you would understand that all thesespeculations are not only idle and senseless becauseyou cannot possibly verify their accuracy, but adeadly poison. You ask if we, meaning, I suppose,the English, are now reincarnating the Egyptians.When I was a boy it was the Romans, while theFrench undertook the same thankless office for theGreeks. I say “deadly poison;” because when youanalyse you see at once that this is a device forflattering yourself. You have a great reverence forthe people who produced Luxor and the Pyramids;and it makes you feel nice and comfortable inside ifyou think that you were running around in thosedays as Rameses II or a high priest in Thebes orsomething equally congenial.You may say that I am myself the chief of sinnersin this respect because of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, but thiswas not my doing. It was imposed upon me by TheBook of the Law, and I do not feel particularlyflattered or comforted by this identification. Theonly interest to me is the remarkable manner inwhich this is interwoven with the existence of the“Cairo working”.Your second and third questions are still worse.I should be ashamed of myself if I were to do somuch as to refer to them.That must serve for that. But your fourth ques-tion I did answer after a fashion. It has howeverstruck me that I might have given you a more1 Indian Civil Servant."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears59detailed instruction with advantage.When I was up the Mindoun Chong in Burma, Istarted an investigation of my dreams; and the onlyway to catch them was to write down as much as Icould remember on waking, instantly. The result ofdoing this is rather surprising. To begin with, Idiscovered, especially as the practice progressed,that I was having many more dreams than I hadpreviously supposed. This might have come aboutin either of two ways.(1) The practice might have actually increasedmy tendency to dream, and (2) the habit of observa-tion may have brought dreams to the surface whichwould otherwise have gone unremarked. In eithercase the figures were quite definite.I found almost at once, that is to say after abouta month, that practically every dream that I couldremember, could be quite clearly ascribed to one oftwo causes: (a) the events of the previous day ordays, or the subjects which had interested andexcited me during that period, and (b) the physicalconditions of the moment. For instance, a good dealof the time of the experiment I was sleeping in whatmight have been euphemistically called a house-boat. It was liable to leak; and on such occasions asI woke to find water trickling down my nose, Ifound that the dream from which I had wakenedwas an adventure of some sort in connection withwater. (It is quite notorious, I believe, that manyasthmatic subjects are pestered by dreams of havingbeen guillotined in a previous incarnation. AlanBennett, I may mention, was one such.)As the practice proceeds, you should find notonly that your dreams increase in number per night,but also become very much fuller, clearer and morecoherent. I assume that the reason is that the fact ofyour paying attention to them brings them to thesurface.I am not quite sure whether this is a complete andadequate answer to your question 4, “How can Ibest bring my sleeping memory into my wakinghours?”I have studied, and my secretary has studied, andwe can make no head or tail of your remark aboutbrain exercises with sketch.Well, I must hope for the best, and leave you withmy blessing.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XLIITHIS “SELF” INTROVERSIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“... It is a lie, this folly against self....” (AL II, 22)The English is very un-English, and the contexthardly helpful. But the meaning is clear enough; theidea is to dismiss, curtly and rudely, the entire bodyof doctrine which insists on altruism as a conditionof spiritual progress.Why do I jump in with this text without warning.Because at the end of my letter on Sammasati theDweller of the Threshold popped up, and thatbrings us to the Black Brothers, and the Left-handpath, all of which subjects are very generally sup-posed to depend for origin upon “Selfishness.”This question is one of the most critical in thewhole of Magical Theory; for in one sense it iscertainly true that every error without exception isdue to exacerbation of the Ego.Yet The Book of the Law flings at us disdain-fully: “It is a lie, this folly against self.”How then?I fear there is nothing for it but to go thoroughlyinto the whole matter of the “self”. This may in-volve some recapitulation; but then didn’t the Bud-dha repeat three times every one of those extrava-gantly verbose paragraphs which give the lucklessBhikku — timens, not tumens, as Catullus says —permission to have (a) walls (b) roof (c) window (d)door (e) hinge to door (f) fastening to door (g) h. andc. — no, he didn’t! anyhow, all those ancientconveniences?“Self” is one of the trickiest words afloat. Skeatgives merely the equivalents, all practically thesame in sound, in various Nordic languages; hedoesn’t say where it comes from, or what it means.I don’t know either, bless your heart!Latin and Greek don’t help us at all; and whenwe try Eastern languages, it seems, dimly, to givethe idea of the Ego, whatever that may be. Orperhaps “that combination which is unified byAhamkara, the “Ego-making faculty”.Decidedly not illuminating!One can’t use the word as an ordinary noun.Skeat doesn’t even label it as such. One can hardlysay: Mr. Blenkinsop’s self is good, or rheumatic, orgone for a walk. It makes nonsense. Yet Philosophyhas picked out this hapless Tetragrammaton, andmade endless mud pies with it!When one says: “I fell and hurt myself”, it’s onlya conventional abbreviation. One means “my nose”,or “my elbow”, as the case may be! No, I can’tconscientiously admit it as a noun. More accu-rately: “my body fell, and I am suffering from theinjury thereby caused to my whatever it was.”And so what?(Oh dear, I am tying ourselves into knots!)So what? Ah me, nothing for it but to plungehead foremost into the hybrid abyss of Babu-Blavatsky bak-abak!Brahman — don’t confuse with the Brahma ofthe Trimurti, as so many Nippies and Clippies arebut too liable to do — is the macrocosmic NegativeAbsolute, when cross-examined; its microcosm isPurusha or Atma. Very near our own QabalisticZero — Nought in no dimensions — equals Infinity(air connu). Then comes Buddhi, which curates,book-makers’ clerks, miners and Privy Councillorsso often mistake for Buddha (Ha! Ha!), the facultyof discrimination. Pretty much like the 0 = 2 equa-tion in our system.Next, the Higher Manas, which is ourNeschamah, as near as a toucher; and the LowerManas, which, as every Lovely and Cutie wellKnows, is our Ruach. The rest of the Hindu systemcan easily be fitted in.Note, however, the Ahamkara, usually trans-lated “Ego-making faculty”, which collects what itcan from this dump, and labels it “I”.There seems not much point in elaborating allthis. The Hindu Pandit is a whale for swallowingnumberless oceans, all swarming with Jonahs; heduplicates and discriminates and invents at his ownsweet will, in order to get a pretty pattern with 84 or108 crores of asankyas of lakhs of anythings.We have done enough for honour.Enough if we see that the system is in its essenceidentical with our own.Well, then, what is this “Higher Self” that youroll out upon me?Actually, we are very far from being out of thewood. This Ut, of Udgitha, who looms so large inthe Upanishads; the God peculiar to yourself, whoappears in one of the Darshanas; some Individualconstructed from the material listed above; arethese all one? If not, is the difference between themmore than a quibble?Really, all these speculations are based on àpriori considerations; we had better drop the wholeargument as little better than a waste of time; nay,as worse, for it encourages one in loose thinking,and especially in clinging to names which have nocounterpart in things.There is only one point of theory which mattersto our practice. We may readily concur that theAugoeides, the “Genius” of Socrates, and the “HolyGuardian Angel” of Abramelin the Mage, are iden-tical. But we cannot include this “Higher Self”; forthe Angel is an actual Individual with his ownUniverse, exactly as man is; or, for the matter ofthat, a bluebottle. He is not a mere abstraction, aselection from, and exaltation of, one’s own favor-ite qualities, as the “Higher Self” seems to be. Thetrouble is (I think) that the Hindu passion foranalysis makes them philosophize any limited be-ing out of existence.This matter is of importance, because it influ-ences one’s attitude to invocation. I can, for in-stance, work myself up to a “Divine Conscious-ness,” in which I can understand, and act, as Icannot in my normal state. I become “inspired;” Ifeel, and I express, ideas of almost illimitable exal-tation. But this is totally different from the “Knowl-edge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian An-gel”, which is the special aim of the Adeptus Minor.It is ruin to that Work if one deceives oneself bymistaking one’s own “energized enthusiasm” forexternal communication. The parallel on the physi-cal plane is the difference between Onanism andSexual Intercourse.Probably, my reason for insistence on this pointis my antipathy to introversion in any form. The“mystic path” itself is packed with dangers. Unlessthe strongest counter-irritants are exhibited, theprocess is almost certain to become morbid. It isonly one step from the Invocation of Zeus, orApollo, or Dionysus, which does demand identifi-cation of oneself with the object of one’s worship, toa form of self-worship which soon develops into a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears60maniacal exacerbation of the Ego; and if one per-sists in this involuted curve, one becomes a “BlackBrother”, or departs for the local loony-bin.Invocations of even the most positive Gods aredangerous, unless care can be taken to keep thepersonality of the god distinct from one’s own.Athene is a superb deity; but one does not wantto be nothing but Athene, except in that suprememoment of Samadhi with Her which is the climax ofthe invocation.Do you remember one of Barbey d’Aurevilly’sContes Cruels about a Spanish nobleman whoanticipated one of the privileges of marriage insteadof waiting for ecclesiastical licence? The Inquisitorsimply had him tied to his betrothed for 48 hours.It is really rather like that! One of my mathemati-cally-minded disciples — J.W.N. Sullivan, I think— told me that his sinister science had one pecu-liarly devilish pitfall; one is so satisfactorily equippedfor work if one had but a bit of paper and a pencil —and a comfortable bed! He had to make a point ofsevere physical exercise to escape becoming bed-ridden in his early twenties!So, even in divine invocation, one should insiston definite communication of knowledge (or whatnot) which is incontestably not one’s own. The factthat the self-begotten feelings and ideas are soeminently satisfactory — naturally, since there isnobody to oppose them — is damnably seductive.Once started on that road, one can easily developself-deception to a fine art. One can imagine thatone has undergone, or achieved, all sorts of experi-ences “as described in the books,” when all that onehas actually done is to work the results of one’sreading into a bubble inflated by imagination.It should be obvious to you that the habit growson one; every bad quality, from vanity to laziness,lends most willing aid. One replaces reality moreand more continuously by these exciting and flat-tering reveries, which by this time have no longerany shadow of a claim to be called mystic experi-ences at all.It is desperately difficult to cure such conditions;the patient resents bitterly every touch of truth, forhe feels it, accurately enough, as a thrust to the verycore of his being.Parallel with this, in my psychoanalytic practiceI have had excellent success with all forms of sexualaberration, with the one exception of masturbation.In these cases, even though I have often beensuccessful in “curing” the condition, so that the manhas been able to carry on with satisfaction to himselfand his family the normal functions of a husband, Ihave never really got rid of the peculiar mental andmoral characteristics which have been, if not im-planted, at least encouraged and fostered, by thisdevastating habit.Now do remember this; it is the guarantee ofwholesomeness in any Invocation that there shouldbe contact with another. It is better to conjure upthe most obnoxious demons from the most noisomepit of Hell than to take one’s own exhilarations forDivine benediction; if only because there was nevera demon yet so atrocious as that same old Ego.You will discover the truth of these remarkswhen you approach the Frontier of the Abyss. Well,now, if that isn’t too funny! The text of this stupen-dous sermon was AL II, 22. I take this verse in itsmost obvious and ordinary sense; for instance, thefollowing sentence: “... The exposure of innocenceis a lie....”; for that means clearly enough Hypoc-risy. So “... It is a lie, this folly against self....” onlymeans, “To hell with sentimental altruism, withfalse modesty, with all those most insidious fiends,the sense of guilt, of shame — in a word, the‘inferiority complex’ or something very like it.”The whole tenor of The Book of the Law, is tothis effect. The very test of worth is that one shouldbe aware of it and not afraid to sock the next man onthe jaw if he disputes it!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. But what do I mean when I say “myself” innormal speech? I mean Tiphareth, the human self asdetermining the identity of the Supreme Triad plusas much Ruach as I have succeeded in organising asextensions of it.Though your Supernal Triad is in essence iden-tical with mine, your Tiphareth is quite definitelynot mine. It is like mine in its nature and many of itssympathies, but your Ruach is altogether differentfrom mine in (at a guess) 80% of its components.We must add Malkuth as the medium whichcrystallizes the characters of our respective “Selves.”This is all horribly, hatefully difficult to put intowords; there is bound to be misunderstanding, how-ever cleverly I concoct the potion. But we under-stand pretty well for all that, at least so far as isnecessary for most practical purposes.CHAPTER XLIIITHE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL IS NOTTHE “HIGHER SELF” BUT ANOBJECTIVE INDIVIDUALCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.On going over some recent letters I see that yourquestion about William Gillette and the Angels wasindeed “a red-hot two-prong that you stick to hiss i’the soft of” me. You meant not only to inquire intothe order of being to which angels belong, but as towhether they are liable to accident, misfortune andthe like.The answer is that it depends on the Angel — forthe purposes of this letter I propose to use the word“angel” to include all sorts of disembodied beings,from demons to gods — in all cases, they areobjective; a subjective “angel” is different from adream only in non-essentials.Now, some angels are actually emanations of theelements, planets, or signs to which they are attrib-uted. They are partial beings in very much the sameway as are animals. They are not microcosms as aremen and women. They are almost entirely com-posed of the planet (or whatever it is) to which theyare attributed. The other components of their beingI take to be almost accidental. For example, theArchangel Ratziel is lord of a company of angelscalled Auphanim; and one must not imagine that allthese angels are identical with one another, or therewould not seem to be much sense in it. They havesome sort of composition, some sort of individual-ity; and the character and appearance of the Angelcan be determined by its name.I do not think that I have anywhere mentionedhow this is done. To take an example, let us haveQedemel — the Hebrew letters as Q.D.M.A.L, andthe numeration is 175, which is that of the sum ofthe 1st 49 numbers, as is proper to Venus. We maythen expect the head or head-dress of the spirit to bein some way characteristic of the Sign of Pisces. Thegeneral form of the body will be indicated by theDaleth, the letter of Venus, and the lower part (orperhaps the quality) will be determined by thewatery Mem — The termination Aleph Lamed isusually taken to indicate appropriate symbols. Forinstance, the Aleph might show a golden aura, andthe Lamed a pair of balances, Some further detailmight be indicated by taking the letters Daleth andMem together, for Dam is the Hebrew word forblood. From such considerations one can build upa pictorial representation in one’s mind which mayserve as a standard to which any appearance of himshould more or less conform. The question thentakes the form of inquiry into how far such beingsare immortal or eternal.In the above case, evidently his existence de-pends on that of the planet Venus; and one mightsuppose that, if that planet were stricken from thesolar system, there would be no more Qedemel. Butthis is to judge too rashly; for Venus himself is onlyan emanation of the number 7, and is thereforeindestructible.It is some such idea as the above which is at theback of the conventional idea that elementals areimmortal, that they incur mortality when their am-bition and devotion causes them to incarnate ashuman beings. (Is this achieved by some sort ofmarriage with a reincarnating Ego? Or how? Allthis is very obscure; we need more evidence.)You will doubtless have read in many Easternstories of the destruction of dryads or Nats by thecutting down of the tree in which they have madetheir habitation. A nymph, similarly, would bedestroyed if her fountain were to dry up.Now, can an angel of this sort ever go wrong, bywhich one must mean, can he ever be untrue to hisown nature? I do not see how one can imagine thisto happen; for they are so completely creatures ofthe elements of which they are composed that theymust be regarded as completely devoid of will inany intelligible sense of the word. Their actions infact are merely re-actions.They are, of course, entirely lacking in the Su-pernal Triad. There is therefore no question ofanything in them which would persist throughchange. Perhaps it would be better to say thatchanged does not really affect them. Another way toput it would be that they are adjectives, not nouns.They are merely sensible manifestations of the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears61elements to which they are attributed, and to theletters of their name.Now, on the other hand, there is an entirelydifferent type of angel; and here we must be espe-cially careful to remember that we include gods anddevils, for there are such beings who are not by anymeans dependent one one particular element fortheir existence. They are microcosms in exactly thesame sense as men and women are. They are indi-viduals who have picked up the elements of theircomposition as possibility and convenience dic-tates, exactly as we do ourselves. I want you tounderstand that a goddess like Astarte, Astaroth,Cotytto, Aphrodite, Hathoor, Venus, are not merelyaspects of the planet;1 they are separate individualswho have been identified with each other, andattributed to Venus merely because the salient fea-ture in their character approximates to this ideal.Now then, it is simple to answer the question oftheir development, their growing old and dying; for,being of the same order of Nature as we are our-selves, almost anything which is true of us is truealso of them.I have tended rather to elaborate this theme,because of the one personally important questionwhich arises in more recent letters; for I believe thatthe Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order.He is something more than a man, possibly a beingwho has already passed through the stage of hu-manity, and his peculiarly intimate relationshipwith his client is that of friendship, of community,of brotherhood, or Fatherhood. He is not, let me saywith emphasis, a mere abstraction from yourself;and that is why I have insisted rather heavily that theterm “Higher Self” implies “a damnable heresy anda dangerous delusion.”If it were not so, there would be no point in TheSacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.Apart from any theoretical speculation, mySammasiti and analytical work has never led to somuch as a hint of the existence of the GuardianAngel. He is not to be found by any exploration ofoneself. It is true that the process of analysis leadsfinally to the realization of oneself as no more thana point of view indistinguishable in itself from anyother point of view; but the Holy Guardian Angel isin precisely the same position. However close maybe the identities in millions of ways, no completeidentification is ever obtainable.But do remember this, above all else; they areobjective, not subjective, or I should not waste goodMagick on them.Let me say in particular in regard to Gods, thatthe God Jupiter whom you invoke is not necessarilythe same as he whom I invoke. It is clear in any casethat the revelation of himself to you is modified inmany ways by your own particular sensitiveness;just as in ordinary life, your idea of a friend may bevery different from my own conception of the sameindividual. Suppose, for example, he happens to bea musician, there will be an entire side of hischaracter to which I am practically insensitive. Youcould talk to him for hours, and I would understandlittle or nothing of what was said. Similarly, if hewere a mountaineer, it would be your turn to be oddman out.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER XLIV“SERIOUS” STYLE OF A.C., OR THEAPPARENT FRIVOLITY OF SOME OFMY REMARKSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Alas! It is unlikely that either you or I shouldcome upon a copy of Max Beerbohm’s portrait ofMathew Arnold; but Raven Hill’s famous cartoonis history, and can be told as such without theillustration.We shall have to go into the matter, because ofyour very just criticism of my magical writings ingeneral — and these letters, being colloquial, arenaturally an extreme case.Far-off indeed those sunny days when life inEngland was worth living; when one could travelanywhere in Europe — except Russia and Turkey,which spiritually, at least, are in Asia — or America,without a passport; when we complained that clos-ing time was twelve-thirty a.m.; when there waslittle or no class bitterness, the future seemed se-cure, and only Nonconformists failed to enjoy thefun that bubbled up on every side.Well, in those days there were Music-halls; Ican’t hope to explain to you what they were like, butthey were jolly. (I’m afraid that there’s anotherword beyond the scope of your universe!) At theEmpire, Leicester Square, which at that time actu-ally looked as if it had been lifted bodily from the“Continong” (a very wicked place) there was apromenade, with bars complete (drinking bars, mydear child, I blush to say) where one might hope tofind “strength and beauty met together, Kindle theirimage like a star in a sea of glassy weather.” Thereone might always find London’s “soiled doves” (asthey revoltingly called them in the papers) of everytype: Theodora (celebrated “Christian” Empress)and Phryne, Messalina and Thais, Baudelaire’sswarthy mistress, and Nana, Moll Flanders andFanny hill.But the enemies of life were on guard. They sawpeople enjoying themselves, (shame!) and theyraked through the mildewed parchments of obso-lete laws until they found some long-forgotten pieceof mischief that might stop it. The withered husks ofwomanhood, idle, frustrated, spiteful and malig-nant, called up their forces, blackmailed the Churchinto supporting them, and began a senseless stringof prosecutions.

These painted masks aredevised to conceal chicanery or emptiness. Theeasy-going humorous style of Vivekananda is intel-ligible and instructive; the platitudinous hot pota-toes of Waite are neither. The dreadful thing is thatthis assumption of learning, of holiness, of mysteri-ous avenging powers, somehow deceives the aver-age student. He does not realise how well andwisely such have conned Wilde’s maxim: “To beintelligible is to be found out.”I know that I too am at times obscure; I lamentthe fact. The reason is twofold: (a) my ineradicablebelief that my reader knows all about the subjectbetter than I do myself, and (at best) may like to hearit tackled from a novel angle, (b) I am carried awayby the exultant exaltation of my theme: I boil overwith rapture — not the crystal-clear, the cool solu-tion that I aimed at.On the Path of the Wise there is probably nodanger more deadly, no poison more pernicious, noseduction more subtle than Spiritual Pride; it strikes,being solar, at the very heart of the Aspirant; more,it is an inflation and exacerbation of the Ego, so thatits victim runs the peril of straying into a BlackLodge, and finding himself at home there.Against this risk we look to our insurance; thereare two infallible: Common Sense and the Sense ofHumour. When you are lying exhausted and ex-enterate after the attainment of Vishvarupadar-shana it is all wrong to think: “Well, now I’m theholiest man in the world, of course with the excep-tion of John M. Watkins;” better recall the words ofthe weary sceptical judge in A. P. Herbert’s HolyDeadlock; he makes a Mantram of it! “I put it toyou — I put it to you — I put it to you — that youhave got a boil on your bottom.”To this rule there is, as usual with rules, anexception. Some states of mind are of the samestructure as poetry, where the “one step from thesublime to the ridiculous” is an easy and fatal step.But even so, pedantry is as bad as ribaldry. Person-ally, I have tried to avoid the dilemma by the use ofpoetic language and form; for instance, in AHA!It is all difficult, dammed difficult; but if it mustbe that one’s most sacred shrine be profaned, let itbe the clean assault of laughter rather than the slimysmear of sactimoniousness!There, or thereabouts, we must leave it. “Out ofthe fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh;” and Icannot sing the words of an epithalamium to themusic of a dirge.Besides, what says the poet? “Love’s at its heightin pure love? Nay, but after When the song’s lightdissolves gently in laughter.”Oh! “One word more” as Browning said, andpoured forth the most puerile portentous piffleabout that grim blue-stocking “interesting invalid,”his spouting wife.

I would add this: that I have not yetheard of anyone who has attained to any results ofimportance who does not attribute his success todevotion of quite similar quality.Here they are:1. The Cloud on the Sanctuary. On reading this"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears63book, Mr. X., who was desperate from the convic-tion that no success in life was worth a tinker’s dam,decided: “This is the answer to my problem; themembers of the Secret Fraternity which this bookdescribes have solved the riddle of life. I mustdiscover them, and seek to be received amongstthem.”2. X., hearing a conversation in a café whichmade him think that the speaker might be such anone as he sought, hunted him down — he had goneon his travels — caught him, and made him promisean interview at the earliest possible date.3. This interview leading to an introduction tothe Fraternity, he joined it, pledging his fealty. Buthe was grievously shocked, and nearly withdrew,when assured: “There is nothing in this Oath whichmight conflict in any way with your civil, moral orreligious obligations.” If it was not worthwhilebecoming a murderer, a traitor, and an eternallydamned soul, why bother about it? was his attitude.The Head of the Fraternity being threatened withrevolt, X. went to him, in circumstances whichjeopardised his own progress, and offered his sup-port “to the last drop of my blood, and the last pennyof my purse.”Deciding to perform a critical Magical Opera-tion, and being warned that serious opposition mightcome from his own friends, family, etc., he aban-doned his career, changed his name, cut himself offcompletely from the past, and allowed no alieninterest of any sort to interfere with his absorption inthe Work. His journey to see the Head seemed atthat time a fatal interruption; at the least, it involvedthe waste of one whole year. He was wrong; hisgesture of setting the interests of the Order beforehis personal advancement was counted unto him forrighteousness.There should be no need to extend this list; itcould be continued indefinitely. X. had one rule oflife, and one only; to do whatever came first on thelist of agenda, and never to count the cost.Because this course of conduct was so rigidlyrational, it appeared to others irrational and incal-culable; because it was so serenely simple, it ap-peared an insoluble mystery of a complexity utterlyunfathomable!But — I fear that you are only too likely to ask— is not this system (a) absurd, (b) wrong, ascertain in the long run to defeat its own object.Well, as to (a), everything is absurd. The Uni-verse is not constructed to gratify the mania of“social planners” and their tedious kind. As to (b),there you said something; the refutation will lead usto open a new chapter. Ought not X. to have laiddown a comprehensive scheme, and worked out thedetails, so that he would not break down half-waythrough for lack of foresight and provision foremergencies?An example. Suppose that the next step in hisWork involved the sacrifice of a camel in a house inTooting Bec, furnished in such fashion as hisGrimoire laid down, and that the purchase of thehouse left him without resources to buy that furni-ture, to say nothing of the camel. What a fool!No, that does not necessarily follow. If the Godswill the End, They also will the means. I shall do allthat is possible to me by buying the house: I shallleave it to Them to do Their share when the timecomes.This “Act of Truth” is already a Magical For-mula of infallible puissance; the man who is ca-pable of so thinking and acting is far more likely toget what he wanted from the Sacrifice — when atlong last the Camel appears on the premises — thenhe who, having ample means to carry out the wholeOperation without risk of failure, goes through theceremony without ever having experienced amoment’s anxiety about his ability to bring it to asuccessful conclusion.I think personally that the error lies in calculat-ing. The injunction is “to buy the egg of a perfectlyblack hen without haggling.” You have no meansof judging what is written in Their ledger; so “...reason is a lie; ... & all their words are skew-wise....”AL II, 32.Let me add that it is a well-attested fact ofmagical experience — beginning with Tarquin andthe Sibylline books! — as well as a fact of profanepsychology, that if you funk a fence, it is harder nexttime.If the boy falls off the pony, put him on again atonce: if the young airman crashes, send him upagain without a minute’s avoidable delay.

And so on; plenty of room forblunders!But it is a thousand times better to make everykind of mistake than to slide into the habit ofhesitation, of uncertainty, of indecision.For one thing, you acquire also the habit ofdishonourable failure; and you very soon convinceyourself that “the whole thing is nonsense.”Confidence comes from exercise, from takingrisks, from picking yourself up after a purler; find-ing that the maddest gambles keep oncoming off,you begin to suspect that there is no more than Luckin it; you observe this closely, and there forms, in thedusk dimly, a Shape; very soon you see a Hand, andfrom its movements you divine a Brain behind thewhole contrivance.“Good!” you say quietly, with a determined nod;“I’m watched, I’m helped: I’ll do my bit; the restwill come about without my worrying or med-dling.”And so it is.Good-night. 666.CHAPTER XLVISELFISHNESSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Selfishness? I am glad to find you worrying thatbone, for it has plenty of meat on it; fine juicy meat,none of your Chilled Argentine or Canterbury lamb.It is a pelvis, what’s more; for in a way the wholestructure of the ethics of Thelema is founded uponit. There is some danger here; for the question is abooby trap for the noble, the generous, the high-minded.“Selflessness,” the great characteristic of theMaster of the Temple, the very quintessence of hisattainment, is not its contradictory, or even itscontrary; it is perfectly compatible (nay, shall wesay friendly?) with it.The Book of the Law has plenty to say on thissubject, and it does not mince its words.“First, text; sermon, next,” as the poet says.AL II, 18, 19, 20, 21. “These are dead, thesefellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor andsad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.“Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest areof us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorrowethis not of us.“Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and deli-cious languor, force and fire, are of us.“We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit:let them die in their misery. For they feel not.Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down thewretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong:this is our law and the joy of the world....”That sets up a standard, with a vengeance!(Note “they feel not,” twice repeated. Thereshould be something important to the thesis hereinconcealed.)The passage becomes exalted, but a verse laterresumes the theme, setting forth the philosophicalbasis of these apparently violent and arrogant re-marks.“... It is a lie, this folly against self....” (AL II, 22)This is the central doctrine of Thelema in thismatter. What are we to understand by it? That thisimbecile and nauseating cult of weakness — de-mocracy some call it — is utterly false and vile.Let us look into the matter. (First consult AL II,24, 25, 48, 49, 58, 59; and III, 18, 58, 59. It mightbe confusing to quote these texts in full; but theythrow much further light on the subject.) The word“compassion” in its accepted sense — which is badetymology — implies that you are a fine fellow, andthe other so much dirt; that is, you insult him by pityfor his misfortunes. But “Every man and everywoman is a star.”; so don’t you do it! You shouldtreat everybody as a King of the same order asyourself. Of course, nine people out of ten won’tstand for it, not for a minute; the mere fact of yourtreating them decently frightens them; their sense ofinferiority is exacerbated and intensified; they insiston grovelling. That places them. They force you totreat them as the mongrel curs they are; and soeverybody is happy!The Book of the Law is at pains to indicate theproper attitude of one “King” to another. When youfight him, “As brothers fight ye!” Here we have theold chivalrous type of warfare, which the introduc-tion of reason into the business has made at themoment impossible. Reason and Emotion; theseare the two great enemies of the Ethic of Thelema."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears64They are the traditional obstacles to success inYoga as well as in Magick.Now in practice, in everyday life, this unselfish-ness is always cropping up. Not only do you insultyour brother King by your “noble self-sacrifice,”but you are almost bound to interfere with his TrueWill. “Charity” always means that the lofty soulwho bestows it is really, deep down, trying toenslave the recipient of his beastly bounty!In practice, I begin afresh, it is almost entirely amatter of the point of view. “That poor chap looksas if a square meal wouldn’t hurt him;” and youchuck him a half-crown. You offend his pride, youpauperize him, you make a perfect cad of yourself,and you go off with a glow of having done yourgood deed for the day. It’s all wrong. In such a case,you should make it the request for a favour. Sayyou’re “dying for someone to talk to, and would hecare to join you in a spot of lunch” at the Ritz, orwherever you feel that he will be the happiest.When you can do this sort of thing as it should bedone, without embarrassment, false shame, withyour whole heart in your words — do it simply, tosum up — you will find yourself way up on the roadto that royal republic which is the ideal of humansociety.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. Let me insist that “pity” is nearly always animpostor. It is the psychic consolation for fear, the“pitiful man” really is a pitiful man! He has trans-ferred his own fear of what may happen to himselfto another: for his is such a coward that he dare notface his fear, even in imagination!P.P.S. The day after I had written the abovepostscript I came upon a copy of Graham Greene’sThe Ministry of Fear — after a long search. Hepoints out that pity is a mature emotion; adolescentsdo not feel it. Exactly; one step further, and hewould have reached my own position as set forthabove. It is the twin of “moral responsibility,” of thesense of guilt or sin. The Hebrew fable of Eden andthe “Fall” is clearly constructed. But remember thatthe serpent Nechesh Wwcn is equivalent to Messiach,cywm, the Messiah. The M is the “Hanged Man,” thesinner; and is redeemed by the insertion of thePhallic God.P.P.P.S. An amusing coincidence. Just as I waspolishing up this letter the lady whom I had justengaged to help me with some of my work irritatedme to the point when my screams became soheartrending that the village will never sleep againas smoothly as its wont. They split the welkin inseveral places; and although invisible menders wereimmediately put on the job it is generally felt that itwill never more be its original wholeness.And why? Just because of her anxiety to please!She asked me if she might do something; I said“Yes;” she then went on begging for my consent,explaining why she had made the request, apologiz-ing for her existence!She could not understand that all she had to dowas to try and please herself — the highest part ofherself — to be assured of my full satisfaction.P.P.P.P.S. “But the A∴A∴ oath; aren’t you —we — all out to improve the race, not counting thecost to ourselves!”Pure selfishness, child, with foresight! I want adecent place to live in next time I come back. Anda longer choice of first rate vehicles for my Work.CHAPTER XLVIIREINCARNATIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Don’t I think I ought to write a book on the FourLast Things, or summat? I do not. What’s more, I’llsee you in Yorkshire’s most important sea-portfirst.But all the same you are within your rights whenyou insist on knowing if I believe in Reincarnation;and, if so why; and how do I feel about it. In otherletters there is quite a lot of detail about the consti-tution of Man, and there is my Essay No. 1, in LittleEssays Toward Truth; you had better get these wellfixed in your mind, in case some of what nowfollows should prove obscure. I can’t be bothered todefine all the technical terms all over again.Do I believe in it?Yes.Why?(1) Because I remember a dozen or so of myprevious lives on earth. (see Magick, Chapter VI.)(2) Because no other theory satisfies my feelingfor “justesse,” for equilibrium, for Newton’s ThirdLaw of Motion.(3) Because every religion asserts, or at leastimplies, it in some sense or other.Even the Judaism-Christianity-Islam line ofthought contains some such element. The Jewswere always expecting Elias to return; the disciplesof Christ constantly asked questions involving it;and I feel that the Mohammedan doctrine of Anti-christ and the Judgment at least toys with the idea.Were I not so ignorant, I could dig up all sorts ofsupport for this thesis. But it doesn’t matter so muchin any case; we do not trouble to find “authority;”we put our shirts on Experience.Now as to (1) what is evidence for me is hearsayfor you; so forget it! But there is a clear method ofobtaining these memories for yourself. See LiberThisharb (Magick, pp. 415-422); and go to it!As to (2) it seems to me fairly obvious. Thedoctrine of Karma is plain common sense; andalthough a terrestrial set of causes might conceiv-ably have their effects in other spheres of action, asof course they do, it seems less trouble for them toremain in their original ambit. As I pointed out longago, the Law of Karma is the Law of Inertia.Nor is it necessary to assert that it always worksout in this way; “sometimes” is quite good enough.Besides, to say “sometimes” explains (or rather,avoids) most of the evident objections to the theory.I grant you cheerfully that Reincarnation is a com-paratively rare occurrence; and it throws upon theobjector the onus of proving an A or an E proposi-tion.What is it that reincarnates? We have had thisbefore, in another connection; it is the SupernalTriad of Jechidah, Chiah and Neschamah that clothesthe original Hadit or Point-of-View, with as muchof the Ruach as the Human Consciousness,Tiphareth, has been able during a given life toattach to itself by dint of persistent Aspiration. Ifthere is not enough Ruach to ensure an adequatequota of Memories, one could never become con-scious of the continuity between one life and thenext.Briefly, the orthodox theory as put forth byH.P.B. is that one works off one’s Karma after deathin Devachan, or Kama Loka, or some such place;when the balance is exhausted, one may come backto earth, or in some other way carry on the GreatWork. One theory — see Opus Lutetianum, theParis Working — says that when one has quitefinished with Earth-problems, one is promoted toVenus, where “bodies” are liquid, and thence toMercury, where they are gaseous, finally to the Sun,where they are composed of pure Fire. Eliphaz Lévisays: “In the Suns we remember; in the planets weforget.”Most of this is the merest speculation, uselessand possibly harmful; but I don’t mind relaxingoccasionally to that extent.What is important is the Oath.One who is vowed to the A∴A∴’s Mission forMankind, who takes it dead seriously, and who willbe neither frightened nor bored from Its majesticpurpose, may at any time bind himself by an Oathto reject the rewards of Devachan, and reincarnateimmediately again and again. By “immediately” ismeant about 6 months before the birth of the newAdept, about 3 months after his last death. It de-pends to some extent, no doubt, on whether he canfind a suitable vehicle. Presumably he will makesome sort of preparation while still alive. It seemsthat I personally must have taken this Oath quite along while ago; for the Incarnations which I actu-ally remember leave very few gaps to be filled in thelast dozen centuries or so.Now, dear sister, I don’t like this letter at all, andI am sorry that I had to write it. For most of thesestatements are insusceptible of proof.And yet I feel their truth much more stronglythan I have ventured to express. How many timeshave I warned you against “feelings?”Love is the law, love under will.Yours Fraternally, 666“Second Method — Preliminary Practices. Lethim seated in his Asana, consider any event, andtrace it to its immediate causes. And let this be donevery fully and minutely. Here for example, is a bodyerect and motionless. Let the adept consider themany forces which maintain it; firstly, the attractionof the earth, of the sun, of the planets, of the fartheststars, nay of every mote of dust in the room, one ofwhich (could it be annihilated) would cause thatbody to move although so imperceptibly. Also theresistance of the floor, the pressure of the air, and allother external conditions. Secondly, the internal"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears65forces which sustain it, the vast and complex ma-chinery of the skeleton, the muscles, the blood, thelymph, the marrow, all that makes up a man.Thirdly the moral and intellectual forces involved,the mind, the will, the consciousness. Let him con-tinue this with unremitting ardour, searching Na-ture, leaving nothing out.“Next, let him take one of the immediate causesof his position, and trace out its equilibrium. Forexample, the will. What determines the will to aid inholding the body erect and motionless?“This being discovered, let him choose one of theforces which determined his will, and trace out thatin similar fashion, and let this process be continuedfor many days until the interdependence of allthings is a truth assimilated in his inmost being.“This being accomplished, let him trace his ownhistory, with special reference to the causes of eachevent. And in this practice he may neglect to someextent the universal forces which at all times act onall, as for example, the attraction of masses, and lethim concentrate his attention upon the principaland determining or effective causes.“For instance, he is seated, perhaps, in a countryplace in Spain. Why? Because Spain is warm andsuitable for meditation and because cities are noisyand crowed. Why is Spain warm? and why does hewish to meditate? Why choose warm Spain ratherthan warm India? To the last question: BecauseSpain is nearer to his home. Then why is his homenear Spain? Because his parents were Germans.And why did they go to Germany? And so duringthe whole meditation.“On another day let him begin with a question ofanother kind and every day devise new questions,not concerning his present situation, but also ab-stract questions. Thus let him connect the preva-lence of water upon the surface of the globe with itsnecessity to such life as we know with the specificgravity and other physical properties of water, andlet him perceive ultimately through all this thenecessity and concord of things, not concord as theschool-men of old believed, making all things forman’s benefit or convenience, but the essentialmechanical concord whose final law is inertia. Andin these meditations let him avoid as if it were theplague any speculations sentimental or fantastic.“Second Method — The Practice Proper. Hav-ing then perfected in his mind these conceptions lethim apply them to his own career, forging the linkof memory into the chain of necessity.“And let this be his final question: To whatpurpose am I fitted? Of what service can my beingprove to the Brothers of the A∴A∴ if I cross theAbyss and am admitted to the City of the Pyramids.“Now that he may clearly understand the natureof this question and the method of solution, let himstudy the reasoning of the anatomist who recon-structed an animal from a single bone. To take asimple example: Suppose, having lived all my lifeamong savages a ship is cast upon the shore andwrecked. Undamaged among the cargo is a‘Victoria.’ What is its use? The wheels speak ofroads, their slimness of smooth roads, the brake ofhilly roads. The shafts show that it was meant to bedrawn by an animal, their height and length suggestan animal of the size of a horse. That the carriage isopen suggests a climate tolerable at any time of theyear. The height of the box suggests crowded streetsor the spirited character of the animal employed todraw it. The cushions indicate its use to convey manrather than merchandise; its hood that rain some-times falls, or that the sun is at times powerful. Thesprings would imply considerable skill in metals;the varnish much attainment in that craft.“Similarly, let the adept consider of his owncase. Now that he is on the point of plunging into theAbyss, a giant Why? confronts him with upliftedclub.“There is no minutest atom of his compositionwhich can be withdrawn without making him someother than he is, no useless moment in his past. Thenwhat is his future? The ‘Victoria’ is not a wagon; itis not intended for carting hay. It is not a sulky; it isuseless in trotting races.“So the adept has military genius or much knowl-edge of Greek. How do these attainments help hispurpose, or the purpose of the Brothers? He was putto death by Calvin or stoned by Hezekiah; as asnake he was killed by a villager, or as an elephantslain in battle under Hamilcar. How do such memo-ries help him? Until he has thoroughly mastered thereason for every incident in this past, and found apurpose for every item of his present equipment,1 hecannot truly answer even those Three Questionsthat were first put to him, even the Three Questionsof the Ritual of the Pyramid; he is not ready to swearthe oath of the Abyss.“But being thus enlightened, let him swear theOath of the Abyss; yea, let him swear the Oath of theAbyss.”2CHAPTER XLVIIIMORALS OF AL — HARD TO ACCEPT,AND WHY NEVERTHELESS WE MUSTCONCURCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.No man alive can appreciate better than myselfthe difficulties connected with The Book of theLaw.You ask me, if I have rightly analysed yoursomewhat complicated series of questions, to ad-vise you as to your attitude towards that Book.Naturally, if you wished for detailed explana-tions, I could no more than refer you to that volumi-nous commentary, verse by verse, which still awaitspublication. But I think I can sum up the mainbusiness in a letter of not too exorbitant length.To begin: the Author is quite certainly both morethan human, and other than human.His main aim seems to me to announce theMagical Formula of the Aeon of Horus, and to laydown the funadmental principles of conduct thatare consistent with it.I put this first, because your troubles belong tothis part of the Book.But let me sort out the principal parts of it.(1) There is a system of the most sublime phi-losophy which stands altogether apart from anyAeon, or from any other limited condition.(2) There is a considerable proportion of thecontents which appears to refer to “The Beast” and“The Scarlet Woman” personally; but these titlesmay be assumed to refer to any one who happens tohold either of those offices during the whole periodof the Aeon — approximately 2000 years.(3) The sex morality of the Book is not verydifferent from that maintained secretly by aristo-crats since the world began. It is the system naturalto any one who has psycho-analysed away all hiscomplexes, repressions fixations and phobias.(4) As matriarchy reflected the Formula of theAeon of Isis, and patriarchy that of Osiris, so doesthe rule of the “Crowned and Conquering Child”express that of Horus. The family, the clan, the statecount for nothing; the Individual is the Autarch.(5) The Book announces a new dichotomy inhuman society; there is the master and there is theslave; the noble and the serf; the “lone wolf” and theherd.3(Nietzsche may be regarded as one of our proph-ets; to a much less extent, de Gobineau.) Hitler’s“Herrenvolk” is a not too dissimilar idea; but thereis no volk about it; and if there were, it wouldcertainly not be the routine-loving, uniform-ob-sessed, law-abiding, refuge-seeking German; theBriton, especially the Celt, a natural anarchist, ismuch nearer the mark. Britons will never get to-gether about anything unless and until each one ofthem feels himself directly threatened.Now here I must tell you a story which maythrow a good deal of light on much that is obscurein the political situation of ’25 to date. The vener-able lady (S.H. Soror I.W.E. 8° = 3) who, on thedeath of S.H. Frater 8° = 3 Otto Gebhardi, suc-ceeded him as my representative in Germany (notethat all this pertains to the A∴A∴; the O.T.O. is notdirectly concerned) attained the Grade of Hermit(AL I, 40). Watching the situation in Europe, shebecame constantly more convinced that Adolf Hitlerwas her “Magical child;” and she conceived it to beher duty to devote her life (for the Hermit “givesonly of his Light unto men”) to his Magical Educa-1 A brother known to me was repeatedly baffledin this meditation. But one day being thrown withhis horse over a sheer cliff of forty feet, and escapingwithout a scratch or a bruise, he was reminded of hismany narrow escapes from death. These proved tobe the last factors in his problem which, thus com-pleted, solved itself in a moment.(O.M. Chinese Frontier, 1905-6)2 The above is quoted from Liber Thisharb; seeMagick in Theory and Practice. pp. 420-422.3 The “Master” roughly denotes the able, theadventurous, welcoming responsibility. The“slave:” his motto is “Safety first,” with all that thisimplies. Race, birth, breeding etc. are important butnot absolutely essential factors."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears66tion. Knowing that the hegemony of the worldwould fall to the nation that first accepted the Lawof Thelema, she made haste to put the Book of theLaw in the hands of her “child.” Upon him it mostundoubtedly made the deepest impression, espe-cially as she swore him most solemnly to secrecy asto the source of his power. (Obviously, he would notwish to share it with others.). From time to time,when circumstances suggested it, she wrote to him,enclosing pertinent sections of my commentary, ofwhich I had given her a copy at the time of the“Zeugnis.”1Had Hitler been a less abnormal character, nogreat “Mischief,” or at least a very different kind of“mischief,” might have come of it. I think you haveread Hitler speaks — if not, do so — his privateconversation abounds in what sound almost likeactual quotations from the Book of the Law. But thepublic man’s private conversation can be repeatedon the platform only at the risk of his political life;and he served up to the people only such concoc-tions as would tickle their gross palates. Worse still,he was the slave of his prophetic frenzy; he had notundertaken the balancing regimen of the Curricu-lum of A∴A∴; and, worst of all, he was very farindeed from being a full initiate, even in the loosestsense of the term. His Weltanschauung was accord-ingly a mass of personal and political prejudice; hehad no true cosmic comprehension, no true appre-ciation of First Principles; and he was tossed aboutin every direction by the varied conflicting forcesthat naturally concentrated their energies ever morestrenuously upon him as his personal position be-came more and more the dominating factor, first indomestic and then in European politics. I warnedour S.H. Soror repeatedly that she ought to correctthese tendencies; but she already saw the success ofher plans within her grasp, and refused to believethat this success itself would alarm the world intocombining to destroy him. “But we have the Book,”she confidently retorted, failing to see that the otherpowers in extremity would be compelled to adoptthose identical principles. Of course, as you know,it has happened as I foresaw; only a remnant ofpiety-purefied Prelates and sloppy sentimentalistsstill hold out against the Book of the Law, sabotagethe victory, and will turn the Peace into a shamblesof surrender if we are fools enough to give ear totheir caterwauling — as in the story of the highly-esteemed tomcat, when at last one of his fans ob-tained an interview; “all he could do was to talkabout his operation.”Has this digression seemed too long? Ah, but itisn’t a digression. Rightly considered, it strikes atthe heart of your “difficulties.”“The Book of the Law takes us back to primitivesavagery,” you say. Well, where are we?We’re at Guernica, Lidice, Oradour-sur-Glane,Rotterdam and hundreds of other crimes, to saynothing of Concentration-camp, Stalag, and a mil-lion lesser horrors and abominations, inconceiv-able by the most diseased and inflamed Sadisticimagination forty years ago.You disagree with Aiwass — so do all of us. Thetrouble is that He can say: “But I’m not arguing;I’m telling you.”Now then let us look a little more deeply (and Ihope more clearly) into his Ethics, with our mindsundismayed by any human emotion.Aiwass is of a different Order of Being fromourselves. Consider a gold-refiner. “Analysis shows20% of copper in this sample; I’ll beat it in a currentof oxygen; that will oxidize the copper. Shake it upwith sulphuric acid; then we wash away the coppersulphate, and that’s that.” He does not consider howthe copper feels about it; indeed, he doesn’t believethat the copper knows about it at all.Yes, yes, of course; I know that’s an extremecase. I only bring it in to show what could be doneas a last resort, if pushed to the wall. Fortunately, weare not so ill situated. You will, I dare say, withoutmy prompting, think of the surgeon and the school-master; but I can go one better. We have in recenthistory a case almost precisely parallel.How did I begin this letter? By defining the taskof the Author: to announce the Magical Formula ofthe Aeon of Horus and so on. In other words, to trainmankind to the use of a new source of power.Page Professor Röntgen! Page the Curies!How many “Martyrs to X-ray dermatitis?” Will-ing experimenters who knew the risks? Not all ofthem; lots of patients got burnt in utmost agony ofdeath. How many victims were there of the “radiumbomb?” (At Guy’s, wasn’t it?) It always has tohappen, even with well tried tools, and despiteutmost precautions. How many workmen’s livesdid the Forth Bridge cost? You know, I suppose,that a certain number of fatal accidents are alwaysincluded in the calculations of any project of PublicWorks.But a new Magical Formula is on a vastly biggerscale. Cast your mind for a moment back to the lastoccasion, when Osiris succeeded to Isis. In thatgreat cataclysm not only Empires, but civilizationscrashed one after another. Three quarters of theAeon had elapsed before the wine of that vintagewas really drinkable.I expect as I hope that this time (communicationbeing universally better established, the founda-tions better laid, and things in general movingquicker) we may be able to enjoy the harvest in verymuch less time. But hang it all! it’s hardly reason-able to expect complete fruition after only 40 years.What seems to me the most encouraging symp-tom of all is this: the Book itself, and the system ofMagick based thereon, and the bankruptcy of allprevious systems (as set forth in Eight Lectures onYoga, Magick, The Book of Thoth, and other simi-lar works) do furnish us all with a clear, concisepractical Method (free from all contamination ofthe humbug of faith and superstition) whereby anyone of us may attain to “the Knowledge and Con-versation of the Holy Guardian Angel,” and that themany other Beings of intelligence and power indefi-nitely more exalted than anything which we recog-nize as human — and, let us hope, capable ofbestowing upon us a modicum of Wisdom adequateto get us out of the quagmire into which the crisishas temporarily plunged us all!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally yours, 666P.S. It has seemed better to make a postscript ofthe most important argument of all; for it is com-pletely separate. It is this.The Book’s meaning is “... not only in theEnglish ...” etc. (AL I, 36; I, 46; I, 54, 55; II, 76; III,16; II, 39; III, 47; III, 63-68; and III, 73). Thesepassages make it clear that there is a secret interpre-tation, which, being hidden as it is hidden, is pre-sumably of even graver importance than the text asit stands. Such passages as I have been able todecipher confirm this view; so also does the discov-ery of the key number 31 by Frater Achad. We mustalso expect a genius to arise who will accomplish allthis work for us. Again we know that much infor-mation of the utmost value has been given throughthe Hebrew, the Greek and very probably the Ara-bic Qabalah.There is only one logical conclusion of thesepremises. We know (a) the Book means more thanit appears to mean, (b) this inner meaning maymodify, or even reverse, the outer meaning, (c)what we do understand convinces us that the Au-thor of the Book is indeed what he claims to be; and,therefore, we must accept the Book as the Canon ofTruth, seeking patiently for further enlightenment.This last point is of especial virtue: see AL III,63-68. The value to you of the Book varies directlywith the degree of your own initiation.CHAPTER XLIXTHELEMIC MORALITYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Right glad am I to hear that thy have so astutelydetected the bulk of my remarks on morals as littlebetter than plain sophistry.“After all,” you tell me, “there is for every one ofus an instinct, at least, of what is ‘right’ and what iswrong.” And it is plain enough that you understandthe validity of this sense in itself, in its own right,wholly independent of any Codes or systems what-soever.Of what, then, is this instinct the hieroglyph?Our destructive criticism is perfect as regards tele-ology; nobody knows what to do in order to act “forthe best.” Even the greatest Chess Master cannot besure how his new pet variation will turn out inpractice; and the chess-board is surely an admirabletype of a limited “universe of discourse” and “fieldof action.” (I must write you one day about Causeand Effect in magical practice.)I seem to have started up this rock chimney withthe wrong leg! What I am trying to write is a sort ofanswer to your remark about “Does the end justifythe means?” and I had better tackle it straightfor-wardly.1 “Zeugnis der Suchenden:” a declaration shehad signed in 1925."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears67Cesspools in every theologian’s back garden:sewers in every legislator’s garden city: there is noend to the literature of the subject. But one point isamusing; the Jesuits have always been accused ofanswering that question in the affirmative, appar-ently for no better reason than that their doctrine isunanimously adverse to admitting it. (People arelike that! They say that I spent months in Yucatan— the only province in Mexico that I did not visit.They say that my home is a Tibetan monastery; andTibet is almost the only country in East and CentralAsia that my feet have never trodden. They say thatI lived for years in Capri — the only town in Italy,of those that I know at all, where I spent less than 48hours.)The Law of Thelema helps us to deal with thisquestion very simply and succinctly. First, it obvi-ates the need of defining the proper “End;” for withus this becomes identical with the “True Will;” andwe are bound to assume that the man himself is thesole arbiter; we postulate that his “End” is self-justified.Then as to his “Means:” as he cannot possiblyknow for certain whether they are suitable or not, hecan only rely on his inherited instincts, his learning,his traditions, and his experience. Of these all butthe first lie wholly in the intellectual Sphere, theRuach, and can accordingly be knocked into anydesired shape at will, by dint of a little manipula-tion: and if Thelema has freed him morally, as itshould have done, form all the nonsense of Plato,Manu, Draco, Solon, Paul (with his harpy brood),John Stuart Mill and Kant, he can make his decisionwith purely objective judgment. (Where wouldmathematics be if certain solutions were à prioriinadmissible?) But then, what about that plaguyfirst weapon in his armoury? It must be theseinstincts, simply because we have eliminated all theother possibilities.What are they?Two are their sources: the spiritual (Neschamah)and the physiological (Nephesch). Note that boththese are feminine. They pertain to Hé and Hé finalin Tetragrammaton respectively. That implies thatthey are, in a sense, imposed on you from thebeginning. Of course it is your own higher prin-ciples, Yechidah and Chiah, that have saddled youwith them; but the “Human Consciousness,” beingin Tiphareth, cannot control Neschamah at all; andit has to be admirably unified, fortified, and per-fected if it is to act efficiently upon Nephesch.(How exquisitely keen is the Qabalah! How apt,how clear, how simple, how pictorially assimilableare its explanations of the facts of Nature! If youwill only learn to use it, to refer your problems to it,you will soon need no Holy Guru!)In practice, we most of us do act upon Nephescha great deal. All learning, training, discipline, tendto modify our physiological reactions in a thousandminor manners. A complete branch of Yoga, HathaYoga, is occupied with nothing else. And you canhave your face “lifted.” Apart from this, we nearlyall of us attend to matters like our waist-line, ourhours of sleep, our digestion, or our musculardevelopment. Some men have even taught them-selves to reduce the pulse-beat both in rate and involume: so much so that they have sometimes beencredited with the power to stop the heart altogetherat will. (Wasn’t it Colonel Somebody — no Blimp— who used to show off to his friends, after dinner?Did it once too often, in any case!)Neschamah is an entirely different proposition.One of Tiphareth’s prime assets is the influence,through the path of “The Lovers,” from Binah. Theson’s milk from the Great Mother. (From his Fa-ther, Chiah, Chokmah, he inherits the infinite pos-sibilities of Nuit, through the path of Hé, “TheStar;” and from his “God,” Kether, the DivineConsciousness, the direct inspiration, guidance,and ward of his Holy Guardian Angel, through thepath of Gimel, the Moon, “The Priestess.”)Neschamah, then, will not be influenced byRuach, except in so far as it is explained or inter-preted by Ruach. These “instincts” are implantedfrom on high, not from below; they would beimperative were one always sure of having receivedthem pure, and interpreted them aright.But this is a digression, though an essential one;the point is how to decide when one’s equation issolved by “a + b”, and one feels that “a + b” isabhorrent to one’s nature.Now do you see the point of the digression? By“wrong” we mean anything that evokes dissent orprotest from either Neschamah or Nephesch, orboth.People spoke to me, people whose experienceand judgment in all matters of Sacrifice to Dionysushad my very fullest assent and admiration; they toldme that of all drinks, the best was Beer. So I havewanted for many years to drink it. I can’t. I oncetasted a few drops on the end of a teaspoon. Theytold me that wasn’t quite the same thing!That’s Nephesch.I cannot bear to do any unkind action, howeverwise, necessary, and all the rest of it. I do it, but “ithurts me more than it hurts you” is actually true forme. (This only applies where the other party isunable to retaliate: I love hurting a stout antagonistin a fair fight.)That’s Neschamah.What one really needs to know is whether theprotest of the Instinct should override the decisionof the Reason. Obviously, one must assume thatboth are equally “right;” that one’s interpretation ofone’s Instinct is full and accurate, that one’s solu-tion of “how shall I act for the best?” is uniquelycorrect.First of all, one is tempted to argue that, thatbeing so, there can be no disagreement; that is, onour general Theory of the Universe. True enough!The farther one goes in initiation, the rarer will suchincidents become. Even a quite uninitiated person— always provided that Thelema has freed himmorally — should find that nine times in ten, theinhibiting antagonism is accidental, or at least ap-parently irrelevant. (Notice, please, that our condi-tions of the “rightness” of both sides are rigid: theusual inhibition is a threat to vanity, or some in-stinct equally false, and to be weeded out.)Wilkie Collins has an excellent episode inArmadale; his “girl-friend” or wife or somebodywants to poison him, and gives the stuff in brandy,not knowing that the mere smell of it is enough tomake him violently sick. So he won’t touch it. I’mnot sure that I’ve got this quite right, but you see theidea.Occasionally it happens that an infinity of minuteand meticulous calculation is necessary to decidebetween the duellists.This is the sort of thing.Suppose that by what is hardly fraud, but “undueinfluence” (as the lawyers say) I could persuade adying person to leave me a couple of hundredthousand in his will. I shall use every penny of it forthe Great Work; it sounds easy! “Of course! Damnyour integrity! Damn you! The Work is all thatmatters.”All the same, I say NO. I should never be thesame man again. I should have lost that confidencein myself which is the spine of my work. No needthat the fraud should be discovered openly: it wouldappear in all my subsequent work, a subtle con-tamination.But suppose that it were not the matter of gullinga moribund half-wit; suppose that the price was astraightforward honest-to-God Bank Robbery un-der arms on the highway, should I hesitate then?Here I should risk my head, and the dice are loadedagainst me; nor does the deed imply “moral turpi-tude.” Stalin’s associates regarded him as a martyredhero when the law of the country, less cogent thatThelema, sat heavily on his devoted head.It would really be a little difficult; my rough-and-tumble life was the best possible training forsuch desperate adventures, so that Nephesch couldnot enter a protest. As to Neschamah, we nearly allof us (Thank God!) have a secret sympathy, withthe nobler type of criminal, whence the universalappeal of Arsène Lupin, Black Star, Raffles andStingaree. When they can make some show ofjustice-on-their-side, it is easier still: Scarlet Pim-pernel and his tribe. We are now almost within themarches of those heroes of romance that enchantedour adolescence: Hereward the Wake, Robin Hood,Bonnie Prince Charlie. And there are, on the otherhand, few of us who do not secretly gloat over thediscomfiture of “Money-Bags.”My retort, however, is convincing and final.Robbery in any shape is a breach of the Law ofThelema. It is interference with the right of anotherto dispose of his property as he will; and if I did somyself, no matter with what tactical justification, Icould hardly ask others to respect my own similarright.(The basis of our criminal law is simple, byvirtue of Thelema: to violate the right of another isto forfeit one’s claim to protection in the matterinvolved.)So much for my own position; but let us look at"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears68the original case with another protagonist: let us saya young Thelemite, fanatically enthusiastic and notvery far advanced in the Path of Initiation. Supposehe argues: “To hell with my integrity, to hell withmy spiritual development: I don’t give a hoot whathappens to me: all I know is that I can help theOrder, and I’m jolly well going to do it.”Who is going to balance that entry in his Karmicaccount? Might not even his willingness to give uphis prospects of advance justify his title to goforward? The curious, complex, obscure and for-midable path that he has chosen may quite conceiv-ably be his best short cut to the City of the Pyramids!I have known strange, striking cases of similar“vows to end vows.” But not by any means suchmacabre fabrications as those of the ghouls atColonel Olcott’s death-bed, or the patient web offalsehood spun by the astrological-Toshophicalspider about the dying dupe on whom he hadfastened, Leo — I’ve forgotten the insect’s name.Well, who hasn’t? No, I haven’t: Alan Leo he calledhimself.I need hardly say that these cases may be multi-plied indefinitely; nothing is easier, and few gamesmore amusing, than to devise dilemmas calculatedto stump the Master, or to catch him bending.In fact, the “Schoolmen” wasted several centu-ries on this agreeable pastime; and they enjoyed theadditional pleasure of torturing and burning any-body who happened not to be quite up-to-date withhis views on Utrum Virgo Maria in congressu cumSpiritu Sancto semen emiserit, or some equallycritical tickler.Don’t tease your pretty little head about it! Nowyou know the principles upon which one must makeone’s decisions, you will not go very far wrong.But — one has to take all these things intoconsideration.Then — you ask — am I saying that the End doesnot justify the means?Hardly that.What I really mean is that these two terms areunconnected. One decides about the “End” in oneway: about the “Means” in another. But everyproposition in your sorites has got to justify itself;and, having done so, to estimate its exact weight inrelation to all the other terms of your problem.“Confusion worse confounded?” I dare say it is;it’s the best I can do with such a difficult question.But I am perfectly happy about it; the one impor-tant thing (as Descartes — and Francis Bacon —saw) is that you should acquire and assimilate theMETHOD of Thelemic thinking.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LA.C. AND THE “MASTERS”: WHY THEYCHOSE HIM, ETC.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Details about Book 4?” This question lacksprecision. I must pull a trigger at a venture.The idea of 4 was due to my observation of St.Peter’s in Rome; it is built with an eye unwaveringfrom the number, as you will see when next you gothere, aware of the fact. Also, 4 means, on thepolitical plane, Temporal Power. (The QabalisticArchitect of St. Peter’s knew that, and designed histalisman ad hoc.) This book was then, according toAb-ul-Diz,1 to achieve worldly success. It is myfault if it did not; still, these are early days to judgeof that.Soror Virakam insisted that I should write this insuch language that the charwoman and the chim-ney-sweeper could understand it easily. She pulledme up at the first hint of obscurity.This went well enough for Part I: Yoga. (And,indeed, that part did sell rather well.) But when Ihad finished Part II, I discovered that not only wasthe book an exceptionally recondite treatise onobscure technical points, but was not even an expo-sition of Magick at all! Magick without Tears,indeed!This was my crazed humility; I honestly thoughtthat everyone knew all about Magick, and how itwas done, and why, and so on. There was little to dobut to erect a superstructure of symbolism. This, bythe way, has hampered me all my life, in every way;I am so aware of my own shameful ignorance onevery subject — there is no mistake about this! —that I cannot conceive of any human being who isactually more ignorant than myself. How couldsuch an one endure to live, with the consciousnessof his infamy gnawing his liver?I know this sounds mad; but it’s true. Well, then,I set myself to repair the omission with Part III; thisshould be a really complete treatise on the Art andScience of magick, and it should be worked outfrom the beginning, a logical sequence like Euclid.Hence Axiom, Postulate and Theorems. I supposedeven then that I could cover the field with anothervolume comparable in size with the former two.I did indeed “finish” this, even announced pub-lication; it was just going to Press when War (alsoannounced five years before by Bartzabel, the Spiritof Mars) came along in 1914. I toted the rod aroundthe world with me (excuse my American!) and in afatal hour of weakness, self-mistrust, took to shewingit to some of my students. Of course — I might haveknown — they all with one accord began: “Oh, butyou haven’t said anything about — —” — all thesubjects in the world. So I started to fill in the gaps.As I did so, I found any amount more to do on myown. It went on like that for 14 years! Since it cameout the voices of detraction have been dumb. I reallydo believe that I’ve covered the ground at last. Ofcourse, time shewed that Part I, although it didreally give the essentials of Yoga in the simplestpossible language, was hardly more than an out-line. More, it did not correlate Yoga with generalphilosophy. Eight Lectures have, I believe, rem-edied this.As to Part IV, The Book of the Law section, theidea was that the volume should comply with theinstructions given in AL III, 39, “All this and a bookto say how thou didst come hither and a reproduc-tion of this ink and paper for ever — for in it is theword secret & not only in the English — and thycomment upon this the Book of the Law shall beprinted beautifully in red ink and black upon beau-tiful paper made by hand; and to each man andwoman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or todrink at them, it is the Law to give. Then they shallchance to abide in this bliss or no; it is no odds. Dothis quickly!” I mistook “Comment” for “Com-mentary” — a word-by-word exposition of everyverse (and much of it I loathed with all my heart!)including the Qabalistic interpretation, a task obvi-ously endless.What then about AL III, 40? (Also see attached.)This problem was solved only by achieving thetask. In Paris,2 in a mood of blank despair about itall, out came the Comment. Easy, yes; inspired, yes;it is, as printed, the exact wording required. Nofurther cavilling and quibbling, and controversyand casuistry. All heresiarchs are smelt in advancefor the rats they are; they are seen brewing (theirvery vile small beer) in the air (the realm of Intellect— Swords) and they are accordingly nipped in thebud. All Parliamentary requirements thus fulfilledaccording to the famous formula of the Irish M.P.,we can get on to your other questions untroubled bydoubt.One Textus Receptus, photographically guar-anteed.

The Equinox of the Gods describes this indetail.But of course Their victim did not have a fairchance of escape. After all, They had had 2000years to perfect Their plans. As for me, I had atraitor in the heart of the citadel; my Karma for Godknows how many Incarnations. (The acquisition ofthe Magical Memory, fragmentary as that is, hasthrown a great deal of light on that matter. Yourletter does in fact surmise that this is so.)You must understand that the arrival of a NewAeon knocks all the Rules sideways. I imagine thateven the very strict Magical Code of Ethics lookslike a cocked hat before They have done with it!My theory is that They chose me for (a) myliterary skill, knowledge and judgment; (b) myscientific training; (c) my familiarity with Eastern1 The Master (or Intelligence) who directed thewriting of this Book; see Letter IX, and Letter LI.2 Error: It was actually in Tunis, November1925. — Editor."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears69ways, habits of thought, and sympathetic predispo-sition; (d) my stern adherence to Truth; (e) mymoral courage; (f) my dour persistence; and (g) myKarma as aforesaid.They prepared me by (a) pushing me rapidlyforward both in Magick and in Yoga; (b) wearyingme of both of them and making me despair of themboth as a solution to the problem of Life, and (c)fixing me both in Buddhistic pessimism and scien-tific rationalism, so that their victory over me mightbe as difficult and solid an achievement as possible.(I am by no means proud of myself. Either I foughtthem or failed them, at every turn.) Chapter V ofThe Equinox of the Gods might have been writtenwith more emphasis; but there are passages else-where in that volume which lay great stress uponthe point.Yet, after all, AL II, 10-11 should surely beenough. “O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn thiswriting. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I amstronger.”To interrupt the dictation of a supremely impor-tant document, merely to jeer at the impotent resent-ment of the luckless scribe! It seemed to me down-right ungenerous, the spirit of the triumphant school-boy bully!But Their ways are not as our ways; this questionleads us on quite naturally to your next point, andthe resolution of that now will unravel that queru-lous criticism. Just as a learned Divine might chuckleover a smoking-room story, or a heart overflowingwith the honey of human kindness wish to have thehousemaid “seven years a-killing,” so may thegreatest of the Masters — even discarnate! — havea perverted sense of humour, or a gross error intaste, (see AL I, 51) “... sweet wines and wines thatfoam! ...” — wines, bar Chateau Yquem and veryfull-bodied port, that I dislike and despise — or anyother eccentricity. Look at H.P.B. — hot stuff, ifyou like!It is most necessary that you should understandwhat happens when on goes from Adeptus Exemptus7° = 4 to Magister Templi 8° = 3. As you seefrom a glance at the Tree of Life, this advanceentails the Crossing of the Abyss; and there is noPath. That means that one must jump. You must getrid of “all that you have, and all that you are” — thatis one way to put it.The Vision and the Voice, Aethyrs XVI-end,gives an immense amount of detail; it must bestudied intensely, with diligence, with Will, andwith imagination. Not only the attainment of thegrade, but the events which go with, or come after,it; all these are described as actual Experience.Even so, it is all extraordinarily difficult until youhave been through it yourself.But that part which answers your question is notreally very hard to grasp; it is indeed most obvious.Ask yourself: then what happens to the discardedelements of the Adept? They cannot be left as theyare, to disintegrate, or to become vehicles for obses-sion. This entity which was the Exempt Adept hasbeen built up in years of unremitting toil, a worthyWorkshop wherein the Great Work should be ac-complished. It has moreover been sanctified andglorified by the Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel.So as each Master has his own appointed Workto perform in the world, he is cast down into theSephira, suitable for that work. If his function is tobe that of a warrior, he would find himself inGeburah; if that of a great poet or composer, inTiphareth; and so on.He, the Master, inhabits this dwelling; but, hav-ing already got rid of it, he is able to allow it to carryon according to its nature without interference fromthe false Self (its head in Daäth) which hitherto hadhampered it. (“If I were a dog, I should bark; if Iwere an owl, I should hoot,” says Basil King Lamusin The Diary of a Drug-Fiend.) He is totallyindifferent to the Event; so then he acts and reactswith perfect elasticity, This is the Way of the Tao;and that is why you cannot grasp the very idea ofthat Way — much less follow it! — unless you area Master of the Temple.Remember in any case, that not only the Adept,but anyone with the smallest capacity for Adeptship,is fundamentally an Artist; he will certainly notpossess any of those bourgeois “virtues” which arejust so many reactions to Blue Funk.Of course, practically all of us in the West get ourfirst knowledge from the pious and pretentiousdrivel of most writers in general circulation. So westart with prejudice.Also, asceticism is all right when it is the propermeans of attaining some special end. It is when itproduces eructations of spiritual pride, and satis-fied vanity, that it is poisonous. The Greek wordmeans an athlete; and the training of an athlete is notmortification of the body. Nor is there any rulewhich covers all circumstances. When men go“stale” a few days before the race, they are “takenoff training,” and fed with champagne. But that ispart of the training. Observe, too, that all men go“stale” sooner or later; training is abnormal, andmust be stopped as soon as its object is attained.Even so, it too often strains vital organs, especiallythe heart and lungs, so that few rowing “Blues” liveto be 50. But worst of all is the effect on the temper!When it is permanent, and mistaken for a “Vir-tue,” it poisons the very soil of the soul. The vilestweeds spring up; cruelty, narrowmindedness, arro-gance — everything mean and horrible flowers inthose who “Mortify the flesh.” Incidentally, suchideas spawn the “Black Brother.” The completelack of humour, the egomaniac conceit, self-satis-faction, absence of all sympathy for others, thecraving to pass their miseries on to more sensiblepeople by persecuting them: these traits are symp-tomatic.Well, this is a very brief synopsis, but I hope thatit will answer your question at least so far as toenable you to understand more easily the account ofthese matters given in The Vision and the Voice.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. On reading this over, it has struck me thatyou may have meant to raise a totally differentissue; that of “abstract morality.” Rather an exten-sive battlefield; I will dispose my forces in array inmy next letter of “morality, heavenly link.”CHAPTER LIHOW TO RECOGNIZE MASTERS,ANGELS, ETC., AND HOW THEY WORKCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I have been thinking over what I wrote in my lastletter with regard to the verification of appearancesin the Astral Plane.I did not mention a parallel question of evengreater immediate practical importance: that ofone’s relations with Astral or discarnate intelli-gences or with Those whom we call “The Masters”or “The Gods”: the messages or gestures whichreach us through the normal physical channels. Theimportance is that they actually determine one’sline of conduct in critical situations.It seemed therefore a good idea to give you threeexamples from The Spirit of Solitude: and here theyare!The first extract refers to the “miraculous” dis-covery of the MS of Liber AL some years after I haddeliberately “lost” it.The second, to the finding of a villa suited to theWork.The third to my rescue from a state of despair.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 6661 It was part of my plan for the Equinox toprepare a final edition of the work of Dr. Dee and SirEdward Kelly. I had a good many of the data andpromised myself to complete them by studying themanuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford —which, incidentally, I did in the autumn; but itstruck me that it would be useful to get my largepaintings of the four Elemental Watch Towerswhich I had made in Mexico. I thought these wereprobably in Boleskine. I decided to go up there fora fortnight or so. Incidentally, I had the conve-niences for conferring upon Neuberg the degree ofNeophyte, he having passed brilliantly through hisyear as a Probationer.I consequently asked him and an Emmanuelman named Kenneth Ward, to come and stay withme. I had met Ward at Wastdale Head shortlybefore, having gone there to renew my ancient loveswith the creeds of the gullies. It happened that Wardwas very keen on skiing. I had several pairs andoffered to give him some. This casual circumstanceproved an essential part of the chain by which I wasultimately dragged behind the chariot of the SecretChiefs. At least I thought it was a chain. I did notrealize that steel of such exquisite temper might bebeaten into a sword fit for the hand of a free man.To my annoyance, I could not find the ElementalWatch Towers anywhere in the house. I daresay I1 The following is from Vol. 4 of “The Confes-sions”, pp. 369-371."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears70gave up looking rather easily. I had got into a stateof disgusted indifference about such things. Rosemight have destroyed them in a drunken fit, just asshe might have pawned them if they had possessedany commercial value. I shrugged my shouldersaccordingly, and gave up the search. The skis thatI had promised Ward were not to be found any morethan the Watch Towers. After putting Neuburgthrough his initiation,1 we prepared to go to Lon-don. I had let the house, and my tenant was comingin on the first of July. We had four days in which toamuse ourselves; and we let ourselves go for athorough good time. Thus like a thunderbolt comesthe incident of June 28, thus described in my diary:“Glory be to Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit in theHighest! A little before midday I was impelledmysteriously (though exhausted by playing fives,billiards, etc. till nearly six this morning) to make afinal search for the Elemental Tablets. And lo!when I had at last abandoned the search, I cast mineeyes upon a hole in the loft where were ski, etc., andthere, O Holy, Holy, Holy! were not only all that Isought, but the manuscript of Liber Legis.”The ground was completely cut away from un-der my feet. I remained for two whole days meditat-ing on the situation — in performing, in fact, a sortof supplementary Sammasati to that of 1905. Hav-ing the knack of it, I reached a very clear conclusionwithout too much difficulty. The essence of thesituation was that the Secret Chiefs meant to holdme to my obligation. I understood that the disasterand misery of the last three years was due to myattempt to evade my duty. I surrendered uncondi-tionally, as appears from the entry of July 1.“I once more solemnly renounced all that I haveor am. On departing (at midnight from the topmostpoint of the hill which crowns my estate) instantlyshone the moon, two days before her fullness, overthe hills among the clouds.”This record is couched in very general terms, butit was intended to cover the practical point of myresuming the task laid upon me in Cairo exactly asI might be directed to do by my superiors.Instantly my burden fell from my back. The longcrucifixion of home life came to a crisis, immedi-ately on my return to London. At the same timeevery other inhibition was automatically removed.For the first time since the spring of 1904 I feltmyself free to do my Will. That, of course, wasbecause I had at last understood what my Will was.My aspiration to be the means of emancipatinghumanity was perfectly fulfilled. I had merely toestablish in the world the Law which had been givenme to proclaim: “... thou hast no right but to do thywill.” Had I bent my energies from the first toproclaiming the Law of Thelema I should doubtlesshave found no obstacle in my path. Those whichnaturally arise in the course of any work soever,would have been quietly removed by the SecretChiefs. But I had chosen to fight against myself forfive years, and “If Satan shall be divided againstSatan, how shall his kingdom stand?” The more Istrove, the more I encouraged an internal conflict,and stultified myself. I had been permitted to com-plete my initiation, for the reason that by doing so Iwas fitting myself for the fight; but all my otherefforts had met with a derisory disaster. More, onedoes not wipe out a lustre of lunacy by a moment ofsanity. I am suffering to this day from the effects ofhaving wasted some of the best years of my life inthe stupid and stubborn struggle to set up myconscious self against its silent sovereign, my trueSoul. “Had Zimri peace who slew his master?”.......2 A boisterous party was in progress. The dancer’slifelong friend, whom I will call by the name sheafterwards adopted, Soror Virakam, was celebrat-ing her birthday. This lady, a magnificent specimenof mingled Irish and Italian blood, possessed a mostpowerful personality and a terrific magnetism whichinstantly attracted my own. I forgot everything. I saton the floor like a Chinese God, exchanging elec-tricity with her.After some weeks’ preliminary skirmishing, wejoined battle along the whole front; that is to say, Icrossed to Paris, where she had a flat, and carriedher off to Switzerland to spend the winter skating.Arrived at Interlaken, we found that Murren wasnot open, so we went on to St. Moritz, breaking thejourney at Zurich. This town is so hideous anddepressing that we felt that our only chance of livingthrough the night was to get superbly drunk, whichwe did ...(Let me emphasize that this wild adventure hadnot the remotest connection with Magick. Virakamwas utterly ignorant of the subject. She had hardlyso much as a smattering of Christian Science. Shehad never attended a séance or played Planchette.)... Lassati sed non Satiati by midnight, I ex-pected to sleep; but was aroused by Virakam beingapparently seized with a violent attack of hysteria,in which she poured forth a frantic torrent of sense-less hallucination. I was irritated and tried to calmher. But she insisted that her experience was real;that she bore an important message to me fromsome invisible individual. Such nonsense increasedmy irritation. But — after about an hour of it — myjaw fell with astonishment. I became suddenlyaware of a coherence in her ravings, and further thatthey were couched in my own language of symbols.My attention being thus awakened, I listened towhat she was saying. A few minutes convinced methat she was actually in communication with someIntelligence who had a message for me.Let me briefly explain the grounds for this belief.I have already set forth, in connection with theCairo Working, some of the safeguards which Ihabitually employ. Virakam’s vision contained el-ements perfectly familiar to me. This was clearproof that the man in her vision, whom she calledAb-ul-Diz, was acquainted with my system of hi-eroglyphics, literal and numerical, and also withsome incidents in my Magical Career. Virakamherself certainly knew nothing of any of these. Ab-ul-Diz told us to call him a week later, when hewould give further information. We arrived at St.Moritz and engaged a suite in the Palace Hotel.My first surprise was to find that I had broughtwith me exactly those Magical Weapons whichwere suitable for the work proposed, and no others.But a yet more startling circumstance was to come.For the purpose of the Cairo Working, Ouarda andI had brought two abbai; one, scarlet, for me; one,blue, for her. I had brought mine to St. Moritz; theother was of course in the possession of Ouarda.Imagine my amazement when Virakam producedfrom her trunk a blue abbai so like Ouarda’s that theonly difference were minute details of the goldembroidery! The suggestion was that the SecretChiefs, having chosen Ouarda as their messenger,could not use any one else until she had becomeirrevocably disqualified by insanity. Not till nowcould her place be taken by another; and thatVirakam should possess a duplicate of her MagicalRobe seemed a strong argument that she had beenconsecrated by Them to take the place of her un-happy predecessor.She was very unsatisfactory as a clairvoyant; sheresented these precautions. She was a quick-tem-pered and impulsive woman, always eager to actwith reckless enthusiasm. My cold scepticism nodoubt prevented her from doing her best. Ab-ul-Dizhimself constantly demanded that I should show“faith,” and warned me that I was wrecking mychances by my attitude. I prevailed upon him,however, to give adequate proof of his existence,and his claim to speak with authority. The mainpurport of his message was to instruct me to write abook on my system of Mysticism and Magick, to becalled Book 4, and told me that by means of thisbook, I should prevail against public neglect. I sawno objection to writing such a book; on quite ratio-nal grounds, it was a proper course of action. Itherefore agreed to do so. But Ab-ul-Diz was deter-mined to dictate the conditions in which the bookshould be written; and this was a difficult matter. Hewanted us to travel to an appropriate place. On thispoint I was not wholly satisfied with the result of mycross-examination. I know now that I was much toblame throughout. I was not honest either with him,myself, or Virakam. I allowed material consider-ations to influence me, and I clung — oh triple fool!— to my sentimental obligations towards Laylah.We finally decided to do what he asked, thoughpart of my objection was founded on his refusal togive us absolutely definite instruction. However,we crossed the Passes in a sleigh to Chiavenna,whence we took the train to Milan. In this city wehad a final conversation with Ab-ul-Diz. I hadexhausted his patience, as he mine, and he told usthat he would not visit us any more. He gave us hisfinal instructions. We were to go to Rome, thoughhe refused to name the exact spot. We were to takea villa and there write Book 4. I asked him how we1 The preparation for this was in some waystrying to the candidate. For instance, he had to sleepnaked for seven nights on a litter of gorse.2 From Vol. 4 of The Confessions, pp. 590-598."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears71might recognize the right Villa. I forget what an-swer he gave through her, but for the first time heflashed a message directly into my own conscious-ness. “You will recognize it beyond the possibilityof doubt or error,” he told me. With this a picturecame into my mind of a hillside on which were ahouse and garden marked by two tall Persian Nuts.The next day we went on to Rome. Owing to myown Ananias-like attempt to “keep back part of theprice,” my relations with Virakam had becomestrained. We reached Naples after two or threequarrelsome days in Rome and began house-hunt-ing. I imagined that we should find dozens ofsuitable places to choose from, but we spent dayafter day scouring the city and suburbs in an auto-mobile, without finding a single place to let thatcorresponded in the smallest degree with our ideas.Virakam’s brat — a most god-forsaken lout —was to join us for the Christmas holidays, and on theday he was due to arrive we motored out as a forlornhope to Posilippo before meeting him at the stationat 4 o’clock or thereabouts. But the previous nightVirakam had a dream in which she saw the desiredvilla with absolute clearness. (I had been careful tosay nothing to her about the Persian Nuts, so as tohave a weapon against her in case she insisted thatsuch and such a place was the one intended.)After a fruitless search we turned our automo-bile towards Naples, along the crest of Posilippo. Atone point there is a small side lane scarcely nego-tiable by motor, and indeed hardly perceptible, as itbranches from the main road so as to form an acute-angled “Y” with the foot towards Naples. ButVirakam sprang excitedly to her feet, and told thechauffeur to drive down it. I was astonished, shebeing hysterically anxious to meet the train, and ourtime being already almost too short. But she sworepassionately that the villa was down that lane. Theroad became constantly rougher and narrower. Aftersome time, it came out on the open slope; a lowstone parapet of the left protecting it. Again shesprang to her feet. “There,” she cried, pointing withher finger, “is the Villa I saw in my dream!” Ilooked. No villa was visible. I said so. She had toagree; yet stuck to her point that she saw it. Isubsequently returned to that spot and found that ashort section of wall, perhaps 15 feet of narrow edgeof masonry, is just perceptible through a gap in thevegetation.We drove on; we came to a tiny piazza, on oneside of which was a church. “That is the square andthe Church,” she exclaimed, “that I saw in mydream!”We drove on. The lane became narrower, rougherand steeper. Little more than 100 yards ahead it wascompletely “up,” blocked with heaps of brokenstone. The chauffeur protested that he would beable neither to turn the car nor to back it up to thesquare. Virakam, in a violent rage, insisted onproceeding. I shrugged my shoulders. I had gotaccustomed to these typhoons.We drove on a few yards. Then the chauffeurmade up him mind to revolt, and stopped the car. Onthe left was a wide open gate through which wecould see a gang of workmen engaged in pretendingto repair a ramshackle villa. Virakam called theforeman and asked in broken Italian if the place wasto let. He told her no; it was under repair. With crazyconfidence she dragged him within and forced himto show her over the house. I sat in resigned disgust,not deigning to follow. Then my eyes suddenly sawdown the garden, two trees close together. I stooped.Their tops appeared. They were Persian Nuts! Thestupid coincidence angered me, and yet some irre-sistible instinct compelled me to take out my notebook and pencil and jot down the name written overthe gate — Villa Caldarazzo. Idly I added up theletters. Their sum struck me like a bullet in mybrain. It was 418, the number of the Magical For-mula of the Aeon, a numerical hieroglyph of theGreat Work. Ab-ul-Diz had made no mistake. Myrecognition of the right place was not to depend ona mere matter of trees, which might be found almostanywhere. Recognition beyond all possibility ofdoubt was what he promised. He had been as goodas his word.I was entirely overwhelmed. I jumped out of thecar and ran up to the house. I found Virakam in themain room. The instant I entered I understood thatit was entirely suited for a temple. The walls weredecorated with crude frescoes which somehow sug-gested the exact atmosphere proper to the Work.The very shape of the room seemed somehowsignificant. Further, it seemed as if it were filledwith a peculiar emanation. This impression mustnot be dismissed as sheer fancy. Few men but aresufficiently sensitive to distinguish the spiritualaura of certain buildings. It is impossible not to feelreverence in certain cathedrals and temples. Themost ordinary dwelling houses often possess anatmosphere of their own; some depress, some cheer;some disgust, others strike chill to the heart.Virakam of course was entirely certain that thiswas the Villa for us. Against this was the positivestatement of the people in charge that it was not tobe let. We refused to accept this assertion. We tookthe name and address of the owner, dug him out, andfound him willing to give us immediate possessionat a small rent. We went in on the following day, andsettled down almost at once to consecrate the Templeand begin the book........1 I knew in myself from the first that the revela-tion in Cairo was the real thing. I have proved withinfinite pains that this was the case; yet the proof hasnot strengthened my faith, and disproof would donothing to shake it. I knew in myself that the SecretChiefs had arranged that the manuscript of TheBook of the Law should have been hidden under theWatch Towers and the Watch Towers under theski; that they had driven me to make the key to myposition the absence of the manuscript; that theyhad directed Kenneth Ward’s actions for years thathe might be the means of the discovery, and ar-ranged every detail of the incident in such a way thatI should understand it as I did.Yes; this involves a theory of the powers of theSecret Chiefs so romantic and unreasonable that itseems hardly worth a smile of contempt. As ithappens, an almost parallel phenomenon came topass ten years later. I propose to quote it here inorder to show that the most ordinary events, appar-ently disconnected, are in fact only intelligible bypostulating some such people as the Secret Chiefsof the A∴A∴ in possession of some such previsionand power as I ascribe to them. When I returned toEngland at Christmas, 1919, all my plans had goneto pieces owing to the dishonesty and treachery of agang which was bullying into insanity my publisherin Detroit. I was pledged in honour to look after acertain person; but I was practically penniless. Icould not see any possible way of carrying on mywork. (It will be related in due course how thiscondition of things came about, and why it wasnecessary for me to undergo it.)I found myself at Morêt, on the edge of the Forestof Fontainebleau, with nothing to do but wait. I didnot throw up the sponge in passionate despair as Ihad done once before to my shame — I had beenrapped sufficiently hard on the knuckles to cure meof that — but I said to the Gods “Observe, I havedone my damnedest, and here I am at a dead centre.I am not going on muddling through: I demand adefinite sign from you that I am still your chosenprophet.” I therefore note in my diary, on January12, 1920, as follows:“I am inclined to make my Silence include allforms of personal work, and this is very hard to giveup, if only because I am still afraid of ‘failure,’which is absurd. I ought evidently to be non-at-tached, even to Avoiding-the-Woes-Attendant-Upon-Refusing-The-Curse-Of-My-Grade, if I maybe pardoned the expression.“And why should I leave my efficacious Tor-toise and look at people till my lower jaw hangsdown? Shall I see what the Yi says? Ay. Question:Shall I abandon all magical work soever until theappearance of a manifest sign?“Answer: 1 The following is from The Confessions, Vol. 4,pp. 379-384.No symbol could be moredefinite and unambiguous.“I have invoked Aiwass to manipulate the Sticks;and, wishing to ask ‘What shall be the Sign?’ gotinstantly the reference in CCXX to our Lady Baba-lon: ‘the omnipresence of my body.’ But this is notquite clear; I took it mentally as referring to theexpected arrival of Our Lady, but it might mean atrance, or almost anything. So I will ask Yi, as mylast magical act for the time being.“I think this means the arrival of OurLady.“I have serious doubts whether the hexagramshould not have been:“which would have certainly meantthat. That I should doubt anything isabsurd: I shall know the Sign, without fail. Andherewith I close the Record, and await that Sign.”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears72The next entry is dated Sunday, February 1.“Kindly read over the entry of January 12 withcare exceeding,. Now then: On Friday, January 30,I went to Paris, to buy pencils, Mandarin, a palette,Napoleon Brandy, canvases and other appurte-nances of the artist’s dismal trade. I took occasionto call upon an old mistress of mine, Jane Chéron,concerning who see Equinox Vol. I, ‘Three Poems.’She has never had the slightest interest in occultmatters, and she has never done any work in her life,even of the needlework order. I had seen her oncebefore since my escape from America, and she saidshe had something to show me, but I took noparticular notice, and she did not insist. My objectin calling on this second occasion was multiple: Iwanted to see the man with whom she is living, whohas not yet returned from Russia; I wanted to makelove to her; and wanted to smoke a few pipes ofopium with her, she being a devotee of that greatand terrible God.“Consider now: the Work whereby I am a Magusbegan in Cairo (1904) with the discovery of theStélé of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, in which the principalobject is the Body of our Lady Nuit. It is reproducedin colours in the Equinox, Vol. I, No. 6. Jane Chéronhas a copy of this book. On Friday afternoon, then,I was in her apartment. I had attained none of myobjectives in calling on her, and was about todepart. She detained me to show me this ‘some-thing.’ She went and took a folded cloth from adrawer. ‘Shut your eyes,’ she said.“When I opened them they saw a cloth four feetor more in length, on which was a magnificent copy,mostly in applique silk, of the Stélé. She then toldme that in February 1917, she and her young manhad gone to the South of France to get cured of theopium habit. In such cases insomnia is frequent.One night, however, he had gone to sleep, and onwaking in the morning found the she, wakeful, haddrawn a copy of the Stélé on a great sheet of paper.“It is very remarkable that so large a sheet ofpaper should have been at hand; also that theyshould have taken that special book on such ajourney; but still more that she should have chosenthat picture, nay that she, who had never doneanything of the sort before, should have done it atall. More yet, that she should have spent threemonths in making a permanent thing of it. Most ofall, that she should have shown it to me at the verymoment when I was awaiting an ‘unmistakable’sign.“For observe, how closely the Words of myEntry of January 12 describe the sign, ‘the omni-presence of my body.’ And there She was — in thelast place in the world where one would have soughtHer.“Note, too, the accuracy of the Yi King Symbol“I observe, after a talk with M. Jules Courtieryesterday, that all their S.P.R.1 work is proof only ofextra-human Forces. We knew about them all along;the universe is full of obscure and subtle manifesta-tion of energy; we are constantly advancing in ourknowledge and control of them. Telekinesis is ofthe same order of Nature as the Hertz Rays or theRadium emanations. But what nobody before mehas done is to prove the existence of extra-humanIntelligence, and my magical Record does this. I errin the interpretation, of course; but it is impossibleto doubt that there is a Somebody there, a Some-body capable of combining events as a Napoleonforms his plans of campaign, and possessed ofpowers unthinkably vast.”If these events be indeed the result of calculationand control on the part of the Secret Chiefs, it seemsat first sight as if the people involved had beenprepared to play their parts from the beginning. Ourprevious relations, the girl’s to opium, my friend-ship with her lover, and his interest in my work;omit any item and the whole plan fails. But thisassumption is unnecessary. The actual preparationneed not go back further than three years, when theStélé was embroidered. We may allow the SecretChiefs considerable option, just as a chess player isnot confined to one special combination for hisattack. We may suppose that had these people notbeen available, the sign which I demanded mighthave been given me in some other equally strikingway. We are not obliged to make extravagantassumptions in order to maintain that the evidenceof purpose is irresistibly strong.To dismiss this intricate concatenation ofcircumstances, culminating as they do in theshowing forth of the exact sign which I haddemanded, is simply to strain the theory ofprobabilities beyond the breaking point. Herethen are two complicated episodes which go toprove that I am walking, not by faith but bysight, in my relations with the Secret Chiefs;and these are but two links in a very long chain.This account of my career will describe manyothers equally striking. I might, perhaps, denymy inmost instinct the right to testify were anyone case of this kind in question; but when,year after year, the same sort of thing keeps onhappening, and, when, furthermore, I findmyself able to predict, as experience has taughtme to do in the last three years, that they willhappen, and even how the pieces will fit intothe puzzle, I am justified in assuming a causalconnection.CHAPTER LIIFAMILY: PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.In your last letter you mention “family pres-sure.” Horrid word, family! Its very etymologyaccuses it of servility and stagnation.Latin, famulus, a servant; Oscan, Faamat, hedwells.It almost deserves the treatment it gets in thatdisreputable near-Limerick:Three was a young lady named EmilyWho was not understood by her femily,She acted so rummily,The head of the fummily,Had her matched with a greyhound from Wem-b-iley.They feared she would breed a facsimile —Bring utter disgrace on the fimilly,So the head of the fommily,Read her a homily —And the devil flew out of the Chim-b-illy!A word ought to have more respect for itself!Then, think what horrid images it evokes fromthe mind. Not only Victorian; wherever the familyhas been strong, it has always been an engine oftyranny. Weak members or weak neighbours: it isthe mob spirit crushing genius, or overwhelmingopposition by brute arithmetic. Of course, one mustbe of good family to do anything much that is worthdoing; but what is one to say when the question ofthe Great Work is posed?Bless you, the whole strength of the family isbased on the fact that it cares for the family only:therefore its magical formula thus concentrated isof necessity hostile to so exclusively individual anaim as Initiation.Its sentiments are reciprocated.In every Magical, or similar system, it is invari-ably the first condition which the Aspirant mustfulfill: he must once and for all and for ever put hisfamily outside his magical circle.Even the Gospels insist clearly and weightily onthis.Christ himself (i.e. whoever is meant by thisname in this passage) callously disowns his motherand his brethern (Luke VIII, 19). And he repeatedlymakes discipleship contingent on the total renun-ciation of all family ties. He would not even allowa man to attend his father’s funeral!Is the magical tradition less rigid?Not on your life!The one serious grimoire of the Middle Ages isThe Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin theMage. He makes no bones about it. He even conde-scends to point out the family as the most serious ofall the obstacles to the performance of the Opera-tion, and he gives the correct psychological reasonswhy this should be so. You said it yourself! “Familypressure” was your pungent and pertinent expres-sion. Just so.It think that “family” should include any body ofpersons with common interests which they expector wish you to share. One’s old school or university,the regiment, the golf club, the business, the party,the country: any of these may dislike very muchyour absorption in affairs alien to their own. But thefamily is the classic type, because its pull is sopotent and persistent. It began when you gave yourfirst yell; your personality is deliberately wrenchedand distorted to the family code; and their zoologyfor is of course the Symbol of ourLady, and the God below Her in the Stéléis the Sun.“All this is clear proof of the unspeakable powerand wisdom of Those who have sent me to proclaimthe Law.1 Society for Psychical Research."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears73is so inadequate that they always feel sure that theirUgly Duckling is a Black Sheep. Even for their Foolthey find a use: he can be invaluable in the Churchof in the Army, where docile incompetence is thesure key to advancement.Curse them! They are always in the way.Even centuries after one of them is dead, heexercises his abominable craft; and you are only theless able to ward off the slaps of the Dead Hand,because (after all!) there is a whole lot of him in you.He appears at times as a sort of alien conscience;and, indebted as you may be to him for yourphysical constitution — I give him credit for nothaving saddled you with gout, rheumatism, T.B., orother plague — and many of your most usefulvirtues, you want to handle your assets yourself,without a subterranean current of criticism, or evenactive interference through others in your sole pre-occupation in the Great Work.I have not actually detected any ancestor of minestealing my whiskey, as the advertisement warns usmay happen: but — oh well! However you like tolook at it, he is always an influence upon you; andthat, good or bad, you quite rightly resent.In the Brahmin caste, the aspirant to Yoga makesit a rule to fulfill his duties to the family and theState; once those jobs are definitely done, he cutsthe painter, and becomes Sannyasi. Many a Maha-rajah, many a Wazir, to say nothing of less respon-sible people, plan their lives from their earliest daysof wearing the sacred Cord as Brahmacharyi, withthese ambitions carefully mapped out; and whenthe right moment comes for him to disappear intothe jungle — the rest is Silence.A sound scheme: that is, provided that one hasfull confidence in the General Theory. But weCaucasians happen not to believe in the Vedas, atleast not in the dyed-in-the-wool sense which comesnatural to the budding Brahmin; as to “our own” —why our own? — scriptures, no intelligent persontakes them seriously any more. Some folk whittleaway merrily, and fashion a Saviour in their ownimages; others strain the text and concoct a sym-bolic interpretation which is more or less satisfying— as can be done with any bunch of legends. Butsuch devices leave us without Accepted Authority,and without that nobody is going to gamble awayhis life. Thus the Path for men of spiritual integritybegins with absolute scepticism. Our methods mustbe exclusively inductive.“Gamble away his life,” did I say? Indeed I did.If there is any truth at all in anything, or even anymeaning in life, in Nature herself; then there is onething, one thing only paramount: to find out whoone is, what is one’s necessary Way.The alternative to the Great Work is the hotchpotof dispersion, of fatuity, or disconnected nonsense.To the performance of this Work the nearestobstacle and the most obvious is the Family. Itspresumption is manifest, in that it expects every-body to yield it first priority.In the Russian troubles following the OctoberRevolution, General Denikin, who was trying toput Humpty-Dumpty back on the wall, capturedthe aged parents of Leon Trotsky, in command ofthe enemy, and chivalrously telegraphed him towithdraw his troops to certain positions, otherwisethe old people would be shot. Trotsky replied“Shoot!”The point of this story is that I hope it will answeryour next question: You are so very clear and firmabout the family; then why don’t you insist on allyour pupils starting with a domestic holocaust?Why? Because a lot of my early rock climbingwas done on Beachy Head. Ask me somethingharder!Look you now, chalk has every possible elementof danger from the standpoint of the cragsman. Allthe more glory to him who can master it!It is an essential part of the Rosicrucian systemthat the Adept should “wear the costume of thecountry in which he is travelling.” I take this in thewidest sense. By that word “country” I understandthis planet and this social status “to which it haspleased God to call me.” The Brethren of the Roseand Cross depreciated monastic life or hermit life:perhaps they thought such expedients cowardly, orat least as a confession of weakness.I agree. One ought to be able to live the normallife of a member of one’s class, to all externalseeming; at least sufficiently so as not to appearunduly eccentric.Perhaps “Let my servants be few & secret: ...”bears some such implication. But the condition ofallowing such apparent laxity is this: That oneshould be as swift and terse as Trotsky in anysimilar situation.If one’s family were reasonable human beings,(But they never are, she sighed) one could perhapsdo wiseliest by explaining the situation. “This Workof mine — you don’t understand it, no need that youshould — is the only important part of my life. Imean to be scrupulously careful of your feelings,and I see no reason why my chosen career shoulddamage our relations. There is only one thing toremember: IF I ever get the faintest suspicion thatyou are opposing me, or condemning my plans, orinterfering in any way, even with the best intentions,THEN — with a single blow I sever our relations,and for ever.” “Well, that’s really very nice of you,Holy One,” you might say; “but you are not the onlyone to be considered, what about the Masters? Dothey ride us on the snaffle? Tradition says not so.”This depends wholly on you. If you are a quiteordinary Aspirant, and a few dozen incarnationsone way or the other don’t make such a difference,then They presumably won’t bother about you atall. In the course of centuries, Karma will roll outthe creases.But — suppose you are of those specially chosento execute some necessary operation in the courseof Their plans? Quite another pair of boots to treadthat Path. Don’t imagine that you are not on it yet,either, just because you happen to be in a mood ofhumility. A pawn may be more powerful than aRook, in some positions.However, even if you are not on it, you can startto-day. That is one of the matters that dependsexclusively on you.If you have already taken the appropriate andadequate Oath, well and good; if not, take it now!What Oath?To cross the Abyss, you have to give up “all thatyou have and all that you are.” This Oath is uncon-ditional: see The Vision and the Voice for details.But for the present so much is neither desirablenor possible: in fact, you cannot genuinely realizewhat it means.So you may content yourself with a simple,reasonable and intelligible Oath for the present: todevote “all that you have and all that you are” to theservice of the Order.The advantage of so doing is that the GrandAuditor of the City of the Pyramids takes immedi-ate notice. He brings your account (Karma) up todate, and starts you off with a Cash Ledger. That is,he arranges for your errors to be paid for on the spot,instead of the customary credit system that goes onfor centuries. The advantage of this is that youknow what you are being punished for, and learnyour lesson at once.This process is, naturally, very painful at times;for one thing, you can’t dope yourself with illusionsabout your being a grand-souled, great-hearted,misunderstood saint, martyr, and hero.And — this I tell you from most bitter experience— the agony is sometimes all but unendurable. TheMasters (or the Lords of Karma, or whatever youlike: I have to put all this in a silly romanticlanguage, if I am to get the meaning across at all) seethe position with absolute accuracy; They know atonce how so-and-so, which you made rather a pointof offering, is really that which you feel you canbear to surrender. Believe me, it is a very thoroughwinnowing, “with which he shall thoroughly purgehis floor,” when Vannus Iacchi whirs in the mill.My personal attitude to all this is, it may be,unduly positive. I may be a bit of a fanatic. But I’minclined to think that you will feel the same, becauseof your detestation of the “elusive.” Having de-cided to gamble, there is no sense in fumbling withthe dice. Anything that makes for closer contact,prompter action, clearer vision, is to be welcome.The deliberate swearing of such Oaths, and thepassionate adherence to them, is the surest methodof approach to the Masters. You force the gate ofTheir temple; if not actually one of Them, you areat least in Their class.Only one reminder: it is worse than useless totake these Oaths with any such ambition. One of themost precious privileges thus gained is the cleansweep that is made of all pretence.This too is painful beyond words at first. Untilthe process starts, you have not the faintest idea ofhow you have wrapped yourself in layers of lies.(The Baltis are like this, you know; they wrapthe baby when it is born, and add rag after rag, neverremoving any, until a prosperous citizen at 40 ismore like a bale of cloth than a human being!)

Ideas of themost atrocious and abominable nastiness, thingsliterally unthinkable by your normal consciousapparatus, are discovered as the mainsprings ofyour character!Those in attendance at confinements are alwaysat first amazed and horrified by the remarks of themost virtuous and refined ladies; but that is the mereloosening of a few superficial layers, such as areaccessible to anaesthetics. These revelations amountto not 1/10 of 1% of the grisly horrors that arerevealed by Sammasati.Now go ahead!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LIII“MOTHER LOVE”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You enthusiastically remark that the love of themother for the off-spring is something that no mancan understand: and you appear to prize it!Well, some men have had a jolly good shot at it,notably Emile Zola. The Usher goes into the corri-dor, and calls that name in strident and stentoriantones. In he waddles, the squat obese bespectacledstudious Jew, with the most devastating of all histhunderbolts under his arm — La Terre, and sowhat?“How he will prologize, how he will perorate”about:“The dewy musk-rose, mid-May’s eldest child,The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves!”He will not.La Terre to him is indeed the mother of all men,sole source of our essential nourishment, the earthto which we are all bound in chains by our inexo-rable bodies, our ineluctable need of life — anddeath.Sublime the thesis? What does he make of it?Theme No. 1 in the first chapter: rural love. Howexquisite, how delicate, first flush of dawn upon theglowing meadows! The young man who is courtingis not idle, either; he serves great nature in yet otherways. He is taking a prize cow to be “served:” onhim depend our milk, cheese, butter, veal and beef.He also contributes to our Wienerschnitzel Hol-stein, or Filet de Boeuf à la Robespierre, our Sole auGratin and our oeufs à la Neige.So then, our rustic idyll! “Rocked on the bosomof our Mother Nature.” Longus paints Daphnis andChloe, Whowasit draws “Aucassin and Nicolette”— why, it’s a root of literature itself all the way toAustin Dobson, Norman Gale and Thomas Hardy,Theocritus — er — hum — not so much of “Mother-love” Trinacria way!Where Zola failed, who can hope to succeed? Todistinguish between brute and brute: no, dear lady,that task I not regretfully relinquish!But in “refined” strata? That cock won’t fight, Othou Aspirant to the Sacred Wisdom! It’s very oftenworse; for under the anaesthetic, the most deli-cately-minded ladies of high social position andreligious repute are apt to pour forth floods of filthwhich would disgust the coarsest harridans of slum-land!This is the final fact: so long as our life is boundto that of the animal and vegetable worlds, so thatwe are bondslaves born to their quite ineradicablehabits, so long are we dragged back from everyflight of fancy or imagination such as would breakthe chains that anchor us to mud.The most far-seeing of our prophetically mindedwriters, Aldous Huxley, brands this black fact uponour foreheads.The first condition of a “Brave New World”must be the dissociation of sexual from reproduc-tive life. The word “mother” must be as nauseatingto all properly human minds as it now is to every onethat has contemplated the subject with clear vision.I know there is an answer to all this; in fact, TheBook of the Law enables us to take it in our stride.But there is another aspect of “mother-love”which is urgent, practical, and in no way dependentupon ideal considerations.What do we find in practice as the immediateconsequence of this “sublime,” this “holy” instinct?Quite a few species of animals habitually devourtheir offspring; but women “know a trick worth twoof that.”No, no, let Zola rhapsodize!Time passes. Libitina smiles. But the conditionsare not spacious; both the “happy events” — realladies and gentlemen emphasize this euphemismwith a snigger and a smirk — are expected the samenight, and the only place available is the barn.Now Zola, well into his stride, gives us fulldetails, hopping from one corner of the barn to theother, so accurately and so judicially that the readervery soon “loses his place,” and doesn’t knowwhich birth is being described in any given para-graph.The accumulated hogwash of a billion sentimen-talists dashes in vain against that cliff of ugly truth.Next witness: Dr. Doughty, who looked after thehealth of Trinity College, Cambridge.A swift routine examination: then he tilted hischair backwards, thrust his hands deep into histrousers pockets, fixed the patient with a glare ofice; then these words dropped like vitriol from hislips: “You — young — fool! You go and put themost tender part of your body where I wouldn’t putmy umbrella!”It is the magical formula of a man to pushoutwards, of a woman to close upon from without.This is commonly seen as the possessive instinct:it may often be masked as “protective” but itsessential truth is the impulse to devour. Hence thedeath-like idea of “home,” where she can digest hervictims in security and at leisure.Hence, as even Jung saw in his very first book,and wrote in stated terms, the first task of manhood— of the “hero” — is to escape from the mother.Now the son, with his male formula, his formula oflife, his instinct to push out, to break down all thatwould restrain him, finds it perfectly natural to “bitethe hand that fed him,” as the complaint mightpiteously wail. But the daughter has no club tosmash, no sword to cut; all she can hope to do is topass the buck. The amoeba, born of fusion, nour-ished by wrapping its pseudopods around suchdrifting particles as come within its scope, is but aparasite on its own dam until the fusion is complete.So, when a woman is “so good,” “so devoted toher daughter,” God help the daughter!She is never allowed to think for herself in theminutest matters; she is bound hand and foot re-morselessly to the routine of her “decent Christianhome;” a wageless kitchen-slut. No hope of escapeunless the mother’s vampirism takes the form ofselling her off to the highest bidder.Need it be added that the “good mother” isusually quite unaware of all this, will read thesesimple statements of plain fact in speechless rage?But the truth stands: the woman-formula is Death:“return to the Great Mother” is the catastrophe ofthe hero, whether he be Coriolanus or Peer Gynt.It is surely unnecessary to state the rider to thistheorem; so perhaps I had better:Anyone who has not totally and for ever de-stroyed in himself every vestige of this instinct,extirpating every root and charring it with Fire,cannot take the first step on the Path of the Wise.How nobly opposite is the Man-Formula! Itsfreight the wealth of the whole Universe, that splen-did Argosy leaps free upon the glittering Ocean, tocast the very Soul of Life upon uncharted andenchanted isles!It is not to these few but well-chosen words thatI propose to look to enhance my popularity in theWoman’s Clubs of the United States.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. “Mother-Love” is, of course, a branch offamily affection about which I have already writtento you in no uncertain terms. Of all its sub-sectionsthis is the worst because it is the strongest, the mostnatural, that is to say, the most brutish. You havecomplained pathetically on more than one occasionthat I do not seem to know my own mind aboutNature; that I am always contradicting myself.Sometimes I tell you that everything is in Nature;that everything moves by Nature: that to opposeNature is to provoke endothermic reaction, andthen I leap headlong through the hoop of my ownconstruction and want you to defy nature, to attackher, to overcome her. Really, dear Master, it is toobad of you!I know it sounds bad but there is not really theopposition that on the surface there seems to be.Perhaps it is that we are talking about two kinds ofNature. In one sense it might be asserted that thefinal formula of Nature is Inertia; in other words,that the dyad of manifested existence is an arbitraryand artificial development of the Zero to whicheverything must always cancel out.Now by saying that, we have to all intents andpurposes, answered the question which it poses; allpositive development must be a conflict with that"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears75Inertia. It is the opposition between the magicalPath and the Mystical; we may therefore say fear-lessly that all forms of progress, although theymake use of the formulae of nature which havebrought them to their present situation, are attemptsto proceed further on the way of the True Will.It is particularly important to understand this atthe present time when the Aeon of Horus is justgetting under way. For the Aeon of Isis, that of theMother, appears to have regarded the whole ofNature as a spontaneous growth of universal scope.In the Aeon Of Osiris, the restriction of Familyappears for the first time.The world of sentient beings is separated intoclusters, each family, clan, gens, or nation, acting asa unit and standing upon armed nutrality withrespect to similar groups. But in the Aeon of Horusthis system has broken down. That such is the caseis already abundantly manifest.Totalitarianism in any of its forms tends to breakdown the family structure. It considers only theIndividual, and him, merely as a unit in the welterof the state.Experience will doubtless prove that this ideasimply will not work. The Individual will come tohis own, but it will be impossible to reconstruct theFamily System.It will in particular be impossible to maintain theintimate relation between Mother and Child, whichhas been so dominant a feature of past civilizations.The very social and economic causes which inthe old time tended to cement the relationship, havebecome centrifugal in their effect.CHAPTER LIV“ON MEANNESS”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Yes, indeed! As you surmise, the injunction to“buy the egg of a perfectly black hen withouthaggling” is another way of putting the Parable ofthe Pearl of Great Price; a much better way. For thePearl-buyer did think of equating the values, whichis precisely what one must not do. That Egg isincommensurable with money.(Further, the saying teaches one to insist onperfection; the hen must not have one tinge of aughtbut black in any feather.)However, that is neither here not there; what youwant me to do is to discuss Economy in its magicalaspects.Very good: to begin, Economy does not meanthrift or cheeseparing. It means: the law of thehouse. In practice, one may say “management.”Finances are only one branch of the science, just astruckling, blackmail, graft, treachery and double-dealing are only components of modern statesman-ship.All the same, I propose to talk in terms of money,because everyone has thought a good deal about it.Examples are abundant, ideas easy to express, andone can be concise and clear without danger ofmisunderstanding.So let us call this letter Moralizing on Meanness!Firstly (dearly beloved brethern) meanness isflat contradiction to the Teaching of The Book ofthe Law. For “The word of Sin is Restriction....”and meanness is plainly a most flagrant case ofRestriction. Also, there is nearly always an elementof Fear in meanness; at least, I would like to bet that95% of mean people originally became so becausethey foresaw a friendless and penniless old age. Andfear is particularly forbidden in the Book: II, 16 “...fear not to undergo the curses....” Waxing in wrath,III, 17 goes on: “... Fear not at all; fear neither mennor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Money fear not,nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other powerin heaven or upon the earth or under the earth....”Then pretty well all the positive injunctions implyreckless enthusiasm. “Beauty and strength, leapinglaughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are ofus.” (AL II, 20.)What’s more, meanness does not even pay! Ipropose to tell you why this is, and how things workout.What is money? A medium of exchange devisedto facilitate the transaction of business. Oil in theengine. Very good, then; if instead of letting it flowas freely and smoothly as possible, you baulk itsvery nature; you prevent it from doing its True Will.So every “restriction” (that word again!) on theexchange of wealth is a direct violation of the Lawof Thelema.How stupid is this tightening of the purse-strings!Parable No. Three, “The Fairy Bank Note.”One evening a man walked into an inn and askedfor hospitality. In the morning, when his bill came,he found he had nothing but a £100 note. “I’mafraid I’ve no change till the Banks open.” “Oh,stick to it — I’ll be back next week — I’ve enoughpetrol to take me home.”“Handy,” thought Boniface, “that will just squaremy brewer.” That reminded the brewer to pay hiscornchandler, who had been worrying him to settle.He wasn’t nasty about it; he really needed themoney for his farmer, a worthy man who wanted tobuild some new outhouses, and the builder couldn’tgive any credit because he was being pressed by theman who supplied his materials, a man in greattrouble on account of his wife’s long illness, and thenecessity of an immediate and very expensive op-eration.So the doctor went round, very lordly, to thelocal estate agent, and made the first payment on thenew house he had wanted for so long. “Hullo!Hullo!” laughed the agent; “here we are again. It’scurious, but I paid out that note only ten days ago!”So there were seven hampered and worried menall made happy, and the Bank note was in the handsof its original holder.Now then for True Story No. 1. It is my ownexperience. When, nearly 40 years ago, I walkedthrough Spain, accompanied only by a single chela,there was little paper money in use, at least in therather primitive places which we favoured. Thecurrency was confined to the silver peso, and itsfractions. About 90 miles north of Madrid, wefound, one fine morning, that our well-meant at-tempt to pay our bill at the posada threw a bomb-shell into the works: the people of the Inn jabberedand gesticulated among themselves for about halfan hour before they produced our receipt, and badeus Hasta la vista!Next day, the same thing, rather worse. The dayafter, worse still; and we saw that they were disput-ing about the coins that we had handed over. Fi-nally, about 20 miles from Madrid, they wouldn’ttake our money at all! Instead, they pointed out thatwe were English gentlemen, and they would beeternally honoured and grateful if we would sendthe money from Madrid!On arrival at that city, we noticed long queues ofpeople besieging the Banks; I put my finger to mynose, and said Aha!But, sitting down at a café, oh no! not at all!Pesos were passing without question. Well, well!So I got into conversation with a knowledgeable-looking bloke, and he told me the whole story. Itseemed that the Director of Customs had a brotherin Mexico D.F. who manufactured brass bedsteads.The uprights of these were packed with forgedpesos of Fernando VII and one other king — I forgethis name — made of the same standard silver alloyas the genuine coins, and so well executed that theonly way to tell the false was that they looked newerthan they should have been, in view of the date! Andso (continued my informant) there was a panic, andno one would take any money at all, and the city wasdying on its feet! So the Government gave orders tothe Banks to change any coins soever for theirequivalent in freshly-minted money — that’s whatthose queues are — and “every one is happy again.”“But,” I objected, “I see you have some old coins.”He laughed. “Those one-eyed mules at the Banks!All foolishness! Days ago we all agreed to take anymoney without question — and as long as we all dothat, why, nobody’s hurt!”I am not pretending that there is anything newabout any of this; the whole theory of credit impliesthe probability of some such happenings.(During the Skirmish [1914-1918 e.v.] somesmall town in Northern Mexico got cut off bywarring presidential brigands from the rest of thecountry, and got on perfectly well for a year or morewithout any money or commerce at all, on a basis ofgood-neighbourly feeling. Similar principles atCefalù; three years without a single quarrel aboutmoney. We used to say: “There’s no harm in moneyuntil you begin to count it!”) Trouble comes fromFear, and from Restriction.When I first landed in the U.S.A. (1900) Inoticed instantly that practically everybody seemedto have money to burn, defying statistics. “Oh,that’s simple!” explained a banker to whom I men-tioned it; “in this country we reckon that moneycirculates 9 times as fast as in England. One dollardoes the work of nine.” Then, a year later at SanFrancisco, everything seemed very dear. Why? InS.F. one hardly ever saw a copper coin; the nickel(2½d) was the smallest in practical use. Going on to"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears76Honolulu, it was twice as bad; and there the dime(5d) was the smallest coin one ever saw. Somehow,it made for stickiness. When one hesitates to paymoney out, one cannot expect other people to feelotherwise. So everything becomes increasingly con-stipated. I am not denying the virtues of thrift, butit’s a long and tedious business; and all the bigfortunes are made by shrewd gambling. Even ifyour policy be “small profits,” it is a failure unlessit ensures “quick returns.” This is the deeper mean-ing of the proverb “time is money.”Then, isn’t there a little Bonus? Isn’t it worthsomething to have a pleasant life, and to havepeople like you. It leaps to the eye if one is a“tightwad;” the Saturnian constriction shows itselfin a myriad ways. “The liberal soul shall be madefat; and he that watereth shall be watered alsohimself.”Now, then expand your thought; from the con-sideration of money (which we chose merely forconvenience of discussion) apply these principles tothe spheres of all the other planets. You will verysoon heighten the enjoyment of life beyond allmeasure and belief!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LVMONEYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You ask me for the initiated view about thepower of money. As the poet says: “O.k. oke; I’myer bloke.” F. Marion Crawford, a Victorian novel-ist, now (I think deservedly) obsolescent, thought Isaw one of his books last week on the shelves of atuppenny shark-library,1 wrote a tale Mr. Isaacsbased on the life of one Mr. Jacobs, the IndianRothschild of two generations ago, financing princes,little wars — everything. One night in Bombay theburden of his wealth broke his nerve; he stood at thewindow of his hotel, and flung masses of money tothe mob. Soon after came a stranger, and said tohim, “You have insulted the fourth of the greatpowers that rule this world; it shall be taken fromyou.” It was so; he lost all. In the end he became,after a fashion, Sannyasi, and died (I suppose) in theusual odour.I thought of this incident in Paris in the twenties,when I saw American tourists plaster the bonnets oftheir cars with 1000 franc notes, or tear them up andstrew the floors of banks with them. Grimly Iprognosticated Twenty-Nine. And it was so.“Nice work!” you charmingly remark; “buthardly what I sought to know.” Patience, child!Money being the fourth great power, “what arethe other three?” Come, come, you can surely dothat in your head. Four’s Tetragrammaton, isn’t it?Very well, then! The First Great Power is Yod,the Father. Fire, the Wand, the Flame of CreativeGenius. The Second is Hè, the Mother, Water, theCup, the Sea to which all things tend; it is the gift ofpleasing, of absorbing, of drawing all things tooneself.The Third is Vau, the Son, the Sword, the mov-ing, penetrating element, double in nature. For it isintellect, but also the result of Genius absorbed,interpreted, transmuted and applied through thevirtue of the Cup to expand, to explain, to bring intoconscious existence.And the Fourth is the Hè final, the Daughter,Earth, the Disk, Pantacle, or Coin — the Coin onwhich is stamped the effigy of the Word that begatit with the aid of the other forms of Energy. It is thePrincess of the Tarot of whom it is written: “Greatindeed is her power when thus firmly established.”It is a trite, and not quite true, saying that moneycan buy nothing worth having. But it can commandservice, the real measure of power, and leisure;without these two advantages the most brilliantgenius is practically paralysed. It can do much tosecure health, or to restore it. The truth is thatmoney is only troublesome when one begins tocount it.(This epigram is copyright in Basutoland, theUnited States of America, the Republic of SanMarino, the Sanjak of Novibazar, Arabia Petraea,and the Scandinavian countries.)Then there is travel, by which I do not meanglobe-trotting; and privacy, less attainable everyyear as the Meddlesome Matties invade every cor-ner of life.But this is by the way; the text, tenor and thesisof the illuminated and illuminating discourse is theabove Epigram, which is not merely one of theextravagant absurdities for which I am justly infa-mous. It is the Pearl of Great Price. Observe that,formally it is a generalization of the principle of theold injunction “to buy the egg of a perfectly blackhen without haggling.” I want you to realize thesupreme importance of this. For one thing, it goeshand-in-hand with the whole doctrine of so-calledrenunciation — which is nothing of the sort. Youdon’t “renounce” five shillings if you pay that for acountry house with 3000 acres of shooting, and thebest salmon fishing on Deeside, do you? This is theGreater Interpretation of the Injunction, that noequation is possible: Magical Power is immeasur-ably more valuable than any amount of money. Butthe Epigram is severely practical. It may sound alittle romantic, but — here goes! A communitywhich thinks in terms of wealth is rich; in terms ofmoney, poor. How so? Because the former includesthe imponderables.A couple of Japanese wrestlers may be worthmore than Phidias, Robert Browning, Titian andMozart in terms of butchers’ meat. We might alterthat incorrect truism “money cannot buy anythingworth having” to “things worth having cannot beestimated in terms of money.” You see, no count-ing. The operation to save your child’s life: do youcare if the surgeon wants five pounds or fifty? Ofcourse, you may not have the fifty, or be obliged toretrench in other ways to get it; but it makes no oddsas to what you feel about it. What is the value of aUniversity Education? The answer is that it is apure gamble. The student may use his advantagesto make a rich marriage, to attract the wife of amillionaire, to earn a judgeship or a post in theCabinet, to earn £500 a year as a doctor, £150 as aschoolmaster — or he may die in the process. Sowith all the spiritual values; they are, in the mostliteral sense, inestimable. So — don’t start to count!Most obviously of all, when it comes to TheGreat Work, money does not count at all. I do notwrite of any Magical work, in the restricted sense ofthe phrase. Shaw says: “Admirals always wantmore battleships” and J.F.C. Fuller: “if a lawyer,more wretches to hang.” It applies to any one whoseheart is in his job. (Of course, in this case, money islike all other things of value; nothing counts but theJob.) This, too, is sound Magical doctrine.Lack of money is another matter altogether.Isn’t it about time you sent me a cheque?Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LVIMARRIAGE — PROPERTY — WARPOLITICSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Directly or indirectly, you have already all youneed about marriage in its relation to MagicalTraning. The Hindu proverb sums it all up: “Thereare seven kinds of wife — like a mother, a sister, adaughter, a mistress, a friend, an enemy and a slave;of these the only good one is the last.”But from your questions I gather that what youwant is advice on how to advise, how marriage as aninstitution is regarded by The Book of the Law.Very good.It is not actually mentioned; but that it is contem-plated is shown by the use of the word “wife” — ALI, 41. The text confirms my own thesis “There shallbe no property in human flesh.” So long as this isobserved I see no reason why two or more peopleshould not find it convenient to make a contractaccording to the laws or customs of their commu-nity.But my above thesis is all important; note thefury of denunciation in AL I, 41-42!As to property in general, the Book lays down nolaw. So far as one can see, it seems to adhere to “thegood old rule, the simple plan that they should takewho have the power, and they should keep whocan.”I think that your best course is to work out allsuch problems for yourself; at least it is an admi-rable if arduous, mental exercise. One ought, theo-retically, to be able to deduce the ideal system fromthe Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus.Now then, as to war. You need hardly haveasked the question; the whole Book is alive with it;it thrills, it throbs, it tingles on almost every page. Iteven goes into details. Strategy: “Lurk! Withdraw!1 No money-lender in the drukenness of guiltplus the delirium of cocaine fortified by buckets ofhashish would dare dream of getting such intereston his capital as these vampires."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears77Upon them! ...” AL III, 9. Then AL III, 3-8. En-gland, I suppose. Verse 6 suggests the mine-layer toany one who has seen one in action. Verse 7 mightrefer to the tank or the aeroplane — or to somethingwe haven’t yet got.Notice also Verse 28, a surprising conclusion tothe long magical instruction about the “Cakes ofLight.” Then the mysterious opening of Verse 46demands attention and research! Can “the Forties”refer to the years ’39 (e.v.) onward — will this warlast till ’49 (e.v.)? Can the “Eighties” be symbolic,as the decade in which universal peace seemed tonearly everybody as assured for an indefinite pe-riod?There are any number of other passages, equallywarlike; but see II, 24.It is a warning against internecine conflict be-tween the masters; see also III 58, 59. Hitler mightwell quote these two reminders that the real dangeris the revolt of the slave classes. They cannot rule orbuild; no sooner do they find themselves in a crisisthan mephitic rubbish about democracy is sweptinto the dustbin by a Napoleon or a Stalin.There is just one exception to the general idea ofruthlessness; some shadowy vision of a chivalroustype of warfare is granted to us in AL III, 59:Significant, perhaps, that this and a restatement ofThelema came immediately before “There is an endof the word of the God enthroned in Ra’s seat,lightening the girders of the soul.” (AL III, 61.) Andthis is “As brothers fight ye!” Perhaps the Aeon maygive birth to some type of warfare “underQueensbery rules” so to say. A baptism of thosewho assert their right to belong to the Master class.Something, in short, not wholly dissimilar from thejousts of Feudal times. But on such points I shouldnot care to adventure any very positive opinion.The last part of your question refers to politics.“The word politics surprises by himself,” as CountSmorltork observed. Practically all those parts ofthe Book which deal with social matters may beconsidered as political in the old and proper sense ofthe word; of modern politics it disdains to speak.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally yours, 666CHAPTER LVIIBEINGS I HAVE SEEN WITH MYPHYSICAL EYECara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Well do you know my lifelong rule never tomake any assertion that cannot be verified, or atleast supported by corroborative evidence, on anysubject pertaining to Magick.When, therefore, you express curiosity as to howmuch of the normally super-sensible world hasbeen revealed to my senses, and especially that ofsight, you must take my answer as “without preju-dice,” “e. and o.e.”, “under the rose,” and “in aPickwickian sense.” If you choose to call me alunatic and/or a liar, I shall accept the verdict withmine accustomed imperturbability. Whether what Iam about to tell you is “true” or not doesn’t matter,as in any case it proves nothing in particular. Whatdoes matter is to accept nothing whatever from the“Astral Plane” without the most conclusive andirrefragable internal evidence.That is enough for the caveat part of it; now Iplunge direct into the autobiographical.I begin with my childhood. There is one incident,not quite relevant in this place, but yet of suchsupreme significance that I dare not omit it. I musthave been about 6 years old. I was capering roundmy father during a walk through the meadows. Hepointed out a bunch of nettles in the corner of thefield, close to the gate (I can see it quite clearly to-day!) and told me that if I touched them they wouldsting. Some word, gesture, or expression of minecaused him to add: Would you rather be told, orlearn by experience? I replied, instantly: I wouldrather learn by experience. Suiting the action to theword, I dashed forward, plunged in the clump, andlearnt.This incident is the key to the puzzle of mycharacter. But, as a child, what did I see? I cannotthink of any one person who subsequently devotedhis life to Magick who has not at least one earlyexperience of seeing angels, or fairies, or somethingof the sort. But A.C.? Nary a one. I was brought upon the Bible, a literalist, fundamentalist — all thata Plymouth Brother could wish. It never occurred tome to doubt a word of what I was told. Perhaps theWolf’s Tail of an healthy scepticism gleamed paleat the age of 10, when I asked my form master howit was that Christ managed to be dead for three daysand three nights between Friday night and Sundaymorning. He said that he did not know, and (to afurther question) that no one had ever explained it.This merely filled me with ambition to be the greatexegetist who had explained it. I never thought ofdoubting the story.Well, all this time, and then through puberty,despite my romantic bent, my absorption in thegramarye of Sir Walter Scott, my imaginative lifeas one of his heroes, and the rest of it, I never hadeven a moment’s illusion that anything of the sorthad ever happened to me. I went through all themotions; I haunted all the places where such thingsare reputed likely to happen, but nothing did hap-pen.There is one exception, and one only.It was in 1896, at Arolla in the Pennine Alps. Itook my cousin, Gregor Grant, a fine climber butwith little experience beyond scrambles, and inpoor physical condition, for the second (firstguideless) ascent of the N.N.E. ridge of Mont Collon,a long and exacting climb of more than averagedifficulty. I had to help him with the rope for mostof the climb. This made us late. I dashed for thequickest way down, a short but very steep ridgewith one decidedly bad patch, to the great snowfieldat the head of the valley. At the bottom of the lastpitch a scree-strewn slope, easy going, led to thesnows. We took off the rope, and I sat down to coilit and light a pipe, while he wandered down. By thistime I was as tired as 14 dogs, each one more tiredthan all the rest put together; what I call “sillytired.” I took a chance (for nightfall was near) onresting 5 or 10 minutes. Restored, I sprang to myfeet, threw the coiled rope over my shoulder, andstarted to run down. But I was too tired to run; Islackened off.Then, to my amazement, I saw on the slopesbelow me, two little fellows hopping playfullyabout on the scree. (A moment while I remind youthat all my romance was Celtic; I had never evenread Teutonic myths and fables.) But these littlemen were exactly the traditional gnome of Germanfolk-tales; the Heinzelmänner that one sees some-times on German beer-mugs (I have never drunkbeer in my life) and in friezes on the walls of aConditorei.I hailed them cheerfully — at first I thought theywere some of the local nobility and gentry of a typeI had not yet encountered; but they took no notice,just went on playing about. They were still at itwhen I reached my cousin, sheltering behind someboulders at the foot of the slope; and I saw no moreof them.I saw them as plainly as I ever saw anything;there was nothing ghostly or semi-transparent aboutthem.A curious point is that I attached no significanceto this. I asked my cousin if he had seen them; hesaid no.My mind accepted the incident as simply as if Ihad seen Chamois. Yet even to-day when I haveseen lots and lots of things more wonderful, thisincident stands out as the simplest and clearest of allmy experiences. I give myself full marks!“Why?” Isn’t it obvious? It means that I am notthe semi-hysterical type who takes wish-phantasmsfor facts. When I started seriously to study andpractise Magick in the Autumn of ’98 e.v., I wishedand wished with all my might; but I never gotanything out of it. With the exception above re-corded, my first experiences were the direct result ofintense magical effort on the traditional lines; therewas no accident about it; when I evoked N to visibleappearance, I got N and nobody else. But even so,there isn’t much to splash!The first definitely physical sight was due to the“evocation to visible appearance” of the Goetiademon Buer by myself and V.H. Frater “VoloNoscere.” (Our object was to prolong the life, inimminent danger, of V.H. Frater Iehi Aour — AllanBennett — Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya — and wassuccessful; he lived another 20 odd years. And oddyears they were!)I was wide awake, keyed up, keenly observant atthe time.The temple was approximately 16 feet by 8, and12 high. A small “double-cube” altar of acacia wasin the centre of a circle; outside this was a trianglein which it was proposed to get the demon to appear.The room was thick with the smoke of incense,some that of Abramelin, but mostly, in a specialcenser in the triangle, Dittany of Crete (we decidedto use this, as H.P.B. once said that its magical"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears78virtue was greater than that of any other herb).As the ceremony proceeded, we were aware thatthe smoke was not uniform in thickness throughoutthe room, but tended to be almost opaquely dense insome parts of it, all but clear in others. This effectwas much more definite than could possibly beexplained by draughts, or by our own movements.Presently it gathered itself together still more com-pletely, until it was roughly as if a column of smokewere rising from the triangle, leaving the rest of theroom practically clear.Finally, at the climax of the ritual — we had gotas far as the “stronger and more potent conjuration”— we both saw, vaguely enough, but yet beyonddoubt, parts of a quite definite figure. In particular,there was a helmet suggesting Athene (or horror!Brittania!), part of a tunic or chlamys, and verysolid footgear. (I thought of “the well-greavedGreeks.”) Now this was very far from satisfactory;it corresponded in no wise with the appearance ofBuer which the Goetia had led us to expect. Worse,this was as far as it went; no doubt, seeing it at allhad disturbed our concentration. (This is wheretraining in Yoga would have helped our Magick.)From that point it was all a wash-out. We could notget back the enthusiasm necessary to persist. Wecalled it a day, did the banishings, closed the temple,and went to bed with our tails between our legs.(And yet, from a saner point of view, the Opera-tion had been a shining success. “Miraculous”things began to happen; in one way and another thegates opened for Allan to migrate to less asthmaticclimes; and the object of our work was amplyattained.)I give prominence to this phenomenon becausewhat we saw, little and unsatisfactory as it was,appeared to our normal physical sight. I learnedlater that there is a kind of sight half-way betweenthat and the astral. In a “regular” astral vision onesees better when the eyes are shut; with this interme-diate instrument, to close them would be as com-pletely annihilating as if the vision were an ordinaryobject of sight.It seems, too, as if I had picked up something ofthe sort as an after-effect of the Evocation of Buer— a Mercurial demon; for phenomena of one sort oranother were simply showered on me from thismoment, pari passu with my constantly improvingtechnique in regular “astral visions.” Sometimes Iwas quite blind, as compared with Frater V.N.; forwhen the circles was broken one night — see thewhole story in my Autohagiography — he saw andidentified dozens and scores of Abramelin demonsas they marched widdershins around my library,while all I saw of them was a procession of “half-formed faces” moving shadowy through the dimly-lit room.When it was a matter of the sense of touch, it wasfar otherwise; I got it good and hearty — but that isnot the subject of this letter.I find all this excessively tedious; I resent havingto write about it at all; I wonder whether I ambreaking some beastly by-law; in fact, I shall askyou to be content with Buer as far as details go; Inever saw anything of importance with purely physi-cal sight with anything like the clarity of my adven-ture on Mont Collon.Yes, as I think it over, that by-law is to thank.This Spring I saw very plainly, on four separateoccasions, various beings of another order thanours. I was ass enough to tell one or two pupilsabout it ...And I’ve never been able to see any more. This,however, it is a positive duty to tell you. One canacquire the power of seeing, with this kind of sightthat is neither wholly normal nor wholly astral, allthe natural inhabitants of the various places that onereaches in one’s travels; one can make intimatecontact with individual “elementals” as closely asone can with human beings or animals, although therelation is rarely continuous or permanent.The conditions of such intercourse are complex:(a) one must have the necessary degree of initiation,magical efficiency, and natural ability; (b) onemust be at the time in the appropriate magical state,or mood; (c) both parties must desire to make thecontact, or else one must be lawfully the superior, amaster and slave relationship, (d) the magical con-ditions at the time must be suitable and propitious;e.g., one would not make love to a salamandrineduring a sandstorm. Of course, like all operations,any such efforts must be justified by their consoancewith one’s True Will.On this note I end this abortive letter.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LVIII“DO ANGELS EVER CUT THEMSELVESSHAVING?”Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of he Law.A very witty way to put it! “Do angels ever cutthemselves shaving?” Rem acu tetigisti, again.(English: you big tease?)What sort of existence, what type or degree ofreality, do we attribute to them? (By angel, ofcourse, you mean any celestial — or infernal —being such as are listed in the Hierarchy, fromMetatron and Ratziel to Lilith and Nahema.) Weread of them, for the most part, as if they werepersons — although of another order of being; asindividual, almost, as ourselves. The principal dif-ference is that they are not, as we are, microcosmic.The Angels of Jupiter contain all the Jupiter there is,within these limits, that their rank is not as high astheir Archangel, nor as low as their Intelligence ortheir Spirit. But their Jupiter is pure Jupiter; noother planet enters into their composition.We see and hear them, usually (in my ownexperience) as the result of specific invocation. Lessfrequently we know them through the sense oftouch as well; sometimes their presence is associ-ated with a particular perfume. (This, by the way, isvery striking, since it has to overcome that of theincense.) I must very strongly insist, at this point, onthe difference between “gods” and “angels.” Godsare macrocosmic, as we microcosmic: an incar-nated (materialised) God is just as much a person,an individual animal, as we are; as such, he appealsto all our senses exactly as if he were “material.”But everything sensible is matter in some state orother; how then are we to regard an Angel, completewith robes, weapons, and other impedimenta? (Ihave never known a god thus encumbered, when hehas been “materialised” at all. Of course, the mereapparition of a God is subject to laws similar tothose govering the visions of angels.)For one thing, all the laws that we find in opera-tion on various parts of the “Astral Plane” are valid.Two things can occupy the same place at the sametime. They are “swift without feet, and flying with-out wings.” They change size, shape, appearance,appurtenances of all sorts, at will. Anything that isrequired for the purpose of the vision is there at will.They bring their own background with them. Theyare able to transfer a portion of their energy to theseer by spontaneous action without appreciablemeans.But here is where your question arises — what istheir “life” like? In the visions, they never doanything but “go through the motions” appropriateto their nature and to the character of the vision.Are we to conclude that the whole set of impres-sions is no more than symbolic? Is it all a part ofoneself, like a daydream, but a daydream intensi-fied and made “real” because its crucial incidentsturn out to be true, as must always occur during thetesting of the genuiness of the vision?Shall we infringe Sir William Hamilton’s Lawof Parsimony if we extend our conception of ourown powers, and conclude that the vision is but amanifestation of our Unconscious, presented in asymbolic form convenient for our understanding?I’m sorry, but I can’t let it go at that! Some of myown experiences have been so confoundedly objec-tive that it just won’t work. So there we are back toyour original question about shaving and I fear mesorely that “Occam’s razor” will help us no whit.It seems to me much simpler to say that theseAngels are “real” individuals, although living in aworld of whose laws we have no conception; andthat, in order to communicate with us, they makeuse of the symbolic forms appropriate; employ, inshort, the language of the Astral Plane.After all, it’s only fair; for that is precisely whatwe do to them when we invoke them.Ha! Ha! Ha! I suppose you think you’ve caughtme out in an evasion there! Not so, dear child, notso: this state of affairs is nothing strange.Ask yourself; “What do I know of Therion’smode of life? Whenever I see him, he’s always onhis best behaviour. I’ve hardly ever seen him eat;perhaps he does so only when I am there, so as notto embarrass me by a display of his holiness. Hisuniverse touches mine at only a very few points.The mere fact of his being a man, and I a woman,makes sympathetic understanding over a vast rangeof experience almost impossible, certainly imper-fect. Then all his reading and his travels touch mine"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears79at very few points. And his ignorance of musicmakes it an almost grotesque extension of magna-nimity for me to admit his claim to belong to thehuman species ... U.S.W.” Then: “How do wemanage to communicate at all? There is bound to bean impassable gulf between us at the best, when oneconsiders that his connotation of the commonestwords like ‘mountain’, ‘girl’, ‘school’, ‘Hindu’,‘oasis’, is so vastly different from mine. But to do itat all! What actually have we done?”Think it out!We have made a set of queerly-shapen marks ona sheet of paper, given them names, attached aparticular sound to each, made up (God knows howand why!) combinations of these, given names andsounds to them too, and attached a meaning —hardly ever the same for you as for me — to them,made combinations of these too according to a set ofquite arbitrary rules, agreed — so far as agreementis possible, or even thinkable — to label a thoughtwith some such arrangement: and there we are!You have in this fantastically artificial way suc-ceeded in conveying your thought to my mind.Now, turn back to Magick; read there how wework to establish intelligible intercourse betweenourselves and the “angels.”If you can find any difference between thatmethod and this, it is more than I can.Finally, please remember as a general rule thatall magical experience is perfectly paralleled by thesimplest and commonest phenomena of our dailylife!People who tell you that it is “all quite differentbeyond the Veil” or what not, are blithering incom-petents totally ignorant of the nature of things.Incidentally, Bertrand Russell has given us asuperb mathematical proof of this theorem; but Iwon’t afflict you with it at this time of asking.On the contrary, I will tell you more about“communication.”There is a method of using Ethyl Oxide whichenables one (a) to analyse one’s thoughts with amost exquisite subtlety and accuracy, (b) to find out— in the French phrase — “what is at the bottom ofthe bottle.” By this they mean the final result of anyproject or investigation; and this, surprisingly of-ten, is not at all what it is possible to discover by anyordinary means.For instance, one might ask oneself “Do I believein God?” and, after a vast number of affirmativeanswers of constantly increasing depth and subtlety,discover with a shock that “at the bottom of thebottle” one believed nothing of the sort! Or viceversa.On one occasion the following experiment wascarried out. A certain Adept was to make use of theSacred Vapour, and when the time seemed ripe, toanswer such questions as should be put to him by hisScribe. Presently, after about an hour’s silence, theScribe asked: “Is communication possible?”By this he meant merely to enquire whether itwould now be in order for him to begin to ask hisprepared list of questions.But the Adept thought that this was Question No.1: meaning “Is there any valid means of makingcontact between two minds?”He remained intensely silent — intensely, asopposed to his previous rather fidgety abstentionfrom talking — for a very long time, and then brokeslowly into a long seductive ripple of hushed laugh-ter, suggestive of the possession of some ineffablydelicious secret, of a moonlight revel of Pan with hisretinue of Satyrs, nymphs and fauns.I shall say no more, save to express the hope thatyou have understood this story, and the Truth andBeauty of this answer.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally yours, 666CHAPTER LIXGEOMANCYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Your last letter has really put me up a gum tree.I do not see how I can write you an account ofGeomancy. At first sight it looks as if all I could dowas to refer you to the official text book of thatsublime and difficult art. You will find it in theEquinox, Volume I, No. 2. (Or am I mistaken and itis No. 4?) I cannot bother to refer to it, and the booksare not under my hand.There is, of course, a short account in Magickand I do not think that it is a very satisfactory one,certainly not in view of what you have asked me.No, it certainly won’t do at all.The main point of your letter appears to be aquestion as to whether I think it worth your while todevote a great amount of time to it; whether itsusefulness repays the pains required to master it.Now here we come to a question of personality.The first thing to remember about Geomancy is thatalthough the various intelligences are attributed tothe twelve signs of the Zodiac they all appertain tothe element of earth. Anyone therefore who has gotin his nativity an earthy sign rising, or the sun in anearthly sign, or a good proportion of planets in anearthy sign, is much more likely to find Geomancyattractive than anyone the principal features ofwhose horoscope are devoted to other elements,especially air, which of course is the enemy of earth.Now these remarks apply of course very much tothe type of question that is likely to be within thegrasp of the Geomantic Intelligences, that mustcertainly be considered as well as the natural fac-ulty of the practitioner to master the art.I ought of course to emphasize that I am just theworst person in the habitable globe that you couldhave asked about this matter, as my rising sign andmy planets are all in fire, air, or water, exceptNeptune, which as Astrology teaches, refers not somuch to the Native as to the period of life.It has accordingly been exceptionally difficultfor me to be of much use to people who have cometo me with enquiries similar to yours, still morewhen they have planted themselves down solidly atmy feet and insisted on my teaching them. There is,however, a certain meagre harvest to be gainedfrom my experience. I should like to tell you whathappened to such a man.A resident of Johannesburg and singularly giftedwith the power of getting physical results to takeplace as a result of Magical experiments, this manwas as strongly attracted to Geomancy as I wasrepelled, and I do not know that it would be fair forme to claim that I had been of any special use to him,though he was always kind enough to say so.When I pointed out that the answers to Geomanticquestions were so vague and indeterminate he hadalready devised a method whereby this difficulty(which he admitted as existing) could be overcome.It is of course of the very first importance inGeomancy to frame your questions accurately; forthe Intelligences serving the Art delight in tricksomegambols. If there is a possibility of assigning adouble meaning to the question you can bank ontheir finding it, and deceiving you.Of all this my disciple was well aware; and hehad become extremely artful in allowing no ambi-guity to spoil any of his questions.But as to the further difficulty about their vague-ness, what he did was to arrange a series of ques-tions narrowing the issue step by step until he hadsucceeded in obtaining a precise instruction whichwould resolve his original difficulty.I do think, as a matter of fact, that I was able tohelp to some extent on the purely theoretical side ofthe Art, and he went back to South Africa feelinghimself fully equipped to deal with any problemthat might arise.At that time we were particularly anxious towind up the first volume of the Equinox with a No.10, which should be a really massive contributionto Magical thought. That meant a very considerableincrease in the cost of production. All this myDisciple, of course, knew, and on arriving inJohannesburg he said to himself “Well, here I am ina part of the world where the earth teams with goldand diamonds. I will procure the necessary fundsfor the Equinox and various other financial neces-sities of the Work by Geomantic divination.”Now, then, he thought, in and about Johannesburgwe have both gold and diamonds; that is exactly thechance for these tricky earth spirits to take advan-tage of the ambiguity. I will therefore frame thequestion so as to cover both sources of riches. I willnot specify gold or diamonds. I will say simply“mineral wealth.”The answers to his series of questions indicatedthat he was to go out of the city where he would finda deposit.The next questions in his series were directed tofinding the direction in which he should start hisexploration. That was easy.The next question was the distance involved, andhe could think of no way of framing questionswhich would inform him on that very importantpoint. He got at it indirectly, however, by asking asto his means of transport, and as to that the answerwas quite clear and unmistakable. He was to use ahorse."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears80Well, he had a Boer pony, and next morning heset forth with provisions for a day’s journey.On and on he went and found no geologicalindication of any mineral wealth. Presently he be-gan to get tired and thought it was a little late. Hecould see in every direction across the Veldt andthere was nothing at all. A mile or so in front of him,however, was a row of small kopjes. He said, I mayas well go on and get a view from the top.This he did; and there was still no geologicalpointer. It struck him, however, that he was gettingshort of water; and just below on the far side of thekopje were a number of apparently shallow pools.“I will fill my skin and give my horse a drink andget home feeling like a fool.”But, when he got to the water, his horse turnedsharply aside and refused to drink. At that hedismounted and put his finger in the water to test it.He had struck one of the most important deposits ofalkali in South Africa. Mineral wealth indeed!He went home rejoicing and took the necessarysteps to protect his find. In the course of the formali-ties he found it necessary to come to London, whichhe did, and told me the whole story.Unfortunately we end with an anti-climax. Thenegotiations went wrong; and the property wasstolen from under his nose by one of the big alkalifirms. However, it was a good mark for Geomancy.I am afraid that all this is a digression. As Iindicated above, what you want to know is to befound in the official instruction on the subject in theEquinox.Now far be it from me to cast any doubt on anyofficial instruction, but I cannot help saying that inthis particular instance it does not give very fulldetails, and I think you would be well advised toinvestigate the whole subject afresh, basing youenquiry on the general principles of the science.You will presumably have noticed that theGeomantic figures are derived from taking thepermutations of two things, four at a time, just as thetrigrams of Fu-Hsi are two things taken three at atime, and the Hexagrams of the Yi are two thingstaken six at a time.The system is consequently based upon 16 fig-ures and no more. Of course all systems of divina-tions which have any claim to be reasonable arebased upon a map of the universe, or at least theSolar system, and 16 is really rather a limitednumber of units to manipulate.However, if you are the type of person who hasa natural bent towards this particular Art you willbe able to develop it on your own lines, guided byyour own experience.I do not think there is anything further to add tothese scattered remarks except that so far as I knownone of the treatises on the subject (with the singleexception of the official instruction) are any use atall.I feel rather acutely how unsatisfactory theseremarks must sound to you, but it is the best that Ican do for you. You must regard it either as anexcuse, or a confession of incompetence, that I havealways had this instinctive distaste for the subject.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXKNACKCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I am very glad that it has not been necessary in allthis long correspondence with you, to discuss thequestion of Knack. You seem to be specially gifted;you were able to get the results directly from follow-ing out the instructions, and I am glad that it isthrough you, on behalf of other people, to whomyou have communicated these instructions, thatthis letter has become necessary.When Otto Morningstar was trying (with indif-ferent success) to teach me how to play FrenchBilliards in Mexico City I found one particulardifficulty, and that was how to play the massé shot.He kept on explaining and explaining and demon-strating and demonstrating, and none of it seemedany good. I understood intellectually, well enough;but somehow or other it never came off. Presentlyhe said that he guessed he knew what was thematter. Although I had the whole thing perfect inmy mind I had not made the link between my mind,my eye and my hand, and what I must do was not togo to him for teaching, of which I had had alreadyenough and more than enough. He told me if I wenton trying it would happen quite suddenly and unex-pectedly one day that I found I could do it. This wasparticularly decent of him because it was in directcontradiction with his financial interest. But he wasan all-round good man.So I cut him out so far as the massé shot wasconcerned and redoubled my practice of it. What hesaid came out right; one day I found that I hadacquired the knack of it.Now with these semi-pupils of yours the samething probably applies. The point you raise inparticular as baffling them is the getting on to theastral plane. It is not much good explaining why thefailure occurs, or at what point it occurs; the onlything that is any use is for the pupil to go on and onand on eternally. He must find out for himself wherethe snag is, and he must continue his experimentuntil he acquires the knack.All this should be perfectly obvious; the samesort of thing applies to every kind of game whichyou know. There is a particular knack for instancein putting. It is not that your calculations are wrong,it is not that your stance is wrong, it is not that yourgrip is wrong, it is that for some reason or other youfail to co-ordinate all these various factors in theproblem; and sooner or later the moment comeswhen it appears to you quite natural to succeed ingetting out of the body, or in opening the eyes on theastral plane, or in getting hold of the particular formof elemental energy which has until that momentescaped you.I have mentioned the question of astral journeysbecause that is one which in your experience, asindeed it has been in mine, is the one that mostfrequently occurs.I do not know why it is that people should get soeasily discouraged as they do. I can only suggestthat it is because they are touching so sensitive aspot in their spiritual and magical organisation thatit upsets them; they feel as if they were completelyhopeless in a much more serious way than if it wasa matter of learning some trick in some such gameas chess or billiards.Of course, the worst of it is that failure in theseearly stages is liable to destroy their confidence inthe teacher, and I think it would be a very wise planon your part to warn them about that.I ought incidentally to mention that this suddenillumination — that is not quite the right word butI cannot think of a better one — is quite different tothe sudden confidence which takes hold of one inthe Yoga practices, the more I think of it the moreI feel that the question of sensitiveness is of thegreatest importance.In Yoga practices one does not, at least as far asmy experience goes, come against the delicacy thatone does in all magical and astral practices. Thereason for that is, I think, quite obvious. All theYoga practices are ultimately of the protective type,whereas with magical and astral practices one isexposing oneself to the contact of exterior (or ap-parently exterior) forces. In neither case however isthere any sort of reason at all for discouragement;and as I said above the cure in all cases is apparentlythe same.In one way or another the veil is rent, the pupilbecomes the master, and the reason for that is reallyrather beyond my analysis so far as that has gone atpresent. I do not know whether it is some kind ofawakening of some faculty of the magical self,though that seems to me the simplest and mostprobable explanation; but in any case there is nodoubt about the nature of the experience, and therecan be no difficulty about the recognition of it whenit occurs.Now, dear Sister, I hope that this letter may be ofreal use to you in dealing with those difficult semi-pupils. In particular I hope that you will make apoint of insisting on how encouraging this doctrineis. Your pupils must not calculate; that indeed isone point where the magical record is rather ahindrance than otherwise.It reminds me of the story of the Psychologistwho wanted to judge the difference in temperamentbetween an Englishman, a Scotsman and anIrishman, in judging the amount of Whisky in abottle in the next room. They had to go in, report,and come back, and tell him what they thoughtabout it. He filled it 50% with great accuracy.The Irishman came back fairly cheerful; herubbed his hands; “Well, there’s half a bottle left,your honour.”When the Scotsman came back his face was fullof gloom: “I’m afraid,” he says, “that half a bottlehas gone.”Then the Englishman had his turn. He came inall over smiles, rubbing his hands, and said: “There’s"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears81not a drop left, so that’s that.”Moral — Be English!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXIPOWER AND AUTHORITYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Thanks very much for your last letter. I expectedno less. As soon as anybody gets into a position ofauthority, even on a very small scale, their troublesbegin on a very large one.Imagine, if you can, what I have been through inthe last quarter of a century or more. My subordi-nates are always asking me for advancement in theOrder; they think that if they were only members ofthe 266th degree everything in the garden would belovely. They think that if they only possessed thesecrets of the 148th degree they would be able toperform all those miracles which at present escapethem.These poor fish! They do not understand thedifference between Power and Authority. They donot understand that there are two kinds of degrees,altogether different.For instance, in the theory of the Church of Romea bishop is a person on whom has been conferred themagical power to ordain priests. He may choose atotally unworthy person for such ordination, itmakes no difference; and the priest, however un-worthy he may be, has only to go through the correctformulae which perform the miracle of the Mass,for that miracle to be performed. This is because inthe Church we are dealing with a religious asopposed to a magical or scientific qualification. Ifthe Royal Society elected a cobbler, as it could, itwould not empower the New Fellow to perform aboiling-point determination, or read a Vernier.In our own case, though Our authority is at leastas absolute as that of the Pope and the Church ofRome, it does not confer upon me any power trans-ferable to others by any act of Our will. Our ownauthority came to Us because it was earned, andwhen We confer grades upon other people Our giftis entirely nugatory unless the beneficiary has wonhis spurs.To put it in a slightly different form of words:Any given degree is, as it were, a seal upon a preciseattainment; and although it may please Us to ex-plain the secret or secrets of any given degree ordegrees to any particular person or persons, it is notof the slightest effect unless he prove in his ownperson the ability to perform those functions whichall We have done is to give him the right to performand the Knowledge how to perform.The further you advance in the Order the morewill you find yourself pestered by people who havesimply failed to understand this point of Magicaltheory.Another thing is that the business of teachingitself is a very tricky one; even such simple mattersas travelling on the astral plane are not to be attainedby any amount of teaching unless the pupil has boththe capacity and the energy as well as the theoreticaland intellectual ability to carry out successfully thepractices. (I have already said a good deal about thisin my letter on Knack.)I have thought it most important that you shouldimpress upon everybody these points. It is abso-lutely pitiful to watch the vain struggle of theincompetent; they are so earnest, so sincere, soworthy in every way of every possible reward andyet they seem unable to advance a single step.There is another side to this matter which isreally approximating to the criminal. There are anynumber of teachers and masters and bishops andgoodness knows what else running around doingwhat is little better than peddling grades and de-grees and secrets. Such practices are of course nobetter than common fraud.Please fix it firmly in you mind that with Us anydegree, any position of authority, any kind of rank,is utterly worthless except when it is merely a sealupon the actual attainment or achievement.It must seem to you that I am beating a dead dog,that it is little better than waste of time for me to keepon insisting, as I am now doing, upon what anyordinary person would think was patent to themeanest intelligence; but as a matter of plain factthe further you advance in the Order, and the morepeople you get to know, the more you find thisattitude, sometimes absurd and sometimes abomi-nable, getting up and kicking you in the face.This is one of the reasons why the older I growand the more experience I have of human nature,the more am I convinced of the wisdom of the Chiefsof the A∴A∴, where association with any otherperson except your immediate superior or the one ofwhom you are yourself in charge is discouraged inevery possible way.There are of course exceptions. It is necessary,though regrettably so, for personal instruction inthe practices to be given or received.For all that, I wish I could show you 200 or 300letters that I have received in the last twenty yearsor so: they tell me without a shadow of doubt thatanything like fraternization leads only to mischief.When you wish instruction from your superior, itshould be for definite points and nothing else. Anybreach of this convention is almost certain to lead toone kind of trouble or another. It may in fact beregarded as a defect of concentration if communica-tion between any two members of the Order shouldtake place, except in cases of necessity.I know that it must seem hard to the weakerbrethren of the Order that we should make so littleappearance of success in the Great Work to whichwe are all pledged. It is so universal a conventionthat success should be measured by members. Peoplelike to feel that they have hundreds of Lodges fromwhom they can obtain assistance in moments ofdiscouragement.But a far truer and deeper satisfaction is foundwhen the student has contentedly gone on with hiswork all by his own efforts. Surely you have hadsufficient example in these letters, where in mo-ments of despair one suddenly awakes to the factthat despite all appearances one has been watchedand guarded from a higher plane. I might say, infact, that one such experience of the secret guard-ianship of the Chiefs of the Order is worth a thou-sand apparently sufficient witnesses to the facts.I would have you lay this closely to your heart,dear Sister, and moreover always to keep in mindwhat I have written in this letter so that you may beable to recognise when the occasion arises howmuch better evidence of the power and intelligenceof the Order is this to being constantly cheered upalong the difficult way by incidents such as it ispossible to explain by what might be considerednormal circumstances.Finally, let me insist that it is a definite symptomof Magical ill-health when the craving for manifes-tation of that power and intelligence come betweenthe worker and his work.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXIITHE ELASTIC MINDCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You ask me what I mean by an “elastic mind” —from our telephone conversation on Friday.It is hard to define; but let me give you anexample of the bad kind: an old riddle. “Why is astory like a ghost?” Because“A story’s a talea tail’s a brusha brush is a brooma brougham is is a carriagea carriage is a giga gig’s a trapa trap is a snarea snare’s a gingin is a spiritand a spirit’s a ghost.”You will have noticed a logical blunder —usually non distributio medii or Hobson Jobson —at every step in the sorites. It is your instinctive, orinstructed, objection to commit these that preventsyour mind from actually moving on such lines.But these “correspondences,” such as they are,ought to present themselves, be judged as false ortrue, and rejected or accepted accordingly.The inelastic mind, on the other hand, is tied bytraining to a rigid sequence, so that it never gets achance to think for itself.To develop a mind properly it needs (a)“Lehrjahre” (a first-class public school and univer-sity education, or the equivalent) when it learns allsides of a question, and is left free to judge for itselfand (2) “Wanderjahre,” when it sees the world foritself, not by any pre-arranged course (Cooks’,Lunns’, University Extension, Baedeker) but builtup on the results of the Lehrjhre, foot or horseback,and avoid beaten tracks.It is the Rosicrucian injunction to “wear thecostume of the country in which you are travel-ling;” this is only another way of saying “When in"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears82Rome, do as the Romans do.” The object of this isnot merely to avoid interference or annoyance, butto teach the mind to think down to the roots of thelocal customs. You learn also the great lesson ofThelema, that nothing is right or wrong in itself: aswe say “Circumstances alter cases.” One trainsoneself to adapt one’s life to the impinging facts: to“cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth.” It leadsone to the understanding of that great Principle ofCompromise which has kept England’s head abovewater through the tempests of a chiliad.But always behind all these must be Will, therestraining and controlling purposefulness whichprevents one getting flabby, as worn rubber does.(This is why no one is surprised to hear an ultra-Socialist minister deliver a speech that might havecome from Pitt.) There must be a perfect readinessof the mind to consider all the possible reactions toany given situation, to judge exactly how far oneshould yield, and in what direction, and to actaccordingly; but always on keen guard against therisk of snapping.Remember that the slightest sign of inelasticitymeans that the rubber has already “perished;” andthat the test of perfection is that one can “Snapback” to the original condition, with no trace of thestress to which it has been subjected.Beyond all, be armed against the “doctrinaire”type of mind, in yourself or in another. One verysoon falls into the habit of repeating ones pet ideas;as the French say. “C’est enfoncer une porteouverte;” and, probably before you know it your-self, you have become that most obscene, abhorredand incurable of human monsters, a BORE.I perceive a slight danger of this kind in the letter:moral, SHUT UP!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXIIIFEAR, A BAD ASTRAL VISIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Your letter of yesterday: so happy that my lastwas useful: but the vision! I must have failed tomake myself clear. We shall come to that later inthis letter.It is reassuring to learn that you are two-thirdshuman! Greed, anger and sloth are the three Bud-dhist bed-rock badnesses; and you have certainlygiven the last a miss in baulk. It is my own darkestand deadliest foe, and oh how mighty! With me henever relaxes. Sounds a paradox! but so it is.Now as to fear. In the Neophyte ceremony ofG∴D∴ when the bandage is first removed from theeyes of the Aspirant, Horus, who was in that Aeon“the Lord in the West,” tells him: “Fear is failure,and the forerunner of failure: be thou thereforewithout fear for in the heart of the coward virtueabideth not.”Listen, my child! I, even I, moi qui vous parle,need no information about fear. When I was twelveyears old, it was discovered that I had defectivekidneys; the opinion, nomine contradicente, of theMedical Profession was that I could certainly neverlive to be twenty-one. (Some people think that theywere right!) But after a couple of years with tutorsin the wildest parts of the country, I was found wellenough to go to a Public School. They soon foundme out! This kidney weakness causes depressionand physical cowardice, and the other boys were notsympathetic about kidneys, regarding them mostlyas satisfactory parts of the body to punch.Imagine my misery! The most powerful of allmy passions — bar sloth — is Pride; and here wasI, the object of universal contempt. So, when I wasable to determine my own way of life, I observedmildly “Pike’s Peak or bust!” and chose for mysports the two, mountain climbing and big-gameshooting, reputed the most dangerous. It was adesperate remedy, but it worked. No half measures,either! I used to wander into the jungle alone,looking for tigers, and trusting to my sense ofdirection to take me back to camp. All my mountainclimbing was guideless, and a very great deal of itsolitary.Well, this is not an example for you to copy, is it?But it gives an idea of the principle “Take the bullby the horns.” A practice easier to imitate was thisfollowing. In most great cities, always in Easterncities, are black slums. Here one may find blindalleys, dark doorways open to unlighted houses.One may explore such places, looking for adven-ture — and it was rather a point of honour to acceptthe challenge in whatever form it took. Again, onemay walk with deliberate carelessness into thetraffic; this practice does not in my considerableexperience, conduce to one’s personal popularity.Another idea was to hasten to cholera-strickencities, to places where Yellow Jack, plague, typhoidand typhus, dysentery (et haec turba malorum)were endemic; and (of course) big-game huntingtakes one to the certainty of malarial fever, with nodoctors (or worse, Bengali doctors!) within many aleague.The general principle seems to be “This boatcarries Caesar and his Fortunes!” and no doubtPride in its most Satanic degree is one’s greatestasset. But the essence of the practice, as a practice,is to seek out and to face what one fears. Do notforget that courage implies fear — what else shouldfear be useful for?Of course, fears differ greatly both in quality andin degree; and one must distinguish between ratio-nal fear, ignorance of which implies stupidity, brut-ishness, imbecility, or what have you, and thepathological fear which springs from mental ormoral disorder. There are in fact many types of fearwhich may be uprooted by some form of psycho-analysis. Generally speaking, it is up to you toinvent a practice to meet each specific case.One moment, though, about the fear of death.The radical cure is the gaining of the magicalmemory. (See also AL I, 58.) The more previousincarnations one can remember, the less importantappears the moment when the curve of life dipsbelow the horizon. (One very curious point: whenone looks back at the moment of one of one’sdeaths, one exclaims: “By Jove! that was a narrowescape, and no mistake!” Escape from what? Me nosavvy; but such is the fact.) How to acquire thatMemory? The development of the Magical Recordis by far the most important of one’s weapons. Howto use the Record is not easy to explain; but there isa sort of knack which comes to one suddenly. Andthere are certain types of Samadhi during the exer-cise of which these memories appear spontane-ously, without warning of any kind.There is comfort in the thought that the persistentpractice of seeking out one’s fears, analysing themand their causes, then deliberately evoking them to“come out, you cad, and fight!” (W.S. Gilbert),presently sets up a habit of mind which is a strongfortress against all fear’s modes of assault; onesprings automatically to action when a patrol sneaksup within range of one’s guns.Particularly useful against the fear of death is thepunctual and vigorous performance of Liber Resh.Meditate on the sun in each station: his continuousand even way: the endless circle. That formula inthe Tarot book is most valuable.One excellent practice, the general idea of whichcan easily be adapted to a host of particular cases,is the use of the imagination.Let me tell you how it worked in those early AirRaids on London. First, I looked at the questionsensibly, taking the view that shelters and gasmasks were soothing syrup with an element ofbooby-trap in it.(J.B.S. Haldane in Spain, running to escape abomb, found himself racing towards the exact spotwhere it fell.)Let me tell you a fable from the East. It is one ofthose incomparably sublime blossoms of the Spiritof Islam, infinite depth of wisdom adorned with themost exquisite and delicate wit.Contrast it with the poor thin propagandist stuffwhich passes for a parable in the Gospels! There ishardly one to be found worth remembering.Isaak ben Hiddekel was a Jew of Baghdad.Though not in his first or even second youth, he wasin such health, enjoyed such prosperity, and com-manded such universal respect and devotion thatevery moment of his life was dear to him. Amonghis pleasures one of the chief was the friendship ofthe aged Mohammed ibn Mahmed of Bassorah,reputed a sage of no common stature, for (it wassaid) his piety had been rewarded with such gifts asthe power to communicate with Archangels, an-gels, the Jinn, and even with Gabriel himself. How-ever this may have been, he held Isaak in very greatesteem and affection.It was shortly after leaving his friend’s houseafter a short visit to Baghdad that he met Death.“Good morning,” said the saint. “I do hope you’renot going to Isaak’s, he is a very dear friend ofmine.” “No!” said Death, “not just now; but sinceyou mention it, I shall be with him at moonrise onthe thirteenth of next month. Sorry he’s a friend ofyours; but no one knows better than you do that"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears83these things can’t be helped.”Mohammed set off sadly for Bassorah. Indeed,as the days passed, the incident preyed upon hismind, until at last he resolved to risk the breach ofprofessional confidence and warn his friend. Hesent accordingly a letter of condolence and fare-well.But Isaak was a man of action. Prompt andstealthy, on the day appointed he saddled his besthorse and so passed through the silent streets of thecity in search of a refuge.That evening Mohammed was returning fromprayer “Nowit asali fardh salat al maghrab Allahuakbar” slowly and mournfully, when hardly half-way from the mosque to his house who should hemeet but Death!“Peace be with thee!” says Death. “And peacewith thee,” replied the sage. “But I did not expect tosee thee here to-night; I thought you were to meetmy friend Isaak, and he’s in Baghdad.” “It wants anhour yet of the time,” says Death briskly; “and he’sgalloping hither as fast as he can.”At least, don’t let the Gods have the laugh onyou! Hello! Here’s the Book of Lies again! Whatfun. Now I ring up POL 5410 and borrow the bookand get the chapter we need copied and — oh! Withluck we shall get this space filled in a month or two!“The Smoking Dog”“Each act of man is the twist and double of anhare.“Love and Death are the greyhounds that coursehim.“God bred the hounds and taketh His pleasure inthe sport.“This is the Comedy of Pan, that man shouldthink he hunteth, while those hounds hunthim.“This is the Tragedy of Man, when facing Loveand Death he turns to bay.“He is no more hare, but boar.“There are no other comedies or tragedies.“Cease then to be the mockery of God; in sav-agery of love and death live thou and die!“Thus shall His laughter be thrilled through withEcstasy.”Very good! Now where were we? in the “blitz”?Oh, yes! No sense in scuffling or slinking or skulk-ing; so one decides to take no notice so far aspractical action is concerned.So, the noise making work rather difficult, onelies down in Shavasana (the “Corpse-Position” —flat on the back, arms by sides, everything relaxed)or the Templar (Sleep of Siloam) position, which isthat of the Hanged Man in the Tarot. One thenimagines a bomb dropping first in one place, then inanother; one imagines the damage, and what onethen has to do to counteract the new dangers —perhaps a wall of your house has gone, and youmust get clear before the roof falls in. And so on —close the practice by a block-buster hitting youaccurately on the tip of the nose. This must be donerealistically enough to make you actually afraid.But presently the fear wears off, and you get inter-ested in your various adventures after each explo-sion: ambulance taking you to hospital, gettingtools and digging out other people and so as far asyour imagination takes you. After that comes yetanother stage; your interest declines; you find your-self indifferent to the entire proceedings. After a fewnights you can no longer distinguish between thereal thing and your own private and peculiar Brock’sBenefit. The fear will have vanished; familiaritybreeds contempt. Finally, one is no longer evenaware that the boys are out again on a lark.Incidentally, one may draw a quite close parallelbetween these four stages and those accompanyingSamadhi (probably listed in Mrs. Rhys David’sbook on Buddhist Psychology, or in Warren’s bran-tub of translations from the Tripitaka, or ThreeBaskets of the Dhamma. I haven’t seen either bookfor forty years or more, don’t remember the exacttitles; scholars would help us to dig them out, but itisn’t worth while. I recall the quintessence accu-rately enough.Stage 1 is Ananda, usually translated “Bliss”.This is an intensity of enjoyment altogether inde-scribable. This is due to the temporary destructionof the pain-bearing Ahamkara, or Ego-making fac-ulty.Stage 2. Ananda wears off sufficiently to allowone to observe the state itself: intense interest (ob-jective) of a kind that suggests approach to theTrance of Wonder. (See Little Essays TowardsTruth pp. 24-28.)Stage 3. Interest exhausted, one just doesn’tcare. (Once more “Indifference” Op. cit. pp. 39-44.How simple, how serene, how innocent a pleasureto write Op. cit.! It does make one feel good!)Stage 4. “Neither indifference nor not-indiffer-ence.” One hardly knows what to make of thistranslation of the technical Buddhist term: prob-ably no meaning is really illuminating to one whohas not experienced that state of mind. To me itseems a kind of non-awareness which is somehowdifferent from mere ignorance. Rather like one’sfeeling about the automatic functions of physiol-ogy, perhaps: and acceptance so complete that,although the mind contains the idea, it is not stirredthereby into consciousness. These speculations are,perhaps, idle, and so distracting, for you in yourpresent path. Was it worth while to make thisanalogy? I think so, vague and unscientific as itmust have seemed to you, as reminding you of theway in which unlike ideas acquire close kinship asone advanced on the path.Enough of all this! I could not bear to hear youexclaim: “Di magni! Salaputtium disertum!” asCatullus would certainly have done, had I inflictedall these dry-as-dust dromedary-droppings uponhim!Let us get on to your white rages!Well I do know them though I call them black —no, I shall not quarrel about the colour.To me they come almost every day. When I seethe maid dust my mantel-piece — which I pay herto do — I want not merely to slay her in theextremity of torment; I want to abolish her, toannihilate her — and the mantelpiece too andeverything on it! I can hardly keep from roaring ather to get out and never darken my door again. Thisis not because she is doing it badly; doing it at all isa token of the unspeakable horror of existence. Theactual feeling is that she is somewhat disturbing myaura, which I had got so nice and clean and quietafter the nuisance of “getting up.” I feel as if I werebeing pushed about in a crowd of swarming insect-citizens.Then there is quite another kind, which is quiteclearly penny-plain frustration. Something onewants to do, perhaps a trifle, and one can’t. Thenone looks for the obstacle, and then the enemybehind that again; maybe one gets into one of those“ladder-meditations” (as described in Liber Aleph,quoted in The Book of Thoth, when discussing“The Fool” and Hashish, only the wrong way up!)which end by the conception of the Universe itself asthe very climax, asymptote, quintessence of frustra-tion — the perfect symbol of all uselessness. This is,of course, the absolute contradictory of Thelema;but it is the sorites on which both Hindu andBuddhist conclusions are based.This kind of rage is, accordingly, most noxious;it is direct attack from within upon the virgin citadelof Self. It is high treason to existence. Its results areimmediately harmful; it begets depression, melan-choly, despair. In fact, one does wisely to take thebear by the ring in his snout; accept his conclusions,agree that it is all abject and futile and silly — andturn the hose-pipe of the Trance of Laughter on himuntil he dances to your pleasure.But — is this any answer to your problem? Itdisturbs me little that you should try to palm off“Peace” upon my sentries as the password. Toooften peace is merely the result of war-weariness,and the very negation of victory. It is (or may be) theformula of sloth and the gateway of stagnation.Life is to be a continuous vibration of ecstasy;and so it is for the Adept, whenever his work allowshim time to consider the matter, consciously; andeven when his work pre-empts his attention, is aneternal fountain of pure joy springing, a crystalfragrance of reverberating light from the most in-most caverns of the Heart. It secretly informs one’sdullest thought with sparkling wine, radiant in theAethyr — see well! the least excuse, since it isalways there, and champing at its bit, to turn thedreary cart-horse drudge into proud Pegasus him-self!This is where I want to have you, with us who arecome thus far, in a state utterly detached from theEgo, so that you appear the plain Jane Wolfe “doingyour duty in that state of life to which it has pleasedGod to call you” and consequently unremarked —like a Rosicrucian, “wearing the habit of the coun-try in which you are travelling” — but tremblingwith interior illumination, so that the first relax-ation of the constant conscious burden of JaneWolfe, Soror Estai is automatically released, apillar of Creative Light."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears84“I am Thou! and the Pillar is ’stablished in theVoid!”(Liber LXV, as you know, is full of these explo-sions).No: I am not at all sure that all this is the answerthat you need about white rages. Yet it is certainlycontained herein, or, at the least, implied.[{Heidrick’s note: The following found writtenin:} (Of course, it is all here, my love, and may Godbless you, whereever you are.)]Try another aspect.We tracked the cause: it was frustration. Good:then we must counter it. How? Only (in the lastevent) by getting the mind firmly fixed in thecomplete philosophy of Thelema. There is no suchthing as frustration. Every step is a step on the Path.It is simply not true that you are being baulked. Theheight of your irritation is a direct measure of theintensity of your Energy. Again, you soon come tolaugh at yourself for your impatience. Probably(you surmise) your trouble is exactly that: you arepushing too hard. Your mind runs back to AL I, 44;you realize (again!) that any result actually spoilsthe Truth and Beauty of the Act of Will; it is almosta burden; even an insult. Rather as if I risked my lifeto save yours, and you tipped me half-a-crown!Here’s that Book of Lies popping out its ugly mugagain: “Thou hast become the Way.” This is whythe Ankh or “Key of Life” is a sandal-strap, bornein the hand of every God as a mark of his Godhead:a God is one who goes. (If I remember rightly, Platoderives “Theos” from a verb meaning “to run”, andis heartily abused by scholars for so doing. Butperhaps the dreary old sophist was not far wrong,for once.) What you need to do, then, is to knit allthese ideas into a very close pattern; to make ofthem a consecrated Talisman. Then, when ragetakes you, it can be thrown upon the fire to stifle it:to thrust against the Demon, to disintegrate him.The great point is to have this weapon very firmlyconstructed, very complete. Your rage will pass inone of those two ways, which are one: Rapture andLaughter.I want you to go over this apparatus very care-fully; to analyse the argument, to make sure thatthere are no loose ends, to keep it keen and polishedand well-oiled, ever ready for immediate use: notonly against rage, but against any hampering ordepressing line of thought.Well, let us hope that I’ve got it all down fairlywell this time, and that you will find it work. For Iconfess to a touch of my Mariana-in-the-moated-Grange complex: I’ve been umpteen hours on thisletter, and I must have killed a Cakkravarti-Rajah,or wounded the body of a Buddha, in my lastincarnation, or Tahuti (hang it all! I have been mostdevoted to him all my life) would have let me havea secretary. Well, that’s that: so now to turn the Flakon to your so-called “Astral Flight.” What a Tailspin! (Here I dash my turban to the ground! Here Ideliver you to Eblis, and reserve a private box foryou in Jehannum! Here I melt into salt tears, andthink of all the other Gurus that have had to bear it.)Astral Flight!!!!!!!!Excuse me if I mention it, but — no doubt thefault is mine — you seem to have failed to note anysingle one of all my prayerful injunctions, either inthe letter or on your visit.Perhaps you thought that I should take circlesand pentagrams etc. for granted: but you give nohint of the object of your journey. (No don’t quoteAL I, 44 at me: it doesn’t mean that. I don’t expectyou to answer the clerk at the booking-office “Whereto, madam?” with “I don’t mind in the least.”Though, even in that case it is magically true, orshould be. As in the case of the young lady who gotcarried on to Crewe. The unplanned adventure mayhave proved much more amusing.) How am I to tellwhether you were seeing correctly? Suppose yourchosen hexagram had been VI Sung “Contention”or XXIX Î “Nourishing”? Where would be the“vision”? You are to set out to explore a countryunknown to you: How can I be sure that you haveactually been there? How can you be sure yourself?You can’t. [{Heidrick’s note: The following writ-ten in:} You can, if you go to a place you have neverheard of, and then discover later on, that it actuallyexists.] You have got to display the congruity ofyour vision with the account of the country given inthe Text. If you take Khien I, which is all Lingamsand Dragons, and you describe it as a landscape inthe Broads, I can only conclude that you did not getanywhere near it.Then you produce a monk, and never get hisname or office. Finally after you return, you get thisCaballero dropping in unasked.Alas! I fear me much this was no Astral journeyat all; it reads like weak imagination tinged bydesire. All you got of interest was the answer to yourquestion: and that you should have gripped, mademore precise, analysed, interpreted. Dear me, no!Final shot: my instinct is all against the “lying inbed.” These visions are intensely active: the hardestkind of work. Read Liber CDXVIII, 2nd Aethyr(and others) to understand the appalling physicalstrain, when you reach remote, well-guarded, andexalted confines of the Universe.In every sense of the expression — SIT UP!(I’m “sitting up” myself to finish this letter. Heregoes for the last lap!)Music. Justifiable? Why not? A help to yourgreat Work, an aspect of your Will, nicht wahr? Goto it!Apollo is the God of Music, pre-eminently; butHe is too all-comprehensive, all-pervading, to bemuch use in a Talisman except as a general back-ground. But there are the Muses: Polymina (orPolyhymnia) seems the one you want: she inspiresthe sublime hymn. How to invoke her is a matter forprolonged consideration. One would hardly seehow to tackle the problem at all, unless by diggingout an Angel from one of the Enochian Tablets.(See Equinox I, 7 and 8.) Perhaps there is a squareruled by Sol (or Venus), Fire, Air and Water in theTablet of one of these, with an appropriate Charac-ter on the summit of the Pyramid. If so, all would beplain sailing.Of course, there are other Gods, notably Pan. (Imust ask you to set my “Hymn to Pan” to music.)But I doubt if any of these are what you want.Probably the most practical plan would be to makea musical conjuration of Sol: use this as yourinvocation when you go on the Astral Plane: therefind a suitable guide to the proper authority — andso on!And that, dear Sister, for to-night will be exactlyand precisely that!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXIVMAGICAL POWERCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Rightly you remark that most of these lettershave dealt with self-development in one form oranother; now, what of the “causa finalis”, the“practical angle” some would call it. Are the outra-geous quack advertisements of the swindlers withtheir “Great Free Book” and so on, all baseless? Mydear child, then back to those letters that gave youa glimpse of the History of Magick, and those inwhich I told you something of the ways in which theMasters work. Oh, I see! What you want now is tolearn how to apply the knowledge and power thatyou have gained to the execution of your True Will,to accomplishment of the Great Work.Obviously, much must be left to your own com-mon-sense; the one technical point on which I insistabove all others is the Magical Link.You must lay to heart Magick Chapter XIV (pp.106-122) and never forget one detail. More failurecomes from neglect of this than from all othercauses put together. Most of the qualities that youneed are inborn; all the material is to your hand; andto develop them is a natural process, equally yourbirthright. But the making of the Link is an intellec-tual, even mechanical, task; success depends onpurely objective considerations.That granted, there are perhaps a few hints.Firstly, while of course the Magical Theory sup-poses a kind of omnipotence, please remember thatMagick is Science, that the Laws of Nature remainthe same, however subtle may be the material withwhich one is working. It is, to put it brutally, abigger miracle to destroy a fortress than an easychair. You know this well enough; but the corollaryis that it is nearly always a mistake to try to do thingsentirely off one’s own bat. It is much simpler to lookfor an existing force, in good working order, that isdoing the sort of stuff that you need, and take fromit, or control in it, just that bit of it that you happento require.You can, theoretically, walk from Cadiz toVladivostock; but unless there be some specialreason, it will save time and waste of energy tomake use of a fraction of the machine-power thathappens to be moving in that direction.This is particularly true of moral and politicalreform. Hitler would have got exactly nowhere if he"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears85had been content to announce his evangel; he be-came master of Germany, and, for a time, of nearlyall Europe, by playing upon existing instruments ofhuman passion; the revenge-lust of Central Europe,the panic of the Blimps and Junkers, the discontentof the property-lacking classes, the pride and ambi-tion of the Prussian military clique, and so on.When he had used them to the full, he callouslyflung them to the wolves. But make no mistake!The Magical Power behind all his actions lay inhimself. He had succeeded in making himself aprophet, like Mohammed; even a symbol, like theCross of the Crusades. His magical technique wasindescribably admirable; he adopted the Swastika,the Hammer of Thor, the distinctive dress, theslogan, the gestures, the greeting; he even imposeda Sacred Book upon the people. If that book hadonly been more mystic and incomprehensible, in-stead of reasonable, diffuse, and intolerably dull, hemight have done better. As it was, he came within anace of capturing England, even before he came topower in Germany; and it was American moneythat saved the Nazi party at the most critical mo-ment. Cleverest move of all, he gave the worldsomething to hate; the Communist and the Jew.His only trouble was that he couldn’t count onhis fingers!I perceive that I am turning into the late SamuelSmiles; having given you an example to imitate —but don’t forget your arithmetic! — let me initiateyou into one of two other secrets of power!Um — will I now? Perhaps you’re hardly grownup enough. I suspect that your question contem-plated not so much Power as powers: things likehealing the sick, making oneself invisible, kindlinga flame without combustibles, bewitching theneighbours’ cows, spoiling your friend’s honey-moon, fascinations of all kinds, levitation, lycan-thropy, necromancy, all the regular stuff of thelegends and the fables.Most of these matters are discussed in Magick,so all I need tell you is the correct general attitudeto all such thaumaturgies.The best excuse for trying to acquire them is thatone learns such a lot in the process. Otherwise —Here is another of those Eastern stories for you!A certain Yogi thought it would be an admirableachievement to walk across the Ganges. After fortyyears he succeeded, and went off to his Guru todemonstrate his power, and receive his due meed ofpraise. It so happened that this Guru was rather likemyself, at least in the matter of his Nasty Temper;and when the disciple came gaily striding backacross the Sacred Stream, expecting compliments,he was met with: “Well, I think you’re a perfect foolall these years, your neighbours have been going toand fro on a raft for a couple of pice!”The moral, dear child, is that such powers arenever to be considered as the main object; it oughtin fact to be obvious from the start that any one’sTrue Will must be deeper and more comprehensivethan any mere technical achievement. I will gofurther and say that any such endeavour must be amagical mistake, like cherishing a gun or a clock ora fishing-rod for its own sake, and not for the usethat one can make of it. Indeed, that remark goes tothe root of the matter; for all these powers, if weunderstand them properly, are natural by-productsof one’s real Great Work. My own experience wasvery convincing on this point; for one power afteranother came popping up when it was least wanted,and I saw at once that they represented so manyleaks in my boat. They argued imperfect insulation.And really they are quite a bit of a nuisance.Their possession is so flattering, and their seductionso subtle. One understands at once why all the first-class Teachers insist so sternly that the Siddhi (orIddhi) must be rejected firmly by the Aspirant, if heis not to be side-tracked and ultimately lost.Nevertheless, “even the evil germs of Mattermay alike become useful and good” as Zoroasterreminds us. For one thing, their possession is indu-bitably a sheet-anchor, at the mercy of the hurricaneof Doubt — doubt as to whether the whole businessis not Tommy-rot!Such moments are frequent, even when one hasadvanced to a stage when Doubt would seem im-possible; until you get there, you can have no ideahow bad it is!Then, again, when these powers have sprungnaturally and spontaneously from the exercise ofone’s proper faculties in the Great Work, theyought to be a little more than leaks. You ought to beable to organize and control them in such wise thatthey are of actual assistance to you in taking theNext Step. After all, what moral or magical differ-ence is there between the power of digesting one’sfood, and that of transforming oneself into a hawk?That being the case, let me transform myself intoa butterfly, and flit on to other honeysuckles!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXVMANCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.In previous letters I hope I have been able to giveyou some idea of the initiated conception of theMacrocosm, and also to have made it clear to youwhy we must all use a symbolic language, and thenecessity of constructing a special alphabet as thebasis of our conversations about Magick.I have also furnished you with charts of thisalphabet. It would of course have been too clumsyand cumbersome to put all the different systems ofsymbol on to the Tree of Life. That Tree is indeedthe basis of all our classification, and I hope by nowyou have got fairly familiar with the process ofsticking everything that turns up on its correctbranch of the Tree.In your last letter you thank me for having madeclear to you the initiated teaching with regard to theUniverse; and you now very rightly enquire “thisbeing so, where do we come in?” You hold up to meone of the oldest axioms of the Qabalah. “Thatwhich is above is like that which is below,” and youask me for details. What, you enquire, is the consti-tution of Man? With what parts of the Great Systemis the Little System to coincide?Perhaps I could hardly do better than call yourattention to the description given in my essay onMan in my small book Little Essays Toward Truth.In some respects indeed this description is not asclear as I could have wished. The fact is that thisEssay was written chiefly for the benefit of thosepeople who were already more or less familiar withthe Tree of Life and its correspondences. But I donot know even to-day, twenty years later, andwriting as I am to you who admittedly had noprevious knowledge of any of these subjects, how toset forth the facts in more elementary terms. Iwarned you in the beginning that there was anessential difficulty in these studies which is not to beby-passed or dodged in any way whatever.But, after all, it is the same difficulty which everychild finds when he begins any study of any kind. InLatin, for instance, he is told that mensa means atable, that it belongs to the first declension and isfeminine. There is no why about any of this; noexplanation is possible; the child has to pick up theelements of the language one by one, taking what heis taught on trust. And it is only after accumulatinga vast collection of unintelligible details that the jig-saw pieces fall into place, and he finds himself ableto construe the classical texts.You must be patient; you must go over and overagain everything that is presented to you, and byobeying you will not only come to a clear compre-hension of the subject, but find yourself automati-cally thinking in the language which you have beenat such pains to acquire.I feel then that I must leave you with thesedescriptions and these charts1 until painfully at first,but at the end with intense pride and gratification,you find yourself spontaneously grasping the morecomplex combinations of these letters and wordswhich are the anatomy of the body of our Learning.And do not forget the old and well-worn saw:“Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring! — Alittle learning is a dangerous thing.”Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXVIVAMPIRESCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.So you want me to tell you all about Vampires?Vampire yourself!I ask you, how does this come within the scopeof your enquiries? Is this information essential toyour Accomplishment of the Great Work? As theGovernment might say “Is your journey reallynecessary?”So musing, I rang you up for details. Vampires,1 Editor’s note: Originally following this chap-ter appeared four diagrams (reproduced inRegardie’s edition as an appendix) here presentedon the preceding page in tabular format."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears86you say, might be a temptation to yourself, or theymight sap your energy. Very good. I will tell you thelittle I know.Listen to Eliphas Lévi! He warns us against atype of person, fearless and cold-blooded, whoseems to have the power to cast a sudden chill,merely by entering the room, upon the gayest partyever assembled. Tête-à-tête, they shake one’s reso-lution, kill one’s enthusiasm, devitalize one’s faithand courage.Yes, we all know such people. Mercury, by theway, is the planet responsible. I have examined aconsiderable number of nativities, both of murder-ers and of people murdered; in both cases it was nota “malefic” that did the dirty work, but poor tinyinnocent silvery-shining Mercury!“Fie for same, you naughty planet!You’re the blighter that began it.”Is it not John Henry Newman that sang of Luci-fer? I doubt it.You, however, are thinking more of the vampireof romance. Bram Stoker’s Dracula and its kin-dred. This is a splendidly well-documented book,by the way; he got his “facts” and their legal andmagical surroundings, perfectly correct.It is easy enough to laugh at vampires if you livein Upper Tooting, or Surbiton, or one of thoseplaces where no self-respecting Vampire wouldwish to be seen. But in a lonely mountain village inBulgaria you might feel differently about it! Youshould remember, incidentally, that the evidencefor vampires is as strong as for pretty well anythingelse in the world. There are innumerable recordsextant of legal proceedings wherein the most sober,responsible, worthy and well-respected citizens,including the advocates and judges, investigatedcase after case with the utmost minuteness, with themost distinguished surgeons and anatomists to swearto the clinical details.Endless is the list of well-attested cases of bodiesdug up after months of burial which have beenfound not merely flourishing with all the lines oflife, but gorged with fresh blood.I cannot help feeling that all the superior-personexplanations — which explain nothing — aboutcollective hysteria and superstition and wish fulfill-ment and the rest of the current tomfool jargon, arejust about as hard to believe as the original straightforward stories.The man who shook his head on being shown agiraffe, and said “I don’t believe it,” is quite on a parwith the pontifical wiseacres of Wimpole Street.It is egomaniac vanity that prompts disbelief inphenomena merely because they lie outside theinfinitesimally minute pilule of one’s own personalexperience.When I crossed the Burma-China frontier for thefirst time, who should I meet but our Consul atTengyueh, the admirable Litton, who had by sheerbrains and personality turned the whole province ofYunnan into his own Vice-royalty? We lunchedtogether on the grass, and I hastened to dig into thegoldmine of his knowledge of the country. Aboutthe third or fourth thing he said to me was this:“Remember! whatever anyone tells you about Chinais true.” No words have ever impressed me moredeeply; they sank right in and were illuminated bydaily experience until they had justified themselvesa thousand times over.That goes for Vampires!Oh yeah! (you vulgarly interpolate) and howdoes it go with the Master’s unfathomably sagediscourse on Doubt.Sister, you’re loopy! Sister, if I may doubt all thepeople who have been to Africa or the Zoo and seenthat giraffe, why must I cling with simple childliketrust to the people that say they’ve been all over Helland parts of Kansas, and haven’t seen one, andtherefore such things cannot possibly be? Of thetwo dogmatic assertions, I should unquestionablyprefer the positive statement to the negative.In 1916, I was the first trained scientific observerto record the appearance commonly called “StElmo’s fire” indiscreetly revealing this fact in aletter to the New York Times. I was pestered for thenext six months and more by professors of physics(and the rest) from all over the U.S.A. The Exist-ence of the phenomenon had been doubted untilthen because of certain theoretical difficulties. That,sister, is the point. If a statement is hard to reconcilewith the whole body of evidence on the laws of thesubject, it is rightly received with suspicion.A moment with great Huxley, and his illustra-tion of the centaur in Piccadilly, reported to him (hehumorously hypothesizes) by Professor Owen. Whatoccasions Huxley’s doubt, and inspires the ques-tions by means of which he seeks to confirm or todiscredit it? Just this, no more: here is the head andtorso of a man fitted to the shoulders of a horse; howare the mechanical adjustments effected?In the same strain, he pointed out that for anangel to have practicable wings as in Mediaevalpictures, the breast-bone would have to stand outsome five feet in front of the body. (The poor fellow,of course, was densely ignorant of the mechanics ofthe Astral Plane. I am, for once, “on the side of theangels”.)1Am I digressing again? no, not really; I am justputting forward a case for keeping an open mind onthe subject of Vampires, even of the Clan Dracula.But certainly there is little or no evidence of theexistence of that species in England.How then is the subject in any way important toyou? Thus, that there are actually people runningabout all over the place, who actually possess, andexercise, faculties similar to those mentioned byLévi, but in much greater intensity, even of a kindfar more formidable, and directed by malignantwill.There is a mighty volume of theory and practiceconcerning this and cognate subjects which will beopen to you when — and if — you attain the VIII°of O.T.O. and become Pontiff and Epopt of theIlluminati. Further, when you enter the Sanctuaryof the Gnosis — oh boy! Or, more accurately, ohgirl!Not that the O.T.O. is a Young Ladies’ andGentlemen’s Seminary for Tuition in Vampirism,with a Chair (hardly suitable) for Werwolves, andBeds of Justice — that sounds more apt — forIncubi and Succubi; far from it! But the forces ofNature employed in these presumably abominablepractices are similar or identical.The doctrine of “Vital Force” has been so longand so completely exploded that I hardly need to tellyou that in some still undiscovered (or, rather,unpublished) and unmeasured form it is certainly afact. Haven’t I told you one time how we nearlystarved on Iztaccihuatl with dozens of tinned foodsall round us, they being ancient; of how one can getdrunk on half a dozen oysters; of how the best meatI have ever eaten is half-raw Himalyan sheep, cutup and thrown on the glowing ashes before rigormortis had set in? There is a difference betweenliving and dead protoplasm, whether the chemistand his fellow twilight-gropers admit it or no. I donot blame the ignorance of these fumblers withfrost-bitten fingers; but they make themselves con-spicuously assinine when they flaunt that ignoranceas the Quintessence of Knowledge; Boeotian bom-bast!There are forms of Energy, their Order toosubtle to have been properly measured hitherto,which underlie and can, within certain limits, directthe gross chemical and physical changes of thebody. To deny this is to be flung headlong into thearms of Animal Automatism. Huxley’s argumentsfor this theory are precisely like those of BishopBerkeley: unanswerable, but unconvincing. Thisletter is not, to every comma, the ineluctable,apodeictic, automatic, reaction to the stimulus ofyour question; and no one can persuade me that it is.Of course that unpersuadability is equally a factorin the equation; it is quite useless to try to “answerback.” Only, it’s silly!(And, in the meanwhile, the mathematical physi-cists are knocking the bottom clean out of their shipby shewing that causality itself is little more than amaniac’s raving!)So then, we may — at least! — get busy. It is easyenough to bore one’s neighbour — look how I boreyou! But that is usually an unintentional business.Is it possible to intensify the devitalizing process, soas to weaken the victim physically, perhaps evenalmost to the point of death? Yes.How? The traditional method is to get posses-sion of some object or substance intimately con-nected with the victim. On this you work magicallyso as to absorb its virtue. It is best if it was as recentlyas possible part of his living tissue; for instance, anail-paring, a hair plucked from his head. Some-thing still alive or nearly so, and still part of thecomplex of energies that he included in his concep-tion of his body.Best of all are fluids and secretions, notably1 For all that, they move without flapping them.As Swinburn says: “Swift without feet, and flyingwithout wings.”"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears87blood and one other of supreme importance to thecontinuity of life. When you can get these still aliveto their function, it is best of all. That is why it is notso highly recommended to tear out and devour theheart and liver of your next-door neighbour; youhave gone far to destroy just that which is of mostimportance to you to keep alive.Doubtless you will reply with some apparentjustice, indeed most plausible is such ratiocination,that by taking into your own body, and so preserv-ing the life of, his heart and liver, the whole of his“vital energies” will desert the sinking ship of thephysical tissue, and rush to the lifeboat provided bythe vampire. Never forget that you confer an ines-timable benefit upon the victim by absorbing hislower form of Energy into your higher. Read yourMagick, Chapter XII!You say this strongly, my dear Sister in the Lord;your thesis is impeccably stated, your argumentsare cogent, plangent, not to be repeated. But — thisI put to you most solemnly — what experimentalevidence do you adduce? How many hearts, howmany livers, have been your spiritual sustenance?Have you excluded every source of error? Haveyou — here, you know the routine; write it all downand send it along to be vetted!Be that as it may, I once knew a lady of someseventy summers. She came of a noble Polish fam-ily; she was short, sturdy, rather plump but singu-larly agile; good-looking in a brutal sort of way.But — her eyes! For fifty years she had lived nearlyall the year round in her chateau in Touraine. Shehad plenty of money, and had always surroundedherself with a dozen or more boys and young men.(By young I mean up to forty.) She not only lookedtwenty-five but she lived twenty-five. It was agenuine, natural, spontaneous twenty-five, not agallant effort. She would dance the night throughand go a long walk in the morning. You may applyto her for details of the treatment; I dare say she isstill about, though I did hear that she moved toSouth America when she saw 1914 coming. In anycase, you have had some fairly plain hints so I cansay in all simplicity, “Go thou and do likewise!”I think my old friend Claude Farrère had morethan an inkling of these matters; the idea of usingyoung cellular tissue to fortify the old is plainlystated in La maison des hommes vivants; but as tothe method of transmission his water was drawnfrom Wells (H.G.).After that — you will agree that I have writtenenough.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXVIIFAITHCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Dear me! dear me! this is very unexpected. Iwrote you a long while ago about doubt, and now Isuppose the seed fell in fertile ground! My chasteremarks have prompted a new question “arising outof the previous answer, Sir.”You point out quite correctly that the doubt ofwhich I wrote in passages of such burning elo-quence is after all what used to be called “philo-sophic” doubt; and by “philosophic” people appar-ently meant something rather like “Pickwickians.”Not the genuine McCoy, determining action, but— well, rather like scoring points in an intellectualgame.Now then (air connu) what is Faith? There aretwo kinds; and they are almost exact opposites.(N.B. The word is allied to Bide: there’s some ideaof endurance [or perhaps repose] in it. Cf. Pe-ter!?!?!?) Then the third kind, which is moral, notintellectual; as in “good faith,” bona fide, yoursfaithfully; and this is probably the hall-markedsense, for it implies just that endurance which goeswith bide, and is not dependent in any way uponreason or conviction. This then I may dismiss asimpertinent to the question in your letter, and stickto the other two.Faith in its Meaning Number One was perfectlywell defined by the schoolboy: “the faculty ofbelieving that which we know to be untrue.” It is atleast the acceptance of any statement as true with-out criticism, examination, verification, or any othermethod of test. Faith of this sort is evidently themain symptom of the moron, the half-wit, the vil-lage idiot. It is this kind of faith upon the possessionand exercise of which religious persons alwaysinsist as the first condition of salvation.Here is my own lamentable foresight on thesubject!“The Convert”“(A Hundred Years Hence)”“There met one eve in a sylvan gladeA horrible Man and a beautiful maid.‘Where are you going so meek and holy?’‘I’m going to temple to worship Crowley.’‘Crowley is God then? How did you know?’‘Why, it’s Captain Fuller that told us so.’‘And how do you know that Fuller was right?’‘I’m afraid you’re a wicked man; good-night.’While this sort of thing is styled successI shall not count failure bitterness.”Sometimes, note well! they are even frank aboutit, and say plainly that there would be no merit in itif there were any reasonable basis for it! Thisposition is at the worst both honest and intelligible;the only trouble is that there is no possible means ofdeciding which to two conflicting statements toaccept.In faith of this kind there are of course in practicedelicately shaded degrees; these depend mostlyupon the authority of the speaker and your relationswith, and opinion of, him. In practice, moreover,faith is usually tinged — should I say clouded? —by questions of probability. I see no need to wearyyou with examples of varying degrees; it is enoughto dismiss the subject with the remark that faith isnot true faith if any considerations of any kind sullyits virgin nullity.To prop faith is to destroy it: I am reminded ofMr. Harry Price’s young lady of Brocken fame,who was so timorously careful of her virginity thatshe never felt it safe unless she had a man in bed withher.What is the other kind of faith? Like its hostiletwin, it must have no truck with reason, at least noconscious truck, or it ceases to possess a moralmeaning. It is that confidence1 in oneself whichassures one that the long shot at the tiger will fly trueto the mark, that the tricky putt will go down, thatthe man one never beat before will go down thistime; also its horrid contrary, the moral certaintythat something will go wrong, even with the easiestproblems, with one hundred to one in one’s favour.I think the official answer is that one’s certaintyis in reality based upon subconscious calculation,so that faith has nothing whatever to do with it. Ifthere is any answer to this, I don’t know it.After all, that is neither here nor there; there isbut one material issue: how to acquire that kind offaith. Suppose we hunt it up in that precious Bookof Lies! Any luck? Sure, kiddums, here we are!“Steeped Horsehair”“Mind is a disease of semen.“All that a man is or may be is hidden therein.“Bodily functions are parts of the machine; si-lent, unless in dis-ease.“But mind, never at ease, creaketh ‘I’.“This I persisteth not, posteth not through gen-erations, changeth momently, finally is dead.“Therefore is man only himself when lost tohimself in The Charioting.”Nothing in that to contradict the official view, isthere? Nothing in biology either.Or in Blake:“If the Sun and Moon should doubt”They’d immediately go out.”Or in that other chapter of the Book of Lies:“The Mountaineer”“Consciousness is a symptom of disease.“All that moves well moves without will.“All skilfullness, all strain, all intention is con-trary to ease.“Practise a thousand times, and it becomes diffi-cult; a thousand, thousand, and it becomeseasy; a thousand, thousand times a thousandthousand, and it is no longer Thou that doethit, but It that doeth itself through thee.

Don’t take any wooden money.P.P.S. I have a marvelous proposition for you; Iwouldn’t let in anyone on it but my very best friend:there’s a man in San Luis Potosi in a mine there; hestole about $20,000 worth of gold dust and nowhe’s afraid to get rid of it, but he knows I’m safe andknows how to handle it and I’ve been his very bestfriend for twenty years, and he’s as straight as a die,and I know he’d let us have it for $10,000 and I’veonly got $4,000 — and that is where you come in!CHAPTER LXVIIITHE GOD-LETTERSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Maybe it was Devanagri that began it! This“sacred” character, used rightly for Sanskrit alone,is supposed (so Allan Bennett told me) to be con-structed on — can one call them ideographic? —principles. The upright line is the soft palate; thehorizontal the hard; and the line between themshows the position of the tongue when one pro-nounces the letter. He demonstrated this most el-egantly for the letter T ( ); but I was never ableto follow this up with most of the other fifty-five(isn’t it?) letters.However, it did start me thinking (why?) aboutthe possibility of a direct relation between the soundof a letter and its meaning in some primitive mannerof speech.So I used to alarm my fellow-citizens, usuallypassengers on a liner, by spending most of my timerepeating some unhappy letter over and over, whileI looked into my mind to see if the sound suggestedany particular idea. (It was rather fun, you know;but it was most certainly one of the most delicate,subtle, and difficult experiments that I have everundertaken.)Bound to flop, obviously, from the word “gun”,if only because the same-sounding word in differentlanguages — sometimes even in the same! — hasoften not merely diverse, but diametrically opposedmeanings. Think of Bog, or Bug, the Russian wordfor God (I do think “Bogey” comes from this,though!); think of the dam of a stream, and of ayoung thing, and damn. Think of all the differentkinds of box and cock and rock. (G.K. Chestertonmust have made tens of thousands of pounds out ofit!) Think of “let”, meaning both to prevent and toallow. Think of “check” to a chess-player, a banker,a draper, a waitress, a fox-hunter and a Slovak!The importance of all this: I’m sure I’ve told youhow Thoth, God of all Magick, the Wisdom and theWord, is usually shown with style and papyrus, asinventor of writing, which is the real Magical Art.Hence “grimoire” is nothing but grammar; to cast a“spell” explains itself; and the Angel (e.g. of aChurch, see Revelations I, II) was merely the Sec-retary.Never mind! I was thinking of language in its(supposed) primal state, when grunts and groansand moans and yells and squeaks and the like werethe nearest anybody ever got to:“Sweet articulate wordsSweetly divided apart.”And yet I persisted. I wanted to go right back,before letters were put together to make words atall. This is, I believe, almost wholly original work,though I’m not sure that Fabre d’Olivet didn’t skateround the edges.I put to myself this question: when I pronouncethe letter so-and-so, what thought or class of thoughttends to arise in my mind? (If you practise this inpublic, people may wonder!)With the vowels, one does seem to find a naturalcorrespondence. (I wrote a ballet “The BlindProphet” on these lines, long before it struck me toinvestigate on scientific lines). The Hindus knewthis with their A-U-M: A is the open breath, O thecontrolled force, M no breath at all. (See Magick,pp. 45-49). To me I is a shrill feminine sound, as Ois the roar of the male. U is pursed, E hardlysignificant.As to Magick, the Gnostics were chili con carneplus molten platinum plus a few girls I have knownon the vowels. Their incantations consist almostentirely of combinations of these. Seven at a time isvery frequent; in fact it seems sometimes as if theirtheurgy depended on variations of these combina-tions. Their theology, too. Never mind that justnow!But the consonants? That is a harder nut tocrack.Students of language have been accustomed togroup the consonants exactly as we now happen torequire. Here, in brief, is the list: Dentals, Labials,Gutturals.Various modifications extend them to fifty-nineand there are twenty-seven vowels. I shall naturallyconcern myself only with those that matter to thesubject: in practice, the twenty-two letters of theHebrew Alphabet will serve for this preliminarystudy, especially as in that case, we have already theattributions. I will begin by classing them.Gutturals:1. g. Luna.2. c. Cancer, house of Luna; Jupiter here exalted.3. k. Jupiter.4. q. Pisces, house of Jupiter. Atu XVII “TheMoon.”You will note that either Jupiter or Luna occursin every case; in two, doubly. Guttur, moreover, isthe Latin word for throat. Both planets emphasizethe soft open expansive aspects of Nature; they bothrefer accordingly to the feminine throat, the tubeeither of present or of future Life. (Jupiter, when inSagittarius, has an aggressive, masterful, male side;but his letter when there is Samekh.) Now pro-nounce these letters; observe the motions of open-ing and expulsion of the breath. Well, then, you willno longer wonder at that list we had in another letterof the words Cwm, coombe, quean, queen, and soon; also (?) quill, queer, quaintest, curious, (?)quick, (?) quince: especially with the U vowel,which sounds prehensile, ready to suck. Kupris (orCtytto) the Greek or Syrian Aphrodite-Venus, is theoutstanding example in Theogony.But, you ask, what has all this to do with theGods? Patience, child; this will develop as weproceed. Let us look at the dentals. These, for theprofane scholar, include the “sibilants,” and “liq-uids.”Dentals:1. d. Venus.2. z. Gemini, house of Mercury.3. e. Leo, house of Sol.4. l. Libra, house of Venus; Saturn here exalted.5. m. Water.6. n. Scorpio, house of Mars.7. s. Sagittarius, house of Jupiter.8. r. Sol.9. w. Fire.10. t. Saturn; the Earth.Here, we see at one glance, there is no suchsimple obvious relationship, as in the previous list.Nor indeed is there, to my ear, any close connectionin the sounds.Better luck, perhaps, with the last lot.Labials:1. b. Mercury.2. v. (or #) Vau. House of Venus; Luna exaltedtherein.3. p. Mars.Not a bit of it; almost worse than before. Here,then, I say it, weeping, with agonized reluctance,the Holy Qabalah has let us down with a bump! (Itdid look, too, didn’t it, as if it was all going to go somiraculously well!)All is not lost — not even honour! Suppose youreflect that (after all) Hebrew is a late language,invented; far, far removed from the primitive gruntsand groans (with their corresponding motions) thatwe set out to study. Let us take the high hand, andsay that the Guttural Correspondence doesn’t rimewith anything, that it is just an amazing piece ofsheer luck: nay, that it should serve us as a warningnot to be led away like Macbeth — you rememberhow Banquo warned him that“Oftentimes, to win us to our harms,The instruments of darkness tell us truths,Win us with honest trifles, to betray usin deepest consequence.”— and breaks off abruptly to speak with his cous-ins.Never forget the abiding temptation of men ofscience, the hidden rocks on which so many havebeen wrecked, to generalize on insufficient data.May the gods keep us from that! I dread it more thanall the other snags put together.With all due caution, therefore, let us attack ourpuzzle from the other end; let us see what astralexperiment tells us about the philology of it!Good! We’ll call it D-Day and drop our para-troops. D is a sharp, sudden, forceful explosive"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears89sound, cut off smartly. Now then I can’t tell whetheryou will connect this with ejaculation, with the ideaof paternity. Whether or no, a vast number of peopledid so in the dawn of speech. Even to-day childrenseem instinctively to say “Dad” for “Father,” thoughno allowance can be made for cases of mistakenidentity. And the most ancient Father-Gods of theoldest and simplest civilizations are thus named. InSumer He was AD, or ADAD, whence the laterEgyptian Hadit, and the Semitic Adonai. (There arealso words like AVD, the creative Magick.) So alsothe Greeks in Syria knew Adonis, and the LatinDeus is itself the general word for God. Again,Valhalla houses Odin, Woden; and there are others.When the dental is complicated to a sibilant, as weshall see later, another idea is introduced; while thelightening of the sound to T has yet another effect.Sanskrit also helps us with such roots as DETH,to show, DAM, to tame, DEVK, to lead, DHEIGH,to knead, mould, DHER, to support, DO, to give,DHE, to put, and a whole group of words like Deva,a divine being.But that comes later: meanwhile, practise pro-nouncing these names, as also English words suchas Do, Deed, Dare, Drive, Doubt, Dig, Dog, Dive,Duck, Dub while exploring the Abyss of your mind,and see whether you do not soon associate the D-sound with a swift, hard, definite, fertile and com-pleted act. For a fair test, take only the oldest andsimplest words, words which might naturally bewanted in the Stone Age.The next sound-group to be considered mayconveniently be N. Here at once we haveinnumberable Gods and Goddesses flocking up:Nu, Nuit, Anu, Noah, John, Oannes, On, Jonah, etal. With the exception of On, a special case, all thesedivine or semi-divine Beings refer to the Night, theStarry Heavens, the Element of Water, the North,the Mother-Goddess, as appears when we considertheir legends and rituals. N, Nun, means a fish andrefers to the water sign of Scorpio. (Note, later whenwe reach Sh, that Joshua was the Son of Nun.) Tome the sound gives the idea of a continuum, aneternal movement; and this is of course our Thelemicconception of the Universe, the “Star-sponge,” ofwhich I have elsewhere written at such length.But at the moment I am especially desirous thatyou should compare and contrast this letter with theS Sound. (S or Sh combined with T is discussedrather fully in Magick, pp. 336-8.) You should findit child’s play to determine the significance of thesibilant. It is the one letter which necessitates theexposure of the skeleton! (E.g., the Subconscious.)Hence “Hush!” it is the hiss of the snake, great Lordof Life and Death — (life? yes, the spermatozoon,child!) “Silence! Danger! There is a man some-where about.” The savage reaction. And, sureenough, Ish is the Hebrew for man (Mankind isADM, Adam, Sanskrit Admi, the Father and Motherconjoined. “Male and Female created They Man.”)The S-gods are innumerable. Asar (Asi, Isis, ishis female twin) Astarte, Ishtar or Ashtoreth, Set,Saturn, Shu, Zeus, (into whom the D intrudes,because S is the male as N the female, and D thefather as M the mother) and the Jesus group. Hereis the idea of the South, or East, both quartersreferring, in ways very slightly divergent, to theelement of Fire, the Sun, the Father-God in hisaspect as the Holy Ghost. The ancient traditionappears in the Gospels: the Lesser Mysteries ofJohn, beheaded with the Sword, and consumed ona Disk, and the Greater Mysteries of Jesus, piercedwith a Wand, and consumed in a Cup. All sameTarot!I am not at all sure how far it is wise to take thisletter. To make it complete, we should need a Bookabout three times the size of The Book of Thoth, andI should want another half-century of researchbefore I started to write it! As this seems for diversreasons a little awkward in practice, I am ratherafraid that we must content ourselves with this verysketchy account: always, when one touches thesubject, one “goes all woolly.” One lacks not onlycompleteness, but precision. Then there is the “over-lapping” nuisance, and the fact that the natures andthe names of the Gods change slowly as time goesby. The confusion! The contradictions! I couldwish to be the proverbial bargee. Oh! I could go onmaking excuses for another hour! I can’t be helped;and I feel that I shall have rendered you quite a bitof service by calling your attention to the existenceof the subject, by stimulating you to research, bysuggesting certain potential lines on which to attackthe same, and perhaps even by giving you a few tipswhich you may find useful in practical Magick.The subject is closely bound up with Mantra-Yoga, and with Invocation. You will doubtlesshave noticed (for instance) that many chapters ofthe Q’uran have the letter L for a leit-motif. Islamattaches immense importance to this liquid L, as itappears in Allah (compare the Hebrew L-Gods,AL, Aloah, Elohim, A’alion, etc., and look up theL-idea in your Book of Thoth, and in Magick, pp.331 sqq.) and other peculiarly sacred names andwords.Before cursing my way to dinner — oh! how Ihate the need of food unless I am practising the“Ninth Art” and disguise myself as a gourmet — Imust mention the letter M. This is the only letter thatcan be pronounced with the lips firmly closed; it isthe beginning of speech, and so the Mother of theAlphabet. (Distinguish from N, the letter of theFemale.) Look up Magick again; Chapter VII (pp.45-49) gives a good account of M in discussingAUM. Note, too, the root MU “to be silent,” formwhich we have the words Mystic, Mystery andothers. As the letter of the Mother it appears to thisday in nature everywhere, the first call of the childto “Mamma.” In nearly every language, moreover,the word for Mother is based on M. Madar, Mere,Mutter, Umm, AMA or AIMA and the rest.The vibrant R suggests light-rays: Ra, the Sun;the labials bring to mind the curves in Nature —you will soon discover the words with a few littleexperiments; the T is a D, only lighter, quicker andyounger — and so Good-night!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXIXORIGINAL SINCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.It was at Dover. I had passed the CustomsInspector. Turning back, I said: “But perhaps Iought to have declared my Browning?” Much agi-tated, he muttered: “How ever did I come to missthat?” and began all over again. I helped him out:“You see, you were thinking of pistols, I of poetry.”(There is a lesson in that!)And now you — of all people! — fire him off atme. “Gold Hair” you write, “what about R.B’sdefence of Christianity?” You mean, of course,“’Tis the faith that launched point-blank its dartAt the head of a lie, taught Original Sin,The corruption of man’s heart.”It is impossible to commit all the possible logicalerrors in the course of a single syllogism; but he hasan honest try.1. It’s not a man’s heart, but a girl’s.2. He argues from an extravagantly rose case ofaberration as if it were an universal rule.3. All his premises are false; and even at that,defective.4. Non distributio medii.5. Ignoratio elenchi6. Need I go on?For one thing, I have yet to learn who told the“lie.” It was not until Rousseau that we had thenonsense about the “noble savage.” But it is at leasttrue that man’s deepest instincts, being natural andnecessary, are, for him, “right.” It is true that anartificial society creates artificial crimes; but this isnot “Original” Sin; on the contrary. What’s thatyou say?I laugh! I wondered when you were going to pullme up, and send me packing to my Skeat aboutwhat “Sin” means. O.K. Police routine does beatthe gifted amateur. Sin, astonishingly, means real!Curtius tells us “Language regards the guilty manas the man who it was.” Then, what is “guilt”? A.S.gylt, trespass; in our own Thelemic language, “de-viation from (especially in the matter of excess,trespasser) the True Will. Please take notice thatmost of the words which denote misconduct implywandering, either from the home or from the path:error, debauch, wrong (= twisted), wry, evil (exces-sive) detraquer, go astray, and several others. So Itoo leap into the breach with Curtius, and point outthat “Language itself asserts the doctrine of theTrue Will.” But what says The Book of the Law? Itis at pains to define Sin in plain terms: “The word ofSin is Restriction....” (AL I, 41.) From the context itseems clear that this refers more especially to inter-ference with the will of another.This statement is the first need of the world to-day for we are plagued with Meddlesome Matties,male and female, whose one overmastering passionis to mind other peoples’ business.

But neither history norbiology acquaint us with any form of progressachieved by any of these communities. Penal settle-ments and Pall Mall Clubs have not even madeprovision for the perpetuation of their species; andall such “well-ordered” establishments are quiteevidently defenceless against any serious change intheir environment. They have failed to comply withthe first requirements of biology; at best, they stag-nate, they achieve nothing, they never “get any-where.”A settled society is useful at certain periods;when, for instance, it is advisable to consolidate thegains gotten by pioneer adventurers; but historyshows with appalling clarity that the very qualitieswhich serve to protect must inevitably destroy thevery conditions which they aim to preserve.Hey! Hasn’t the dear old Book of Lies got itsword on the subject?Never known to fail!“The Wound of Amfortas”“The Self-mastery of Percivale became the Self-Masturbatery of the Bourgeois.“Vir-tus has become ‘virtue’.“The qualities which have made a man, a race, acity, a caste, must be thrown off; death is thepenalty of failure. As it is written: In the hourof success sacrifice that which is dearest tothee unto the Infernal gods!“The Englishmen lives upon the excrement ofhis forefathers.“All moral codes are worthless in themselves;yet in every new code there is hope.

Not by the tinkeringof the meliorist; not by the crushing of initiative; notby laws and regulations which hamstring the race-horse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innova-tions of the eccentric, by the phantasies of thehashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirationsof the idealist to the impossible, by the imaginationof the revolutionary, by the perilous adventure ofthe pioneer. Progress is by leaps and bounds, butbreaking from custom, by working on untried ex-periments; in short, by the follies and crimes of menof genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtueafter they have been tortured to death, and theirmurderers reap gloatingly the harvest of the seedsthey sowed at midnight.Damn it!

On reading this, I note that I passed overwith deserved contempt the theory of “original sin”in the sense which you probably meant me to take:the defect deliberately implanted in man by “OldNobodaddy” with no better object than to preparethe grotesquely tragic farce of the “Atonement.” Iwill merely remark that no idea at once so base andso contemptible, so bestial and so idiotic, can chal-lenge its ignoble absurdity.Rotten with sex-perversion, it is a noisome blendof sadism and masochism based on the most abjectform of fear.The only argument for it is that it ever did exist;but it does not exist for wholesome minds.CHAPTER LXXMORALITY (1)Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.“Tu l’as voulu, Georges Dandin!” I knew fromthe first that your sly, insidious, poisoned poniard,slipped in between my ribs, would soon or lateinvolve a complete exposition of the whole subjectof Morality.Of we go! What really is it? The word comesfrom Mos, Latin for custom, manner. Similarly,ethics: from Greek εθος custom. “It isn’t done”may be modern slang, but it’s correct. Interesting tostudy the usage of “moeurs” and “manières” inFrench. “Manner” from “manus” — hand: it is “theway to handle things.”But the theological conception has steered a verywrong course, even for theology; brought in DivineInjunction, and Conscience, and a whole host ofbogeys. (Candles in hollow turnips deceive nobodyoutside a churchyard!)So we find ourselves discussing a “palely wan-dering” phantom idea whose connotations or exten-sions depend on the time, the place, and the victim.We know “the crimes of Clapham chaste inMartaban,” and the difference between Old andNew Testament morality in such matters as po-lygamy and diet; while the fur flies when twolearned professors go down with a smart attack ofOdium Theologicum, and are ready to destroy acivilization on the question of whether it is right orwrong for a priest (or presbyter? or minister?) towear a white nightie or a black in the pulpit.But what you want to know is the differencebetween (a) common or area morality, (b) Yogin —or “holy man’s” morality, and (c) the MagicalMorality of the New Aeon of Thelema.1. Area Morality: This is the code of the “Slave-Gods,” very thorougly analysed, pulverized, andde-loused by Nietzsche in Antichrist. It consists ofall the meanest vices, especially envy, cowardice,cruelty and greed: all based on over-masteringFear. Fear of the nightmare type. With this incubus,the rich and powerful have devised an engine tokeep down the poor and the weak. They are lavishalike with threats and promises in Ogre Bogey’sCastle and Cloud-Cuckoo-Land. “Religion is theopium of the people,” when they flinch no longerfrom the phantom knout.2. Eight Lectures on Yoga gives a reasonableaccount of the essence of this matter, especially inthe talks on Yama and Niyama. (A book on thissubject might well include a few quotations, nota-bly from paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 in the former.) Itmight be summarized as “doing that, and only that,which facilitates the task in hand.” A line of conductbecomes a custom when experience has shown thatto follow it makes for success. “Don’t press!” “Playwith a straight bat!” “Don’t draw to five!” do notinvolve abstract considerations of right and wrong.Orthodox Hinduism has raped this pure system,and begotten a bastard code which reeks of religion.A political manoeuvre of the Brahmin caste.Suppose we relax a little, come down to earth,and look at what the far-famed morality of the HolyMan was, and is, in actual practice. You will findthis useful to crush Toshophist and Antro-posophagist cockroaches as well as the ordinaryChristian Scolex when they assail you.In the lands of Hinduism and (to a less extent) ofIslam, the Sultan, the Dewan, the Maharajah, theEmir, or whatsoever they call “the GrandPandjandrum Himself, with the little round buttonon top,” it is almost a 100 per cent rule that thebutton works loose and is lost! Even in less exaltedcircles, any absolute ruler, on however petty a scale,is liable to go the whole hog in an unexceptionablyhoggish fashion. He has none to gainsay him, and hesees no reason for controlling himself. This suitsnearly everybody pretty well; the shrewd Wazir cangovern while his “master” fills up on “The King’sPeg” (we must try one when champagne is onceagain reasonably cheap) and all the other sensuousand sensual delights unstinted. The result is that bythe time he is twenty — he was probably married at12 — he is no longer fitted to carry out his very firstduty to the State, the production of an heir.Quite contrary to this is the career of the “HolyMan.” Accustomed to the severest physical toil,inured to all the rigours of climate, aloof from everynoxious excess, he becomes a very champion ofvirility. (Of course, there are exceptions, but theaverage “holy man” is a fairly tall fellow of hishands.) More, he has been particularly trained forthis form of asceticism by all sorts of secret methodsand practices; some of these, but the way, I was ableto learn myself, and found surprisingly efficacious.So we have the law of supply and demand atwork as uncomplainingly as usual: the Holy Manprays for the threatened Dynasty, blesses the Barren"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears91Queen; and they all live happy ever after. This is notan Arabian Night’s Tale of Antiquity; it is the sametoday: there are very few Englishmen who havespent any time in India who have not been ap-proached with proposals of this character.Similar conditions, curiously enough, existed inFrance; the “fils à papa” was usually a hopelessrotter, and his wife often resorted to a famousmonastery on the Riviera, where was an exception-ally holy Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, prayersunto whom removed sterility. But when M. Combesturned out the monks, the Image somehow lost itvirtue.Now get your Bible and turn up Luke VIII, 2!When the sal volatile has worked, turn to John XIII2, 3 and ask a scholar what any Greek of the periodwould have understood by the technical expres-sions there unambiguously employed.Presently, I hope, you will begin to wonderwhether, after all, the “morality” of the middleclasses of the nineteenth century, in Anglo-Saxoncountries, is quite as axiomatic as you were taughtto suppose.Please let me emphasize the fact that I have heardand seen these conditions in Eastern countries withmy own ears and eyes. Vivekananda — certainlythe best of the modern Indian writers on Yoga —complained bitterly that the old greymalkin witchesof New York who called themselves his discipleshad to be dodged with infinite precaution wheneverhe wanted to spend an evening in the Tenderloin.On the other hand, the Sheikh of Mish — and a veryholy Sheikh he was — introduced his “boy friend”as such to me when I visited him in the Sahara,without the slightest shame or embarrassment.Believe me, the humbug about “morality” in thiscountry and the U.S.A., yes, even on the Continentin pious circles, is Hobgoblin No. 1 on the path of theWise. If you are fooled by that, you will never getout of the stinking bog of platitudinous mouthingsof make-believe “Masters.” Need I refer to the factthat most of the unco’ guid are penny plain hypo-crites. A little less vile are those whose prejudicesare Freudian in character, who “compound for sinsthat they’re inclined to, By damning those theyhave no mind to.”Even when, poor-spirited molluscs, they arehonest, all that twaddle is Negation. “Hang yourclothes on a hickory limb, and don’t go near thewater!” does not produce a Gertrud Ederle. ThankGod, the modern girl has cast off at least one of herfetters — the ceinture de chastété!Perhaps we have now relaxed enough; we seethat the “Holy man” is not such a fool as he looks;and we may get on with our excursions into the“Morality” of the Law of the New Aeon, which isthe Aeon of Horus, crowned and conquering child:and — “The word of the Law is ΘΕΛΗΜΑ.”3. So much of The Book of the Law deals directlyor indirectly with morals that to quote relevantpassages would be merely bewildering. Not thatthis state of mind fails to result from the first,second, third and ninety-third perusals!“When Duty bellows loud ‘Thou must!’The youth replies ‘Pike’s Peak or Bust!’”is all very well, or might be if the bellow gavefurther particulars. And one’s general impressionmay very well be that Thelema not only givesgeneral licence to any fool thing that comes intoone’s head, but urges in the most emphatic terms,reinforced by the most eloquent appeals in superblanguage, by glowing promises, and by categoricalassurance that no harm can possibly come thereby,the performance of just that specific type of action,the maintenance of just that line of conduct, whichis most severely depreciated by the high priests andjurists of every religion, every system of ethics, thatever was under the sun!You may look sourly down a meanly-pointednose, or yell “Whoop La!” and make for PiccadillyCircus: in either case you will be wrong; you willnot have understood the Book.Shameful confession, one of my own Chelas (orso it is rather incredibly reported to me) said re-cently: “Self-discipline is a form of Restriction.”(That, you remember, is “The word of Sin”.) Of allthe utter rubbish! (Anyhow, he was a “centre ofpestilence” for discussing the Book at all.) About90 % of Thelema, at a guess, is nothing but self-discipline. One is only allowed to do anything andeverything so as to have more scope for exercisingthat virtue.Concentrate on “thou hast no right but to do thywill.” The point is that any possible act is to beperformed if it is a necessary factor in that Equationof your Will. Any act that is not such a factor,however harmless, noble, virtuous or what not, is atthe best a waste of energy. But there are no artificialbarriers on any type of act in general. The standardof conduct has one single touchstone. There may be— there will be — every kind of difficulty indetermining whether, by this standard, any givenact is “right” or “wrong”: but there should be noconfusion. No act is righteous in itself, but only inreference to the True Will of the person who pro-poses to perform it. This is the Doctrine of Relativ-ity applied to the moral sphere.I think that, if you have understood this, thewhole theory is now within your grasp; hold it fast,and lay about you!Of course, there must be certain courses of actionwhich, generally speaking, will be right for prettywell everybody. Some, per contra, will be gener-ally barred, as interfering with another’s equalright. Some cases will be so difficult that only aMagister Templi can judge them, and a Maguscarry them wisely into effect. Fearsome responsibil-ity, I should say, that of the Masters who began thebuilding-up of the New Aeon by bringing aboutthese Wars!(I do wish that we had the sense to take our ideasof Peace conditions from the Bible, as our rulers soloudly profess that they do. The Enemy knows wellenough that there is no other way to make a warpay.)Now then, I hope that we have succeeded inclarifying this exceptionally muddy marish waterof morality from most of its alien and toxic dirt; toooften the Aspirant to the Sacred Wisdom finds nofirm path under his feet; the Bog of Respectabilitymires him who sought the Garden of Delights; soonthe last bubbles burst from his choked lungs; he isengulfed in the Slough of Despond.In the passive elements of Earth and Water is nocreative virtue to cleanse themselves from suchimpurity as they chance to acquire; it is therefore ofcardinal importance to watch them, guard them,keep their Purity untainted and unsoiled; shall theHoly Grail brim with poison of Asps, and thegolden Paten be defiled with the Bread of Iniquity?Come Fire, come Air, cleanse ye and kindle the pureinstruments, that Spirit may indwell, inform, in-spire the whole, the One Continuous Sacrament ofLife!We have considered this Morality from quite anumber of very different points of view; wroughtsubtly and accurately into final shape, you shouldfind no further difficulty in understanding fully atleast the theoretical and abstract aspects of thebusiness.But as to your own wit of judgment as to thegeneral rules of your own private Code of Morals,what is “right” and what is “wrong” for you, thatwill emerge only from long self-analysis such as isthe chief work of the Sword in the process of yourInitiation.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S.

I hadhoped that you had left behind forever all thatquality of thinking. It is unclean. It is stuffy andflabby. You write of a matter about which youcannot possibly have information, and what yousay is not even a good guess; it is simply contrary tofact. It shows also that you have failed to grasp thenature of the O.T.O. Its main raison d’être, apartfrom social and political plans, is the teaching anduse of a secret method of achieving certain results.This secret is a scientific secret; it is guarded againstbetrayal or abuse by a very simple automatic ar-rangement. Its guardians cannot be “dying” anymore than electricians as a class can be.It is really difficult to answer your letters. Youhave got things so higgledy-piggledy. You write ofthe constitutions of two orders, the A∴A∴ and theO.T.O.; yet you ignore the printed informationabout them which you are supposed to have read.I have to answer each sentence of your letterseparately, so incoherent have you become!You are a “student” of A∴A∴, and become aProbationer as soon as you take and pass the exami-nation. (This is intended mostly to make sure thatyou have some general idea of the principal branchesof the subject, and know the more important corre-spondences.) The rest: — please read One Star inSight again, and do for God’s sake try to assimilatethe information there very clearly and very fullygiven!It is terrifyingly near the state of mind which wesymbolize by Choronzon, this hurrying flustereddash of yours from one point of view to another: aset of statements all true after a fashion, but flungout with such apprehensive agitation that a sensi-tive reader like myself comes near to being upset.You say that you must tread the Path alone: quitetrue, if only because anything that exists for you isnecessarily part of yourself. Yet you have to “go toothers”, and you become a veritable busybody.You quote odd opinions at random without themeans of estimating their value.Cannot I ever get you to understand the differ-ence between an honest and dishonest teacher? Ihave always made it a rule never to put forward anystatement of which I cannot produce proof; when Iventure a personal opinion it is always Marked inPlain Figures to that effect. (I refer you to Magickp. 368: p. 375, paragraphs 1 and 2; and p. 415,paragraphs 000 and 00. We insist from the begin-ning on the individual character of the work, andupon the necessity of maintaining the objective andsceptical standpoint. You are explicitly warnedagainst reliance upon “authority,” even that of theOrder itself.) Consider my own assets, personal,social, educational, experiential and the rest: don’tyou see that all I had to do was to put out somebrightly-coloured and mellifluous lie, and avoidtreading on too many toes, to have had hundreds ofthousands of idiots worshipping me?Please get a Konx om Pax somehow, and read p.XII:“It’s only too easy to form a cult,To cry a crusade with ‘Deus Vult’ ...A pinch of Bible, a gallon of gas,And I, or any otherguess ass,Could bring to our mystical Moonlight MassThose empty-headed Athenians.”and so on.But I never forget that I am working on the 2,000year basis; my work will stand when all the pomp-ous platitudes and pleasant pieties have witheredfor the iridescent soft-soap bubbles that they are.Soap! yes, indeed. I work on gold, and gold mustbe cleansed with acid.I really cannot understand how you can be soinaccurate, with the very text before your eyes! Youwrite — “you write that in Jan. 1899 etc.” But Idon’t. Captain J.F.C. Fuller wrote it. A small point;but you must learn to be careful about every tiniestdetail.Then you go on about “not only invisible chiefs1of the A∴A∴ ... but also the Chiefs of the GoldenDawn ...” The Golden Dawn is merely the name forthe Outer Order: see Magick pp. 230-231. Youhave never been taught to read carefully. Youwrite of Theoricus as the grade following Neo-phyte: it isn’t. Back to Magick pp. 230-231! Youhave never taken the trouble to go with me throughthe Rituals of O.T.O., or you would not ask suchquestions. The O.T.O. is a training of the Masonictype; there is no “astral” work in it at all, nor anyYoga. There is a certain amount of Qabalah, andthat of great doctrinal value. But the really vitalmatter is the gradual progress towards disclosure ofthe Secret of the Ninth Degree. To use that secret toadvantage involves mastery both of Yoga and ofMagick; but neither is taught in the Order. Now itcomes to be mentioned, this is really very strange.However, I didn’t invent the system; I must supposethat those who did knew what they were about.To me it is (a) convenient in various practicalways, (b) a machine for carrying out the orders ofthe Secret Chiefs of A∴A∴ (c) by virtue of theSecret a magical weapon of incalculable power.You are not “stuck.” You can use your AstralBody well enough: too well, in one way. But I thinkyou need a few more journeys with me: you oughtto get on to the stage where the vision results froma definite invocation.Do please forget all these vague statements aboutthe “clarification of one’s dream-life” (meaningwhat?) and “shadow-thinking” (meaning what?).These speculations are idle, and idleness is poison.In your very next paragraph you give the wholeshow away! “Artistically it appeals to me — but notspiritually.” You have been spiritually poisoned.What blasphemy more hideous could be penned?What lie so base, so false, so nasty, what so devilishand deadly a doctrine? I feel contaminated by themere fact of being in a world where such filth ispossible to conceive. I am all but in tears to think ofmy beloved sister tortured by so foul a denizen ofthe Abyss. Cannot you see in this the root of all yourtoadstool spawn of miseries, of doubts, of fears, ofindecisions?As an Artist you are a consecrated Virgin Priest-ess, the Oracle of the Most High. None has the rightto approach you save with the most blessed awe,with arms outstretched as to invoke your benedic-tion.By “spiritually” you mean no more than “ac-cording to the lower and middle-middle-class mo-rality of the Anglo-Saxon of the period whenLongfellow and Tennyson were supposed to bepoets, and Royal Academicians painters.”There is a highly popular school of “occultists”which is 99% an escape-mechanism. The fear ofdeath is one of the bogeys; but far deeper is the root-fear — fear of being alone, of being oneself, of lifeitself. With this there goes the sense of guilt.The Book of the Law cuts directly at the root ofall this calamitous, this infamous tissue of false-hood.What is the meaning of Initiation? It is the Pathto the realisation of your Self as the sole, thesupreme, the absolute of all Truth, Beauty, Purity,Perfection!What is the artistic sense in you? What but theOne Channel always open to you through whichthis Light flows freely to enkindle you (and theworld through you) with flowers of inexhaustiblefervour and flame?And you set up against That this spectre of grimfear, of shame, of qualms and doubts, of inwardquakings lest — — you are too stricken with panicto see clearly what the horror is. You say “theelemental spirits and the Archangels are watching.”(!) My dear, dear, sister, did you invent these beingsfor no better purpose than to spy on you? They arethere to serve you; they are parts of your beingwhose function is to enable you to reach further inone particular direction or another without interfer-ence from the other parts, so long as you happen toneed them for some service or other in the GreatWork.Please cleanse your mind once and for all of thisdelusion, disastrous and most damnable, that therecan be opposition between two essential parts ofyour nature.1 How do you know They are “invisible?” Iforesee that sooner or later you will be asking formore information about them, so I am planning aseparate letter to supply this. (See Letters IX, L andLXXVII.)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears93I think this idea is a monstrous growth upon thetetanus-soaked soil of your fear of “the senses.”Observe how all these mealy-mouthed prigs de-velop their distrust of Life until hardly an actionremains that is not “dangerous” or in some wayharmful. They dare not smoke, drink, love — doanything natural to them. They are right!! The Selfin them is Guilt, a marsh miasmal of foul pestilence.Last, since “nature, though one expel it with apitchfork, always returns,” they do their “sins” insecret, and pile hypocrisy upon the summit of alltheir other vices.I cannot write more; it makes me too sad. I hopethere is no need. Do be your Self, the radiantDaughter of the Muse!With that command I turn to other tasks.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally yours ever, 666CHAPTER LXXIIEDUCATIONCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Education means “leading out”; this is not thesame as “stuffing in”.I refuse to enlarge on this theme; it is all-impor-tant. To extract something, you should first knowwhat is there. Here astrology ought to give usefulhints; its indications give the mind something towork on. Experience makes “confirmation strongas Holy Writ;” but beware of à priori. Do not bedogmatic; do not insist in the face of disappoint-ment. Astrology in education is useful as geology isto the prospector; it tells you the sort of thing to lookfor, and the direction in which to explore.There are, however, two main lines of teachingwhich are of universal value to normal children; itis hardly possible to begin too early.Firstly, accustom his ear from the start to noblesounds; the music of nature and the rhythm of greatpoetry. Do not aim at his understanding, but at hissubconscious mind. Protect him from cacophonousnoise; avoid scoring any cheap success with him byinflicting jingles; do not insult him by “baby-talk.”Secondly, let him understand, as soon as youstart actual teaching, the difference between the realand the conventional in what you make him memo-rize. Nothing irritates children more than the arbi-trary “because I say so.”Nobody knows why the alphabet has the orderwhich we know; it is quite senseless. One couldconstruct a much more rational order: e.g. theMother, the Single and the Double letters, all in thenatural order of the elements, planets and signs.Again, we have the “Missionary” Alphabet, ar-ranged “scientifically” as Gutturals, modified ditto,Dentals, Labials, vowels and so on; a most repul-sive concoction! But I would not accept any emen-dation from the God Thoth himself; it is infinitelysimpler to stick to the familiar order. But explain tothe child that this is only for convenience, like therule of the road; indeed, like almost any rules!But when your teaching is of the disputable kind,explain that too; encourage him to question, todemand a reason and to disagree. Get him to fencewith you; sharpen his wits by dialectic; lure him intothinking for himself. I want tricks which will showhim the advantages of a given subject of study;make him pester you to teach him. We did this mostsuccessfully at the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu; letme give you an instance: reading. One of us wouldtake the children shopping and bring up the subjectof ice-cream. Where, oh where could we get some?Presently one would exclaim and point to aplacard and say, “I really do believe there’ll besome there” — and lo! it was so. Then they wouldwonder how one knew, and one would say: Why,there’s “Helados” printed on that piece of card inthe window. They would want to learn to read atonce. We would discourage them, saying what hardwork it was, and how much crying it cost, at thesame time giving another demonstration of theadvantages. They would insist, and we should yield— to active, eager children, not to dullards thathated the idea of “lessons.” So with pretty welleverything; we first excited the child’s will in thedesired direction.But (you ask) are there any special branches oflearning which you regard as essential for all?Yes.Our old unvalued friend St. Paul, the cunningcrook who turned the Jewish communism of theApostles into an international ramp, saw in a visiona man from Macedonia who said “Come over andhelp us!” This time it has been a woman fromCalifornia, but the purport of her plaints was iden-tical. Much as I should like to see my Father the Sunonce more before I die, nothing doing until — ifever — life recovers from the blight of regulations.Luckily, one thing she said helps us out: someonehad told her that I had written on Education in LiberAleph — The Book of Wisdom or Folly — whichhas been ready for the printer for more than aquarter of a century — and there’s nothing I can doabout it!However, I looked up the typescript. The book isitself Education; there are, however, six chapterswhich treat of the subject in the Special sense inwhich your question has involved us.So I shall fling these chapters headlong into thisletter.DE VOLUNTATE JUVENUMLong, O my Son, hath been this Digression fromthe plain Path of My word concerning Children; butit was most needful that thou shouldst understandthe Limits of true Liberty. For that is not the Will ofany Man which ultimateth in his own Ruin and thatof all his Fellows; and that is not Liberty whoseExercise bringeth him to Bondage. Thou maysttherefore assume that it is always an essential Partof the Will of any Child to grow to Manhood or toWomanhood in Health, and his Guardians maytherefore prevent him from ignorantly acting inOpposition thereunto, Care being always taken toremove the cause of the Error, namely, Ignorance,as aforesaid. Thou mayst also assume that it is Partof the Child’s Will to train every Function of theMind; and the Guardians may therefore combat theInertia which hinders its Development. Yet here ismuch Caution necessary, and it is better to work byexciting and satisfying any natural Curiosity thanby forcing Application to set Tasks, however obvi-ous this Necessity may appear.DE MODO DISPUTANDINow in this training of the Child is one most dearConsideration, that I shall impress upon thee as isConformity with our holy Experience in the way ofTruth. And it is this, that since that which can bethought is not true, every Statement is in some sensefalse. Even on the Sea of Pure Reason, we may saythat every Statement is in some Sense disputable.Therefore in every Case, even the simplest, theChild should be taught not only the Thesis, but alsoits opposite, leaving the Decision to the child’s ownJudgment and good Sense, fortified by Experience.And this Practice will develop its Power of Thought,and its Confidence in itself, and its Interest in allKnowledge. But most of all beware against anyAttempt to bias its Mind on any Point that liethwithout the Square of ascertained and undisputedFact. Remember also, even when thou art mostsure, that so were they sure who gave Instruction tothe young Copernicus. Pay Reverence also to theUnknown unto whom thou presumest to impart thyknowledge; for he may be one greater than thou.DE VOLUTATE JVENIS COGNOSCENDAIt is important that thou shouldst understand asearly as may be what is the true Will of the Child inthe Matter of his Career. Be thou well aware of allIdeals and Daydreams; for the Child is himself, andnot thy Toy. Recall the comic Tragedy of Napoleonand the King of Rome; build not an House for a wildGoat, nor plant a Forest for the Domain of a Shark.But be thou vigilant for every Sign, conscious orunconscious, of the Will of the Child, giving himthen all Opportunity to pursue the Path which hethus indicates. Learn this, that he, being young, willweary quickly of all false Ways, however pleasantthey may be to him at the Outset; but of the true Wayhe will not weary. This being in this Manner discov-ered, thou mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for noman can keep all Roads open for ever. And to himmaking his Choice explain how one may not travelfar on any one Road without a general Knowledgeof Things apparently irrelevant. And with that hewill understand, and bend him wisely to his Work.DE ARTE MENTIS COLENDI, (1)MATHEMATICA.Now, concerning the first Foundation of ThyMind I will say somewhat. Thou shalt study withDiligence in the Mathematics, because thereby shallbe revealed unto thee the Laws of thine own Reasonand the Limitations thereof. This Science manifestethunto thee thy true Nature in respect of the Machin-ery whereby it worketh, and showeth in pure Na-kedness, without Clothing of Personality or Desire,the Anatomy of thy conscious Self. Furthermore, bythis thou mayst understand the Essence of the Rela-tions between all Things, and the Nature of Neces-sity, and come to the Knowledge of Form. For this"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears94Mathematics is as it were the last Veil before theImage of Truth, so that there is no Way better thanour Holy Qabalah, which analyseth all Thingssoever, and reduceth them to pure Number; andthus their Natures being no longer coloured andconfused, they may be regulated and formulated inSimplicity by the Operation of Pure Reason, to theirgreat Comfort in the Work of our TranscendentalArt, whereby the Many become One.SEQUITUR (2) CLASSICAMy son, neglect not in any wise the study of theWritings of Antiquity, and that in the originalLanguage. For by this thou shalt discover the His-tory of the Structure of thy Mind, that is, its Natureregarded as the last Term in a Sequence of Causesand Effects. For thy Mind hath been built up of theseElements, so that in these Books thou mayst bringinto the Light thine own sub-conscious Memories.And thy Memory is as it were the Mortar in theHouse of thy Mind, without which is no Cohesionor Individuality possible, so that it is called Demen-tia. And these Books have lived long and becomefamous because they are the Fruits of ancient Treeswhereof thou art directly the Heir, wherefore (say I)they are more truly germane to thine own Naturethan Books of Collateral Offshoots, though suchwere in themselves better and wiser. Yes, O my son,in these Writings thou mayst study to come to thetrue Comprehension of thine own Nature, and thatof the whole Universe, in the dimensions of Time,even as the Mathematic declareth it in that of Space:that is, of Extension. Moreover, by this Study shallthe Child comprehend the Foundation of Manners:the which, as sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom,maketh Man.SEQUITUR (3) SCIENTIFICASince Time and Space are the conditions ofMind, these two Studies are fundamental. Yet thereremaineth Causality, which is the Root of the Ac-tions and Reactions of Nature. This also shalt thouseek ardently, that thou mayest comprehend theVariety of the Universe, its Harmony and its Beauty,with the Knowledge of that which compelleth it.Yet this is not equal to the former two in Power toreveal thee to thyself; and its first Use is to instructthee in the true Method of Advancement in Knowl-edge, which is, fundamentally, the observation ofthe Like and Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee theEcstasy of Wonder; and it shall bring thee to aproper Understanding of Art Magick. For our Mag-ick is but one of the Powers that lie within usundeveloped and unanalysed; and it is by the Methodof Science that it must be made clear, and availableto the Use of Man. Is not this a Gift beyond Price, theFruit of a Tree not only of Knowledge but of Life?For there is that in Man which is God, and there isthat also which is Dust; and by our Magick we shallmake these twain one Flesh, to the Obtaining of theEmpery of the Universe.I suppose I might have put it more concisely:Classics is itself Initiation, being the key of theUnconscious; Mathematics is the Art of manipulat-ing the Ruach, and of raising it to Neschamah; andScience is co-terminous with Magick.These are the three branches of study which Iregard as fundamental. No others are in the sameclass. For instance, Geography is almost meaning-less until one makes it real by dint of honest travel,which does not mean either “commuting” or “luxurycruises,” still less “globe-trotting.” Law is a special-ized study, with a view to a career; History is toounsystematic and uncertain to be of much use asmental training; Art is to be studied for and by one’ssolitary self; any teaching soever is rank poison.The final wisdom on this subject is perhaps theold “Something of everything, and everything ofsomething.”Love is the law, love under will.Yours ever, 666P.S. Better mention, perhaps, that literacy is notest of education. For ignorance of life, the don classleaves all others at the post; and it is these monkishand monkeyish recluses, with their hideous clatterand cackle, “The tittering, thin-bearded, epicene,”“Dwarf, fringed with fear,” the obscene vole, dwellerby and in backwaters that has foisted upon us thegrotesque and poisonous superstition that wisdomabides only in dogs-eared, worm-eaten, mule-in-spired long-forgotten as misbegotten folios.I like the story — it is a true tale — of the old Jewmillionaire who bought up the annual waste of thePennsylvania Railroad — a matter of Three Mil-lion Dollars. He called with his cheque very neatlymade out — and signed it by making his mark! TheRailroad Man was naturally falbbergasted, andcould not help exclaiming, “Yet you made all thosemillions of yours — what would you have been ifonly you had been able to read and write?” “Door-keeper at the Synagogue” was the prompt reply. Hisilliteracy had disqualified him when he applied forthe job after landing.The story is not only true, but “of all Truth;” seemy previous letter on “Certainty.Books are not the only medium even of learning;more, what they teach is partial, prejudiced, mea-gre, sterile, uncertain, and alien to reality. It followsthat all the best books are those which make nopretence to accuracy: poetry, theatre, fiction. Allothers date. Another point is that Truth abidesabove and aloof from intellectual expression, andconsequently those books which bear the MagicKeys of the Portal of the Intelligible by dint ofinspiration and suggestion come more nearly togrips with Reality than those whose appeal is onlyto the Intellect. “Didactic” poetry, “realistic” playsand novels, are contradictions in terms.P.P.S. One more effort: the above reminds methat I have said no word about the other side of themedal. There are many children who cannot beeducated at all in any sense of the word. It is anaboninable waste of both of them and of the teacherto push against brick walls.Yet one last point. I am as near seventy as makesno matter, and I am still learning with all my might.All my life I have been taught: governesses, privatetutors, schools, private and public, the best of theUniversities: how little I know! I have traveled allover the world in all conditions, from “grandseigneur,” to “holy man;” how little I know!What then of the ninety-and-nine, dragged by theears through suicide examinations, and kicked outof school into factory in their teens? They havelearnt only just enough to facilitate the swallowingof the gross venal lies of the radio and the YellowPress; or, if mother-wit has chanced to warn them,they learn a little — very little — more, getting theirScience from a Shilling Handbook and so on, tillthey know just enough to become dangerous agita-tors.No, anything like a real education demandsleisure, the conversation of the wise, the means totravel, and the rest.There is only one solution: to pick out the dia-monds from the clay, cut them, polish them, and setthem as they deserve. Attempt no idiot experimentswith the muck of the mine! You will observe that Iam advocating an aristocratic revolution. And so Iam!P.P.P.S. Short of the ideals above outlined, youmay as well have a pis aller — words of astonishinginsight and wisdom, not alien to the Law Thelema,and written by one who was trained on The Book ofthe Law.“Self-confidence must be cultivated in theyounger members of the nation from childhoodonwards. Their whole education and training mustbe directed towards giving them a conviction thatthey are superior to others”, wrote Hitler.“In the case of female education,” I read on, “themain stress should be laid on bodily training, afterthat on character, and, last of all, on the intellect; butthe one absolute aim of female education must bewith a view to the future mother.”They are quoted as an extreme example of allthat is horrible and evil by Mr. George E. Chust ofthe Daily Telegraph — from Mein Kampf!P.P.P.P.S. There is a game, an improvement onthe “Spelling Bee” — I have anti-christened it“Fore and aft” so as to be natty and naval — whichis in my opinion one of the three or four best indoorgames for two ever invented. Here are the rules, inbrief: any disputed points? Apply to me.1. A “Word” consists of four or more letters.2. It must be printed in big black type in theDictionary chosen for reference. (Nuttall’s is fairlygood, though some very well-known words areomitted. The Oxford Pocket Dictionary is useless;it is for morons, illiterates, wallowers in “BasicEnglish” — and [I suppose] Oxonians. No propernames, however well-known, unless used as com-mon: e.g. Bobby, a flatfoot, a beetlecrusher, aharness bull; or Xantippe, a shrew, a lady. X-rays isgiven in the plural only: ditto “Röntgen-rays”, andthey give “Röntgenogram”. “You never can tell!”Participles, plurals and the like are not “words”unless printed as such in big black type. E.g. Nuttall’s“Juttingly” is a word; “jutting” is not, being insmaller type. “Soaking” is in small type, but also inbig type as a noun; so it is a word.)"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears953. The Dictionary is the sole and final arbiter.This produces blasphemy, but averts assassination.4. The first player starts with the letter A. Thesecond may put any letter he chooses either beforeor after that A. The other continues as he will, andcan.5. The player who cannot add a letter withoutcompleting a “word” loses.They proceed to B, and so on to Z.6. A player whose turn it is must either add hisletter within a reasonable (This is a matter of goodfeeling, courtesy and consideration) time, may say“I challenge” or, alternatively, “That is a ‘word’.”The other must then give the “word” that he intends,or deny that it is a “word” within the meaning of theArt, as the case may be. The Dictionary decides thewinner. The challenged player may give one wordonly, and that in the form which is printed in theDictionary; e.g. if he were challenged at BRUSS,and answered Brussels, he would lose; if BRUS-SELS-SPROUTS, he would win. Hyphens neednot be given. CASHMERE is a “word”; it is a kindof shawl, etc., so is CHARLEY, a night-watchman.Don’t argue: the Dictionary decides.7. This game calls not only for an extensivevocabulary but for courage; foresight, judgment,resource, subtlety and even low cunning. It can beplayed by more than two players, but the more thereare, the more the element of chance comes in; andthis is hateful to really fine players and diminishesthe excitement. The rapier-play of two experts,when a word changes from one line of formation toanother, and then again, perhaps even a third time,is as exhilarating as a baseball-game or a bull-fight.And what the Tartarus-Tophet-Jehanna has allthis to do with Education, and the Great Work?This, child! H.G. Wells and others have pointed outwith serene justice that a gap in your vocabularyimplies a gap in your mind; you lack the corre-sponding idea. Too true, “Erbert! But I threap thata pakeha with such xerotes as his will chowter withan arsis of ischonophony, beyond aught that anyfub, even in Vigonia and dwale mammodis with acascade from a Dewan tauty, a kiss-me-quick, achou over her merkin and a parka over her chuddercould do to save him, and have an emprosthotonos,when he reads this. Sruti!(Whaur’s your Wullie Chaucer noo?)I put this in for you because an American officer,very dear to me, flited from the Front for a few daysto ask me a few questions — oh, “very much aboveyour exalted grade” my dear — and I thought itmight be useful to him to learn this game, needing,as it does, such very meagre apparatus, to wile awaysome of the long hours between attacks. He pickedit up quickly enough; but, after a bit when I sug-gested that he should pass it on to his comrades-in-arms, he jeered at me openly!Their vocabulary to mine, he said, holds justabout the same proportion as mine does to yours; Ihypothesized modestly, “about five per cent.” (Af-ter all, I am forty-five years his senior.) He roared atme. “Not one in a hundred,” he said, “know somuch as the names of nine-tenths of the subjects thatI discuss habitually and fluently. They gasp, theygape, they grunt, the gibber; it is almost alwaysblack bewilderment.1 And some of them are collegegraduates — which I’m not.”He was snatched from school, and given a com-mission on the spot, apparently because he was oneof very few that could be differentiated from theaverage Learned Pig.All this made me exceeding sorrowful. I began tounderstand why my Liber OZ, written entirely inwords of one syllable only, with this very idea inmind, turned out to be completely beyond the aver-age man’s (or woman’s) understanding. I had someMass Observation done on it. “But this is ranksocialism,” “Sy, ayn’t this all Fascism?” “OhGolly!” “Cripes!” “Coo!” “How dreadful!” aboutthe nearest most of them got to Ralph Straus andDesmond MacCarthy!Words of one syllable! Louis Marlow had al-ready told me what a fool I was to expect that. “Allthey can digest,” said he, “is a mess of stewedclichés with Bird’s custard Power.”Damn everything — it’s true, it’s true.So do you at least get together the stones that youneed to build your Basilica!CHAPTER LXXIII“MONSTERS,” NIGGERS, JEWS, ETC.Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Come now, is this quite fair? When I agreed totip you off about Magick and the rest, I certainlynever expected to be treated as if I were beinginterviewed by an American Sunday Newspaper.What do I prefer for breakfast, and my views on thefuture of the theatre, and is the Great White Broth-erhood in favour of Eugenic Babies? No, dear sister— I nearly said sob-sister. But this I will say, youhave been very artful, and led me on very cleverly— you must have been a terror to young men — forthe matter of that, I dare say you are still!And I don’t see how to get out of swallowing thislast sly bait; as you say, “Every man and everywoman is a star” does need some attention to thedefinition of “man” and “woman”. What is theposition, you say, of “monsters”? And men of“inferior” races, like the Veddah, Hottentot and theAustralian Blackfellow? There must be a line some-where, and will I please draw it? You make me feellike Giotto!There is one remark which I must make at thebeginning. It’s some poet or other, Tennyson orKipling, I think (I forget who) that wrote: “Folks inthe loomp, is baad.” It is true all round. Someonewisely took note that the vilest man alive hadalways found someone to love him. Remember themonster that Sir Frederick Treves picked up froman East End peep-show, and had petted by prin-cesses? (What a cunning trick!) Revolting, all thesame, to read his account of it. He — the monster,not Treves! — seems to have been a most charmingindividual — ah! That’s the word we want. Everyindividual has some qualities that endear him tosome other. And per contra, I doubt if there is anyclass which is not detestable to some other class.Artists, police, the clergy, “reds,” foxhunters, Free-masons, Jews, “heaven-born,” women’s clubwomen(especially in U.S.A.), “Methodys,” golfers, dog-lovers; you can’t find one body without its “natu-ral” enemies. It’s right, what’s worse; every class,as a class, is almost sure to have more defects thanqualities. As soon as you put men together, theysomehow sink, corporatively, below the level of theworst of the individuals composing it. Collect schol-ars on a club committee, or men of science on a jury;all their virtues vanish, and their vices pop out,reinforced by the self-confidence which the powerof numbers is bound to bestow.It is peculiarly noticeable that when a class isa ruling minority, it acquires a detestation as wellas a contempt for the surrounding “mob.” In theNorthern States of U.S.A., where the whites areoverwhelming in number, the “nigger” can bemore or less a “regular fellow;” in the South,where fear is a factor, Lynch Law prevails.(Should it? The reason for “NO” is that it is aconfession of weakness.) But in the North, thereis a very strong feeling about certain other classes:the Irish, the Italians, the Jews. Why? Fear again;the Irish in politics, the Italians in crime, the Jewsin finance. But none of these phobias preventfriendship between individuals of hostile classes.I think that perhaps I have already writtenenough — at least enough to start you thinkingon the right lines. And mark well this! The sub-mergence of the individual in his class means theend of all true human relations between men.Socialism means war. When the class moves as aclass, there can be no exceptions.This is no original thought of mine; Stalin andHitler both saw it crystal-clear; both, the oneadroitly, the other clumsily, but with equallyconsummate hypocrisy, acted it out. They pickedindividuals to rule under their autocracy, killedoff those that wouldn’t fit, destroyed the power ofthe Trades Unions or Soviets while pretending tomake them powerful and prosperous, and settleddown to the serious business of preparing for the1 They attach no meaning to these words:PalaeontologyCriterionVectorSynthesis (They know “synthetic” but can’t con-nect it with the noun)EpitomeForeign Policy (To them a mere phrase; no ideaof its connotation or principles)DemologyEntrepreneurCorrespondent and Co-respondent.

Our own long-est period of peace abroad (bar frontier skir-mishes like the Crimean war) and prosperity athome coincided with Free Trade and Laissez-faire.Now we may return, refreshed, to the mainquestion of monsters, real (like Treves’) or imagi-nary like Jews and niggers.’Arf a mo! Haven’t we solved the problem,ambulando? Everything would be okydoke andhunkydory if only we can prevent classes fromacting as such?I suppose so. Then, what about a spot of pithyparadox for a change?Why should the classes want to act as classes?It’s obvious; “Union is strength.” The worstFifteen can do more with a football than the bestopposing team of one — excuse my Irish!Well, what tortoise is that elephant basedupon? Why, still obviously, upon the universalsense of individual weakness. We all want a bigbruvver to tell of him! Hence the Gods and theClasses. It’s fear at the base of the whole pyramidof skulls.How right politicians are to look upon theirconstituents as cattle! Anyone who has any expe-rience of dealing with any class as such knowsthe futility of appealing to intelligence, indeed toany other qualities than those of brutes.And so, whenever we find one Man who has nofear like Ibsen’s Doctor Stockmann or MarkTwain’s Colonel Grainger that strolled out on hisbalcony with his shotgun to face the mob that hadcome to lynch him, he can get away with it. “AnEnemy of the People” wrote Ibsen, “Ye are againstthe people, O my chosen!” says The Book of theLaw. (AL II, 25.)Not only does it seem to me the only conceiv-able way of reconciling this and similar passageswith “Every man and every woman is a star” toassert the sovereignty of the individual, and todeny the right-to-exist to “class-consciousness,”“crowd-psychology,” and so to mob-rule andLynch-Law, but also the only practicable planwhereby we may each one of us settle downpeaceably to mind his own business, to pursue hisTrue Will, and to accomplish the Great Work.So never lose sight for a moment of the maximso often repeated in one context or another inthese letters: that fear is at the root of everypossibility of trouble, and that “Fear is failure,and the forerunner of failure. Be thou thereforewithout fear; for in the heart of the coward virtueabideth not.”Good-night; and don’t look under the bed!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXXIVOBSTACLES ON THE PATHCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Peccavi! And how! But my excuse is good, andI will try to make amends.First, a little counter-attack — your letter is sorambling and diffuse that at first I couldn’t makeout what you were getting at, and at last decided thatit is much too random to reproduce, or even to dealwith in detail. I shall simply formulate the case forthe Prosecution, plead guilty, and appeal for clem-ency.The gravamen is that the Path of the Wise is gaywith flowers, gilded with kiosks, and beset withsnares; that every step is the Abode of Terror andRapture — and all that! Yet I habitually write in themanner of a drunken dominie! You “gaped forAeschylus, and got Theognis.”I tempted you, it seems with The ChymicalMarriage of Christian Rosencreutz, its incompa-rable mystery and glamour, its fugitive beauty, itsineffable romance, its chivalry and its adventure,pellucid gleams as of sunlight under the sea, vastbrooding wings of horror overshadowing the firma-ment, yet with strong Starlight constant overhead.And then I let you down!You did expect at least something of the atmo-sphere of the Arabian Nights; if not so high, ofApuleius and Petronius Arbiter; of Rabelais,Meinhold, de la Motte Fouqué; and the Morted’Arthur in later times, of Balzac, Dumas, Lytton,Huysmans, Mabel Collins and Arthur Machen.You look at me with strange sad eyes: “But you,too, Master, have not you too led a life as strange,as glamourous, as weird and as romantic, as the bestof them? Then why this cold detachment from thatambience?” Well, if you put it like that, I can onlysay that I feel at the same time more guilty andentirely innocent!For, while the charge is true, the defence is not tobe shaken.The worst of all teachers are the Boloney Mag-nates, of whom I have already given some account.But the next worst are just exactly those who try tocreate an atmosphere of romance, and succeed onlyin a crude theatricalism. So, avoiding the swirlingturmoil of Scylla, I have broken the ship on thebarren rock Charybdis.Now let me hearten you, brave sister! All the oldtales are true! You can have as many dragons,princesses, vampires, knights-errant, glendowers,enchanted apes, Jinn, sorcerers and incubi as youlike to fancy, and — whoa Emma! did I tell youabout Cardinal Newman? Well, I will.The one passage in his snivelling Apologia whichimpressed me was a tale of his childhood — beforethe real poet, lover and mystic had been buriedbeneath the dung-heap of Theology. He tells us thathe read the Arabian Nights — in a heavily Bowd-lerized edition, bet you a tosser! — and was en-chanted, like the rest of us, so that he sighed “I wishthese tales were true!” The same thing happened tome; but I set my teeth, and muttered: “I will makethese tales true!”Well, I have, haven’t I? You said it yourself!Let me be very frank about one point. It hasalways puzzled me completely why one is forbid-den to relate certain of one’s adventures. Youremember, perhaps, in one of these letters I startedout gaily to tell you some quite simple things — Icouldn’t, can’t, see quite what harm could come ofit — and I was pulled up sharp — yes, and actuallypunished, like a school-boy! I had often done muchmore impudent things, and nobody seemed to givea hoot. Oh somebody tell me why!The only suggestion that occurs to me is that Imight somehow be “giving occasion to the enemyto blaspheme.” Let it go at that! “Enough of Be-cause! Be he damned for a dog!”Yes child, my deepest attitude is to be found inmy life. I have been to most of the holy inaccessibleplaces, and talked with the most holy inaccessiblemen; I have dared all the most dangerous adven-tures, both of the flesh and of the spirit; and Ichallenge the world’s literature to match for sub-limity and terror such experiences as those in thelatter half of The Vision and the Voice.You understand, of course, that I say all thismerely in indication; or rather, as I said before, as anappeal for clemency.On the contrary (you will retort) you are a meancat (Felis Leo, please!) not to let us all in on theground floor of so imposing a Cathedral!To atone? Not a catalogue, which would beinterminable; not a classification, which would beimpossible, save in the roughest terms; nothing buta few short notes, possibly an anecdote or so.

To master Earth, remember that the Diskis always spinning; fix this idea, get rid of itssolidity.Commonly, the first tests of the young Aspirantrefer to cash — “that’s God’s sole solid in thisworld.” The proper magical attitude is very hard todescribe. (I’m not talking of that black hen’s eggany more; that is simple.) Very sorry to have to sayit, but it is not unlike that of the spendthrift. Moneymust circulate, or it loses its true value. A banker inNew York once told me that the dollar circulatednine times as fast as the English equivalent, so thatpeople seemed to themselves to be nine times asrich. (I told you about the £100 note in a specialletter on Money). But here I am stressing the spiri-tual effect; what happens is that anxiety vanishes;one feels that as it goes out, so it comes in. This viewis not incompatible with thrift and prudence, and allthat lot of virtues, far from it, it tucks in with themquite easily. You must practise this; there’s a knack"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears97in it. Success in this leads to a very curious resultindeed; not only does the refusal to count(Fourpen’north of Yoga, please miss, and Mumsays can I have a penny if I bring back the bottle!),bring about the needlessness of counting, but alsoone acquires the power to command!A century ago, very nearly, there lived in Bristolan “Open Brother” named Muller, who was awizard at this; Grace before breakfast, the usualpalaver about the Lord and His blessings and Hisbounty et cetera, da capo; to conclude “and, BlessedLord, we would humbly venture to remind Theethat this morning Thou art £3 4s. 6½d. short in theaccounts; trusting that Thou wilt give this smallmatter Thine immediate attention, for Jesus’ Christ’ssake, Amen.” Sure enough, when he came to openhis post, there would be just enough, sometimesexactly enough, to cover that amount.This story was told me by an enemy, who thoughtquite seriously that he would go to Hell for being“Open.” (“Open” Brethren were lax about the Lord’sSupper, let people partake who were not soundupon the Ramsgate Question; and other Theologi-cal Atrocities!) It meant that the facts were soundeniable that the “advertisement for Answer toPrayer” outweighed the “miracle by a heretic.”I knew a poetess of great distinction who used toamuse herself by breaking off a conversation andsaying, “Give me a franc” (or a shilling, or anysmall sum) and then going on with her previousremarks. She told me that of over a hundred peopleI was the second who had passed the coin to herwithout remark of any kind.This story — do you think? — is neither here nothere. No, my remarks are rarely asyntartete. TheMasters, at one stage or another of initiation — it isforbidden to indicate the conditions — arrange forsome test of the Aspirant’s attitude in some matter,not necessarily involving cash. If he fails, goodnight!Swords, now. The snags connected with this typeof test are probably the nastiest of any. Misunder-standing, confusion, logical error (and, worse, logi-cal precision of the kind that distinguishes manylunatics), dispersion, indecision, failure to estimatevalues correctly — oh! —there is no end to the list.So much so, indeed, that there is no specific criticaltest, it is all part of the routine, and goes on inces-santly.Well, there is just one. Without warning a deci-sion of critical importance has to be made by thecandidate, and he is given so many minutes to sayYes or No. He gets no second chance.But I must warn you of one particular disgrace.You know that people of low mentality hauntfortune-tellers of equal calibre, but with more lowcunning. They do not really want to know thefuture, or to get advice; their real object is topersuade some supposed “authority” to flatter themand confirm them in their folly and stupidity.It is the same thing with a terrifying percentageof the people that come for “teaching” and “initia-tion.” The moment they learn anything they didn’tknow before, off they fly in a temper! No soonerdoes it become apparent that the Master is not astupid middle-class prig and hypocrite — anotheredition of themselves, in short — they are fright-ened, they are horrified, they flee away on both theirfeet, like the man in the Bible! I have seen peopleturn fish-belly pale in the face, and come nearfainting outright, when it has dawned upon themsuddenly that magick is a real thing!It’s all beyond me!Cups: we are much more definite again. Thegreat test is so well known, and accounts havealready been published, that it can be here plainlystated. Early in his career, the Aspirant is exposed tothe seductions of a Vampire, and warned in dueform and due season.“Sleep with A, B, C, D, E and F, my lad, and ourhearty best wishes! But not with G on any account,on peril of your work!”So off he goes to G, without a second’s hesita-tion. This test may be prolonged; the deadliness andsubtlety of the danger has been recognized, and hemay have half a dozen warnings, either direct orspringing from his relations with her. And thepenalty is not so drastically final; often he gets offwith a term of penal servitude.On the other hand, the Aspirant who can spot atthe first hint why the Masters think that particularwoman a danger, and acts promptly and decisivelyas he should, is secretly marked down as a sword ofvery fine temper indeed!The rest of the Cup Ordeals consists for the mostpart of progressive estimations of the quality of thePostulant’s devotion to the work; there is not, as arule, anything particularly spectacular or dramaticin it. If you stick to your Greetings and Adorationsand all such mnemonics, you are not likely to govery far wrong.Wands: this obviously a pure question of Will.You will find as you go on that obstacles of varyingdegrees of difficulty confront you; and the way inwhich you deal with them is most carefully watched.The best advice that I can give is to remember thatthere is little need of the Bull-at-a-Gate method,though that must always be ready in reserve; no, thebest analogy is rapier-play. Elastic strength. War-fare shows us.That seems to cover your question more or less;but don’t forget that it depends on yourself howmuch of the dramatic quality colours your Path. Isuppose I have been lucky to have had the use of allthe traditional trappings; but it is always possible tomake a “coat of many colours” out of a heap of rags.To show you that you have had Chaucer and JohnBunyan — yes, and Laurence Sterne: to bring upthe rear, James Thomson (B.V.) to say nothing ofConrad and Hardy. Nor let me forget The Cream ofthe Jest and The Rivet in Grandfather’s Neck ofmy friend, James Branch Cabell.So now, fair damozel, bestride thy palfrey, andaway to the Mountains of Magick!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 666P.S. One danger I had purposely passed over, asit is not likely to come your way. But, since othersmay read these letters —Some, and these the men of highest promise,often of great achievement, are tempted by Treason.They acquire a “Judas-complex,” think how splen-did it would be if they were to destroy the Order —or, at the very least, unhorse the Master.This is, of course, absurd in itself, because if theyhad crossed the Abyss, they would understand whyit is impossible. It would be like “destroying Elec-tricity,” or “debunking” the Venus of Milo. Themaximum of success possible in such an operationwould be to become a “Black-Brother;” but whathappens in practice, so far as my own experiencegoes, is complete dispersion of the mental facultiesamounting to suicide; I could quote no less thanfour cases in which actual physical self-murder wasthe direct result.CHAPTER LXXVTHE A∴∴∴∴∴A∴∴∴∴∴ AND THE PLANETCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You Write:“Am I to understand that the A∴A∴ has twomain lines of Work. (1) The initiation of Individu-als, (2) Action on the world in general — say“Weltpolitik”? Because your letters on the Historyof Magick do imply (2); and yet the A∴A∴ dis-courages any form of group working. Is it that theMasters (8° = 3 Magistri Templi) having beenadmitted to the Third Order — the A∴A∴ proper;below this are R.R. et A.C. and G∴D∴ — are nolonger liable to the dangers which make groupactivity in lower grades undesirable. Or do they stillwork as Individuals, yet, because they are ini-tiates, appear to act as a corporate body? You haveoften expressed yourself as if this were so. ‘Ofcourse, They had to pick on me to do the dirty work’is a typical growl of the old Big Lion! But againthere is that Magical Memory of yours when youcame down from that Hermitage in the little woodoverhanging the nullah below the Great Peak ‘some-where in Asia’ and sat in some sort of Consistory inthe valley where the great Lamaserai — or what-ever it was — towers over the track. (I quote someof your phrases from memory.) Which is it?”My dear child, that is all very sensibly put; andthe answer is that Convenience would decide. Thenyou go on, after a digression:“Then how are They acting at present? Whatimpact has the new Word, Thelema, made upon theplanet? What are we to expect as a result?

But do notforget that I am myself completely in the dark withregard to the special functions of most of my col-leagues.To begin, then!Achtung! I am going to be hard-boiled; my firstact is to enlist the Devil himself in our ranks, andtake the Materialistic Interpretation of History from"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears98Karl Marx, and accept economic laws as the mani-fest levers which determine the fortune of one partof the earth or another.I shall take exception only by showing that theseprinciples are secondary: oil in Texas, nitrates onthe Pacific slope of the Andes, suphur in Louisiana(which put Etna’s nose out of joint by making itcheaper for the burgers of Messina to import it fromfour thousand miles away instead of digging it outof their own back garden), even coal and timber,upset very few apple-carts until individual geniushad found for these commodities such uses as ourgrandfathers never dreamed. The technical devel-opments of almost every form of wealth are theforebears of Big Business; and Big Business, di-rectly or indirectly, is the immediate cause of War.In the “To-day and to-morrow” series is an essaycalled Ouroboros, by Garet Garrett; one of themost shrewd and deep-delving analysis of econom-ics ever written. May I condense him crudely? MassProduction for profit fails when its markets areexhausted; so every effort is made to impose it notonly on the native but the foreigner, and shouldguile fail, then force!But the process ineluctably goes on; when thewhole world buys the nasty stuff, and will accept noother, the exploiter is still faced by diminishingreturns. No possibility of expansion; sooner or laterdividends dwindle, and the Business is Bust.To even the most stupid it becomes plain at thisstage that war is wholly ruinous; organization breaksdown altogether; one meaningless revolution fol-lows another; famine and pestilence complete thejob.Last time — when Osiris replaced Isis — thewreck was limited in scope — note that it was thecivilized, the organized part that broke down.(Jews and Arabs could remain aloof, and keep asmall torch burning until Light returned with theRenaissance.)This time there is no civilization which canescape being involved in the totality of the catastro-phe.Towards this collapse all totalitarian movementsinevitably tend. Bertrand Russell himself admitsthat, although himself “temperamentally Anarchis-tic,” Society must be yet more organized than it isto-day if it is to exist at all.But his, as Garet Garrett shows, is the JohnGilpin type of horsemanship. We are to-day moreor less at the stage where “off flew Gilpin’s hat andwig.”Achievement of high aims, which tends ulti-mately to the well-being, the prosperity of the re-public, depends on the proportion of masters toservants. The stability of a building depends on theproportion of superstructure to foundations. Therule holds good in every department of Nature.There is an optimum for every case. If there is onebarber for ten thousand men, most of them willremain unshorn; if there are five thousand barbers,most of them will be out of a job.Apply this measure to society; there must be anoptimum relation between industry and agricul-ture, between town and country. When the properbalance is not struck, the community must dependon outside help, importing what it lacks, exportingits surplus. This is an unnatural state of affairs; itresults in business, and therefore ultimately in war.That is, as soon as the stress set up by the conditionsbecomes insupportable. So long as “business” isconfined to luxuries, no great harm need result; butwhen interference with the flow of foreign tradethreatens actual necessities, the unit concerned real-izes that it is in danger of strangulation. ConsiderEngland’s food supply! Switzerland, Russia, China,the U.S.A. can laugh at U-boats. England mustsupport a Navy, a wealth-consuming, not a wealth-producing, item in the Budget. Similar remarksapply to practically all Government Departments.The minimum of organization is desirable; all arti-ficial doctrinaire multiplication of works whichproduce no wealth is waste; and for many reasons(some absurd, like “social position”) tend to createfresh unnecessary necessities. Ad infinitum, like thefleas in the epigram!When laws are reasonable in the eyes of theaverage man, he respects them, keeps them, does hisbest to maintain them; therefore a minute PoliceForce, with powers strictly limited, is adequate todeal with the almost negligibly small criminal class.A convention is laudable when it is convenient.When laws are unjust, monstrous, ridiculous, thatsame average man, will he-nill he, becomes a crimi-nal; and the law requires a Tcheka or a Gestapowith dictatorial powers and no safeguards to main-tain the farce. Also, corruption becomes normal inofficial circles; and is excused. I refer you to Mr.J.H. Thomas.1One evil leads to another; the seven devils al-ways take possession of a house that is swept andgarnished to the point at which people find it un-comfortable.But is not all this beside the point, you ask? No.It was needful to indicate this cumulative progres-sion to social shipwreck, because, to-day an obvi-ous peril of the most menacing, in 1904 no ordinarysane person foresaw anything of the sort. But spe-cial knowledge alters things, and it is certain that theMasters anticipated, with great exactness of calcu-lation, the way things would go in the politicalworld.Practically all the messages received during the“Cairo Working” (March-April 1904 e.v.) came tome through Ouarda. No woman ever lived who wasmore ignorant of, or less interested in, anything todo with politics, or the welfare of the race; she caredfor nothing beyond her personal comfort and plea-sure. When the communications ceased, she droppedthe whole affair without a thought.She nearly always referred to the authors of thesemessages as “They:” when asked who “They”were, she would say haltingly and stupidly “thegods,” or some equally unhelpful term. But she wasalways absolutely clear and precise as to the in-structions. The New Aeon was to supersede the old;my special job was to preserve the Sacred Tradi-tion, so that a new Renaissance might in due seasonrekindle the hidden Light. I was accordingly tomake a Quintessence of the Ancient Wisdom, andpublish it in as permanent a form as possible. ThisI did in The Equinox. I should perhaps have beenstrictly classical, and admitted only the “Publica-tion in Class A”, “A-B”, “B” and “D” material. ButI had the idea that it would be a good plan to add allsorts of other stuff, so that people who were not inany way interested in the real Work might preservetheir copies.This by the way: the essence this letter is to showthat “They”, not one person but a number acting inconcert, not only foresaw a planet-wide catastro-phe, but were agreed on measures calculated toassure the survival of the Wisdom worth savinguntil the time, perhaps three hundred or six hundredyears later, when a new current should revive theshattered thought of mankind.The Equinox, in a word, was to be a sort ofRosetta Stone.There is one other matter of incomparable im-portance: the wars which have begun the disinte-gration of the world have followed, each at aninterval of nine months, the operative publicationsof The Book of the Law. This again seems to makeit almost certain that “They” not only know thefuture, at least in broad outline, but are at pains toarrange it. I have no doubt that the advance ofNatural Science is in the charge of a certain groupof “Masters.” Even the spiritually and morally aswell as the physically destructive phenomena of ourage must be parts of some vast all-comprehensiveplan.Putting two and two together, and making 718,it looks as if the Masters acquiesced in and helpedto fulfill, the formula of the catastrophic successionof the Aeons.An analogy. We have the secret of the Elixir ofLife, and could carry on in the same body indefi-nitely; yet at least some masters prefer to reincar-nate in the regular way, only taking care to waste notime in Amennti, but to get back to the Old Benchand pick up the New Tools with the minimum ofdelay.By having attained the Freedom of “Elysian,windless, fortunate abodes Beyond Heaven’sconstellated wilderness” “we are blessed; and bless”by refusing to linger therein, but shouldering oncemore “Atlantean the load of the too vast orb of” theKarma of Mankind.This hypothesis does at least make intelligibleTheir action in riding for a fall instead of preventingit. It may also be that They feel that human progresshas reached its asymptote so far as the old Formulacan take it. In fact, unless we take some such view,there does not seem to be much point in taking an1 The Chancellor of the Exchequer, having fixedthe increase of Income Tax at threepence, pro-ceeded to defraud the Insurance Companies byinsuring himself against a rise of the sum!"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears99action so fundamentally revolutionary (on the sur-face) as the proclamation of a New Word.But then (you will object, if an objection it be)people like Lenin, Hitler, Mussolini, the Mikado, ethoc genus omne, are loyal emissaries of the Mas-ters, or the gods! Well, why not? An analogy, oncemore. In the Christian legend we find God (omnipo-tent, omniscient, omnipresent) employing Judas,Pilate and Herod, no less than Jesus, as actors in theDrama which replaced Isis by Osiris in the GreatFormula. Perfectly true; but this fact does not in anyway exculpate the criminals. It is no excuse for theCommandants of Belsen and Buchenwald that theywere acting under orders. The Drama is not mereplay-acting, in which the most virtuous man mayplay the vilest of parts.Your further objection, doubtless, will be thatthis theory makes the Masters responsible for theagony of the planet. I refer you to The Book of theHeart Girt with a Serpent, Cp I, v. 33-40.“33. Let us take our delight in the multitude ofmen! Let us shape unto ourselves a boat of Mother-of-Pearl from them, that we may ride upon the riverof Amrit!“34. Thou seest yon petal of Amaranth, blownby the wind from the low sweet brows of Hathor?“35. (The magister saw it and rejoiced in thebeauty of it) Listen!“36. (From a certain world came an infinitewail) That falling petal seemed to the little ones awave to engulph their continent.“37. So they will reproach thy servant, saying:Who hath set thee to save us?“38. He will be sore distressed.“39. All they will understand not that thou and Iare fashioning a boat of Mother-of-Pearl. We willsail down the river of Amrit even to the yew grovesof Yama, where we may rejoice exceedingly.“40. The joy of men shall be our silver gleam,their woe our blue gleam — all in the Mother-of-pearl.”And again, Cp. I, v. 50-52 and v. 56-62.“50. Adonai spake yet again with V.V.V.V.V.and said: The earth is ripe for vintage; let us eat ofher grapes, and be drunken thereon.“51. And V.V.V.V.V. answered and said: O myLord, my dove, my excellent one, how shall thisword seem unto the children of men?“52. And He answered him: Not as thou canstsee. It is certain that every letter of this cipher hathsome value; but who shall determine the value? Forit varieth ever, according to the subtlety of him thatmade it.”.......“56. And Adonai said: The strong brown reaperswept his swathe and rejoiced. The wise man countedhis muscles and pondered, and understood not, andwas sad. Reap thou and rejoice!“57. Then was the adept glad, and lifted his arm.Lo! an earthquake, and plague, and terror on theearth! A casting down of them that sate in highplaces; a famine upon the multitude!“58. And the grape fell ripe and rich into hismouth.“59. Stained is the purple of thy mouth, Obrilliant one with the white glory of the lips ofAdonai.“60. The foam of the grape is like the storm uponthe sea; the ships tremble and shudder; the shipmas-ter is afraid.“61. That is thy drunkenness, O holy one, andthe winds whirl away the soul of the scribe into thehappy haven.“62. O Lord God! Let the haven be cast down bythe fury of the storm! Let the foam of the grapetincture my soul with thy light!”Yes, I dare say. But is there not here a sort ofmoral oxymoron? Are not the Masters pursuingtwo diametrically opposed policies at the sametime?Genius — or Initiation, which implies the libera-tion and development of the genius latent in us all(is not one of the names of the “Holy GuardianAngel” the Genius?) — is practically the monopolyof the “crazy adventurer,” as the official mind willmost certainly rate him. Then why do not theMasters oppose all forms of organization tooth-and-nail?It depends, surely, on the stage which a societyhas reached on its fall to the servile state. Civiliza-tion of course, implies organization up to a certainpoint. The freedom of any function is built uponsystem; and so long as Law and Order make it easierfor a man to do his True Will, they are admirable.It is when system is adored for its own sake, or as ameans of endowing mediocrities with power assuch, that the “critical temperature” is attained.It so happens that I write this on the eve of aGeneral Election in England; and it seems to methat whichever wins, England loses.The Socialists openly proclaim that they mean torun the country on the lines of a convict prison; butthe Tories, for all their fine talk, would be helplessagainst the Banks and the Trusts to whom they mustlook for support.Still, perhaps with a little help from Hashish, onecan imagine a Merchant Prince or a Banker beingintelligent, or even, in a weak moment, human; andthis is not the case with officials. The standard,moreover, of education and Good Manners, low asit is, is less low in Tory circles.As I think that totalitarian methods are alreadyon the way to extinguish the last spark of manlyindependence — that is, in self-styled civilizedcountries — it seems to me that we all should regardwith shrewd suspicion any plans for “perfecting”social conditions. The extreme horror is the for-mula of the gregarious type of insect. Inherent in thepremises is the impossibility of advance.One may sum the policy of the A∴A∴ as fol-lows:1. To assist the initiation of the individual.2. To maintain a form of social order in which theadventure of initiation is easy — to undertake!3. To work out the Magical Formula of the NewAeon.“Ye-e-ss, I s-e-e.”I doubt it. But what you are asking is how todecide upon your personal programme.The intelligent visitor from who knows whatplanet was puzzled. He chanced to have landed inEngland — to find a General Election in full blast.(The operative word is “blast”.) They must beabsolute imbeciles, was his first reaction, to riskupsetting the policy of Government with a first-class war on.(There would have been no need of such non-sense — I interrupted — if Parliament was electedby my simple plan. I’ll give you the main idea; Idon’t insist on the figures. When a candidate isreturned by 50 per-cent over his runner-up, he sitsfor five years. If forty percent, four years; and so on.An alternative — to “stagger” the assembly, as (Ithink) is done in the Senate of the United States.)How are you going to vote?Rather like the question of the dentist. The teethcan be tinkered: of course, sooner or later they haveto go. Is it worth the trouble and expense? TheSocialists would have them all out right away, andreplaced by a set of “dentures,” which (obviously)are perfect. Arrange them, change them, chooseyour own pattern; no trouble, no pain: all one’sdream come true! But hardly biological.You may argue that convicts are examples ofliving individuals whose safety, shelter, nourish-ment and the rest are organized with the utmostcare; but accidents will happen in the best-regulated“brown stone jugs.” The one ideally automatic caseis the foetus. You will agree that here is lack ofinitiative; in fact, its “True Will” is to escape, albeitinto a harsh and hostile universe, fraught withunknown and incalculable dangers.As the Ritual says: “Prepare to enter the Immea-surable Region!”I think your decision should depend on how farcaries has travelled on its road of destruction.I do not think that the Masters need be unani-mous.A practical plan might be for them to concentrateon one particular group, or one part of the world,and to keep this in as good shape as possible untilthe time has come for Nature to grow a new set.They will be grown on a new Formula, to meetthe new needs, just as when our “permanent” (Alas,not much!) set replace our milk-teeth.You ask me if I think this change can be madewithout bloodshed.No. The obscure autocrats of Diplomacy andBig Business are infinitely stupid and short-sighted;they cannot see an inch beyond their too oftenstigmatically shapen probosces, except where theprofit of the next financial year is concerned. Theylive in perpetual panic, and shy at their own shad-ows. They accordingly attack even the most in-nocuous windmills in suicidal charges.Yes:bella, horrida bella,Et flavem Tibrim spumantem sanguine cerno.So, whichever way you vote, you are asking fortrouble, or would do, if the vote had any meaning."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears100The result of any election, or for the matter of thatany revolution, is an almost wholly insignificantcomponent of those stupendous and inscrutableMagical Forces which determine the destinies of theplanet.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXXVITHE GODS: HOW AND WHY THEYOVERLAPCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Your last letter.I am glad: it shows you have been putting insome genuine original work. Result! You make avery shrewd observation; you have noticed thecurious fashion in which Gods seem to overlap. It isnot the same (you point out) with Angels. In noother system do we find a parallel for the LivingCreatures. Wheels, Wings, Fiery Serpents, withsuch quasi-human cohorts as the Beni Elohim whobeget the children on women, to whom the Qabalahhas introduced us. The Beni Elohim is actually anexception; there is the Incubus and some of theFairy Folk, as well as certain Gods and demi-Gods,who act thus paternally. But you are right in themain. The Arabs, for example, have “seven heav-ens” and seven Orders of Angels, also Jinn; but theclasses are by no means identical. This, even thoughcertain Archangels, notably Gabriel, appear in bothsystems. But then Gabriel is a definite individual, aperson — and this fact is the key to your puzzle.For, as I have explained in a previous letter,Gods are people: macrocosms, not mere colloca-tions of the elements, planets and signs as are mostof the angels, intelligences and spirits. It is interest-ing to note that Gabriel in particular seems to bemore than one of these; he enjoys the divine privi-lege of being himself. Between you and me and thepylon, I suspect that Gabriel who gave the Q’uranto Mohammed was in reality a “Master” or messen-ger of some such person, more or less as Aiwassdescribes himself as “the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.” (AL I, 7.) His name implies some suchfunction; for G.B.R. is Mercury between the TwoGreater Lights, Sol and Luna. This seems to meanthat he is something more than a lunar or terrestrialarch-angel; as he would appear to be from 777.(There now! That was my private fiend again — theDemon of Digression. Back to our Gods!)777 itself, to say nothing of The Golden Boughand the Good Lord knows how many other similarmonuments of lexicography (for really they arelittle more), is our text-book. We are bound to noteat once that the Gods sympathise, run into oneanother, coalesce much more closely than any otherof the Orders of Being. There is not really much incommon between a jackal and a beetle, or betweena wolf and an owl, although they are grouped underPisces or Aries respectively. But Adonis, Attis,Osiris, Melcarth, Mithras, Marsyas — a wholestring of them comes tripping off the tongue. Theyall have histories; their birth, their life, their death,their subsequent career; all goes naturally withthem exactly as if they were (say) a set of warriors,painters, anything superbly human. We feel in-stinctively that we know them, or at least know ofthem in the same sense that we know of our fellowmen and women; and that in a sense which never somuch as occurs to us when we discuss Archangels.The great exception is the Holy Guardian Angel;and this as I have shewn in another letter is forexactly the same reason; He is a Person, amacrocosmic Individual. (We do not know abouthis birth and so on; but that is because he is, so tospeak, a private God; he only appears to the worldat all through some reference to him by his client;for instance, the genius or Augoeides of Socrates.)Let us see how this works in practice. ConsiderZeus, Jupiter, Amon-Ra, Indra, etc., we can think ofthem as the same identical people known and de-scribed by Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and Hindus;they differ as Mont Cervin differs from MonteSilvio and the Matterhorn. (They are bound toappear different, because the mountain does notlook the same from Zermatt as it does fromDomodossola, or even as seen by a French-Swissand a German-Swiss.) In the same way read the Lifeof Napoleon written by one of his marshals, byMichelet (a rabid Republican), by Lord Rosebery,by a patriotic Russian, and by a German poet andphilosopher: one can hardly believe that the subjectof any two of these biographies is the same man.But upon certain points the identity is bound totranspire; even when we read of his crushing andclassic defeat at Waterloo by the Belgians, the manis detected. Transferring the analogy to the Gods, itis then open to us to suppose that Tahuti, Thoth,Hermes, Mercury, Loki, Hanuman and the rest areidentical, and that the diversity of the name and theseries of exploits is due merely to the accidents oftime and space. But it is at least equally plausible tosuggest that these Gods are different individuals,although of the identical Order of Being, character-istics and function. Very much as if one took Drake,Frobisher, Raleigh, Hood, Blake, Rodney andNelson, as seen through the mists of history, tradi-tion, legend and plain mythopoeia. Add a fewnames not English, and our position is closelyparallel. Personally, I incline to the latter hypoth-esis; but it would be hard to say why, unless that itis because I feel that to identify them completelywould be to reduce their stature to that of personi-fications of various cosmic energies.History lends its weight to my view. When thephilosophic schools, unable to refute the charge ofabsurdity leveled at the orthodox devotee who be-lieved that Mars actually begot Romulus and Remuson a Vestal Virgin, explained that Mars was nomore than the martial instinct, and the Virgin a typeof Purity, their faith declined, and with it RomanVirtue. “Educate” Colonel Blimp’s children andwe have the “intelligentsia” of Bloomsbury. I amvery sorry about all this; but life must always bebrutal and stupid so long as it depends upon animalsand vegetables for nourishment.How restore faith in the Gods? There is only oneway; we must get to know them personally. Andthat, of course, is one of the principal tasks of theMagician.One further remark. I have suggested that allthese “identical” gods are in reality distinct persons,but belonging to the same families. Can we followup this line of thought? Yes: but I will defer it to asubsequent letter.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXXVIIWORK WORTH WHILE: WHY?Cara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Your remarks on my 0=2 letter are very apt andinspiriting — that is if I have rightly understoodwhat you want to say. (Really, you know, they area bit muddled — or I am!) May I frame yourquestion, if it is a question, in my own terms? Yes?Right.You say that I have advanced an invulnerabletheory of the Universe in philosophical and math-ematical language, and you suppose (underlinedthree times with two question marks) that onecould, with a great effort, deduce therefrom per-fectly good reasons for an unswerving contempla-tion of one’s umbilicus, or the performance ofstrange dances and the vibration of mysteriousnames. But what are you to say (you enquire) to theordinary Bloke-on-the-Boulevard, to the man ofthe world who has acquired a shrewd knowledge ofNature, but finds no rational guide to the conduct oflife. He observes many unsatisfactory elements inthe way things go, and for his own sake would liketo “remould them nearer to the heart’s desire,” torefurbish the cliché of Fitzgerald about “this sorryscheme of things.” He is not in the least interested inthe learned exposition of 0=2. But he is aware thatthe A∴A∴ professes a sound solution of the prob-lem of conduct and would like to know if itsprogramme can be justified in terms of CommonSense.As luck would have it, only a few weeks ago Iwas asked to address a group of just such people —and they gave me three-quarters of an hour’s notice.It was really more like ten minutes, as the rest of thetime was bespoke by letter-writing and postingwhich could in no wise be postponed.So I had to devise an adequate gambit, one whichruthlessly excluded any touch of subtlety, or anyassumption of previous knowledge of the subject onthe part of the audience.It came off. For the first time in history, thelaymen elicited intelligent and relevant questions.There were only three half-wits in the five score orso persons present, and these (naturally!) were justthose people who claimed to have studied the sub-ject.What follows is a rough outline of my argument.I began by pointing out that Nature exercisesmany forms of Energy, which are not directly ob-servable by the senses. In fact, the History of Sci-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears101ence for the last hundred and fifty years or so hasconsisted principally of the discovery of such types,with their analysis, measurement and manipula-tion. There is every reason to suppose that manysuch remain to be discovered.But what has in no case been observed is anytrace of will or of intelligence, except through someapparatus involving a nervous and cerebral system.At this point I want especially to call yourattention to certain species of animals (bees andtermites are obvious cases) where a collective con-sciousness seems to exist, since the community actsas a whole in evidently purposeful ways, yet theunits of that community are not even complete inthemselves. (Isn’t there some series of worms, eachsub-type able only to subsist on the excrement of itspreserver in the series?)Then there are the phenomena of mob psychol-ogy, where a crowd gleefully combine to performacts which would horrify any single individual.And there is the exceeding strange and interestingpsychology of the “partouse” — this is a little more,in my judgment, than a spinthria.In all such cases the operative consciousnessdoes not reside in any single person, as one mightargue that it did when an orator “carries away” hisaudience. But these remarks have rather shuntedone into a siding away from the main line of argu-ment. My most important point is to insist that evenwith the most familiar forms of energy, man hasdone no creative work so ever. He has discovered,examined, measured (rather clumsily) and used,but in no case has he understood, still less ex-plained, the causes of phenomena. Sometimes hecannot even reconcile different “laws of Nature.”So we find J.W.N. Sullivan exclaiming “The scien-tific adventure may yet have to be abandoned,” andto me personally he confessed “It may yet turn outthat the mathematical approach to Reality mayhave to be supplanted by the Magical.”Now in Nature it leaps at one that Will andIntelligence are behind phenomena. My old friendand colleague Professor Buckmaster, who wrote abook on “Blood” which, he admitted, could notpossibly be understood by more than six people,told me that the ingenuity of the structure of thehuman kidney “almost frightened” him. Yet in allNature there is no trace whatever of any purposesuch as human mentality can grasp. Again, appar-ent purpose often appears to be baffled. Take oneexample. Evolution, working through thousands ofyears to establish a most subtle scheme of cross-fertilization, found, just as it was perfect, conditionsso altered that it was completely useless.The “law of cause and effect” itself took a death-blow when Hesinger showed that the old formula“If A then B” was invalid, and must be altered to “IfA, then B or C or D or E or ...”But at least we know enough phenomena tomake it certain that Will and Intelligence do existsomehow apart from any nervous and cerebralsystem of which we are aware, and that these mustbe of a type which transcends our human conscious-ness as that does that of a limpet or a lichen.It follows that somehow, somewhere, there mustbe “gods” or “Masters” — whatever name you like.And that, I suppose, is what you may call thepremise major of my syllogism.The minor, I confess, is not so apodeictic. Noone, I suppose, is going to point proudly to thepresent state of human affairs, as evidence that weare all becoming wiser and nobler every minute, aspeople did seventy years ago. (I was brought up inthe faith that Queen Victoria would never die, andthat Consols would never go below par.In fact, one may suspect that the majority of well-instructed men expect nothing but that History willrepeat itself, and our civilization go the way of allthe others whose ruins we dig up in every quarter ofthe earth.(Our own destruction may be more competethan theirs; for most of the monuments to ourintelligence, sobriety and industry are made ofsteel, and would vanish in a very few years after thesmash.)Well, if we have to wait for the calamity, and forevolution to begin all over again in a number ofcenturies — with luck! — one thing is at least quitecertain: we can do nothing about it. Any form ofactivity must be as futile and as fatuous as anyother; and the only sensible philosophy must be“Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.”Is there a conceivable alternative?Well, consider the cause of the impending col-lapse. It is quite simple: Knowledge is loose, with-out control of Will and of Intelligence. (How clearlythe Qabalah states and demonstrates this doctrine!But I musn’t be naughty; let me stick to CommonSense!)Now, these qualities in us having failed to mea-sure up to the situation of the world, one hoperemains; to get into communication with those“gods” or “masters” whose existence was demon-strated in my Premise Major and learn from Them.But is this possible?Tradition and experience unite to assert that it isso; moreover, various forms of technique for ac-complishing this are at our disposal.This is what is called The Great Work; and it isabundantly clear that no other aim is worth pursuit.So much for the argument; it will be agreedreadily enough that to put it into practice we shallneed an Alphabet, a Grammar and a Dictionary.Follow the Axioms, the Postulates, the Theorems;finally, the Experiments.And that is what all these letters are about.Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666CHAPTER LXXVIIISORE SPOTSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Three in one and one in three — it’s theAthanasian Creed in the Black Mass — eh! What’sthat you say? Oh, quite right, quite, quite right ofyou to remind me. “Definition first!”A “sore spot” is one which reacts abnormallyand violently, however gently you touch it; more,all the other bits of you give a painful jerk, howeverdisconnected they may seem. Still more, the entireSystem undergoes a spasm of apprehension; and thetotal result is that the mental as well as the physicalsystem is quite unable to grasp the situation withany accuracy, and the whole man is temporarilyengulphed in what is naturally not far from a condi-tion of insanity.(Now, Athanasius! It’s all right; the lady hasgone away to think it over.)In — shall I say “Anglo-Saxondom,” or “Teu-tonic breeds,” or “bourgeoisie, so as to includesome of the French whom when they are good arevery good indeed, but when they are bad, they arehorrid? — the presiding God/Gods of this Trinityis/are: 1. Sex, 2. Religion, 3. “Drugs;” and thegreatest of these is Sex, actually the main root ofwhich the other two are tough and twisted stems,each with its peculiar species of poisonous flowers,sometimes superficially so attractive that their nas-tiness passes for Beauty.I shall leave it to the psychoanalysts to demon-strate the reduction to Sex, merely remarking thatthough I agree with their analysis as far as it goes,I do not allow it to stop where they do.For us, Sex is the first unconscious manifestationof Chiah, the Creative Energy; and although (likeeverything else) it is shown both on the spiritual andthe physical planes, its most important forth-show-ing is on the “Magical” plane, because it actuallyproduces phenomena which partake of all these. Itis the True Will on the creative plane: “By Wisdomformed He the worlds.” So soon as its thaumaturgyis accomplished, it is, through Binah, understood asthe Logos. Thus in Sex we find every one of theprimary Correspondences of Chokmah. Being thusineffable and sacrosanct, it is (plainly enough)peculiarly liable to profanation. Being profaned, itis naturally more unspeakably nasty than any otherof the “Mysteries.” You will find a good deal on thissubject implied in Artemis Iota, attached to anotherof my letters to you.Before tackling “Sore Spots” seriously, there isafter all, one point which should be made clear as tothis Trinitarian simplification.One of the most interesting and fruitful periodsof my life was when I was involved in research as tothe meaning of Sankhara: “tendencies” may be,indeed is, a good enough translation, but it leavesone very much as deeply in the dark as before. Youremember — I hope! — that Sankhara lies betweenVinnanam, Pure Consciousness, and Sanna, Per-ception. For instance, an electric fan in motion: ahouse-fly “tends” to see the vanes as we do whenthey are still, we “tend” to see a diaphanous blur.Then, in delirium tremens, why do we tend to seepink rats rather than begonias or gazelles?We tend to see the myriad flashing colours of thehumming bird; the bird itself does not; it has noapparatus of colour-sense; to him all appears aneutral tint, varying only in degrees of brightness."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears102Such were some of the fundamental facts thatdirected the course of my research, whose resultsyou may read in “The Psychology of Hashish”, byOliver Haddo in The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 2. Thegeneral basis of this Essay is Sankhara; it showshow very striking are the analogies between, (1) theresults obtained by Mystics — this includes theEcstasy of Sexual Feeling, as you may read in prettynearly all of them, from St. Augustine to St. Teresaand the Nun Gertrude. The stages recounted by theBuddha in his psychological analyses correspondwith almost incredible accuracy. (2) The phenom-ena observed by those who use opium, hashish, andsome other “drugs”. (3) The phenomena of variousforms of insanity.The facts of this research are infuriating to thereligious mystic; and the fact of its main conclusionis liable to drive him into so delirious a frenzy ofrage as to make one reach for one’s notebook — onemore typical extreme case!Now of course very few religious persons knowthat they are mystics — already it annoys them tosuggest it! — but, whether the lady doth protest toomuch, or too little, the fact is that they are. There isno true rational meaning in religion. Consider theAthanasian Creed itself!Observe that the rationalist dare not yield amillionth of a millimetre.“First cut the Liquefaction, what comes nextBut Fichte’s clever cut at God himself? ...The first step, I am master not to take:”says Bishop Blougram, and is pinned to the corklabelled “St. Januarius”!This dilemma, consciously or subconsciously, iswell rooted in the minds of everybody who takesLife, in any one of its forms, seriously. He feels thetouch of the rapier, however shrewdly or cautiouslywielded. The salute itself is more than enough; hefeels already the thrust to his vitals.I remember sailing happily in to breakfast atCamberwell Vicarage, and saying cheerfully, inabsolute good faith: “A fine morning, Mr. Kelly!”I was astounded at the reply. The dear old gentle-man — and he really was one of the best! — halfchoked, then gobbled at me like a turkey! “You’rea very insolent young man!” Poor, tiny Aleister!How was I to know that his son had driven it wellhome that the hallmark of English stupidity wasthat the only safe topic of conversation was theweather. And so my greeting was instantly con-strued as a deliberate insult!A typical example of the irrationality of thereactions of a sufferer!Now, from this schoolboy level, let us rise andput the case a little more strongly. Let us quit theshallows of social backchat for the gloomy andhorrific abysses of a murder trial!To every man and woman that has not seen Sexas it is, faced it, mastered it — you will findelsewhere in these letters sufficient on this matter —it is his secret guilt. Imagine, then, how at anyreference however remote, the “sinner” quails, hisinmost mystery laid bare, his evil conscience hold-ing up a tarnished mirror to his deformed andhideous face! Often enough, he does not mind grossjests which admit complicity on the part of theother; but any allusion to the Truth, and his soulshrieks: I am found out! Then apoplectic Fear putson the mask of Indignation and Disgust.As for a serious discussion of anything con-cerned therewith, why, every word is a new raspingtear. The mind takes refuge in irrational and irrel-evant outbursts of feigned rage and horror.In the case of religion, the consciousness of guiltextended to cover everything from “playin’ chuch-farden on the blesséd tombstones” to “the blas-phemy against the Holy Ghost.” Against this vagueand monstrous bogey, religion is the only safe-guard, and therefore to suggest the unsoundness ofthe guarantee is to strike at the roots of all security.It is like hinting to some besotted and uxoriousoldster, that his young wife may be unfaithful. It isthe poison that Iago dripped so skillfully into thelong hairy ear of the dull Moor. So he reactsirrationally — every bush conceals a bear — nay,more likely a Boojum, or a Bunyip, or some othercreature of fear-spurred Imagination! “Monstruminforme, ingens, horrendum.” Note well the“informe.”And because the guarantee is unsound (and mustbe, or where would be the point of “Faith”?) reas-surance is in the nature of things impossible. Likethe demented rider in The Erl-King, the chase goesever wilder and wilder, until he plunges at the endinto the bottomless bog of madness and destruction.I wonder how many lunatics there are in the“bughouse” to-day — in the times of “evangelicalrevival” the number was fantastic — who got therethrough fear that they had somehow committed theaforesaid “blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.”The unknown again. The Bible does not tell us thatit is; only that it is unpardonable. Nor Grace, norFaith, nor predestination avail in the least; for allyou know, you may have committed it. Reassur-ance is impossible; no ceinture de chasteté availsto avert this danger.Again with drugs, it is the unknown which is thehorrific factor. Most people get their information onthe subject from the yellowest of yellow newspa-pers, magazines and novels. So darkly deep is theirignorance that they do not know what the wordmeans — like us so often, yes? Wide sections of theU.S.A. are scared of tea and coffee. They blenchwhen you point out that bicarbonate of soda is adrug just as much as cocaine; at the same time theyliterally shovel in the really dangerous Aspirin, tosay nothing of the thousand Patent Medicines blaredat them from every radio — as if the Press were notenough to poison the whole population! Blank-eyed, they gasp when they learn that of all classes,the first place among “drug addicts” is that of thedoctor.But the crisis in which fear becomes phobia is theunreasoning aversion, the shuddering of panic,above all, the passionate refusal to learn anythingabout “drugs,” to analyse the conditions, still less toface them; and the spasmodic invention of imagi-nary terrors, as if the real dangers were not enoughto serve as a warning.Now why? Surely because in the sub-consciouslies an instinct that in these obscure medicinesindeed lies the key of some forbidden sanctuary.There is a fascination as irrational and therefore asstrong, as the fear. Here is the point at which theylink up with sex and religion. Oh, how well nighalmighty is the urgency to him who reads those fewgreat writers who understood the subject from ex-perience: de Quincey, Ludlow, Poe and Baudelaire:into whom burn the pointed parallels between theiradventures and those of all the mystics, East andWest!The worst of this correspondence-form is thatyou are always asking simple elementary questionswhich require half a dozen treatises to answer: so,take this, with my blessing!Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally, 666P.S. One further reflection. With all these “sorespots” is closely linked the idea of cruelty. I need nottouch upon the relation of cruelty to sex; the themehas been worn threadbare. But in religion, note theBottomless Pit and the Eternal Flame; in Bud-dhism, the eighteen hot and eighteen cold Hells,with many another beneath. Hindu eschatology hascountless Hells; even pedestrian, precise Islam, andthe calculating Qabalists, each boast of Seven.Again with drugs as with insanity, we are con-fronted constantly with nameless terrors; the idea offormlessness, of infinity pervades them alike. Con-sider the man who takes every chance gesture of astranger in the street as a secret sign passed from oneof his persecutors to another; consider those whorefuse food because of the mysterious conspiracy topoison them.All sanity, which is all Science, is founded uponLimit. We must be able to cut off, to define, tomeasure. Naturally, then, their opposites, Insanityand Religion, have for their prime characteristic,the Indefinable, Incomprehensible, Immeasurable.The healing virtue of these words is this: exam-ine the sore spot, analyse it, probe it; then disinfec-tion and the Vis Medicatrix Naturae, complete thecure.I had just finished this when in comes your verypertinent “Supplementary” Postcard. “Doesn’t hy-pocrisy fit in here, somehow?” Indeed it does, mychild!Corresponding to, and the poison bacillus of,that centre of infection, is a Trinity of pure Evil, thetotal abnegation of Thelema. Well known to thepsycho-analyst: the name thereof Shame — Guilt— Fear. The Anglo-Saxon or bourgeois mentalityis soaked therein; and his remedy so far from ourexploratory-disinfection method, is to hide the gan-grened mass with dirty poultices. He has always atext of Scripture or some other authority to paint hisfoulest acts in glowing colours; and if he wants aglass of beer, he hates the stuff, but “doctor’s orders,my boy, doctor’s orders.”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears103There is really nothing new to be said abouthypocrisy; it has been analysed, exposed, lashed byevery great Artist; quite without effect. It gets worseas the socialistic idea thrives, as the individual leansever harder on the moral support of the herd.1P.P.S. Here is a very different set of reactions. Ido not quite know why I am putting it in; is it somesub-conscious attraction of my own? Anyhow, hereit is; call itLA POULE AUX RATSTime: a fine Sunday evening in June, just oneand twenty years ago. Place: Paris, just off the Placedes Tertres, overlooking the city. A large and lovelystudio, panelled in oak. Strange: it was completelybare, and so far as one could see, it had no door. Theskylights, mindful, were carefully screened withbroidered stuff. A gallery, some ten feet from thefloor, ran round one corner. Here was a buffetloaded with priceless wines and liquors of all sorts— except the “soft” — and excellent variety of allcold “snack” refreshments. One gained it by astaircase from the lower floor.By the buffet, the old butler: oh, for a painter toportray his Weariness of Evil Wisdom!Our host led us to the gallery; “we ate and drankand saw” not God also, but the lady responsible forthe heavy tread upon the stairs. A woman of theHalles Centrales, in her early forties; coarse, brutal,ugly, robust, square-set, curiously radiant withsome magnetic form of energy.I cannot describe her clothes — for lack ofmaterial. She greeted us all round with a sort ofsurly good humour. The butler took a pot of veryfar-gone Roquefort cheese, and smeared her allover. She drank to us, and clumped away down-stairs. She came out into the studio from under thegallery, braced herself and shook her mop of hair asif about to wrestle, waved to us and waited.A minute later a small trap at the far end of thestudio was smartly pulled up; in rushed a hundredstarving rats. There was a moment’s hesitation; butthe smell of the cheese was too much, and theyrushed her. She caught one in both hands, bitthrough its spine, and flung it aside.Softly repeating to myself passages from TheRevenge by the late Alfred Lord Tennyson, ofwhich the scene most powerfully reminded me.“Rat after rat, for half an hour, flung back as fast asit came.” Their courage wilted; the hunted becamethe huntress; I thought of Artemis as I sang softly tomyself, “When the hounds of spring are on winter’straces.” But she pursued; snapped the last spine,and flung it into the gallery with a yell of triumph.It was not so easy a victory as I have perhapsdescribed it, once she slipped in the slime and camedown with a thud; and at the end blood spurted frominnumerable bites.The whole scene was too much for most of themen; they literally howled liked famished wolves,and shook the balustrade until it creaked andgroaned. Presently one slipped over, let himselflightly to the floor and charged. Others followed.All had their heart’s desire. I was reminded ofSwinburn’s Laus Veneris,“I let mine eyes have all their will of theeI seal myself upon thee with my might.”As for the women, the ferocious glitter of theireyes was almost terrifying. One of them, true,would have joined the happy warriors below; butthe butler roughly pulled her back, saying in ashocked voice, “Madame est normale.” (I enjoyedthat!) Others consoled themselves by capturingthose males who were too timid to risk the jump.I swallowed a last glass of champagne, and then“je filai a l’Anglais.”Summary: a pleasant time was had by all.————Note for political economists: the woman took10,000 francs (at about 125 to the £); she took threeweeks in hospital and three weeks’ holiday betweenthe shows. She was, or had been, the mistress of aMinister with “peuple” ideas, though he was anaristocrat of very old vintage; and he helped her tohave her daughters brought up in one of the mostexclusive convents in France.CHAPTER LXXIXPROGRESSCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You will certainly have to have an india-rubbermedal for persistence: this is the nth time that youhave tried to catch me contradicting myself.Well, so I do, and must, every time I make anystatement whatever, as has been shown severaltimes in this chatty little interchange of views. Butthat is not what you mean.You say — permit me to condense your morethan somewhat tautological, pleonastic, prolix, dif-fuse and incoherent elucubrations! — that the wholeidea of the Great Order is based on faith in Progress.The doctrine of successive aeons is nothing else.The system of training is nothing else. Nothing, infact, is anything else. Maugré this and in despitethereof (you continue, with a knavish gleam in yourhither eye) I am everlastingly throwing down thewhole jerry-built castle by my cynical reflections.(Some one — Anthony Hope in a lucid moment, Ithink — says that cynicism is always a confessionof failure — “sour grapes.”) Maybe, some of thetime. But the explanation is very simple, and youought to have been able to think it out for yourself.It is a question of the “Universe of Discourse,” ofPerspective. An engineer may swear himself ultra-marine in the map all the time at the daily mistakesand mishaps that go on all the time under his nose,yet at dinner tell his friends complacently that thebridge is going up better than he ever expected.Just so, my gibes are directed at incidents; butmy heart’s truth is fixed on the grand spiral.All the same, I am glad you wrote; it is a text fora little sermon that I have had in mind for a longwhile on the conditions of progress.Number One is obviously Irregularity, Eccen-tricity, Disorder, the Revolutionary Spirit, Experi-ment.I have no patience whatever with Utopia-mon-gers. Biology simply shouts at us that the happycontented community, everyone with his own (of-ten highly specialized) job, nobody in need, nobodyin danger, is necessarily stagnant. Termites andother ants, bees, beavers; these and many anotherhave produced perfect systems. What is the firstcharacteristic? Stupidity. “Where there is no vision,the people shall perish.” What is the Fighter Ter-mite to do, after he has been blocked out of hishome? None of these communities possess anyresource at all against any unforeseen unfavourablechange of circumstance. (We look rather like thatjust now at the end of 1944 e.v.) Nor does anyoneof them show any achievement; having got to theend of their biological tether, they stay put, withoutan aim, an idea, an effort. The leech, an insufferablepest in its belt — it has killed off tiger, rhinoceros,anything with a nostril! — is the curse of ourmilitary station at Lebong — or was when I wasthere. At Darjeeling, a few hundred feet higher,devil a one! They have no one to think: now howcan we flourish up higher? Those old forlorn-hopeMiss-Sahibs — how wide are their nostrils! Then1 Here is a most pertinent story from I Write as IPlease by my old friend, Walter Duranty. It showshow the sentimental point of view blinds its addictsto the most obvious facts.“My friend Freddy Lyon ... told me a story ... ofthe Volga Famine. Some A.R.A. ‘higher-ups’ fromNew York were making a tour of inspection ...Among them was a worthy but sentimental citizenwho gushed about the unhappy Russians and thepoor little starving children and what a privilege itwas for Mr. Lyon to be doing this noble work forhumanity and so on and so forth until Lyon said hewas ready to choke him.... After lunch the visitorssuggested they would like to visit the cemetary. Itwas, said Freddy, a horrid sight, nude, dead bodiespiled up ten high like faggots, because the popula-tion was so destitute that every stitch of clothingwas needed for the living. The visitors were sick-ened by what they saw, and even the gushing onewas silent as they walked back to the cemetery gate.Suddenly he caught Freddy by the arm. ‘Lookthere!’ he said, ‘Is not that something to restore ourfaith in the goodness of God in the midst of all thesehorrors?’ He pointed to a big woolly dog lyingasleep on a grave with his head between his paws,and continued impressively. ‘Faithful unto deathand beyond. I have often heard of a dog refusing tobe comforted when his master died, lying desolateon his grave, but I never thought to see such a thingmyself.’ That was too much for Freddy Lyon.‘Yes,’ he said cruelly, ‘but look at the dog’s pawsand muzzle’ — they were stiff with clotted blood —‘he’s not mourning his master, he’s sleeping off ameal.’“‘At which point,’ Lyon concluded his storywith gusto, ‘that talkative guy did the opposite ofsleeping off his lunch in a very thorough manner,and there wasn’t another peep out of him until weput him on the train.’”"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears104— how?Consider for a moment our own Empire. Howdid that spread all over the planet? It was theimaginative logic, the audacity, the adroit adapt-ability, of the Adventurer that blasted the road.The sunny Socialist smiles his superior smile,and condescends to instruct us. That was an unfor-tunate, though perhaps sometimes necessary, stagein the perfection of Society.Something in that. But there are other kinds ofAdventure. My imagination can set no limit to thepossibilities of Science, or of Art: our own GreatWork is evidence of that.Last Sunday I looked through an interview withthe least brain-bound of these ruminators — poorold, dear old G. for gaga Bernard Shaw.The artist, said he, was a special case. He shouldhave a nice easy job, three or four hours a day, andbe free for the rest of it to devote himself to his Art.I wonder how much of his own work would haveseen daylight if he had been tied to some silly robotsoul-killing, nerve-crushing, mind-infuriating rou-tine job for even one half-hour a day! When I am ona piece of work, I grudge the time for eating; andwhen it’s done, I need the absolute relaxation ofleisured luxury.Then what of the Work itself? If the Idea be trulynew and important, God help it! The whole class ofmen affected jump on it with one accord, if haplythey may crush it in the germ. Read a little of theHistory of Medicine! Any man who shows a sign ofindependent thought is watched, is thwarted. Hepersists and is threatened and bullied. He persists;every engine of oppression is set in motion againsthim. Then something snaps; either they succeed inkilling him (Ross, who defeated malaria, nearlystarved to death) or they make him a baronet, or apeer, or make his death a Day of National Mourn-ing, and bury him in the Pantheon — aux grandshommes la patrie reconnaissante — like Pasteurafter one of the most infamous campaigns of perse-cution in history.Then, of course, entertainment must be stan-dardized. It costs money to produce; and who willproduce anything which can only appeal to the veryfew — to none at all, soon, if these swine have theirway. So, if it is new, is original, is worth one’swhile, it must be ignored. Besides, being new andincomprehensible to the great Us, it may be danger-ous, and must be suppressed.In all literature I know no pages so terrifying asthose in Louis Marlow’s Mr. Amberthwaite, whichdescribe his dream. I wish I could quote it, withSinai as the orchestra; never mind, read it again.And we are on the way — far on the way — to That!Now, obviously, the robot education, robot text-books stuffed in by robot teachers, will have donewonders with the help of the bovine well-being toproduce a race of robot boys.All independence, all imagination, all spirit ofAdventure, will have been ground down and rolledout smooth by this ghastly engine. But — Nature isnot so easily beaten; a few boys and girls willsomehow escape, and either by instinct or by obser-vation, have the sense to keep secret. Now whatevertheir own peculiar genius may select as their line,they will realise that nothing is possible in any waywhile the accursed system stands. Their first duty isRevolt. And presently some one will come alongwith the wit and the will and the weapon, and blowthe whole most damnable bag of tricks sky-high.We had better busy ourselves about this while itis still possible to get back to freedom withoutuniversal bloodshed.“All right, Master, you win! Now give us yourown idea of Utopia.”An Utopia to end Utopias? Very good, so I will.Education, to begin with; well, you’ve had all thatin another letter. The main thing to remember is thatI want every individual taught as such, according tohis own special qualities. Then, teach them bothsides of every question: history, for example, as theplay of economic forces, also, as due to the interven-tion of Divine Providence, or of “Sports” of genius:and so for the rest. Train them to doubt — and todare!Then, somehow, as large a number of the mostpromising rebels should be selected to lead a life ofluxury and leisure. Let every country, by dint ofhonouring its old traditions, be as different as pos-sible from every other. Restore the “Grand tour,” orrather, the roving Englishman of the NineteenthCentury. Entrust them with the secrets of discipline,of authority, of power. Hardship and danger in fullmeasure; and responsibility.A great deal of such material will be as disgust-ingly wasted as it has been in the past; and there willbe much abuse of privilege. But this must be al-lowed and allowed for; no very great harm willresult, as the weak and vicious will weed them-selves out.The pure gold will repay us ten thousandfold.You ask examples? With us, the Elizabethan andthe Victorian periods stand out. What is most wantedis opportunity and reward. Under Victoria therewas some — taste the late Samuel Smiles Esquire,D.D. (wasn’t he?) — but not enough, and Industri-alism, the mother and nurse of Socialism, wasdestroying the soul of the people.In my not very maternal remarks on Mother-love, was included the substance of the one wisesaying of my pet American lunatic, “You can’t getpast their biology.” This is so true, and so disheart-ening, that it arouses me to combat. Must we forever be bound to the inconvenient habit of cows andcabbages? I pick up the glove.Isn’t it Aldous Huxley who says somewhere thatsome species or other can never develop higherpowers because its brain is shut in by its carapace?I thought this too, long ago; and I went into intermi-nable conferences with my old friend, ProfessorBuckmaster; I wanted to extend brain surgery toproduce the phenomena of Yoga. Also, I wonderedwhat would happened if we wedged apart the sec-tions of the cranium at, or shortly after, birth, so asto prevent them closing and giving the brain achance to grow.I suspect, by the way, that something of the sortis done in China and Bruma; but the object is merelyto produce megalocephalic idiots as a valuableaddition to the financial resources of the family.I thought that modern physiology, with its greatrecent advances in knowledge of the specializedfunctions of the brain, might quite possibly succeedin producing genius.You would not surprise me if you told me thatsomething of the sort is being tried in Russia, withits Communism modelled so closely on that of Ivanthe Terrible at this moment, war or no war! Quivivra verra.Anyhow, all that I really want you to get intoyour head “sunning over with little curls” is thatProgress demands Anarchy tempered by CommonSense, and that the most formidable obstacle is thisBiology.The experience of the Magician and the Yogidoes suggest that there is room in the human brainas at present constituted for almost limitless expan-sion. At least our system of Training is more imme-diately practical than digging up our CorporaQuadragemina and planting them in a Monkey’sMedulla just to see what will come of it.

Presently, he being (so she said) awayon a business trip, the tradesmen complained thatshe seemed to need very little pabulum. Somehow,people got suspicious, and sure enough, when theybroke in, they found that she had pickled him! Thisstory is founded on fact; damn it, why did the MShave to get lost?Even suicide is not a “dead bird.” I knew acreature once — careless observers often mistookhim of a man — who tried three times, pistol, ropeand poison. Something always went wrong. (Likethe Babbacombe murderer, who went to the scaf-fold three times, and lived to a green old age!)Finally he did poison himself, by accident, when hehad no intention whatever of doing anything of thesort.Where’s the Book of Lies? Ah, here we are. “Itis chance, and chance only, that rules the Universe;therefore, and therefore only, life is good.”Then, is it mere fatuity and folly to make plans?Was not the IXth Atu, the Hermit, also at one timecalled “Prudence?” Of course. Abstract philosophyrarely coincides with common-sense. We shouldplan as carefully as we can; but we should alwaysallow a margin for every conceivable accident.Nor should we trust to luck, like England, whenshe goes to war. Bret Harte has an admirable story“The Outcasts of Poker Flat” in which the “badman,” the crooked gambler, gives his life for thesafety of the rest of his party, and winds up all withthe remark: “Life isn’t in having the luck of thecards, but in playing a poor hand well.”Yes, I daresay, all very fine; but what youwanted to know was about the propriety of takingrisks in Magick.So off we go.Risks, we have agreed, are always unavoidable;but we can calculate them. The best and wisest manI ever knew, the late Oscar Eckenstein, was onceoffered a job which gave him a fifty percent chanceof survival. He calmly sat down, worked out his“expectation of life,” his “expectation of income,”and the Lord alone knows what other factors. Itcame out that the pay offered was a thousandpounds or so less than he might expect normally, sohe turned down the offer. Not a trace of sentiment ofany kind!Now let us consider an “A.B. case.” JohnJeremiah Jenkins sees a short cut to his performanceof the Great Work. To seize this opportunity, hemust give up a steady job with good prospects andas near safety as is possible in the nature of things,for a slim chance of a career in the most insecure ofall the professions.He can do it; that is at the mercy of his Will; buthe risks something very close to the utter wreck andruin of his future. Only a miracle can bring himthrough. Just so! But is he not neglecting one factorin his problem? Who put this romantically insaneopportunity in his way? The Gods: it must be, sincehe is performing the Great Work. Very well then! Itis up to Them to watch: “he shall give his angelscharge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways: in theirhands they shall bear thee up lest thou dash thy footagainst a stone.”What’s more, he must leave it at that; he must notinsult Them by constantly looking out for extrasafeguards, or “hedging.” (You remember the Majorin The Suicide Club when Prince Florizel waspicking seconds for a duel? “In all my life I never somuch as hedged a bet.”) You must give Themplenty of opportunity to show Their approval bysteering you miraculously through one crisis afteranother.This course of conduct may seem to you a littlelike the “Act of Truth” but this is only superficiallythe case. The latter is usually an emergency mea-sure, and either not particularly serious or as seri-ous as anything can be. But what I have said aboveamounts really to a regular Rule of Life.Need I add that the prime and essential requisitein all this Work is that you so devote yourself to, andidentify yourself with, the Gods, that there is neverany doubt in your mind as to what They intend youto do?Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally. 666CHAPTER LXXXIMETHOD OF TRAININGCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.In your well-worn copy of the Bagh-i-muattaryou have no doubt triply underlined that greatverse:“Who hath the How is careless of the Why,”which shows how cunning I was to induce you toput all your “why” questions first.But now let us get down to orichalc taques, asthe Norman peasant might say.The first and absolutely essential task for theAspirant is to write his Magical Record.You know some elementary Mechanics — theTriangle of Forces, and all that. Well, if we have abody acted on by two equal forces, one pulling itEast, the other South, it will tend to move in a South-Easterly direction. But if the “south” force is (say)twice as strong, it will move south of South-East.Now you, sitting in your study reading this letter,got there and were compelled to do that, as the resultof the impact upon you of countless quintillions offorces of every kind. I don’t expect you to discoverall these and calculate and report them; but I wantyou to set down all the main currents. For so youshould be able to get some sort of answer to thequestion “Where do we go from here, boys?”I am not a guesser; and I cannot judge you, oradvise you, or help you, unless and until I know thefacts as thoroughly as you are able to allow me todo.The construction of this Record is, incidentally,the first step in the practice called Sammasati, andleads to the acquisition of the Magical Memory —the memory of your previous incarnations. So thereis another reason, terrifically cogent, for writingthis Magical Record as clearly and as fully as youcan.This best explanation of how to set about the taskis given in Liber Thisharb.Some of this sounds rather advanced and techni-cal; but it ought to give you the general idea. Youshould begin with your parents and the familytraditions; the circumstances of your birth and edu-cation; your social position; your financial situa-tion; your physique, health, illnesses; your vitasexualis; your hobbies and amusements; what youare good at, what not; how you came to be interestedin the Great Work; what (if you have been on falsetrails, Toshophists, Antroposophagists, shamRosicrucians, etc.) has been “your previous condi-tion of servitude;” how you found me, and decidedto enlist my aid.That, by itself, helps you to understand yourself,and me to understand you.From that point the keeping of the Record isquite easy. All you have to do is to put down whatpractices you mean to begin, how you get on withthem from day to day, and (at intervals) what I haveto say about your progress.Remember always that we have no use for piety,for vague chatter, for guesswork; we are as strictlyscientific as biologists or chemists. We ban emotionfrom the start; we demand perception; and (as youwill see later on) even perception is not acceptableuntil we have made sure of its bases by a study ofwhat we call the “tendencies.”That is all about the Magical Record; the way isnow clear to set forth our Method. This is two-fold.(1) Yoga, introversion, (2) Magick, extroversion.(These are rough but useful connotations.) The twoseem, at first glance, to be opposed; but, when youhave advanced a little in both, you find that theconcentration learnt in Yoga is of immense use inattaining the mental powers necessary in Magick;on the other hand, the discipline of Magick is of thegreatest service in Yoga.Let me remark, by the way, that to my mind oneof the greatest beauties, and most encouragingconfirmations of the validity of our system, is thematchless harmony of its elements. Always, whenwe pursue any one path to its end, we find that it hasbecome one with some other path which at theoutset appeared utterly irreconcilable with it.(“Write down that the tearing apart is the crush-ing together” comes from an actual experience. SeeLiber 418, The Vision and the Voice, which teemswith similar passages, and is itself an outstandingexample of the unity of the Yogic and the Magicalmethods.)To study Yoga, you have my Book 4 Part I andmy Eight Lectures on Yoga. Then there isVivekananda’s Raja Yoga and several little-knownHindu writers; these latter are very practical andtechnical, but one really needs to be a Hindu tomake much use of them. The former is very goodindeed, if you remember to switch off when he slidesinto sloppiness, which luckily is not often.To study Magick: Book 4, Parts II, III (Magick"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears106in Theory and Practice) and IV (The Equinox ofthe Gods.) Add The Book of Thoth and the youare: —“Being furnished with complete armour andarmed, he is similar to the goddess.”Of other writers, you have The Book of theSacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, and any ofthe works of Eliphaz Lévi. But that’s all.But — I suppose you knew all this long ago. Itmay help if I try to expound the essence of these twoMethods in very simple language, and very differ-ent language. By contrast and comparison, youshould be able, without reading even one of allthose books, to get a perfectly clear idea in perspec-tive of “what’s coming to you!”The process of analysing, developing and con-trolling the mind is the essence of all Yoga prac-tices.Magick explores and learns to control thoseregions of Nature which lie beyond the objects ofsense. Reaching the highest parts of these regions,called the divine, one proceeds by the exaltation (?= intoxication? Yes, of a sublime sort) of the con-sciousness to identify oneself with those “celestial”Beings.In Yoga, various practices prevent the body andits functions from interrupting the mental process.Then, one inhibits that process itself: the stilling of“thoughts” allows one to become aware of mentalfunctions beyond the intellectual; these functionshave their own peculiar properties and powers.Each sheath, as one goes deeper, is discarded as“unreal;” finally one apprehends that Nothing whichis the only true and real form of existence. (But thenit does not exist: in these regions of thought wordsalways become nightmares of self-contradiction.This is as it should be.)In Magick, on the contrary, one passes throughthe veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, butin another sense, becomes “unreal” by comparisonas one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body(instrument is a better term) called the Body ofLight; this one develops and controls; it gains newpowers as one progresses, usually by means of whatis called “initiation:” finally, one carries on almostone’s whole life in this Body of Light, and achievesin its own way the mastery of the Universe.The first step in Yoga is “Keep still.”The first step in Magick is “Travel beyond theworld of the senses.”There, that is the whole business in a nutshell,and expressed so that anyone, however ignorant ofthe subject, may grasp the essentials (I hope).Love is the law, love under will.Yours fraternally. 666CHAPTER LXXXIIEPISTOLA PENULTIMA: THE TWOWAYS TO REALITYCara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.How very sensible of you, though I admit some-what exacting!You write — Will you tell me exactly why Ishould devote so much of my valuable time tosubjects like Magick and Yoga.That is all very well. But you ask me to put it insyllogistic form. I have no doubt this can be done,though the task seems somewhat complicated. Ithink I will leave it to you to construct your seriesof syllogisms yourself from the arguments of thisletter.In your main question the operative word is“valuable.” Why, I ask, in my turn, should youconsider your time valuable? It certainly is notvaluable unless the universe has a meaning, andwhat is more, unless you know what that meaningis — at least roughly — it is millions to one that youwill find yourself barking up the wrong tree.First of all let us consider this question of themeaning of the universe. It is its own evidence todesign, and that design intelligent design. There isno question of any moral significance — “oneman’s meat is another man’s poison” and so on. Butthere can be no possible doubt about the existenceof some kind of intelligence, and that kind is farsuperior to anything of which we know as human.How then are we to explore, and finally tointerpret this intelligence?It seems to me that there are two ways and onlytwo. Imagine for a moment that you are an orphanin the charge of a guardian, inconceivably learnedfrom your point of view. Suppose therefore that youare puzzled by some problem suitable to yourchildish nature, your obvious and most simple wayis to approach your guardian and ask him to en-lighten you. It is clearly part of his function asguardian to do his best to help you. Very good, thatis the first method, and a close parallel with what weunderstand by the word Magick. We are botheredby some difficulty about one of the elements — sayFire — it is therefore natural to evoke a Salamanderto instruct you on the difficult point. But you mustremember that your Holy Guardian Angel is notonly far more fully instructed than yourself onevery point that you can conceive, but you may goso far as to say that it is definitely his work, or partof his work; remembering always that he inhabits asphere or plane which is entirely different fromanything of which you are normally aware.To attain to the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel is consequently withoutdoubt by far the simplest way by which you canyourself approach that higher order of being.That, then, is a clearly intelligible method ofprocedure. We call it Magick.It is of course possible to strengthen the linkbetween him and yourself so that in course of timeyou become capable of moving and, generally speak-ing, operating on that plane which is his naturalhabitat.There is however one other way, and one only, asfar as I can see, of reaching this state. It is at leasttheoretically possible to exalt the whole of yourown consciousness until it becomes as free to moveon that exalted plane as it is for him. You shouldnote, by the way, that in this case the postulation ofanother being is not necessary. There is no way ofrefuting the solipsism if you feel like that. Person-ally I cannot accede to its axiom. The evidence foran external universe appears to me perfectly ad-equate.Still there is no extra charge for thinking on thoselines if you so wish.I have paid a great deal of attention in the courseof my life to the method of exalting the humanconsciousness in this way; and it is really quitelegitimate to identify my teaching with that of theYogis.I must however point out that in the course of myinstruction I have given continual warnings as tothe dangers of this line of research. For one thingthere is no means of checking your results in theordinary scientific sense. It is always perfectly easyto find a subjective explanation of any phenom-enon; and when one considers that the greatest of allthe dangers in any line of research arise fromegocentric vanity, I do not think I have exceeded myduty in anything that I have said to deter studentsfrom undertaking so dangerous a course as Yoga.It is, of course, much safer if you are in a positionto pursue in the Indian Jungles, provided that yourhealth will stand the climate and also, I must say,unless you have a really sound teacher on whomyou can safely rely. But then, if we once introducea teacher, why not go to the Fountain-head andpress towards the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel?In any case your Indian teacher will ultimatelydirect you to seek guidance from that source, so itseems to me that you have gone to a great deal ofextra trouble and incurred a great deal of unneces-sary danger by not leaving yourself in the first placein the hands of the Holy Guardian Angel.In any case there are the two methods whichstand as alternatives. I do not know of any third onewhich can be of any use whatever. Logically, sinceyou have asked me to be logical, there is certainlyno third way; there is the external way of Magick,and the internal way of Yoga: there you have youralternatives, and there they cease.Love is the law, love under will.CHAPTER LXXXIIIEPISTOLA ULTIMACara Soror,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The suggestion in your last letter to me is a verysensible one. I do think that people in general wouldlike to get some idea of my system of training as awhole, in a comprehensive form. In the past therehas been far too much of referring them to one quiteunprocurable document and then to another whichprobably has not even been written. No wonder thatthey go away sorrowful. So I am going to put in asthe last of this series of Letters an account, as clearand as succinct as the gods enable me to do, of whatthey may expect to have to do to get good marksfrom Grandfather. Of course I shall not be able toavoid altogether reference to the various officialdocuments, but I will make these as short and as few"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears107as I can.First of all then, my system can be divided intotwo parts. Apparently diametrically opposed, but atthe end converging, the one helping the other untilthe final method of progress partakes equally ofboth elements.For convenience I shall call the first methodMagick, and the second method Yoga. The opposi-tion between these is very plain for the direction ofMagick is wholly outward, that of Yoga whollyinward.I will deal first then with Magick. How do Idefine this word?Magick is the science and art of causing changeto occur in accordance with the will. (Obviouslythen all scientific methods can be included in thisterm.)I have to assume in all that follows that you havethoroughly understood the doctrine of 0 = 2.All Magical action may be classed as under theformula of progression from the “0” to the “2”; inother words it is complete extraversion.The aspiring Magician only analyses himself forthe purpose of finding new worlds to conquer. Hisfirst objective is the astral plane; its discovery, theclassification of its tenants, and their control.All his early practises therefore are devoted toexploring the worlds which surround (if you choose,or if you prefer — are contained in) the object ofsense. If there is a tree in your garden, you want tofind out whether that tree is occupied by a nymph ora nat, and if so, what are they like? How do they act?How can you make them useful to your purpose? Itis in fact the ordinary every-day scientific method ofexploration. The only difference is that in the courseof one’s experiments one becomes aware of parts ofthe nature of the object to be examined which aresubtler and perhaps more powerful, nearer to real-ity, than those which ordinary scientific examina-tion discloses. You will notice, however, that thequalities above-mentioned are identical. The chemi-cal elements which go to form a tree are subtler,more powerful and nearer to reality than the tree asit is presented to the senses.Finally, we reach the conception of molecules,atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons and so on, andnobody needs telling nowadays what unfathomablepotencies lie hidden in the atom.When I say subtler, moreover, I mean it. Theanalysis of matter has resulted in the extraordinarydiscovery that the definition of matter as given bythe physicist of to-day is very similar indeed to thedefinition of spirit as stated by the mystics of themiddle ages.Henry Poincaré has well pointed out that theresults of scientific experiment as we know them,are altogether in their way dependant on the exist-ence of our own peculiar natures. If, for example,we had no sense to use in our exploration but that ofhearing, we should have worked out a classificationof trees entirely different from that which we nowpossess. We should have taught our students how todistinguish the sounds made by an oak and an elmrespectively in a storm; the differences in the rus-tling of various kinds of grass, and so on.Similarly the results of our magical experimentsare naturally and necessarily very distinct fromthose which we obtain by ordinary methods. Tobegin with we must build up an apparatus of exami-nation, and this we do by discovering and develop-ing qualities in our own sturcture which are suitablefor the purpose.The first step is the separation of (what we call,for convenience) the astral body from the physicalbody. As our experiments proceed, we find that ourastral body itself can be divided into grosser andsubtler components. In this way we become awareof the existence of what we call, for convenience,the Holy Guardian Angel, and the more we realisethe implications of the theory of the existence ofsuch a being, the clearer it becomes that our su-preme task is to put ourselves into intimate commu-nication with him.For one thing, we shall find that in the object ofsense which we examine there are elements whichresist our examination. We must raise ourselves toa plane in which we obtain complete control ofsuch.It is found furthermore in the course of experi-ment that a great many of the apparent differencesin our study conceal a hidden unity, and vice versa.Like every other science, both the subject and theobject of the work increase as that work proceeds.Take a simple matter like Mathematics as ouranalogy. The schoolboy struggling with the Rule ofThree is a very rudimentary image of the advancedmathematician working on the differential calcu-lus.From the above it ought to be clear to you that Ihave said all that really needs to be said in explain-ing the whole of Magick as the science and art ofextending, first in oneself, one’s own faculties,secondly in external nature their hidden character-istics.Before closing the subject entirely I think it wellto point out that there are quite a number of worldson which a good deal of work remains to be done.In particular I cannot refrain from mentioning thework of Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly. My ownwork on this subject has been so elaborate andextensive that I shall never sufficiently regret that Inever had an opportunity of completing it, but Ishould like to emphasize that the obtaining of abook like Liber 418 is in itself so outstanding anachievement that it should serve as an encourage-ment to all Magicians.In the case of many worlds, in particular that ofAbra Melin, of the greater and lesser Keys ofSolomon, of Pietro di Abano, of Cornelius Agrippa,while we have perfectly adequate information as tothe methods we have very meagre examples of theresults, especially so far as refers to the technicalside of the work.I must conclude with a warning. So many ofthese branches of magick are so fascinating that anyone of them is liable to take hold of the Magician bythe short hair and upset his balance completely. Itshould never be forgotten for a single moment thatthe central and essential work of the Magicians isthe attainment of the Knowledge and Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achievedthis he must of course be left entirely in the hands ofthat Angel, who can be invariably and inevitablyrelied upon to lead him to the further great step —crossing of the abyss and the attainment of the gradeof Master of the Temple.Anything apart from this course is a side issueand unless so regarded may lead to the completeruin of the whole work of the Magician.IIThe second part of this letter, which appears to beexpanding into a sort of essay, will be devoted toYoga. You will have noticed that the grade ofMaster of the Temple is itself intimately associatedwith Yoga. It is when one reaches this plane that theapparently contradictory forms of the Great Work,Magick and Yoga, begin to converge, though evenearlier in the course of the work it must have beennoticed that achievements in Yoga have been ofgreat assistance to magical operations, and thatmany of the mental states necessary to the develop-ment of the Magician are identical with those at-tained in the course of the strictly technical Yogicoperations.The literature necessary to the study of Magickis somewhat variegated; there are quite a number ofclassics on the subject and though it would be easyenough for me to draw up a list of not more thanhalf-a dozen which I consider really essential, theremay be as many as an hundred which in the more orless subsidiary forms are useful to the magician.With Yoga the case is very different indeed. Theliterature on the subject is so enormous and con-tains so vast a number of more or less secret docu-ments which circulate from hand to hand, that Ibelieve that the best advice I can give anyone is tocut one’s cloth very sparingly if one is to make afitting suit. I do not think I am going too far if I saythat Part I of Book 4 and my Eight Lectures onYoga form an absolutely sufficient guide to theuseful practise of the subject; anything else is al-most certain to operate as a distraction.Swami Vivekananda summarised Yoga underfour headings, and I do not think that one canimprove on that classification. His four are: Gnana,Raja, Bhakti and Hatha, and comprise all divisionsthat it is desirable to make. As soon as one begins toadd such sections as Mantra Yoga, you are addingto without enriching the classification, and onceyou begin where are you to stop? But I honestlybelieve that the excessive simplication given inEight Lectures on Yoga is a practical advantage.Any given type of Yoga is the work of a lifetime andfor that reason alone it is desirable to confineoneself from the beginning to an absolutely simpleprogramme.What then is the difference between Yoga andMagick? Magick is extraverson, the discovery ofand subsequently the classification of and finally"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears108the control of new worlds on new planes. So far asit concerns the development of the mind its objectand method are perfectly simple. What is wanted isexaltation. The aim is to identify oneself with thehighest essence of whatever world is under consid-eration.With Yoga you might easily slip into saying thatit was identical, with the exception that the newworlds are from the start recognised as alreadyexisting within the human cosmos, but nobody isasked to extend these worlds in any way; on thecontrary the object is to analyse ever more mi-nutely, and the control to which one approaches isnot external but internal. At all times one is concen-trated on the idea of simplication. The recognitionof any new idea or form of ideas, is invariably thesignal for its rejection: “not that, not that.”One might simplify this explanation by con-structing some sort of apophthegm; Magick is thejourney from 0 to 2, Yoga from 2 to 0. It is a verygood rule for the Yogi to keep this mind constantlyfixed on the fact that any idea soever is false. Thereis actually a Hindu proverb “That which can bethought is not true.” Consequently the existence ofany idea in the mind is an immediate refutation ofit, but equally the contraries as well as contradic-tory of that idea are false, and the result of this is toknock the second law of formal logic to pieces.One puts up a sort of sorites — A is B, thereforeA is not B; therefore not A is not B; and all thesecontrary statements are equally false, but in order torealise this fact they must themselves be announcedby the mind as ecstatic discoveries of truth.The result of all this naturally is that the mindvery rapidly becomes a discredited instrument, andone attains to a totally different and much moreexalted type of mind, and the same destructivecriticism which one applied to the original con-sciousness applies equally to this higher conscious-ness, and one gets to one higher still which is againdestroyed. In The Equinox, Vol. I there is an essaycalled “The Soldier and the Hunchback: ! and ?” InLiber Aleph too there are several chapters aboutattainment by what is called the Method of Ladders.All these operations are equally valid and equallyinvalid, and the result of this is that the wholesubject of Yoga leads to constantly increasing con-fusion. The fineness of the analytical instrumentseems to defeat its own purpose and it is perhapsbecause of that confussion that I have always felt inmy deepest consciousness that the method of Mag-ick is on the whole less dangerous than that of Yoga.This is particularly the case when discussing thesematters with a Western mind.It is true that our 0 = 2 formula remains infinitelyuseful because it is of such potency in destroying thescepticism which so often disheartens one, espe-cially in the highest realms of Magick. The criti-cism which the enemy directs against your sun-kissed tower is thrown back from those glitteringwalls, You accept the criticism at the same time asyou dismiss it with a laugh.On the whole therefore I continue to regard thediscipline of Yoga as its most valuable feature. Theresults attained by pushing Yoga to its end are ontheir own showing worthless, whereas the attain-ment of Magick, however lofty, is still immune toall criticism and at every period of its constructionhas been perfectly sympathetic with the normalconsciousness of man.On this view indeed, one might laughingly re-mark that Yoga at its best is a smoke-screen thrownout by a battleship in self-protection.It may seem to you strange as you read this letterto have watched how the pendulum has swungalways a little more and more towards the side ofMagick. I do not know why this should have been,but that it is so I have no doubt whatever. I see quiteclearly now that Yoga from its very first beginningsis liable to lead the mind away into a condition ofmuddle, and though for each such state Yoga itselfprovides the necessary cure, may not one ask one-self if it is really wise to begin one’s work withaxioms and postulates which are inherently danger-ous. The whole controversy might be expressed asa differential equation. Their curves become iden-tical only at infinity, and there is no doubt, at leastto my mind, that the curve of Magick follows a morepleasant track than that of Yoga.To take one point alone: it is evidently moresatisfactory to have one’s malignant demons exter-nal to oneself.As I have written it has become clearer to me thatthis is the case, but I should not like you to arisefrom its perusal with any idea that I have been insome way derogating Yoga. I would not like tomaintain that it is necessary to Magick becausethere have been many very great magicians whoknew nothing at all of the subject but I am just asstrongly convinced as I was before that the practiceof Yoga in itself is of enormous assistance to theMagician in his more intelligible path, only addingthat he should beware lest the logical antinomiesinherent in Yoga divert him from or discourage himin his simple path.Love is the law, love under will.Yours, 666L"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Magick Without Tears109FOREWORD................................................... 1INTRODUCTION........................................... 1LETTERS WRITTEN BY MASTERTHERION TO A STUDENT ...................... 11 WHAT IS MAGICK? .................................... 72 THE NECESSITY OF MAGICK FOR ALL 93 HIEROGLYPHICS: LIFE AND LANGUAGENECESSARILY SYMBOLIC................... 104 THE QABALAH, THE BEST TRAININGFOR MEMORY........................................ 115 THE UNIVERSE.
