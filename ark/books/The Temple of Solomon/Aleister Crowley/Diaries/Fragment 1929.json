However, a copy has been finally found and is here presented and published for the first time. The analysis of the diary allows us to have a fuller knowledge of Crowley’s movements and activities while in Portugal and especially of his meetings with Fernando Pessoa. It also clarifies some aspects of the famous Boca do Inferno suicide stunt in which Pessoa was directly involved and brings some new clues concerning a possible initiation of Pessoa in one of Crowley’s magical orders. Palavras-chave Fernando Pessoa, Aleister Crowley, Hanni Jaeger, Raul Leal, Kenneth Grant, Yorke Collection, Gerald Yorke, Colecção “Magick”, caso da Boca do Inferno Resumo O diário de Aleister Crowley referente ao período da sua viagem a Portugal e ao seu encontro com Fernando Pessoa considerava-se, há muito tempo, perdido ou inacessível. Porém, uma cópia do mesmo foi finalmente localizada e é aqui apresentada e publicada pela primeira vez. A análise do diário permite-nos ter um conhecimento mais completo dos movimentos e das actividades de Crowley aquando da sua estadia em Portugal e, nomeadamente, do seu encontro com Fernando Pessoa. Também esclarece certos aspectos da famosa encenação do suicídio de Crowley na Boca do Inferno, encenação na qual Pessoa esteve directamente envolvido, e fornece algumas novas pistas relativas a possível iniciação de Pessoa numa das ordens mágicas de Crowley.   * Universiteit van Amsterdam. 1 I would like to thank Martin P.

A bibliography of publications focusing on it would now include quite a few titles.2 And it is not only scholars who have been intrigued by this strange encounter. For example, no less than four novels have presented a fictionalized account of the events (Dell’Aira, 1993; Soares, 2007; Rico Gongora, 2009; Salgueiro, 2012), and it was only inevitable that a film would sooner or later follow them.3 Most Crowley biographers have also devoted some space to the affair (Symonds, 1989: 445-447, 452-456; Kaczynski, 2010: 449-452; Sutin, 2000: 354-355).4 One of the biggest problems in the study of this episode and its implications, is that very rarely researchers have tried to compare data and findings coming from the archives of both authors at the same time. Specialists of Pessoa would rely mostly on the documents preserved in Pessoa’s Archive in Lisbon, whereas Crowley specialists would rely mostly on the documents preserved in the Yorke Collection (YC) at the Warburg Institute in London.5 In most cases they would ignore, or pretend to ignore, even the existence of other archives. The most glaring example of this strange virtual barrier between Pessoa’s and Crowley’s archives can be seen in the publication, by Miguel Roza, of the documents from the Pessoa “Magick” Collection (Pessoa and Crowley, 2001; Pessoa and Crowley, 2010).6 Roza’s two editions of the papers from this collection can be considered as a real turning point in the study of the Crowley-Pessoa affair, because the collection includes a large number of documents, originally collected and preserved by Pessoa himself, that are essential for understanding what happened before, during, and after the encounter of the two men. However, apart from being regrettably amateurish, both editions fail to even mention documents from the Yorke Collection that were closely related to those included in the Magick Collection and that had already been published even in Portugal (Belém, 1995). In some of my previous works, I have tried to bridge this research gap, by studying and comparing documents coming from various collections, based both   2 See references in Pasi, 2006, 193-234. See also the bibliography in Dix, 2009. 3 The release of a docudrama film based on the Crowley-Pessoa encounter, directed by António Cunha and titled “Hino a Pã. O último Sortilégio,” has been announced for November 2012. 4 Both because Symonds was the only biographer who had access to Crowley’s diary for that period, and because of lack of familiarity with Portuguese sources, most Crowley biographers just content themselves with following more or less closely Symonds’s version of the events, without really bringing any new details in. 5 It should be noted that the Yorke Collection is not the only collection of Crowley papers, but is the one that preserves most of the material related to Crowley’s Portuguese trip and his relationship with Pessoa. 6 “Miguel Roza” is the pseudonym of Pessoa’s nephew Luis Miguel Rosa Dias. See also the article by Patricio Ferrari and myself in the present issue of Pessoa Plural (Pasi and Ferrari, 2012), where some aspects of the history of the Magick Collection, its contents, and Roza’s editions are discussed."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 255 on Pessoa’s and Crowley’s personal papers (Pasi, 1999 and 2006; Pasi, 2001). The present contribution goes in the same direction and intends to add a most important piece to the knowledge we have of the affair. One of the puzzling aspects of research on Crowley’s papers from the Yorke Collection was the unavailability of certain documents concerning his relationship with Pessoa that were known to have existed at some point, but seemed to have vanished. Among them, there were the books of English poems that Pessoa had sent Crowley in December 1929, and whose re-discovery is described in another contribution by Patricio Ferrari and myself for the present issue of this journal (Pasi and Ferrari, 2012). But there was at least another document that was potentially even more interesting and was eluding all my efforts to locate it: Crowley’s personal diary for September 1930, corresponding roughly to the period he spent in Portugal (Pasi, 1999: 153, n. 65). There was no doubt that this portion of Crowley’s diary existed. Not only because John Symonds quoted from it in his biography of Crowley,7 but also because there were traces of its past presence in the Yorke Collection itself. In order to understand this point, it is now necessary to make a digression both into Crowley’s use of his diaries and into the history of the Yorke Collection. Aleister Crowley kept a diary for the most part of his life. The regular writing of a diary clearly had for him a magical purpose and was part of his system of spiritual realization (Asprem, 2008: 151-154; Pasi, 2004: 376-379; Wasserman, 2006).8 Depending on circumstances, his diaries would also fulfill more secular tasks such as writing down personal reflections about the most disparate subjects or simply keeping a record of significant daily events. Together with Crowley’s own autobiography (Crowley, 1989), his diaries offer the largest amount of biographical material for most periods of his life, and have in fact been freely used by his biographers, starting with John Symonds. Precisely because of the magical significance of his diaries, Crowley himself began to publish portions of them, especially in his own periodical The Equinox, whose first series appeared between 1909 and 1913. Their publication could serve as a model for his disciples, who were also required to keep a regular diary recording their spiritual progress. A significant example of Crowley’s publication of his own diary is “John St. John,” describing a spiritual “retreat” in the city of Paris and published in the very first issue of The Equinox (Crowley, 1909; see also   7 Symonds quotes several passages from Crowley’s diary related to his Portuguese trip already in the first edition of his book (Symonds, 1951: 273-275), and leaves them practically unchanged in the subsequent editions (Symonds, 1971: 368-370; Symonds, 1989: 452-455; Symonds, 1997: 456-459). 8 It is also noteworthy that one of the two novels he published during his life was titled The Diary of Drug Fiend (Crowley, 1922). In the novel the regular practice of the diary is emphasized for its spiritual value and is part of the teaching system of the community on which the plot centers (loosely based on the Thelemite community Crowley created in Cefalù, Sicily, in 1920)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 256 Wasserman, 2006: 1-103). However, the largest part of Crowley’s diaries remained unpublished during his life. In the 1970s there were two important editions of these unpublished parts, corresponding to the years 1914-1920 and 1923 (Crowley, 1972; Crowley, 1979). Later, other unpublished portions were edited as small booklets (Crowley, 1992) or as part of larger collections of documents (Crowley, 1998). The Yorke Collection of the Warburg Institute preserves copies of most of Crowley’s diaries. The Collection was created by Gerald Yorke (1901-1983), who had been a disciple of Crowley’s since 1928 and had remained interested in his work even after the two had become estranged in 1932 (Richmond, 2011: xxxv-xxxvii).9 It includes books and papers by or related to Crowley. Yorke donated a first part of his collection to the Warburg Institute, probably in several installments, between the 1960s and the 1970s.10 This part is usually referred to now as the “Old Series” (OS). A second part, the “New Series” (NS), was bequeathed by him to the same Institute and joined the first part in 1984, after he died. One important point to keep in mind about the Collection is that some of the documents preserved in it, especially diaries and correspondence, are not available in their original version, but only in typewritten transcripts. During a certain period of time after Crowley’s death in 1947, Yorke had a large number of Crowley papers at his disposal which did not belong to him, but were meant to be part of the official archive of Crowley’s occultist organization, the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). These documents would eventually have to be given to Karl Germer (1885-1962), Crowley’s successor as international head of the OTO. Yorke decided therefore to have typewritten transcripts made of those documents, so that he could keep at least a copy. For that purpose, around 1950 Yorke employed Kenneth Grant (1924-2011), former Crowley student and secretary, as typist (Richmond, 2011: lii, lvi; Tibet, 2011: 221-222).11 Once the copies were made, the originals were sent to Germer, who had moved to the United States during the war. However in September 1967, five years after his death, they were stolen from his widow Sascha   9 Later the two resumed a relatively friendly relationship, even if Yorke did not consider Crowley as his spiritual master or guru anymore. 10 There is a certain degree of uncertainty about when exactly single parts of the Collection reached the Warburg Institute, and only further research in the archives of the Institute will allow to clarify this point. Keith Richmond, in an otherwise remarkably well researched and thoroughly informative biographical study of Gerald Yorke, states that the “majority of his [i.e., Yorke’s] collection was placed [in the library of the Warburg Institute] in 1973, with the remainder delivered in batches in the years that followed.” (Richmond, 2011: lxxi). However, there is evidence that Yorke began to donate items from his collection to the Warburg Institute at least as early as 1963/1964 (personal email from Philip Young, Assistant Librarian at the Warburg Institute, 27 March 2012). 11 Grant would later become a prominent figure in the Thelemic world as leader of another splinter OTO group, usually referred to as “Typhonian OTO” (later taking the name of “Typhonian Order”), and as author of several books on occult subjects."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 257 by some members of a spin-off OTO group, the Solar Lodge, and in May 1969 they were accidentally destroyed in a fire while they were still in their possession (Shiva, 2012: 124-128, 183-186; Richmond, 2011: lxvii-lxviii; Starr, 2006: 104-108). This was an irreparable loss, only mitigated by the fact that, thanks to Yorke’s typewritten transcripts, the content of these papers would still survive in his collection. It is important therefore to realize that the Yorke Collection transcripts are the only copies we have of some of Crowley’s papers. Crowley’s diaries preserved in the Yorke Collection are partly in their original handwritten version, partly in the typewritten version. The original handwritten diaries are of course those that were, for one reason or another, personally owned by Yorke and were for that reason never sent to Germer. As far as I have been able to determine, and apart from smaller excerpts scattered here and there, the original versions of the diaries go from January 1901 (YC, OS, 22.a) to April 1925 (YC, OS, A15). The typewritten transcripts, on the other hand, are available for diaries going from June 1916 (YC, NS, 19) to the last months of 1947, when Crowley died (YC, NS, 23). It is therefore evident that for the years after 1925 the only available copy of the diaries is the typewritten version. This would also include the part for September 1930, corresponding to the Portuguese trip. Crowley’s diary for 1930 is in binder YC, NS, 20, which contains transcripts of diaries from 1927 to 1934. From an analysis of the file it becomes immediately clear that, when the transcript was made, Crowley’s entries for September 1930 were there. In fact the pages of the transcript are numbered, but the numbering for 1930 jumps from p. 11 (ending with 30 August) directly to p. 18 (beginning with 30 September). Six pages therefore appear to be missing, and they correspond almost exactly to the time Crowley spent in Portugal with his lover Hanni Jaeger (1910- 1933 ca.). What is interesting is that, at the top left of the page, a note in Yorke’s hand says “? September”. This can only mean that the pages for September 1930 had originally been part of the transcript, but had already been missing even before they reached the Warburg Institute after Yorke’s death. The only logical explanation is that Yorke, browsing the file on a given moment, noticed the gap and penned the brief note to record it. There can be no doubt that the missing part was precisely the one from which Symonds was quoting when describing Crowley’s trip to Portugal and his meeting with Fernando Pessoa. But why was that part missing? And would it be possible to retrieve it? Seven years ago I received via email from a trusted source a pdf file containing what appears to be the missing part of Crowley’s 1930 diary. It consists of a scan of six pages of typewritten text, which would match exactly the gap in the Yorke Collection file. An inspection of both the content and the layout of the text makes it clear that it is in fact the missing part, which is here made integrally available for the first time, both with an edited transcription of the text and a facsimile"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 258 reproduction of the document.12 The same source informed me later about the latter’s provenance.13 As I have said, after Crowley’s death Gerald Yorke asked Kenneth Grant to type the documents he had at his disposal before dispatching them to Karl Germer. Yorke did not pay Grant for this service, but allowed him to keep one of the carbon copies that were being made in the process (Tibet, 2011: 221-222). Grant had therefore a mirror copy of all the transcripts that were so prepared. While he would normally keep only one copy for himself, it appears that for that particular portion of the diary – maybe simply by an oversight, or maybe for other reasons that would now be difficult to ascertain – he retained all the copies.14 Thus, after the original handwritten version was destroyed in the 1969 fire, no one but Grant could have access to that part anymore. According to my informant, the scan I received was made from one of Grant’s copies.15 I would like now to focus on the points that make this portion of Crowley’s diary particularly interesting and important. A first aspect needs hardly to be mentioned, and it is the obvious fact that these pages allow us to follow Crowley’s activities, encounters, and thoughts during his Portuguese trip practically day by day. Especially by comparing the diary entries with the documentary material of the Pessoa “Magick” Collection published by Miguel Roza, it is now possible to know with sufficient precision where and when Crowley went and what he did during his stay.16 Especially concerning the Boca do Inferno affair, and Crowley’s own departure from Portugal, this portion of the diary allows us to establish a more reliable and detailed chronology of events than it was possible before. Another point worth mentioning concerns the quotations of this part of the diary made by Symonds in his biography of Crowley. All the quotations can easily   12 For the sake of completeness, the facsimile reproduction will also include pp. 11 and 18 of Crowley’s 1930 diary from the Yorke Collection (YC, NS, 20), that is, the pages immediately preceding and following the missing document. This will allow to place the document back in its original textual sequence. 13 Personal email dated 6 May 2012. 14 Already in 2002 William Breeze had come to the same conclusion, even if at that time he did not have access to the missing document. In a preliminary copy of a projected revised version of the Yorke Collection catalogue, he noted: “The missing pages were never in the Yorke Collection. Yorke had employed Kenneth Grant to transcribe the Royal Court diaries c. 1950. Grant’s personal copy of 1930 has the original and all carbons for the missing pages through a collation error.” (Breeze, 2002: 135). 15 Personal email dated 6 May 2012. 16 One significant example of an error in chronology that can be corrected through the analysis of the diary is the date of a letter from Crowley to Pessoa which Miguel Roza gives as 15 September 1930 (Pessoa and Crowley, 2010: 104), and which in fact is 3 September 1930. Dix, in his thorough study of the encounter between the two men based on the “Magick” Collection, also follows Roza in his mistake (Dix, 2009: 54, 69-70). This correction is particularly important, because it places this letter before the initiation that took place on 9 September at Raul Leal’s apartment, about which see below."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 259 be traced in the diary, with one interesting exception. According to Symonds, on September 21 Crowley wrote: “I decide to do a suicide stunt to annoy Hanni. Arrange details with Pessoa.” (Symonds, 1989: 455). A quick comparison with the actual entry for the same day in the diary shows that the quotation is simply not there. Was Symonds deliberately trying to manipulate his sources? Or was the quotation taken from another source (perhaps a letter?) and then inserted there with a wrong reference by a simple oversight? It is difficult to have a definite answer to the question, but this small discovery slightly modifies our understanding of the events. Without this quotation, it becomes in fact less evident that the fake suicide affair was mainly the result of Crowley’s strained relationship with Hanni. The fact that Crowley had this publicity stunt on his mind for a while even before going to Portugal, and independently from his relationship with Hanni, becomes indeed more likely.17 The diary contains also quite a few “colourful” notes about Lisbon and Portugal that appear to be rather depreciative and scathing. Symonds had quoted a couple of them in his biography, but now it is possible to see that there were more. They are an intriguing read, but it seems likely that Crowley was rather discreet about his impressions with Pessoa. Judging from the piqued response Pessoa wrote to the lecture held by esotericist and philosopher Hermann Keyserling (1880-1947) in Lisbon in April 1930 (only a few months before Crowley’s trip), there are reasons to believe that he would have hardly found Crowley’s remarks amusing (Pessoa, 1988). An interesting detail is the presence in the diary of a horoscope of Hanni prepared on the day of her birthday, when she turned twenty (4 September).18 This horoscope might be compared with the horary question prepared by Pessoa during Crowley’s stay in Portugal, where Hanni’s astral data are also included in the chart, and with Hanni’s own horoscope, also prepared by Pessoa (Pessoa, 2011: 266-274). References to Crowley’s dealings with Pessoa are of course the most interesting aspect of the diary. They confirm that the two men met at least three times. The first was when Pessoa welcomed Crowley and Hanni Jaeger (the German-American girlfriend who was accompanying him) at their arrival in   17 There is indeed ample evidence that Crowley thought about setting up a suicide stunt at least twice before his Portuguese escapade. Interestingly enough, both instances are from periods of extreme stress in his life. In August 1923, while he was in Tunis after his expulsion from Italy, he had the idea of a organizing a fake suicide modeled on the myth of Empedocles, with the intent of drawing public attention to the ‘unjust’ measures taken against him by the Italian government and protesting against the attacks of the British yellow press (Crowley, 1979: 113, n. 66). In March 1929, while he was in the process of being expelled from France, he had another plan for a suicide stunt, which he proposed to journalist Francis Dickie (1890-1976). The latter, however, refused (Sutin, 2000: 354). 18 About Hanni’s birthday, see the discussion by Paulo Cardoso in Pessoa, 2011: 270."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 260 Lisbon on the vessel Alcantara, on 2 September. On the other two occasions, 7 and 18 September, Crowley and Pessoa spent the whole afternoon together. Unfortunately, Crowley does not offer any detail in the diary about the subject of their conversations. It is very likely however that the third meeting was spent particularly talking about the preparations for the suicide stunt, in which, as it is known, Pessoa played a very important role. In my view, however, the single most interesting piece of information provided by the diary is Crowley’s meeting with Pessoa’s friend and fellow esotericist Raul Leal (1886-1964). As I have pointed out elsewhere, Leal, who had already developed an esoteric doctrine of his own, was deeply fascinated by Crowley and considered him as a real master of magic (Pasi, 2006: 226-231). Like Pessoa, Leal had also corresponded with Crowley before the latter’s visit to Portugal. In a letter to Crowley dated 15 January 1930 Leal described his esoteric doctrine, and finally expressed the wish of being initiated by the English occultist: I hope that our relations may become more and more fraternal and intense: so that if one day you have the desire to carry out my initiation, which up to the present has only been in a sketchy form, I will promptly follow your esoteric indications. You will thus be the Master of the High Initiation of the holy Prophet of God and Death.19 According to Leal, Crowley responded to his letter expressing his desire to meet him personally as soon as the opportunity presented itself.20 When Crowley came to Lisbon, Leal asked Pessoa to arrange a meeting with him. The meeting took place on 9 September at Leal’s apartment, in rua das Salgadeiras, in the Bairro Alto. And this is where Crowley’s diary entry for that day becomes intriguing: “Met Leal: don’t like him. There’s something very definitely wrong about him. At night Initiation.”21 Apart from Crowley’s negative opinion of Leal (which contrasts with the very positive one he had of Pessoa), the interesting point is that we here have a confirmation that at least one initiation took place during Crowley’s stay in   19 The original text of the letter is in French: “J’espère que nos relations puissent devenir de plus en plus fraternelles et intenses: alors si un jour vous auriez le désir d’achever mon initiation, jusqu’à présent seulement esquissée, je suivrais avec promptitude vos indications ésotériques. Vous serez ainsi le Maître de la Haute Initiation du Prophète sacré de Dieu et de la Mort”. The letter is in the Yorke Collection: YC, OS, EE2. Significantly, a carbon copy is also extant in Pessoa’s archive: BNP/E3, 113F-62/66. That Pessoa was aware of Leal’s letter is made evident in Pessoa’s letter to Crowley dated 6 January 1930, where he writes: “[Leal] now tells me, on my return to Lisbon, that he has received a letter from you, and is going to write to you a long one ‘on occult matters’.” (see Pasi and Ferrari, 2012). 20 The source is a letter Leal wrote in 1950 to João Gaspar Simões, shortly after the first publication of Simões’s biography of Pessoa (Leal, 1982: 55). Unfortunately, Crowley’s response to Leal does not seem to be extant in the Yorke Collection. 21 On the same night Crowley also carried out a sexual magical operation with Hanni."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Pasi September 1930, Lisbon Pessoa Plural: 1 (P./Spr. 2012) 261 Portugal. The question is: was Pessoa present during this ritual? Crowley’s diary does not mention him explicitly, but Leal later claimed that Pessoa was present during his meeting with Crowley (Leal, 1982: 55).22 According to Leal, Pessoa came to his apartment to accompany Crowley and introduce the two men to each other. Did Pessoa stay also during Leal’s initiation? Was he initiated together with Leal? And if so, into which of Crowley’s occultist organizations: the OTO or the AA?23 Whatever the case, it is interesting to consider that the astrological horary question prepared by Pessoa only two days before the initiation concerned a situation in which four persons were involved: Crowley, Jaeger, Pessoa, and Leal (Pessoa, 2011: 270-271). Paulo Cardoso, who has investigated this document, has not been able to determine the exact purpose of Pessoa’s horary question, but it is of course tempting to link it up with what that took place in Leal’s apartment two days later. It should also not be forgotten that Pessoa wrote his famous erotic poem inspired by Hanni (“Dá a surpreza de ser”) the day after the initiation in Leal’s apartment (Pessoa, 2011: 273-274). Due to lack of decisive evidence, we will probably never know for sure what happened exactly on the night of 9 September, but we clearly have at least a series of interesting clues that I hope will serve as a basis for further explorations and discoveries, especially as new documentary material will emerge. Note on the edition of the text The edition of this text posed a certain number of problems that could not be so easily solved. The biggest problem resides in the multi-layered character of the text itself. In fact, what we have here is (a) the electronic file of a scan of (b) a typewritten transcript of (c) an original that is irreparably lost. The implications of this situation can easily be seen: when we encounter a spelling error or any other inconsistency or problem in the text, it is not immediately clear where is its origin. Is it in Crowley’s original handwritten text? Or is it in the typist’s transcript? In most cases we can only guess. For my transcription I have chosen to have an interpretive approach, trying to reconstruct Crowley’s original text where I can reasonably infer that errors have been introduced with Grant’s typing. It seems in fact relatively clear that in some cases Grant, not being familiar with some of the subjects mentioned in the diary, is just unable to read Crowley’s handwriting correctly, especially when it concerns Portuguese terms (proper names, localities, etc.). All these emendations, which are to some extent hypothetical, are reported in   22 It should also be noted however that Leal, in his letter to Simões written twenty years after the events, remained silent about the initiation. 23 Concerning the complex issue of Pessoa’s possible initiation, see also my discussion in Pasi, 2006: 212-216.

Spooner (1844-1930) was a professor at New College, Oxford, and a priest of the Church of England. His name is linked to the linguistic phenomenon of “spoonerism,” i.e. the transposition of parts of words (letters or syllables) within a sentence, so that the sentence acquires a totally different meaning. Crowley’s subsequent quotation of Hanni offers an interesting example of spoonerism, although it can be doubted that Reverend Spooner would have found it amusing.
