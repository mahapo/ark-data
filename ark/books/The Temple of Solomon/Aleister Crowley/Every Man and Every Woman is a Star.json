This theology has been adequately examined elsewhere and need not be overlyexamined at this point. Suffice to say that it is believed that within every individual there is this Divine Light, orInner Flame, which denotes us as Children of God.Within this framework we can find the idea that we are all in fact stars upon the blackness of existence.We move through “space” and “time” as points of light along interstellar “paths”. These paths represent who wewere and who we will become by where we end up traveling to. This can be equated to the “Spiritual; Path” ofthe person who is seeking enlightenment, or the “Personal Path” of each individual in the universe. We are facedwith the maxim of “That which is above is as that which is below...” which is exposed in the Emerald Tablet ofHermes. We see the astronomical stars as a representation of our inner stars, and we may be able to examine ourpersonal spiritual growth from the point of view of astronomical and physical laws. Some of these laws may seem a little odd, or may not appear to apply in all cases. When we acknowledgethat many of us are at different points in the evolutionary process, then we can see how things can be affected invarying degrees of continuity. Some of these ideas may appear completely foreign, yet they can be applied toboth spiritual and interpersonal experience, as well as giving an interesting outlook on the astronomy of Man. Like the stars in their courses, so is Man upon a path.The self as center of a star system.If everyone is a star, then how do we determine the idea that he or she is in fact part of a greater scheme?First we need to examine some basic premises concerning human beings. The first of these is the idea that the entire universe revolves around the self. This seems like a very selfishand narrow minded point of view, yet it is something that we cannot escape. No matter how hard you try, youwill always see things from your own perspective. Even two people looking at a star while standing side by sidedo not see the same thing. From a physics point of view, there is a (albeit minuscule) difference in angle andtrajectory between the two points of view. Also the image of this age old star is filtered by the differentexperiences that each person carries with them. One may be an astrologer and one an astronomer. Both studystars, yet neither is looking at the same thing.This is true of all of the things in our lives. We are constantly seeing with our eyes, and thinking with ourbrains, and hearing with out ears. Therefore all things exist to us through our selves. This is the personal centerof the star system. Our self is the star around which all other bodies move in rotation.Now applied to the astronomical model (which I shouldn’t need to explain overmuch in this enlightenedday and age) we see that a star has many planets moving around it. These are the possessions and attributes ofthe star. We can see that a personality, though defined by the center of the system carries many things with it.Emotional baggage, past experience and treasured possessions. These are things which help define the individualsystem, human and stellar. We can learn a great deal about the life of a star by examining its satellites. The sameis true of the individual though it is often called Psychoanalysis. Unlike the pure astronomical model in which things happen very slowly, the individual has the ability,through the strength of Will, to determine what will and will not stay as part of his or her personal system. Theold baggage of years gone by may be flung into space and removed from directly influencing the self. Though thecloser the object is to the gravity well at the center of the system, the harder it is to remove and thus requiresmore energy on behalf of the self. The Gravity of the star, and the gravity of the other objects in its sphere of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990existence are very important in determining the nature and behavior of the objects in question. Therefor we mustexamine gravity to a greater extent.On GravityThe individual star system, and the self are centers of gravity within the system that they create. Thepersonality as a whole has gravitational force, and in fact the system as a whole has a cumulative gravity. Eachbody is a gravitational unit, and thus a system as a whole acts as a greater gravitational unit exerting the gravityof the star as well as the added gravity of all of the bodies in the system.Thus the personality is itself a gravitational system. It is not uncommon to hear of someone with greatcharisma as being referred to as having people “gravitate” to him. This is especially true of the great prophets,and leaders throughout history. The individual exerts gravity based on his personality and the objects he carrieswith him.This can be both a positive and negative influence upon the self. There is no argument that the gravity ofa Priest may be just as compelling as the gravity of a Failure. These two people carry a great number ofastronomical bodies within their system. Yet the Failure drags you into his dispair, and the Priest pulls you intohis ecstasy. This gives us an understanding of why we need to examine the bodies within our system and work onexpelling the bad or negative influences and drawing in the good, or positive influences. This is a great and difficult task, but in the long run it can be very rewarding. The difference in the Priestand the Failure is not just in the gravitational influence on others, but it also shows the different challenges ofliving within the system so defined. Therefor it is our responsibility to alter our objects in order that we can leada happier life personally, but also that we can have a better influence on others. Gravity alters courseIf each personality, each star exerts gravitational force which affects the objects within the system, andeach system exerts gravitational force over other systems, what then does this gravity do? We have seen in science and astronomy that two bodies having mass affect each other when they moveinto close proximity. This can be exhibited by placing two inflatable balls in a pool. A point comes when they areclose enough that they drift towards each other until they touch. If one sphere has greater mass, then it will moveless and the smaller sphere will move towards the greater one. If we imagine that these balls are personal starsystems, then we have an idea of how the gravity of two systems can affect each other.This works very well on a static model (the pool) but in reality we are hurtling through space and time onour personal paths. Like the stars and planets, our movement through time and space is blindingly fast. Thereforewe need to look at another model to understand how our actual courses through life, our paths are affected.If we were to take a flat plane (a table top for instance) and acquire two magnetized ball bearings, or twodisk magnets (commonly found in the back of vanity refrigerator magnets) we could roll the two magnets alongthe table side by side. We would see that the closer the two came, the more fore is exerted upon each other’spaths. By dipping the magnets in ink we could map this difference. Attempts to roll the magnets along atdifferent angles would show different patterns in the trajectory of the magnets. Also dependent on the polarity ofthe magnets as they start you will see that they will either pull together or push apart. And sometimes they willeven reverse themselves in order to accommodate the other magnet. The various patterns and results that thesefew experiments show, well illustrate the idea of personal gravity and the exertion of that force on the paths ofothers.The two gravitational units exert gravity on each other according to the direction of the path. If we lookat path A as being a straight line with a gravitational body of medium force (Object A) we can examine some ofthe possibilities this theory puts forth."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135Object B (an object of little gravity) can pass object A at a right angle and can have little or no effect onpath A. The same body traveling a near parallel course would have some effect on path A, but would experiencea great affect to its own path. The various combinations and permutations are endless, but it is important to note,that a very large object with a great deal of force can in fact completely change the path of a body. In fact whendealing with gravitational units of similar force we can see a dance begin to take place within them, a changingand moving of paths. The idea of two bodies moving towards each other on a narrow angle (less than 45 degrees) would causeboth bodies to change course after passing each other. Neither path is the same throughout the rest of thejourney. Thus strong personalities can change the way we think about things, or the way we feel. These largebodies of force can change our lives and our paths. Sometimes the gravitational body id simply equal to ours, yeta relationship evolves and we move in a different direction than before. This is especially true of good friends andcompanions. (Personal relationships such as marriage and love are discussed later.) As long as the coursesremain parallel the gravitational influence will be maintained within the group (even if it is only a group of two orthree). Another force is required in order to break parallel paths, but with enough energy it can be done.Leaders and ProphetsWhen a very large gravitational force comes along it has a habit of drawing lesser gravitational units toitself. Like a galactic center it creates star clusters of personalities. This is indicative of the great leadersthroughout history (political and religious) who build around them a movement. The smaller units begin to travelthe path of the large unit and in fact may create enough mass that the trajectory remains even when the larger starhas burned out. Examples of this kind of individual can be seen in Jesus ben Joseph (of Nazareth), Martin LutherKing, Mohammed and even a personality like David Koresh or Charles Manson. There are many examples of this kind of strong personality drawing lesser gravitational bodies into theirtrajectory. In some cases the star cluster goes to the next step and the various stars begin to rotate around thecentral star. In this case the other personalities have not just joined the path, but have joined the central systemand become object of the original star. In this case it can be very difficult for them to remove themselves and infact become part of the property of the central system. This is very much like a galaxy than a simple star systemand the stars closer to the center are more in control of the general path of the grater system than, for example, asystem on the fringe. We will not go too far in depth on this point, but it is something that can be examined from both apositive (Jesus, Martin Luther King) and a negative (Koresh, Manson, LeVey) perspective. It reinforces the ideathat gravity can act in both a positive and negative fashion on the various systems which come within thegravitational field of each other.Binary SystemsIn some cases, two stars, moving along similar paths fall into each other’s gravitational pull. As theygrow closer they begin to share objects in their systems until they find themselves revolving around each other asa Binary star system. This is the act of Love. Two individuals who have come together and joined themselvesthrough commitment, or marriage create their own system, with its own gravity. They share almost everythingwithin the system and thus it is very difficult for them to try and break away from each other once this system hasbecome solidified.The Binary system is readily recognizable. We often see people together and intuitively “know” they are“together” and not just traveling in the same direction. It seems apparent that they share gravitational objects intheir system, and the longer they have been building the binary system around them, the more obvious it is thatthey are a single unit."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174Because of the amount of energy and gravitational force inherent in such a system, it is very difficult tobreak away from it. Even in cases of abuse and atrocious behavior, the two cannot split except through anextreme force of Will compounded by an external gravitational influence (parent, friend, counselor). This helps toexplain why even bad relationships maintain themselves. Gravity is an amazing force to reckon with. But not all binary systems are bad. There are binary systems that build very good objects around themand as they grow, they draw other people to them. In many cases these are people who want to learn from theBinary couple in order that they may find some happiness through their example. Once again, the objects youcarry in the system effect others, both positively and negatively. SubsystemsBut what happens when this binary system grows and wants to add to the population of the universe?They begin to build subsystems. A subsystem is in fact very similar to our own solar system. Within the systemproper a subsystem exists surrounding Jupiter. Jupiter has its own planets, not just moons, but planets. And asArthur C. Clark put forth, Jupiter could be ignited into its own Sun. A star within a star system. Unlike the leaders and prophets we looked at, this is something born out of the existing system, which isnurtured and protected within the system, until such a time as it reaches maturity and becomes its own star. Astar system unto itself. A system which will eventually, through force of Will and external gravity, leave theparent system to find its own path. The binary center must at the same time move the subsystem closer to theexternal event horizon of the system in order that the child system will find it easier to leave. Again when lookingat the amount of force involved, this split is never easy and it requires a great deal of energy to complete. The exception to this is when an immature star is picked up by the binary system (adoption) in order to help it reach its own ignition. This kind of subsystem does not generally orbit as close to the center as an originalchild but again, there may need to be a great deal of energy expelled in order to get the subsystem to leave whenthe time comes.ConclusionSpiritually, mankind can be understood from an individual / spiritual basis by examining himself from anastronomical point of view. By understanding that we exert influence on others and they exert influence on usaccording to our own gravitational fields, we can better make choices for ourselves through exertion of our Will.We can also attempt to make ourselves better people by examining the object in our star systems and removingthose which are bad for us and replacing them with good things. By consciously constructing ourselves and ourpersonalities we can become better citizens of the universe, and improve our selves on the path of personalevolution. The bottom line is that we can use this idea to try and make ourselves better people, and to betterunderstand others and our interactions with them.We find the inner star of Man a very complex and intriguing thing, and it is through examination ofourselves that we come to the threshold of the temple, and pass through the gates to grater enlightenment.“Love is the Law, Love under Will.”"}]
