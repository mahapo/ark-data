Pronunciation Symbols The student should thoroughly familiarize him or herself with the pro-nunciation symbols given below. Although the symbols are unique to this book, they appear in pronunciation guidelines in every Ritual and provide the student with more precise pronunciation information than has ever been available before in a book on Ceremonial Magic. The average student should require no more than ten or fifteen minutes to become familiar with these unique symbols. Due to the frequent use in Magic of foreign, Enochian, and unfamiliar words, the pronunciation guidlelines given in the text of the Rituals are quite helpful when performing Rituals. In a few instances where sounds have no exact English equivalents, examples are given from other languages. For English speakers unable to pronounce these sounds correctly, their closest English equivalents should be employed until the pronunciation of the correct sounds are learned.

These Hebrew half-vowels are indicated in transliterations in this book underlined as follows, and should be vibrated only briefly. Although the distinction between regular and shortened vowels is nearly never used in contemporary, spoken Hebrew, it is nonetheless interesting in Magic due to the extended fashion in which Names are vibrated.

Use the Sign of the Enterer, also known as the Sign of Horus or the Attacking Sign, primarily to project Magical Energy. Use it in the charging of Pentagrams and Hexagrams in Ceremonial Magic and to charge Talismans in Practical Magic. To perform the sign of the Enterer, stand with your feet parallel about shoulders width apart. Visualize a star shining just above your head about the size of a baseball. Inhale silently, and visualize a shaft of white Light coming down through your body from the star above you to a second star beneath your feet. As you inhale, draw down the light and raise your elbows upward and outward, parallel with your shoulders. Hold your hands flat beside your neck, palms downward, fingers extended, pointing forwards. Suddenly and forcefully, step forward with your left foot, thrust your hands directly forward, and lower your head between your arms, eyes forward. As you do so, exhale silently, visualize the Light rising back up through your body, and project it out through your fingertips.   16 The Hebrew pronunciation of \"r\" is as in French \"rue\" or \"riche\"."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Magical Rituals of the Junioris Grade Golden Dawn School of Magic and Alchemy 7 Enochian Keys or Calls Introduction Enochian Magic is one of the most controversial aspects of Rosicrucian Magic. Israel Regardie warned that \"It is a very powerful system, and if used carelessly or indiscriminately will bring about disaster and spiritual disintegration.\"2 Paul Foster Case considered the Enochian system to be hopelessly tainted, and removed Enochian Magic entirely when he reformulated Golden Dawn material into his B.O.T.A. Donald Tyson has even suggested that Enochian Magic was revealed to John Dee as a means of setting in motion the destructive forces of the apocalypse, as described in the book of Revelation in the New Testament.3 While there does exist a certain parallel between the English translation of a few of the Enochian Calls and the apocalyptic imagery of the book of Revelation, this imagery may be considered as symbolical of spiritual realities rather than descriptive of physical events. In any case, much of the fear surrounding Enochian Magic has been greatly exaggerated. The author of the present book has been working with the Enochian system, including the Enochian Calls, for many years, with great success, and without fulfilling any of the aforementioned predictions of gloom and doom. The Enochian Calls serve primarily as Energy amplifiers, and when properly used, clearly add great power to Rituals of Ceremonial Magic. Nonetheless, the decision whether or not to employ the Enochian Calls with the Rituals contained in the present book must be left to the discretion, personal responsibility, and risk of each Magician. A primary difficulty in working with Enochian Magic lies in finding a correct or satisfactory means of pronunciation. Names derived from the Enochian Tablets are particularly problematic as consonants therein are frequently so clumped together that such Names are virtually impossible to pronounce. In recognition of this problem, certain rules were laid out by W. Wynn Wescott and S. L. MacGregor Mathers for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Wescott suggested that each letter should be pro-nounced separately. Using this method, for example, the consonant clump \"pfmng\" would be pronounced \"pee-ef-em-en-gee.\" Mathers in-stead proposed that the first vowel in the name of the phonetically equivalent Hebrew letter be employed. For example, the Hebrew name for phonetical equivalent of the letter \"l\" is \"Lamed.\" Therefore, Mathers suggests that the vowel \"a\" be used to render words pronounceable when the letter \"l\" appears in consonant clumps. Each of these methods are indeed quite useful when working with Names drawn from the Enochian Tablets. Unfortunately, however, the Mathers and Wescott rules have tended to be applied far too rigidly and dogmatically, especially to the Enochian Calls, resulting in endless strings of extraneous syllables. For example, one recent book on the Golden Dawn transliterated the word \"Ozongon\" from an Enochian Call as \"Oh-zoad-oh-noo-goh-noo.\" Numerous clues to correct pronunciation may be found in original   2 The Golden Dawn (The original Account of the Teachings, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) [1937], revealed by Israel Regardie, 6th ed. (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1989), p. 626. 3 Donald Tyson, \"The Enochian Apocalypse,\" Gnosis, No. 40 (Summer 1996), pp. 56-62."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Magical Rituals of the Junioris Grade Golden Dawn School of Magic and Alchemy 8 manuscripts4 handwritten by John Dee. These manuscripts clearly indi-cate that the dogmatic application of such rules to the Enochian Calls was neither originally intended by Dee nor by the Angels which dictated them. The Calls properly pronounced and free of surplus syllables remain sonorous in the extreme, reflecting the vibrant beauty of the language of Angels. The Enochian Calls given in this appendix have been retransliterated from Sloane Manuscript 3191. In preparing this new transliteration, every effort has been made to restore the pronunciation to that most likely intended by John Dee and the Angels. The student who prefers, however, to use the Wescott-Mathers method will find the Calls elsewhere so transliterated by Israel Regardie.5 This fresh transliteration of Sloane MS 3191 has presented numerous difficulties and raised interesting questions. To begin with, the word spacing in the handwritten version of the Angelic Calls is so bad in certain places that is nearly impossible to distinguish where one Enochian word ends and the next one begins. Furthermore, the fashion that the English translations are arranged above the Enochian text in the original manuscript is of little use in overcoming this problem. Every effort has therefore been made to reproduce, as closely as possible, the original word spacing of the Enochian in the transliteration given below. The most fascinating question regarding pronunciation raised by an examination of Dee's handwritten version of the Angelic Calls in Sloane MS 3191 is his copious use of diacritical marks. This mystery appears to have been completely overlooked or ignored by contemporary Enochian scholarship. The primary diacritical marks used by Dee are ́, ^, and ̈, and they are used over vowels in ninety-five per cent of all instances. These diacritics have been included in the new transliteration as faithfully as possible. In each instance where an Enochian word is given, the spelling used by John Dee in Sloane 3191 including his diacritical marks has been reproduced side by side with its new transliteration shown in bold type. Unfortunately, however, certain substitutions for the diacritical marks actually used by Dee have been obliged by editorial considerations. The mark ^ as in \"up\" has been substituted for the mark actually used by Dee, which most closely resembles the upward pointing curve used in modern English to indicate a short vowel sound. It is hoped that the inclusion of these diacritical markings shall stimulate additional research regarding their actual meaning. An examination of Sloane MS 3191 by various Professors of modern and classical European languages and linguistics has unfortunately not yet conclusively ascertained the meaning of the diacritical markings. It has been determined, however, that their usage apparently does not match neither that of Latin, Greek, nor any Germanic, Latin, nor Slavic derivative language neither as they are employed today nor as they were used during the Sixteenth Century. It is therefore likely that the they represent a personal phonetical code devised by Dee for his personal use. The transliteration methodology which has been employed in the present book for all Enochian words is outlined below and has been ad-hered to in a consistent fashion. The resulting fresh transliteration of Enochian Names and Calls remains steeped in Rosicrucian tradition, yet as true as possible to the original manuscripts as well.   4 Sloane MS 3191 [1585?], Dr. John Dee (London: The British Library). 5 Israel Regardie, The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (Santa Monica: Falcon Press, 1987), Vol. 10, pp. 56-74."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Magical Rituals of the Junioris Grade Golden Dawn School of Magic and Alchemy 9 Transliteration Methodology 1. Every effort has been made to avoid the addition extraneous vowels and syllables. 2. The phonetic value of each individual letter has been preserved. 3 Wherever necessary, consonants which may be elongated through prolonged vibration as suggested by Wescott (particularly l, m, n, r, v, and z) have been used as separate syllables (avoiding thereby the addition of extraneous vowels). 4. Wherever an extra vowel is absolutely necessary, the first vowel in the name of the equivalent Hebrew letter has been employed as suggested by Mathers. 5. In the choice of vowel sounds, preference has been given to the phonetic values of vowel sounds most frequently used in Hebrew as suggested by Mathers. 6. The sound of the letter z should be elongated through prolonged vibration. This appears to be the true meaning of the marginal notes made by Dee in Sloane 3191 rather than the literal pronunciation of \"z\" as \"zod,\" the Elizabethan appellation of the letter \"z.\"6 7. The letter Q has been transliterated as \"kw.\"7 In cases where there is no vowel following in the Enochian, it has been transliterated as \"kwâ.\" 8. There is no evidence to be found in the manuscripts indicating an Enochian equivalent of the English sounds of the combined conso-nants \"sh,\" \"ph,\" or \"th.\" They have therefore been transliterated in such a fashion that the phonetic values of the individual letters have been retained. There are numerous instances, however, where marginal notations do suggest that \"ch\" should be pronounced as a k. In the present transliteration, this \"ch\" has been given a guttural phonetical value similar to the German \"ch\" as used in the word \"Buch.\" This has been indicated as an underlined \"k\" in the transliterations. 9. There are sporadic instances where marginal notes indicate that the letter \"g\" should be pronounced as \"dg.\" Obviously \"g\" has two phonetic values in Enochian: that of a hard g (as in \"go\") as well as one which closely approximates the English \"j\" (as in \"job\"). Attempts have been made to be as consistent as possible with the transliteration of this letter. Patterns revealed by marginal notation have been given priority. In doubtful instances the more sonorous option has been employed. 10. According to marginal notes, the letter \"c\" is at times to be transliterated as \"k\" and at other times as \"s.\" Attempts have been made to be as consistent as possible with the transliteration of this letter. Patterns revealed by marginal notation have been given priority. In doubtful instances the more sonorous option has been employed. 11. In Dee's handwriting the uppercase letters \"U\" and \"V\" are consis-tently rendered as \"V.\" Furthermore, there are numerous instances wherein from one place to another in Sloane MS 3191 Dee also in-terchanges the lower case letters \"u\" and \"v\" as well. Every attempt has nonetheless been made to maintain the phonetic value of the letters \"u\" and \"v\" as they actually appear in the manuscript except in cases where an extra vowel would have then become necessary. In certain instances where an additional vowel is required by the   6 This apparent misunderstanding of the marginal notes has had a profound and unfortunate effect on the history of Enochian pronunciation. 7 Far from arbitrary, this has been extrapolated from various marginal notations in the Sloane MS 3191."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Magical Rituals of the Junioris Grade Golden Dawn School of Magic and Alchemy 10 text \"v\" has been rendered \"vù.\" The Enochian Calls and the Elemental Tablets The Application of the Calls to the Enochian Elemental Tablets is re-sumed below.
