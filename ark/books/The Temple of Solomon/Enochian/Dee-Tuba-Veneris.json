While the task of the Latin translation seemed like it'd be child's play for someone with Michael Putnam's ability, I wondered whether having Meier's entire analysis translated wouldn't be a wiser avenue to pursue but I eventually aban­doned that idea as impractical. In the interim, several other projects presented themselves and 'Iuba Veneris fell by the wayside. Seven years ago, I developed a proof copy of the book as it stood and was less than enthusiastic about the results so I decided to shelve it until it'd matured a bit. Circumstances at the time made it necessary for me to learn the art of book­binding in order to keep publishing at all, so I busied myself with focusing on learning to become an adequate bookbinder. I continued to collect material for inclusion in what I envisioned to be the present volume and some time later I ran across a paper Phil Legard wrote on the subject of the Dee manuscript and decided to ask him whether he'd allow me to include his excellent treatise and he graciously accepted my invitation. Today, a decade after beginning this project, I feel the book as a whole is of sufficiently high enough quality to warrant being offered to the public.

It is not often one is able to render the goddess of love such a service, and I am humbled to have been given the opportunity. Although there are three known MSS of the \"Tuba\" and a 1794 printed edition in Latin and German, I made the trans­lation from the typescript Latin text given in Joerg M. Meier's German translation and commentary (Das Buechlein der Venus [\"Libellus Veneris Nigro Sacer\"]: Eine magische Handschrift des 16. Jh. Bonn, 1990). Meier edited his Latin text primarily from Warburg MS FBH510, which is the oldest extant. His edition includes an apparatus criticus, and as might be expected the later MSS show various nonsensical variations from the Warburg, whence they probably derive. Very rarely does"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. Meier reject the Warburg attestation for that of one of the later MSS. Early magical texts are notoriously pseudepigraphical. The authorship of the 'Tuba Veneris has been ascribed to John Dee, for the author gives his name as Dee in the text itself. There is, however, much room for doubt. In the above cited volume, Meier lays out the case both for and against Dee as the author. Meier gives several points leading to suspicion of forgery. The first of these is that all the surviving manuscripts, including the earliest Warburg MS, were produced on the Continent, as evidenced by the script; thus Dee's autograph is not recognizable as his own. Moreover, there is no reference to the \"Tuba\" in any of Dee's diaries or other surviving writings. Another point against Dee as the author is the fact that the date ofthe text's composition is given as June 4, 1580, and the place given as London-this, although Dee's private diary states that he was at his home in Mortlake on June 7 and most probably on June 3 as well. There is also the question of why such a text should have been written in London and not Mortlake, where Dee's magical and alchemical experiments had been taking place in any event. Moreover, June 4 was a Saturday and not a Friday, even though the latter day would be more appropriate for the composition and consecration of a book dedicated to Venus. A final consideration is that the type of magic in the \"Tuba\" is of a nigromantic variety in as much as it inYoh·es forcibly evoking and binding spirits, whereas the magic that Dee was practicing during the 1580's was of a more religious nature, with prayer as its basis and pious supplication [XII] Prifacef� of God's holy angels as i� For all of that, 1\\tleier classical style, with Yery ··•. is similar in that respect to Aphoristica et al. ); further to around 1600, give or take ·· span of Dee's lifetime. :\\I -an exact time and date of Another interesting poiDt4 affection for the Angel ofV4 \"Deutlich wird eberifalls eine der Venus-dem er rfftnbar ai.t Buch of Famous and Rich ' diaries do show that Dee angels on occasion for of the goals of the \"Tuba·. that most pseudoepigra magicians either partially dead; the \"Tuba\", howeYes; \"' .. lifetime, when he was being as a necromancer, but still a candidate for reputed Agrippa, or Faust.

For all of that, Meier admits, the Latin is of the good neo­classical style, with very few Medieval words (I note that it is similar in that respect to the Latin in Dee's Propaedeumata Aphoristica et al. ); furthermore, the Warburg MS can be dated to around 1600, give or take twenty years, placing it within the span of Dee's lifetime. Meier also notes that few forgeries give an exact time and date of composition as does the \"Tuba\". Another interesting point here is that Dee did have a certain affection for the Angel ofVenus, a fact which Meier also notes: \"Deutlich wird ebenfalls eine gewisse Vorliebe Dees fuer den Engel der Venus-dem er riffenbar einen besonderen A bschnitt in seinem ... Buch rif'Famous and Rich Discoveries widmete.\" Moreover, Dee's diaries do show that Dee and Kelly were wont to pester the angels on occasion for help in finding buried treasure, one of the goals of the \"Tuba\". Finally, there is the consideration that most pseudoepigraphical forgeries were attributed to magicians either partially or wholly mythical, or else long dead; the \"Tuba\", however, was likely written in Dee's own lifetime, when he was being somewhat defamed and slandered as a necromancer, but still not nearly as well-known or likely a candidate for reputed authorship of a forgery as Solomon, Agrippa, or Faust. Ultimately Meier concludes that if it is a forgery, it is a highly unusual one, probably written by a Continental author in all likelihood familiar with the person of Dee and somewhat familiar with his magical pursuits. I personally am forced to agree with Meier that the weight of the evidence leans against Dee as author, but that there is at present no final conclusion to the matter. We may now [XIII]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\"j Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. say a few things about the content of the text itself, and my translation thereof. The operative magic the text describes contains many elements that will be familiar to modern day lovers of the magical arts-the use of the circle, the burning of the seals of the spirits to compel obedience, the blowing of a trumpet before calling the spirits (cf. 'Ike Key if Solomon), the author's exhortation that the operator be stern and resolute and not let himself be cozened by the spirits or reduced to haggling with them, etc. Meier gives a detailed analysis and commentary of the text in his edition, to which the reader is again referred. His opinion is that the 'Iuba Veneris as a whole stands in the tradition of Agrippa, pseudo-Agrippa, and the Heptameron of Peter of Abano ( \"Der Text ... steht weitgehend in der Tradition des IV Buches der Occulta Philosophia Agrippas und das Heptameron des Pietro de Albano.\") The actual names of the spirits are similar to those found in the \"Herpentil\" and the Libellus St. Gertrudis, and in fact Meier believes that the compiler of the \"Herpentil\" is using the \"Tuba\" as his source for these names (\"Dies bestaetigt den bereits oben geauesserten Verdacht, das es sick bei diesem Text um eine relativ Junge Kompilation handelt, so das man den Libellus Veneris mit Sicherheit als das weit aeltere Werk wird bezeichnen dueifen, das sehr wahrscheinlich eine Quelle fuer den Kompilator des Herpentil geliefert hat.'') The barbarous names of evocation found in the conjurations are also very similar to those found in these works.

Attributed to the renowned English magus and mathematician, Dr. John Dee, the grimoire sets itself apart from the highly formulaic literature of ritual magic by possessing subtle hints of genuine artistic merit and a profound understanding of the more cerebral, Classically learned magical theory of Agrippa et al. Within the context of a work on ritual magic the text conveys attitudes symptomatic to the rebirth of Classical learning that characterised the Renaissance and whose legacy even now influences European culture.

What do the barbarous words of their invocations signify? The Tuba Veneris may be a short work, but it is an enigmatic one. In spite of its brevity it is a work of no mean depth, some of which I hope to cast light upon by way of this introduction. John Dee and the Solomonic Tradition The 'Tuba Veneris exists in several manuscripts, of which the Warburg copy is thought to be the oldest.1 Although the manuscript probably dates from the first half of the 1 71h century, possibly even being composed toward the end of Dee's life, the flowing hand preserved in the manuscript is certainly not that of Dee. Aside from the graphological differences, there is significant documentary evidence that indicates the attribution to Dee is spurious.2 It is well known that Dee was extremely concerned about having his name connected with dubious magical practices. His particular interest in Cabalistic and alchemical works had not gone unnoticed amongst his contemporaries, most notable among them John Foxe author of the monumental and immensely popular Actes and Monuments if the Church (1563). Discussing the trial and martyrdom of Archdeacon John Philpot, Foxe refers to Dee, who was one of the examiners in the case, as 'the great Conjuror'.5 This incensed Dee and it seems that he took the opportunity to rebuff his critics in his Priface to Euclid (1570), where he interrupts his discussion of thaumaturgy to rail against those who confuse natural magic with sorcery and conjuration.4 A similar vindication against [XVIII] The.:.Uagic� such rumours is the corn� (1599), which proclaims� feruent Protestation, for t� Christian course, if the A certain studious Gentlemiln.. • In addition to this Dee. way of connection with s long concern.

It seems doubtful, therefore, that he would sign his name on a document that so explicitly deals, as we shall see, with the conjuration of evil spirits. It seems far more likely that the 'Tuba Veneris was the work of a 171h century author, who, being acquainted with Dee's reputation and having a superficial understanding of his magical work and interests, added his name as a stamp of authority upon his text,? The pseudepigraphic attribution of magical works is a regular feature of the genre of grimoire literature. Almost invariably these works are attributed to some learned and respected historical figure to lend authority to their contents. Often Solomon is alleged to be the author, and indeed, one of the oldest known examples is the 'Testament if Solomon, which dates from between the 1st and srd centuries AD, while works from Coptic Egypt from around the same period also employ similar attributions, claiming figures such as Moses, Thoth, the Apostles, even Jesus and Mary themselves as the authors of magical tracts. 8 By the time we reach the period in which the 'Tuba Veneris was probably composed, the early 17th century, we find many comprehensive works circulating in manuscript form that are [XIX]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. attributed to favourite ancient authorities such as Solomon, Hermes and Ptolemy, along with more recent figures such as Peter d'Abano and Cornelius Agrippa.9 The 'Tuba Veneris bears the hallmarks of a text that derives from these traditions, although this is coupled with the Classical learning so evident during the Renaissance and Baroque periods-in particular the streams ofNeoplatonic thought that Agrippa disseminated to his magically-minded audience via the Three Books if Occult Philosophy. Whereas many so-called Solomonic texts are variants on older works, compilations or simply 're-brandings' under the name of a different authority, this short text presents an entirely novel synthesis of pre-existing magical and philosophical traditions. Whether the 'Tuba Veneris is the work of John Dee or not, I will let the reader decide. There are some tantalising similarities with his work. There is Dee's fascination with number, and even the possibility of a cryptographic cipher as found in Trithemius' Steganographia, a work that Dee became particularly fixated upon. The powers possessed by the daemons also particularly relate to Dee's interests. There is most obviously the passing reference to finding hidden treasure: an activity notably pursued by Dee and his scryers, although they were certainly not alone in supposing the landscape to be full of undiscovered hordes.10 Additionally navigation is mentioned, which was of keen interest to this friend of Mercator who mentions that he has written several unpublished works on the subject in his Discourse Apologeticall. The daemons also have powers in business and war may allude to Dee's official duties on behalf of the crown.

From his Private Diary it seems that Dee was indeed in the vicinity of London at that time, it being one year before his angelic experiments with Barnabas Saul and Edward Kelly would begin. The Classical Inheritance if the Tuba Veneris The learned magical authors of the Renaissance, among them Ficino, Agrippa and Bruno owed a great deal to the rediscovery of Classical literature, which elevated their studies beyond common conjuration, into the realms of theology and philosophy. However, there were still magical practitioners following an earlier model, one that sought power over spiritual entities through the imitation or adaptation of liturgical ritual and the related conventions of legal language: two imposing and domineering edifices of Medieval life. The books now popularly associated with the grimoire genre, from the Clavicules if Solomon to the Grand Grimoire, generally take their approach from this particular stream of magical thought. It is apparent from the outset of the 'Tuba Veneris that the inspirations of the author of this particular grimoire lay beyond the inheritance of post-Medieval Christendom and Biblical legend. Rather they hearken back to the magical culture of the Classical pagan world. From the first sentence alone it is apparent that this text owes a debt to the mythologies of the pagan Mediterranean: \"The name Venus among the Stars was [XXI]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Libel/us Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. given to me by the Gods (a Superis).\" This is to say nothing of the striking image of the frontispiece that depicts the goddess herself arrayed in a red­black mantle, holding her magical implements and standing upon an appropriately verdant patch of grass. Depicted as a fair-skinned maiden it is seems that her 'blackness' relates to her association with six nocturnal spirits, who are described as 'Infernal dwellers' in the introductory verse. Throughout the history of myth and magic the traditional representation of Venus, or Aphrodite, has been that of a fair-haired and beautiful woman. Indeed, there may even be said to be a rough suggestion of Botticelli' s The Birth if Venus in this image. In the context of magic it was through cross­pollination with Arabic astrological magic that these depictions of the gods and goddesses lost their pagan identities and became considered purely as celestial images: figures somehow impressed upon the world-soul, which could be exploited by creating talismans in their likenesses. Such images are found in many sources, the most popular among them Agrippa' s Three Books if Occult Philosophy and the Picatrix, although there are innumerable other minor works on such astrological magic. 11 Although they often refer to the talismanic image of Venus as being a naked woman none of the common sources describe the image of Venus as having a red or black mantle, nor any of the other accoutrements she is shown with on the 'Tuba Veneris frontispiece. The following example from Agrippa' s 'Ihree Books is typical of the talismanic representations of Venus: \"They made another image of Venus, the first face of Taurus or Libra or Pisces ascending with Venus, the figure of which was a little maid with her hair spread abroad, clothed in long and white garments, [XXII] The .:.\\fagic !l I holding a. laurel, apple. or �.· comb.

It is reported to make men pleasant, jocund, strong, cheerful and to give beauty.\"12 Some tantalising hints as to the ultimate inspiration for the figure of the black Venus can be found throughout Classical literature. Perhaps the name is derived from the cult epithet of Aphrodite Philopannyx-\"Night-loving,\" or \"Lover of all �he night\". This epithet occurs in the Orphic Hymn to Aphrod1t�, which the 'Tuba Veneris author would have known, although It would probably have been in the Latin translation if he were at all familiar with the work. 13 Additionally, in his Guide to Greece, composed in the 2nd century AD, Pausanias mentions an Aphrodite Melaina-the \"Black Aphrodite\"-so called \"due to the fact that men do not, as the beasts do, have sexual intercourse always by day, but in most cases by night.\"14 Furthermore, there is a Latin work that enjoyed wide dissemination across Europe from the mid-151h century onward and contains some (possibly autobiographical) information relating to the cult of! sis-Aphrodite and her stygian connections. This work is Lucius Apuleius' Metamorphoses, or 'Ihe Golden .Ass . Composed at some point in the mid-to-late 2nd century AD, it tells of the bawdy adventures of the aristocratic Lucius who, by the third book, is transformed into an ass through reckless meddling with a witches' magical ointment. In the eleventh book, Lucius desperate to turn back into a human calls upon the \"blessed ff(Jieene cif Heaven,\" resulting in a dream vision of the goddess that ultimately leads him to become an initiate in an Egyptian cult serving Isis and Osiris. The description of the vision itself reads not unlike one of the formulae for image magic occurring in Agrippa: \"First shee had a great abundance ofhaire, dispersed and scattered about [XXIII J"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. her neck, on the crowne of her head she bare many garlands enter laced with floures, in the middle of her forehead was a com passe in fashion of a glasse, or resembling the light of the Moone, in one of her hands she bare serpents, in the other, blades of corne, her vestiment was of fine silke yeelding divers colours, sometime yellow, sometime rosie, sometime flamy, and sometime (which troubled my spirit sore) clarke and obscure, covered with a blacke robe in manner of a shield.'\"15 Furthermore the goddess herself declares some explicit connections between not only the celestial regions, but also the underworld: \"I am she that is the naturall mother of all things, mistresse and govern esse of all the Elements, the initiall progeny of worlds, chiefe of powers divine, Queene of heaven! the principall of the Gods celestiall, the light of the goddesses: at my will the planets of the ayre, the wholesome winds of the Seas, and the silences of hell be diposed; my name, my divinity is adored throughout all the world in divers manners, in variable customes and in many names, for the Phrygians call me the mother of the Gods: the Athenians, Minerva: the Cyprians, Venus: the Candians, Diana: the Sicilians Proserpina: the Eleusians, Ceres: some Juno, other Bellona, other Hecate: and principally the Aethiopians which dwell in the Orient, and the Aegyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustome to worship mee, doe call mee Queene Isis.\"16 The connection of this goddess with agricultural deities such as Proserpina, Demeter and Ceres is telling, since such goddesses were generally considered chthonic-the germination of seeds and so forth being processes that took place beneath the earth, on the margins of the underworld. The most explicit connection between this many-named goddess and the stygian world relate to her predictions pertaining to Lucius' initiation into her cult. Lucius glosses over the exact details when he comes to recount them, but it is evident that the initiation involves a descent to the underworld, domain of the patron [XXIV] The ... \"\\1 agic !#! guide and protection. and shalt see me shine in that now) in the darkness of .\\c of Stix, thou shalt worship and if I perceive that thou art my religion, and merite my thy dales above the time that Planets ordeined.\"b However, it is impor Veneris as a revival or r even a survival of Lucius\" of learned occultism that [�"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I t.sacer vel Tuba Veneris. je.lshe bare many garlands enterlaced head was a compasse in fashion the :\\foone, in one of her hands of corne, her vestiment was of metime yellow, sometime rosie, !(which troubled my spirit sore) darke robe in manner of a shield.\"15 lil.'ftPI\"\"';s>lf declares some explicit the celestial regions, but also I r of all things, mistresse and ···initial! progeny of worlds, chiefe of principall of the Gods celestiall, the planets of the a)Te, the wholesome oi hell be diposed; my name, my · es accustome to worship mee, ss \\\\ith agricultural deities Ceres is telling, since such chthonic-the germination es that took place beneath ' Wlderworld.

Like many of the works of learned occultism that flourished in the Renaissance, the pagan aspect is somewhat ambiguous. As I have mentioned previously, the imagery of the pagan world generally became assimilated into a mechanical system of astral magic whereby the ancient myths explained the natures of the planets and gave indications as to how their virtues may be exploited. An allegiance to this type of astral philosophy is indicated by the author of the 'Iuba Veneris who refers to his depiction of Venus as \"a certain image representing the figure if the planet. \" Therefore the Venus being referred to in the text is not intended as an object of pagan veneration, but is a talismanic image-an expression of the nature and influence of the planet Venus. In the ritual itself, the subjugation of the daemons occurs through the agency of Anael, the angel of the Venereal sphere, rather than explicitly via the goddess. Outside of the opening verse and reference to the \"certain image\", the goddess is never explicitly referred to. Such astral relationships [xxv]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. with the pagan gods are hinted at in Agrippa, but are most explicit in Ficino's astrological practice, which used ancient Orphic Hymns to attract stellar influence and affect the soul of the singer, rather than to call down the favour of the pagan divinities for whom they were originally composed.19 Further hints of Classicism can be found throughout the text, such as the specification that the Seal of Venus should be engraved upon Cyprian copper, an allusion to the Classical myth that Aphrodite was born at sea and came ashore at Cyprus.20 The author also demonstrates his Classical learning during the consecration of the magical book, or Liber Spirituum, for which he has composed three verses loosely in the Sapphic style. Despite the author seeming to pay little heed to the prosody of the Sapphic form, and one of the lines being too long, this verse is still something of a novelty in the realm of grimoire literature, which usually prefer more utilitarian forms of writing, generally drawing on a Biblical 'fire and brimstone' approach.21 Since Sappho was best known for her erotic lyrics, the Sapphic verse-form would be appropriate for a work dealing with Venereal forces. Some of the most striking aspects of the Tuba Veneris are the numerological characteristics. The text is dominated by instances of the number six, the use of which ultimately derives from Pythagorean philosophy. Although the number seven is most often associated with Venus, the author has obsessively structured his work around the number six: the seal is six-sided, there are six daemons and the circle is six feet in diameter, and so on. The only other magical text contemporary with the work that has a comparable numerological obsession is the Heptarchia Mystica-a magical work undoubtedly by Dee, [XXVI] The .:.'-'Iagic '!J1 l which uses a sevenfold sci� Veneris goes further than , .. employment of number. � 'J_'he �otion of six as a � Agnppa s Three Books cif1.· the numbers ascribed to the states: : \"The number six, which co�. sexes, is by the Pythagoreans , belongs to Venus, and Juno.._ By 'a Commixtion cifOOtlt six is, according to Pyth of the first 'masculine' n number (two).

However, the 'Tuba Veneris goes further than the Heptarchia in its meticulous employment of number. The notion of six as a Venereal number is recorded in Agrippa's Three Books if Occult Philosophy. In his discussion of the numbers ascribed to the gods\" by the Pythagoreans\", Agrippa states: \"The number six, which consists of two threes, as a Commixtion of both sexes, is by the Pythagoreans ascribed to generation, and marriage, and belongs to Venus, and Juno.\"22 By 'a Commixtion if both sexes' Agrippa is pointing out that six is, according to Pythagorean numerology, the multiplication of the first 'masculine' number (three) and the first 'feminine' number (two). This notion of odd numbers as masculine and even numbers as feminine is recorded in part five of Aristotle's Metaphysics: \" ... there are ten principles, which they arrange in two columns of cognates-limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and plurality; right and left, male and female, resting and moving, straight and curved, light and darkness, good and bad, square and oblong.\"\"\" It is worth noting that this system of binary correspondences, along with Theon of Smyrna's writing on the quaternary, are the ancient templates for the systems of occult correspondences that flourished in the Hermeticism of the Renaissance. 24 Most notable among these the tables in Agrippa' s Occult Philosophy ( 15.'31) and the later collection of magical correspondences, derivative of Agrippa, that are presented in the Magical Calendar of Frankfurt Hermeticist Johann Baptista Grosschedel (1620).25 The number three seems to play a part of secondary importance in the text. For example, with the exception of [XXVII]"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"a � I I I f ' I 1 Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. Amabosar, the daemons mentioned in the text have names consisting of three syllables. This means that the total number of syllables in the daemonic names comes to 19 (3+3+.'3+.'3+.'3+4). 19 multiplied by 6, the number of prime importance in the text, is 114-the number of syllables in three Sapphic stanzas. This may, however, be coincidence-such are the difficulties of analysing works of this nature-or it may indicate that the daemons are bound to the book through a numerological relation between their names and the verses used to consecrate it. The Influence if Contemporary Magical Literature As has been noted above, Agrippa seems to have been instrumental in imparting Classical influences to our author. However, Agrippa's work concentrated almost solely on the theories behind natural, astral and spiritual magic. For Agrippa to set down the particulars of practice, such as the invocations, instructions for ritual regalia and so forth would undoubtedly have been folly on many levels. Therefore the detailed instructions for practical ritual magic generally circulated privately in manuscripts, occasionally being printed where sympathetic communities flourished, such as in the Rhineland Palatinate of the 17th century.26 It is evident that the author the 'Iuba Veneris had access to several such practical works. The Book if the Spirits, or Liber Spirituum, is mentioned in the Key if Solomon amongst others. However, the author's description of the book has striking similarities with the process described in The Fourth Book if [XXVIII] The .1.\\fagic tij I Occult Philosophy, attributedtj and the Fourth Book descri ... the names, invocations � mentions binding the book ' talismans on the first and his authority over the dae book.

J The Magic of the Tuba Veneris. Occult Philosophy, attributed to Agrippa. Both the Tuba Veneris and the Fourth Book describe the Liber Spirituum as containing the names, invocations and seals of the spirits. Agrippa mentions binding the book between two curious apocalyptic talismans on the first and last leaves of the book, presumably indicative of divine power over --!he spirits.27 Similarly, the author of the Tuba Veneris suggests that the 'character of Venus' (presumably the double-sided hexagonal seal) be drawn upon the book, alongside the aforementioned 'certain image' of the goddess, presumably with a similar purpose in mind. In addition to this, the angel Anael is called upon to impose his authority over the daemons during the consecration of the book. Such magical books seem to have been commonplace in the toolkit of the ritual magician. Both Mathers' composite Solomonic work and Agrippa' s Fourth Book seem to indicate that the spirits will appear immediately upon opening the book and reading their conjurations.28 Richard Kieckhefer, in his discussion of consecrated magical books, notes that the tradition of the Liber Spirituum was widespread by at least the 15th century and that if a magician were to find his rituals ineffectual then his book could be re-consecrated according to certain techniques and its efficacy to be restored. 29 Once the book has been written and consecrated Agrippa advises caution, saying that the book \"is to be adorned, garnished, and kept secure, with Registers and Seals, lest it should happen after the consecration to open in some place not intended, and endanger the operator.\" Although many modern authors have claimed that the (often very lengthy and tedious) prayers and conjurations [XXIX]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. of ritual magic should be addressed from memory, it would appear that the commonly perceived image of the magician in his circle reading aloud from a magical book is actually closest to the authentic procedure of magical evocation-at least in this instance. The author's instruction to bury the magical implements \"in the earth next to the powers of .flowing water,\" until such time as they are required is significant. It stirs up once more the connection between Venus and the underground and is an explicit instruction to put the items in a place of Venereal influence. Agrippa provides a list of geographical features that are ascribed to the planets, amongst them: \"To Venus, pleasant fountains, green Meadows, flowrishing [flourishing] Gardens, garnished beds, stews [brothels J (and according to Orpheus) the sea, the sea shore, baths, dancing-places, and all places belonging to women.\"30 (My italics). The association of water with Venus again harkens back to the Classical mythology surrounding the birth of Aphrodite­the goddess was born from foam when Uranus' genitals were cut off and cast into the sea by his son, Kronos.31 Agrippa mentions Orpheus, who sings in his Hymn to Venus that she is \"njoicing in the azure shores, Near where the sea with foaming billows roars. \"32 As with the Liber Spirituum, the trumpet is not a unique ritual device. It is found elsewhere in magical literature, but nowhere is it as strikingly employed as in the Tuba Veneris. One is notably used in the Key of Solomon and related manuscripts as a preparation for the conjuration of the spirits, where it is blown to the \"four quarters of the Universe.\"33 The trumpet is generally an instrument associated with war, and therefore [xxx] The J!agic� a Martial influence.

However, there is a list of the musical instruments-music being associated with Venus-in Giordano Bruno's De Imaginum Compositione, which mentions the lituus, a type of curved horn used in warfare, whose form is similar to that held by the image of the goddess, although such instruments were usually cast in brass, rather than being made of animal horn.34 The warlike nature of the horn could perhaps be interpreted as relating to the influence in war that the demons are claimed to possess. In the Tuba Veneris the horn is to be taken from a live, but presumably sedated, bull-the zodiacal animal of Taurus, whose ruling planet is Venus. After which the horn is washed with a solution of vitriol (copper sulfate) and wine vinegar. This results in a natural dye, giving the horn a blue-green tint . The six-sided Seal of Venus itself is analogous to the Pentacle of Solomon employed in the 17th century magical text called the Goetia, as well as with the lamen prescribed by many other texts as a symbol of authority over the spirits. In both the Goetia and Tuba Veneris, the magician wears the seal, or pentacle, whilst carrying out the ritual operations. Both texts also employ the technique of applying heat to the seal of a spirit as a form of torture to encourage it to appear, or to discipline it if unruly. While the Goetia advises the use of a heated box, the Tuba Veneris recommends heating the seal itself and applying it to the wax characters of the spirits-an approach presumably used because wax is less durable than the metals upon which the Gaelic seals are inscribed. The magical circle is a device found in almost every grimoire. The primary purpose of the circle in ritual magic [XXXI]"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. seems to be for protection: \"It is,\" the author of the Tuba Veneris says \"just as a very strong fortress, in order to protect themselves from the snares if the Daemons.\" The circle is usually inscribed with names and words of power and this particular example contains three bands with the following words derived from Judea-Christian religious/magical formulae: +Mi+chael+AGLA+Uri+el+ALPHA+ Gabriel +OMEGA+ Raph+ael +ON +Joan +nes+ JESUS+ Lu +case+ NAZ + RENUS +Ma+thew+REX+Mar+cus+JUDEORUM (\"Jesus if Nazareth, King if the Jews') +TETRAGRAMMATON +JEHOVA +ELOHIM+ADONAY The circle is divided into four quarters, its fourfold nature reflected in the use of the names of the four angels of the cardinal points and the four evangelists. Interestingly, the order of the names to the cardinal points does not correspond to the order given in Agrippa or other sources with which I am familiar. For example, proceeding clockwise from the north, Grosschedel's Magical Calendar gives the orders Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael for the angels and the Matthew, Mark, Luke and John for the evangelists.35 It seems as though the names attributed to the south and west have been exchanged for some reason. It seems unlikely, given his obvious learning, but one explanation for this is that perhaps the author was unconcerned with the symbolic relationship between names and directions, but solely sought to use them to strengthen his circle.

The dove, a feather of which is used to write the Liber Spirtiuum, is associated with Venus in Agrippa's table of correspondences for the number seven.36 Once more the vitriolic water is used, both to write the book and to consecrate it.37 It seems probable that one the sources the author consulted was some variant on Grosschedel's Magical Calendar, if not the version published by Theodorus de Bry in 1620. The Calendar is a synthesis of Agrippa' s magical correspondences and material from Paracelsus, pseudo-Agrippa and other sources presumably from manuscripts contemporary with those authors. It presents a set of seven very interesting seals relating to the planets, which seem to increase in complexity as they progress from Saturn to Luna. Fig. 1.

The Seal of Venus prescribed by the 'Tuba Veneris contains a version of the sigil enclosed in the heptagon above, along with the sign of the angel Anael. This sign of Anael would have been well-known to practitioners of magic throughout Europe. It is most famously described in the Heptameron, a text of ritual magic attributed to the 13th century scholar Peter d' Abano, but which was most likely composed no earlier than the cusp of the 15th and 16th centuries. By 1600 it was certainly circulating alongside the pseudo-Agrippa's FourthBook.39 Ultimately these angelic sigils can be traced back to Medieval texts such as Liber Juratus and the 'Manual if AstralMagic'.40 As an aside it may be worth noting that the Liber Juratus seemingly refers to the sign as being that of all the Venereal angels, rather than specifically belonging to Anael. eA.nail.

However, the latter theory seems doubtful at present: the lists of planetary characters from Geomantic sources of which I am aware do not have any sigils for Conjunctio that display this form.

Chthonic Powers and Steganographic Daemonology While we are touching on the subject of the daemons it may be useful to look more closely at their natures as indicated by the text.

Once more, the connection is made clear from the initial verses, which mention an 'inftrnal dweller' being subjugated by the sound of the horn.

In the Testament, the demons that spread disease can often be exorcised by the invocation of their corresponding angel. The Tuba Veneris confirms that these daemons are 'evil', and although it assures the reader that the techniques for calling them are safe unless abused, this does not seem like the kind of magic that Dee, with his pious thirst for divine knowledge, would have pursued. One of the most enigmatic aspects of the text are the conjurations that accompany the daemonic sigils. These are strings of what have become known as 'barbarous' words­inscrutable formulae that may simply be nonsense or may once have been words in foreign languages. There are none of the familiar formulae of Judea-Christian magic in these conjurations. Perhaps this is the 'language not particular to us mortals, or even comprehensible to us,' which the author mentions in his preface-the tongue of the spirits. Dee was, of course, notorious for his work with angels and the codification of the 'Enochian' language; perhaps this is being alluded to by our author. The conjurations may otherwise be in a magical language derived by similar visionary means ... or they may simply be 'gibberish'. That is not to say that 'gibberish' words cannot be as magi­cal as well worn foreign words or religious formulae. Aquinas [XXXVII]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. discusses his belief that all the apparatus of magic, such as signs, pentacles and words can only work through being beheld by some intelligent entity. Which is to say that signs and words have no inherent power, rather their meanings are agreed by the parties involved, who act on them accordingly.44 If such a position was considered then even the most obscure words and signs may be considered compacts between the magician and other entities. There is, however, also the possibility that the conjurations are a cipher-an example of Steganographia, or 'Hidden Writing', an area in which Dee was also particularly interested, and the study of which went in and out of vogue during the course of the Renaissance. There are some parallels that may be drawn between the 'Tuba Veneris and Trithemius' Steganographia-a work which Dee went to great lengths to procure, succeeding in 1562. Both works use invocations consisting of seemingly made-up words. Also, the works give little indication of the particular talents allocated to each spirit, instead speaking about them in general terms. The 'Tuba Veneris tells us that the spirits are useful in the following ways: \" ... for the finding of hidden treasures, for journeys, for Business, for Navigation at sea, for war, and for similar things which the Spirits are able to do for you and be of service to you.\" Trithemius applies his Steganographic 'spirits' (or modes of ciphering secret messages) to similar situations. For example: a prince planning the overthrow a city uses Steganographic methods in order to securely share his plans; a discoverer of treasure wishes to notify trustworthy friends to help him remove it so he sends a ciphered message, and so on.45 [XXXVIII] 1 The Jiagic � I However, attempts t� of both Trithemius' Su · the mysterious conjura · · ... been unsuccessful.46 If the C!ll cryptography, then it is� by some kind of mechanical An example of such a tee letters that creates perm name (as detailed in the\" -the names of astrological or perhaps even something by Dee and Kelly to dictate It seems there is some • • the 'Tuba Veneris.

However, attempts to apply the cryptographic techniques of both Trithemius' Steganographia and his Polygraphia to the mysterious conjurations in the 'Tuba Veneris have so far been unsuccessfuP6 If the conjurations are not examples of cryptography, then it is possible that they may have been derived by some kind of mechanical method for purely magical purposes. An example of such a technique would be a table of words or letters that creates permutations of a single magical word or name (as detailed in the various Cabalistic tables for discovering the names of astrological spirits in Agrippa' s Occult Philosophy), or perhaps even something akin the complex letter squares used by Dee and Kelly to dictate the Enochian language.47 It seems there is some kind of structure to the language of the 'Tuba Veneris. The words used all have between two and four syllables, with certain syllables occurring frequently. For example, a significant number of words begin with;1l' or 'Ham', have 'ga' for their central syllable or terminate with 'roth' or 'zoth'. It's tantalising to speculate that there must be some system behind these words, although exactly how it works still remains obscure. There is also a curious relationship between the number of syllables in each conjuration, tabulated here, which may provide some further clue to the inner workings of the grimoire: Spirit Amabosar Belzazel Alkyzub Falkaroth Mephga�ub Moganp Syllable Count 41 42 44 45 46 47 Fig, 5.

Possibly the above does indicate a numerological or cryptographic mystery here to be solved-or perhaps these words are indeed \"not particular to us mortals\". Subsequent Influence: The German 'Tradition It seems likely that the Tuba Veneris was composed in Germany, or at least enjoyed an enthusiastic reception there. Not only do several of the extant manuscripts belong to German institutions and have their provenance from German collections, but there is also a group of grimoires that seem to ultimately derive from the work. These texts fall into what has become known as the 'Faustian' school of grimoire literature. Works of this genre are generally characterised by an unforgiving bloody fixation upon all things demonic. Although similarly bloodthirsty rituals are found in earlier texts of Medieval magic, the Faust-books rose to the level of popular and titillating literature in Germany being especially prevalent throughout the 18th century.48 It is no surprise that when a German version of Tuba Veneris came into print for the first time it was in late 18th century Germany.49 Several German works relating to the Tuba Veneris can be found in the great 19th century compilations of printed works assembled by Horst and Scheible, along with other examples in manuscript form. Both Scheible and Horst preserve several works of interest attributed to Josef Anton Herpentil, variously described as a philosopher or a Jesuit. [XL] Herpentil's 'di,ine its method.

The texts discussed here are difficult to date, especially in relation to the Tuba Veneris, although one is naturally suspicious the dates assigned to them by their printers and copyists. Generally these dates fall within the first half of the sixteenth century but appear to be spurious. For example: several Herpentil texts claim him as a Jesuit, although their alleged dates of composition invariably fall before the 1534 formation of the Society of Jesus!50 The Handwarterbuch des deutschen aberglaubens, an epic catalogue of Germanic lore, contains an article by Jacoby that dates the works ofHerpentil to end of the 17th century, or early 18th century.51 Amongst the literature attributed to Herpentil, it is the In be griff der Ubernatiirlichen Magie that is of most interest. The Inbegrif.fseems to preserve more of the Tuba Veneris material than any of the other grimoires that will be discussed here, incorporating as it does all of the conjurations of the spirits into its text. The Inbegrif.f details a ritual to conjure the three 'great princes', namely: Almischak, Aschirika and Amabosar.52 Amabosar is, of course, one of pseudo-Dee's spirits, although the derivation of the other two names is as yet obscure. Herpentil's 'divine magic' owes a lot to the Tuba Veneris in its method. The circle is similarly made from paper, although in this instance the words are inscribed with the blood of a white pigeon. The author also stresses the need to retire to an undisturbed place where the conjuror will withdraw with his circle and a wand inscribed with the seal of the spirit in weasel blood. The planetary seal also occurs, but has been transformed into the golden Seal of Jupiter, the names of whose angels are [XLI]"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. written upon it in the blood of a white dove. In keeping with the ritual of pseudo-Dee, this seal must be laid upon any money that the spirits bring to the operator and there is also mention of applying heat to coerce obstinate spirits. As previously mentioned, the conjurations of the Inbegzff incorporate all of those from the 'Tuba Veneris. They occur in order, although they have been merged together to give one conjuration for each prince: Inbegriff der Ubernatilrlichen Magie Almischak Aschirika Amabosar Tuba Veneris Mogarip, Amabosar, Alkyzub Falkaroth, Belzazel Mephgazub Fig. 6. The spirits of Herpentil and their corresponding conjurations in the Tuba Veneris. While the dismissal of the spirit is also the same as in the 'Tuba Veneris, none of the subtleties that mark the author of the 'Tuba Veneris out as a man of sensitivity and learning are present in this or the other texts here mentioned. They are generally, save for the introduction, workmanlike and lacking in those elements that make the work of pseudo-Dee so unique. Even their introductions, usually providing us with a fanciful lineage for the art, with obligatory mentions of Egypt and the Middle East, are poorly executed mystical cliches compared to the Tuba Veneris and its pleasing attempts to pass itself off as the work of Dee in addition to its powerful verse and imagery. There is a related work that seems to draw on both the Herpentil text discussed above and also the same author's Liber Spirituum Potentis.

Once again, the sigils provided for the spirits are different and in this case so are the conjurations. However, many aspects of the ritual are similar: the magus carries the wand, inscribed with blood (although of a white dove in this case), while an ornately decorated mitre and belt have been borrowed from the Liber Spirituum Potentis. Finally, there is a very short work entitled Magia Ordinis, attributed to one Johannes Kornreutheri (Johann Kornritter), an Augustinian Prior. This work, like the Compendium, is also linked to Herpentil's Liber Spirituum Potentis in its use of the circle, staff and mitre-again liberally scrawled upon with animal blood. The date of authorship is allegedly 1515, although the entry for the manuscript version held by the Wellcome Institute dates it to the early 18th century. 54 Of the five spirits dealt with in Magia Ordinis, two have curiously familiar names: Azabhsar (Amabosar) and Mebhazzubb (Mephgazub ). Once again the ritual has aspects that ultimately relate to the 'Tuba Veneris, via Herpentil. The circle of paper and retirement to an undisturbed place are key elements, along with the taboo on talking during the ritual and use of heat to compel the spirits.55 Further connections between the texts under discussion can be drawn. Each text has a preface to the reader allegedly from [XLIII]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. the pen of the pseudonymous author. Intriguingly, as with the Tuba Veneris, the work of pseudo-Scot addresses the readers as Amatoribus Artis Magicae. All the texts make a connection between the practice of magical conjuration and the occult arts of the Middle East and furthermore, the Herpen til text perhaps alludes to its primary source as the Tuba Veneris by describing the magic under discussion as 'an English science'. Since Amabosar is common to all of the works discussed above, a comparison between the seals and conjurations of the spirit is here provided: Tuba Veneris Amabosar! Amabosar! Amabosar!

Comparison of the seals and invocations of Amabosar. As noted above, the presence of these spirits in these documents indicates a possible German provenance for the Tuba Veneris. Along with the 18th century German edition of the text, two of the three manuscripts of the Tuba Veneris belong to libraries in Germany-the Universitatsbibliothek Erlangen-Ni.irnberg and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. Conclusion Through this examination of the sources of the Tuba Veneris we may conclude that the author was a keen student of the type of magic advocated by Agrippa, and that he had diligently studied the Three Books if Occult Philosophy, constructing a practical grimoire from the theoretical discussions of magic contained therein. The work, with its Classical allusions [xLv]"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. and Neoplatonic and Pythagorean bias represents the apex of the grimoire genre, certainly in terms of the artistry and historical awareness of the author. The attempts at Sapphic verse, regardless of prosodic errors, also indicate an affinity with the Classical world and the workings of a sensitive and poetic mind, especially when compared to the unsophisticated conjurations found in most grimoires of the period. However, it appears that this style of grimoire was an evolutionary dead-end. The works that were derivative of it lacked any of the charm and awareness that make it such an intriguing and enigmatic text. Instead the German grimoire-makers dragged the ritual through new and bloodier underworlds, hauling the spirits from their pagan Hades into a very Christian Hell. By the time Scheible published his epic Doctor Johann Faust's Magia N aturalis et Innaturalis even Anael, 'great prince of Heaven', had been assimilated into the infernal hordes of Faustian magic.58 The Faustian author describes him as the \"fifth lord of Hell and under the power if the angel Haniel,\" while the accompanying plate depicts the fallen one as a hunch-backed, red-eyed, ape like demon in fine clothes. From the trousers of these protrudes a conspicuously erect tail as he tugs on the cloak of a woman walking in front of him. Of course, like other classically inclined authors of the time, the author was well aware that he is living in the Christian era, and the pagan goddess is redefined as a planetary image of Venus, in line with the prevalent cosmological and astrological doctrines of the period. I conclude that the author was a Christian who saw nothing wrong with using knowledge that, since it originated from respected 'virtuous pagan' authors, [XLVI] The �1Iagic � could be seen as being o The piety of the au question by his designati· Art' or 'N egromancy'.

The Magic of the Tuba Veneris. could be seen as being compatible with Christian doctrines. The piety of the author, however, may be called into question by his designation of the text as a work of the 'Black Art' or 'Negromancy'. He mentions three divisions of magical art, namely: 'Magic, Kabbala, and Negromancy'. I would suggest that this indicates the main streams into which the art of magic is divided. First there is the natural magic, which also encompasses astrological and talismanic works. Second is the magical theology of Kabbala. Therefore by 'negromancy' he intends to indicate all magic that involves the conjuration of spirits. To this end he makes it clear that in spite of the text dealing with stygian daemons, he is presenting a true work of magic that can be practiced without risking ruin in this world or perdition in the next. This is as opposed to the base works of magic that lead men into diabolic pacts and are rightly proscribed by the church. We also find this curious categorisation in the later German works. Herpentil, for example, refers to his art as 'Black Magic,' but insists that it is a divine and holy science.59 Perhaps the implication is that such magic is 'black' in so far as it relates to the nocturnal conjurations of subterranean daemons, and yet 'holy' in that it operates through the aid of divine and celestial agencies, such as the angel Anael. From the influence on the Herpentil, Kornritter and pseudo­Scot, all German publications, along with the geographical distribution of extant Tuba Veneris manuscripts, it may be speculated that the author was based in Germany and may have had an awareness of the Hermetic works being published by the Palatinate house of Theodorus de Bry, or at least had [XLVII]"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. access to one of the sources used for the Magical Calendar. This would place the composition of the 'Iuba Veneris to circa 1620, that is, after De Brys publication of Grosschedel' s Magical Calendar. It is this work that contains the seven planetary seals the provenance of which are otherwise-at the time of writing-obscure. Regardless of the exact location of the author in time and space the 'Iuba Veneris provides us with a perfect example of how the theoretical elements of Renaissance magic, such as those discussed in Agrippa's treatise, may have been put into practice by an enterprising magician. Despite being a work of considerable brevity, I know of no other ritual magic text that employs the systems of occult philosophy and planetary correspondence that flowered in the wake of Agrippa so methodically and thoughtfully. On a practical level it is as if the author has provided us with a template or textbook example after which we may also compose our own planetary rituals: the Scythe of Saturn and Sceptre of the Phoebus almost demand such an interpretation. In conclusion, the 'Iuba Veneris is truly a gift to all the lovers of the magical art. [XLVIII] Philip Legard March 31, 2010 Leeds, United Kingdom Abognazar.

Dee was altogether a wonderful man, and had he lived in an age when folly and superstition were less rife, he would, with the same powers which he enjoyed, have left behind him a bright and enduring reputation. He was born in London, in the year 1527, and very early manifested a love for study. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Cambridge, and delighted so much in his books, that he passed regularly eighteen hours every day among them. Of the other six, he devoted four to sleep and two for refreshment. Such intense application did not injure his health, and could not fail to make him one of the first scholars of his time.

He studied alchymy, astrology, and magic, and thereby rendered himself obnoxious to the authorities at Cambridge. To avoid persecution, he was at last obliged to retire to the university of Lou vain; the rumours of sorcery that were current respecting him rendering his longer stay in England not altogether without danger. He found at Louvain many kindred spirits who had known Cornelius Agrippa while he resided among them, and by whom he was constantly entertained with the wondrous deeds of that great master of the hermetic mysteries. From their conversation he received much encouragement to continue the search for the philosopher's stone, which soon began to occupy nearly all his thoughts. He did not long remain on the Continent, but returned to England in 1551, being at that time in the twenty-fourth year of his age. By the influence of his friend, Sir John Cheek, he was kindly received at the court of King Edward VI, and rewarded (it is difficult to say for what) with a pension of one hundred crowns. He continued for several years to practise in London as an astrologer; casting nativities, telling fortunes, and pointing out lucky and unlucky days. During the reign of Queen Mary he got into trouble, being suspected of heresy, and charged with attempting Mary's life by means of enchantments. He was tried for the latter offence, and acquitted; but was retained in prison on the former charge, and left to the tender mercies of Bishop Bonner. He had a very narrow escape from being burned in Smithfield, but he, somehow or other, contrived to persuade that fierce bigot that his orthodoxy was unimpeachable, and was set at liberty in 1555.

On the accession of Elizabeth, a brighter day dawned upon him. During her retirement at Woodstock, her servants appear to have consulted him as to the time of Mary's death, which Circumstance, no doubt, first gave rise to the serious charge for which he was brought to trial. They now came to consult him more openly as to the fortunes of their mistress; and Robert Dudley, the celebrated Earl of Leicester, was sent by command of the Queen herself to know the most auspicious day for her coronation. So great was the favour he enjoyed that, some years afterwards, Elizabeth condescended to pay him a visit at his house in Mortlake, to view his museum of curiosities, and, when he was ill, sent her own physician to attend upon him. Astrology was the means whereby he lived, and he continued to practise it with great assiduity; but his heart was in alchymy. The philosopher's stone and the elixir of life haunted his daily thoughts and his nightly dreams. The Talmudic mysteries, which he had also deeply studied, impressed him with the belief, that he might hold converse with spirits and angels, and learn from them all the mysteries of the universe. Holding the same idea as the then obscure sect of the Rosicrucians, some of whom he had perhaps encountered in his travels in Germany, he imagined that, by means of the philosopher's stone, he could summon these kindly spirits at his will. By dint of continually brooding upon the subject, his imagination became so diseased, that he at last persuaded himself that an angel appeared to him, and promised to be his friend and companion as long as he lived. He relates that, one day, in November 1582, while he was engaged in fervent prayer, the window of his museum [ LIX J"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. looking towards the west suddenly glowed with a dazzling light, in the midst of which, in all his glory, stood the great angel Uriel. Awe and wonder rendered him speechless; but the angel smiling graciously upon him, gave him a crystal, of a convex form, and told him that, whenever he wished to hold converse with the beings of another sphere, he had only to gaze intently upon it, and they would appear in the crystal and unveil to him all the secrets of futurity.* This saying, the angel disappeared. Dee found from experience of the crystal that it was necessary that all the faculties of the soul should be concentrated upon it, otherwise the spirits did not appear. He also found that he could never recollect the conversations he had with the angels. He therefore determined to communicate the secret to another person, who might converse with the spirits while he (Dee) sat in another part of the room, and took down in writing the revelations which they made. He had at this time in his service, as his assistant, one Edward Kelly, who, like himself, was crazy upon the subject of the philosopher's stone. There was this difference, however, between them, that, while Dee was more of an enthusiast than an impostor, Kelly was more of an impostor than an enthusiast. *The \"crystal\" alluded to appears to have been a black stone, or piece of polished coal. The following account of it is given in the Supplement to Granger's Biographical History. \"The black stone into which Dee used to call his spirits was in the collection of the Earls of Peterborough, from whence it came to Lady Elizabeth Germaine. It was next the property of the late Duke of Argyle, and is now Mr. Walpole's.

This mutilation, degrading enough in any man, was destructive to a philosopher; Kelly, therefore, lest his wisdom should suffer in the world's opinion, wore a black skull-cap, which, fitting close to his head, and descending over both his cheeks, not only concealed his loss, but gave him a very solemn and oracular appearance. So well did he keep his secret, that even Dee, with whom he lived so many years, appears never to have discovered it. Kelly, with this character, was just the man to carry on any piece of roguery for his own advantage, or to nurture the delusions of his master for the same purpose. No sooner did Dee inform him of the visit he had received from the glorious Uriel, than Kelly expressed such a fervour of belief that Dee's heart glowed with delight. He set about consulting his crystal forthwith, and on the 2nd of December 1581, the spirits appeared, and held a very extraordinary discourse with Kelly, which Dee took down in writing. The curious reader may see this farrago of nonsense among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum. The later consultations were published in a folio volume, in 1659, by Dr. Meric Casaubon, under the title of A True and Faithful Relation if what passed between Dr. John Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded, to a general Alteration if most States and Kingdoms in the World.\" * Lilly, the astrologer, in his Life written by himself, frequently tells of prophecies delivered by the angels in a manner similar to the angels of Dr. Dee. He says, \"The prophecies were not given vocally by the angels, but by inspection of the crystal in types and figures, or by apparition the circular way; where, at some distance, the angels appear, representing by forms, shapes, and creatures what is demanded.

The fame of these wondrous colloquies soon spread over the country, and even reached the Continent. Dee, at the same time, pretended to be in possession of the elixir vitae, which he stated he had found among the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, in Somersetshire. People flocked from far and near to his house at Mortlake to have their nativities cast, in preference to visiting astrologers of less renown. They also longed to see a man who, according to his own account, would never die. Altogether, he carried on a very profitable trade, but spent so much in drugs and metals to work out some peculiar process of transmutation, that he never became rich. About this time there came into England a wealthy polish nobleman, named Albert Laski, Count Palatine of Siradz. His object was principally, he said, to visit the court of Queen Elizabeth, the fame of whose glory and magnificence had reached him in distant Poland. Elizabeth received this flattering stranger with the most splendid hospitality, and appointed her favourite Leicester to show him all that was worth seeing in England. He visited all the curiosities of London and Westminster, and from thence proceeded to Oxford and Cambridge, that he might converse with some of the great scholars whose writings shed lustre upon the land of their birth. He was very much disappointed at not finding Dr. Dee among them, and told the Earl of Leicester that he would not have gone to Oxford if he had known that Dee was not there.

A few days afterwards, the Earl and Laski being in the antechamber of the Queen, awaiting an audience of her Majesty, Dr. Dee arrived on the same errand, and was introduced to the Pole.* An interesting conversation ensued, which ended by the stranger inviting himself to dine with the astrologer at his house at Mortlake. Dee returned home in some tribulation, for he found he had not money enough, without pawning his plate, to entertain Count Laski and his retinue in a manner becoming their dignity. In this emergency he sent off an express to the Earl of Leicester, stating frankly the embarrassment he laboured under, and praying his good offices in representing the matter to her Majesty. Elizabeth immediately sent him a present of twenty pounds. On the appointed day, Count Laski came, attended by a numerous retinue, and expressed such open and warm admiration of the wonderful attainments ofhis host, that Dee turned over, in his own mind, how he could bind irretrievably * Albert Laski, son of Jaroslav, was Palatine of Siradz, and afterwards ofSendomir, and chiefly contributed to the election of Henry of Valois, the Third of France, to the throne of Poland, and was one of the delegates who went to France in order to announce to the new monarch his elevation to the sovereignty of Poland. After the deposition of Henry, Albert Laski voted for Maximilian of Austria. In 1585 he visited England, when Queen Elizabeth received him with great distinction. The honours which were shown him during his visit to Oxford, by the especial command of the Queen, were equal to those rendered to sovereign princes. His extraordinary prodigality rendered his enormous wealth insufficient to defray his expenses, and he therefore became a zealous adept in alchymy, and took from England to Poland with him two known alchymists.-Count Valerian Krasinski's Historical Sketch if the Rqormation in Poland.

Long acquaintance with Kelly had imbued him with all the roguery of that personage; and he resolved to make the Pole pay dearly for his dinner. He found out, before many days, that he possessed great estates in his own country, as well as great influence; but that an extravagant disposition had reduced him to temporary embarrassment. He also discovered, that he was a firm believer in the philosopher's stone and the water of life. He was, therefore, just the man upon whom an adventurer might fasten himself Kelly thought so too; and both of them set to work, to weave a web, in the meshes of which they might firmly entangle the rich and credulous stranger. They went very cautiously about it; first throwing out obscure hints of the stone and the elixir; and, finally, of the spirits, by means of whom they could turn over the pages of the Book of Futurity, and read the awful secrets inscribed therein. Laski eagerly implored that he might be admitted to one of their mysterious interviews with Uriel and the angels; but they knew human nature too well to accede at once to the request. To the Count's entreaties they only replied by hints of the difficulty or impropriety of summoning the spirits in the presence of a stranger; or of one who might, perchance, have no other motive than the gratification of a vain curiosity: but they only meant to whet the edge of his appetite by this delay, and would have been sorry indeed if the Count had been discouraged. To show how exclusively the thoughts both of Dee and Kelly were fixed upon their dupe, at this time, it is only necessary to read the introduction to their first interview with the spirits, related in the volume of Dr. Casaubon.

The �J r The Life of Doctor John Dee. entry made by Dee, under the date of the 25th of May 1583, says, that when the spirit appeared to them, \"I, [John Dee], and E. K. [Edward Kelly], sat together, conversing of that noble Polonian Albertus Laski, his great honour here with us obtained, and of his great liking among all sorts of the people.\" No doubt they were discussing how they might make the most of the \"noble Polonian,\" and concocting the fine story with which they afterwards excited his curiosity, and drew him firmly within their toils. \"Suddenly,\" says Dee, as they were thus employed, \"there seemed to come out of the oratory, a spiritual creature, like a pretty girl, of seven or nine years of age, attired on her head, with her hair rolled up before, and hanging down behind; with a gown of silk, of changeable red and green, and with a train. She seemed to play up and down, and seemed to go in and out behind the books; and, as she seemed to go between them, the books displaced themselves, and made way for her.\" With such tales as these they lured on the Pole from day to day; and at last persuaded him to be a witness of their mysteries. Whether they played off any optical delusions upon him; or whether, by the force of a strong imagination, he deluded himself, does not appear; but certain it is, that he became a complete tool in their hands, and consented to do whatever they wished him. Kelly, at these interviews, placed himself at a certain distance from the wondrous crystal, and gazed intently upon it; while Dee took his place in corner, ready to set down the prophecies as they were uttered by the spirits. In this manner they prophesied to the Pole, that he should become the fortunate possessor of the philosopher's stone; that [Lxv]"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. he should live for centuries, and be chosen King of Poland; in which capacity he should gain many great victories over the Saracens, and make his name illustrious over all the earth. For this pose it was necessary, however, that Laski should leave England, and take them with him, together with their wives and families; that he should treat them all sumptuously, and allow them to want for nothing. Laski at once consented; and very shortly afterwards they were all on the road to Poland. It took them upwards of four months to reach the Count's estates, in the neighbourhood of Cracow. In the mean time, they led a pleasant life, and spent money with an unsparing hand. When once established in the Count's palace, they commenced the great hermetic operation of transmuting iron into gold. Laski provided them with all necessary materials, and aided them himself with his knowledge of alchymy: but, somehow or other, the experiment always failed at the very moment that it ought to have succeeded; and they were obliged to recommence operations on a grander scale. But the hopes of Laski were not easily extinguished. Already, in idea, the possessor of countless millions, he was not to be cast down for fear of present expenses. He thus continued from day to day, and from month to month, till he was, at last, obliged to sell a portion of his deeply-mortgaged estates, to find aliment for the hungry crucibles of Dee and Kelly, and the no less hungry stomachs of their wives and families. It was not till ruin stared him in the face, that he awoke from his dream of infatuation -too happy, even then, to find that he had escaped utter beggary.

Not wishing The Life of Doctor John Dee. to quarrel with them, he proposed that they should proceed to Prague, well furnished with letters of recommendation to the Emperor Rudolph. Our alchymists too plainly saw that nothing more was to be made of the almost destitute Count Laski. Without hesitation, therefore, they accepted the proposal, and set out forthwith to the Imperial residence. They had no difficulty, on their arrival at Prague, in obtaining an audience of the Emperor. They found him willing enough to believe that such a thing as the philosopher's stone existed, and flattered themselves that they had made a favourable impression upon him; but, from some cause or other -- perhaps the look of low cunning and quackery upon the face of Kelly - the Emperor conceived no very high opinion of their abilities. He allowed them, however, to remain for some months at Prague, feeding themselves upon the hope that he would employ them: but the more he saw of them, the less he liked them; and, when the Pope's Nuncio represented to him, that he ought not to countenance such heretic magicians, he gave orders that they should quit his dominions within four-and-twenty hours. It was fortunate for them that so little time was given them; for, had they remained six hours longer, the Nuncio had received orders to procure a perpetual dungeon, or the stake, for them. Not knowing well where to direct their steps, they resolved to return to Cracow, where they had still a few friends; but, by this time, the funds they had drawn from Laski were almost exhausted; and they were many days obliged to go dinnerless and supperless. They had great difficulty to keep their poverty a secret from the world; but they managed to bear privation without murmuring, from a conviction that if [LXVII]"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. the fact were known, it would militate very much against their pretensions. Nobody would believe that they were possessors of the philosopher's stone, if it were once suspected that they did not know how to procure bread for their subsistence. They still gained a little by casting nativities, and kept starvation at arm's length, till a new dupe, rich enough for their purposes, dropped into their toils, in the shape of a royal personage. Having procured an introduction to Stephen, King of Poland, they predicted to him, that the Emperor Rudolph would shortly be assassinated, and that the Germans would look to Poland for his successor. As this prediction was not precise enough to satisfy the King, they tried their crystal again; and a spirit appeared, who told them that the new sovereign of Germany would be Stephen of Poland. Stephen was credulous enough to believe them, and was once present when Kelly held his mystic conversations with the shadows of his crystal. He also appears to have furnished them with money to carry on their experiments in alchymy: but he grew tired, at last, of their broken promises, and their constant drains upon his pocket; and was on the point of discarding them with disgrace, when they met with another dupe, to whom they eagerly transferred their services. This was Count Rosenberg, a nobleman of large estates, at Trebona, in Bohemia. So comfortable did they find themselves in the palace of this munificent patron, that they remained nearly four years with him, faring sumptuously, and having an almost unlimited command of his money. The Count was more ambitious than avaricious: he had wealth enough, and did not care for the philosopher's stone on account of the gold, but of the length of days it would bring him.

They prophesied that he should be chosen King of Poland; and promised, moreover, that he should live for five hundred years to enjoy his dignity; provided always, that he found them sufficient money to carry on their experiments. But now, while fortune smiled upon them; while they revelled in the rewards of successful villany, retributive justice came upon them in a shape they had not anticipated. Jealousy and mistrust sprang up between the two confederates, and led to such violent and frequent quarrels, that Dee was in constant fear of exposure. Kelly imagined himself a much greater personage than Dee; measuring, most likely, by the standard of impudent roguery; and was displeased that on all occasions, and from all persons, Dee received the greater share of honour and consideration. He often threatened to leave Dee to shift for himself; and the latter, who had degenerated into the mere tool of his more daring associate, was distressed beyond measure at the prospect of his desertion. His mind was so deeply imbued with superstition, that he believed the rhapsodies of Kelly to be, in a great measure, derived from his intercourse with angels; and he knew not where, in the whole world, to look for a man of depth and wisdom enough to succeed him. As their quarrels every day became more and more frequent, Dee wrote letters to Queen Elizabeth, to secure a favourable reception on his return to England; whither he intended to proceed, if Kelly forsook him. He also sent her a round piece of silver, which he pretended he had made of a portion of brass cut out of a warming-pan. He afterwards sent her the warming-pan also, that she might convince herself that [LXIX]"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. the piece of silver corresponded exactly with the hole which was cut into the brass. While thus preparing for the worst, his chief desire was to remain in Bohemia with Count Rosenberg, who treated him well, and reposed much confidence in him. Neither had Kelly any great objection to remain; but a new passion had taken possession of his breast, and he was laying deep schemes to gratify it. His own wife was ill-favoured and ill-natured; Dee's was comely and agreeable: and he longed to make an exchange of partners, without exciting the jealousy or shocking the morality of Dee. This was a difficult matter; but, to a man like Kelly, who was as deficient in rectitude and right feeling as he was full of impudence and ingenuity, the difficulty was not insurmountable. He had also deeply studied the character and the foibles of Dee; and he took his measures accordingly. The next time they consulted the spirits, Kelly pretended to be shocked at their language, and refused to tell Dee what they had said. Dee insisted, and was informed that they were henceforth to have their wives in common. Dee, a little startled, inquired whether the spirits might not mean that they were to live in common harmony and good-will? Kelly tried again, with apparent reluctance, and said the spirits insisted upon the literal interpretation. The poor fanatic, Dee, resigned himself to their will; but it suited Kelly's purpose to appear coy a little longer. He declared that the spirits must be spirits, not of good, but of evil; and refused to consult them any more. He thereupon took his departure, saying that he would never return. Dee, thus left to himself, was in sore trouble and distress of mind. He knew not on whom to fix as the successor to Kelly [LXX J \" TheL� for consulting the sp:-• boy of eight years of with great ceremon)\". dignified and awful to perform; but the the faith, nor the the crystal, as he was nothing.

He consecrated him to this service with great ceremony, and impressed upon the child's mind the dignified and awful nature of the duties he was called upon to perform; but the poor boy had neither the imagination, the faith, nor the artifice of Kelly. He looked intently upon the crystal, as he was told; but could see nothing and hear nothing. At last, when his eyes ached, he said he could see a vague indistinct shadow; but nothing more. Dee was in despair. The deception had been carried on so long, that he was never so happy as when he fancied he was holding converse with superior beings; and he cursed the day that had put estrangement between him and his dear friend Kelly. This was exactly what Kelly had foreseen; and, when he thought the Doctor had grieved sufficiently for his absence, he returned unexpectedly, and entered the room where the little Arthur was in vain endeavouring to distinguish something in the crystal. Dee, in entering this circumstance in his journal, ascribes this sudden return to a \"miraculous fortune,\" and a \"divine fate;\" and goes on to record that Kelly immediately saw the spirits, which had remained invisible to little Arthur. One of these spirits reiterated the previous command, that they should have their wives in common. Kelly bowed his head, and submitted; and Dee, in all humility, consented to the arrangement. This was the extreme depth of the wretched man's degradation. In this manner they continued to live for three or four months, when, new quarrels breaking out, they separated once more. This time their separation was final. Kelly, taking the elixir which he had found in Glastonbury [LXXI J"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. Abbey, proceeded to Prague, forgetful of the abrupt mode in which he had previously been expelled from that city. Almost immediately after his arrival, he was seized by order of the Emperor Rudolph, and thrown into prison. He was released after some months' confinement, and continued for five years to lead a vagabond life in Germany, telling fortunes at one place, and pretending to make gold at another. He was a second time thrown into prison, on a charge of heresy and sorcery; and he then resolved, if ever he obtained his liberty, to return to England. He soon discovered that there was no prospect of this, and that his imprisonment was likely to be for life. He twisted his bed-clothes into a rope, one stormy night in February 1595, and let himself down from the window of his dungeon, situated at the top of a very high tower. Being a corpulent man, the rope gave way, and he was precipitated to the ground. He broke two of his ribs, and both his legs; and was otherwise so much injured, that he expired a few days afterwards. Dee, for a while, had more prosperous fortune. The warming-pan he had sent to Queen Elizabeth was not without effect. He was rewarded, soon after Kelly had left him, with an invitation to return to England. His pride, which had been sorely humbled, sprang up again to its pristine dimensions; and he set out for Bohemia with a train of attendants becoming an ambassador. How he procured the money does not appear, unless from the liberality of the rich Bohemian Rosenberg, or perhaps from his plunder. He travelled with three coaches for himself and family, and three waggons to carry his baggage. Each coach had four horses, and the whole train was protected [LXXII] The Lift .. by a guard of four and doubted; but it is on the it on oath before the to inquire into his eire he had an audience of as far as words went. molested in his pursuits who boasted of the pow not, thought Elizabeth. gave him no more sub her countenance and p Thrown thus unex began in earnest the worked incessantly aiD0DJ1 and almost poisoned consulted his miraculOUSJ to him.

This statement may be doubted; but it is on the authority of Dee himself, who made it on oath before the commissioners appointed by Elizabeth to inquire into his circumstances. On his arrival in England he had an audience of the Queen, who received him kindly as far as words went, and gave orders that he should not be molested in his pursuits of chemistry and philosophy. A man who boasted of the power to turn baser metals into gold, could not, thought Elizabeth, be in want of money; and she, therefore, gave him no more substantial marks of her approbation than her countenance and protection. Thrown thus unexpectedly upon his own resources, Dee began in earnest the search for the philosopher's stone. He worked incessantly among his furnaces, retorts, and crucibles, and almost poisoned himself with deleterious fumes. He also consulted his miraculous crystal; but the spirits appeared not to him. He tried one Bartholomew to supply the place of the invaluable Kelly; but he being a man of some little probity, and of no imagination at all, the spirits would not hold any communication with him. Dee then tried another pretender to philosophy, of the name of Hickman; but had no better fortune. The crystal had lost its power since the departure of its great high-priest. From this quarter then Dee could get no information on the stone or elixir of the alchymists, and all his efforts to discover them by other means were not only fruitless but expensive. He was soon reduced to great distress, and wrote piteous letters to the Queen, praying relief. He represented that, after he left England with Count Laski, the mob had pillaged his house at Mortlake, accusing him of being [LXXIII J"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. a necromancer and a wizard; and had broken all his furniture, burned his library, consisting of four thousand rare volumes, and destroyed all the philosophical instruments and curiosities in his museum. For this damage he claimed compensation; and furthermore stated, that, as he had come to England by the Queen's command, she ought to pay the expenses of his journey. Elizabeth sent him small sums of money at various times; but, Dee still continuing his complaints, a commission was appointed to inquire into his circumstances. He finally obtained a small appointment as Chancellor of St. Paul's cathedral, which he exchanged, in 1595, for the wardenship of the college at Manchester. He remained in this capacity till 160'2 or 1603, when, his strength and intellect beginning to fail him, he was compelled to resign. He retired to his old dwelling at Mortlake, in a state not far removed from actual want, supporting himself as a common fortune-teller, and being often obliged to sell or pawn his books to procure a dinner. James I. was often applied to on his behalf, but he refused to do anything for him. It may be said to the discredit of this King, that the only reward he would grant the indefatigable Stowe, in his days of old age and want, was the royal permission to beg; but no one will blame him for neglecting such a quack as John Dee. He died in 1608, in the eighty-first year of his age, and was buried at Mortlake.

If truly you have the knowledge of this Invocation-that is, of the names and summon-ings or the appropriate words by which the spirits are called forth and ruled by the very Angels of the Planets themselves-and if you do not lack the remaining requisites given in our little book, soon both without delay, noise, or terror and with every phantasm far removed you will be able to try to compel the spirit to assume a human form. For you should know that the good angels have been placed over the evil spirits by God Thrice-Greatest and Best so that they should rule over them; on account of which when something is commanded by a good Spirit to a bad one, the former orders and calls the latter by means of his own capable invocation, and this perhaps may be in a language not particular to us mortals, or even comprehensible to us. Among learned men there are indeed various opinions about this, but there is nothing certain as of yet. For indeed truly the greatest Creator of all things placed a certain Character and name upon every created thing just as it is said \"He who numbers the multitude of the Stars and gives names to all things.\" (Psalm 146). However all the evil Daemons had names and sigils placed upon them by the Highest Creator when previously they were Angels and Stars in heaven; and through these same names and sigils it is wholly necessary to summon and compel them, by which means we are able to summon even the good angels, just as elsewhere I have taught and demonstrated.

This aforementioned science has been piously practiced by the ancient Hebrew and Chaldean Fathers and by many others, and may also be practiced nowadays by pious men. For therefore the Sciences are revealed: Magic, Qabala, and Negromancy, which previously flourished not a little among the Egyptians, Persians, and Arabs; when it was also practiced in a depraved, usurped, and deformed manner, in that men would willingly give themselves over into the hands of evil Daemons by means of blasphemous pacts, which certainly is horrible to hear. On account of this most vile abuse this Art was piously forbidden by the Church and by the Secular Authorities, and for this reason one can find exceedingly few suitable books concerning its practice. Therefore this our Trumpet, acquired by peculiar study, we desire to share with you faithfully for a good purpose, and by no means for your ruin (which arises from its abuse alone), and we bequeath it to you so that you may use it for your own good and to your advantage-e.g., for the finding of hidden treasures, for journeys, for Business, for Navigation at sea, for war, and for similar things which the Spirits are able to do for you and be of service to you. Practice and experience will be sufficient to teach you.

Wherefore our little book may be consecrated in the following manner. Let the little book be made from parchment, on which let the character ofVenus be inscribed and if it is pleasing, also a certain image representing the figure of this planet, with the sign of Venus above its head. Let the little book be entitled: A Little Book Sacred to the Black Venus."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris.

The whole of the little book ought therefore to be written during the oftentimes before said times of Venus, for which is further required a feather from a dove and ink which has prepared from copper-sulfate water and which has been used be no one else. Also the operator is able to use a red or green color as he pleases, since these colors are wholly pleasing to our Planet. After the little book has been made and written let it be fumigated. Then let Vitriolic water be taken with which the hand is to be filled, and the book baptized with it, saying: I consecrate you, 0 little black book, to Venus Let the Trumpet if Venus be your name Let it be terrible and well known To all the dwellers if the Underworld. 0 Great Prince if Heaven Anael!

Let it be buried in the earth with the other items, and at the prescribed time be unearthed and preserved for use. In What Manner the Operation Is To Be Carried Out F all of these aforesaid things have been prepared aright and are all ready at hand, and the operator has tested himself sufficiently, and has prepared himself so that he is capable and courageous (for this operation requires a man both dauntless and high-minded), in the same time which has often before been indicated-that is, in the hour and night of Venus-let him go to a place secure from any human disturbances; or let him go to his house, or better yet into a wood and crossroads deserted and unfrequented. There let the operator construct the circle and hang the seal of Venus over his neck. Let him then kindle the incense and begin to summon the Spirit from the assigned number chosen by him. Let the summoning of the spirit though be announced by the Trumpet of Venus, and let him call the Spirit by its own name, both at the beginning of the summoning and again at the end, but always with some pause. [ 29 J"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Libellus Veneri Nigro Sacer vel Tuba Veneris. Now let the operator welcome the arriving spirit with the following: Hail, noble and obedient Spirit (here let the Spirit be called by his own name) I I command you by the name Adonai and by this Seal (here let the operator show the Seal to the Spirit) qf the angel Anael, chiif ruler qf the sphere qf Venus, so that you show yourself quietly and peaceably, and that you fulfill my will in all qf the demands which I shall give you. 'Ihis I charge you again by God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and by the 'Triumphant Lord Jesus Christ who is coming to judge the world by fire. After this, the Spirit will ask the Operator why he has been summoned, and what it is that the Operator wishes. Let then the Operator state clearly and distinctly what it is that he wants. Here it is to be noted that if the Spirits show themselves in any way obstinate, the Seal of Venus should be taken and placed over the fire or over the coals upon which the incense has been lit, or if incense is not being used (as at this point it is not necessary) let the Seal be held over a burning candle so that it becomes warm, and then let it be placed over the Sigil of the spirit which is being summoned. By doing this the spirits are greatly tormented, and they will ask the operator to stop torturing them; and they will no longer refuse to carry out his wishes. Still let the Operator be not excessive in his requests and desires; for I may advise that you not perchance arouse the anger of the Divine Godhead. Nor should the Operator display an inconstant or hesitant mind to the wily Spirits; still less should he accept conditions of service proposed by them.

Nor must the Operator any less beware lest he use the assistance of the spirits for impious and wicked ends, toward which indeed the Spirits lend themselves all the more promptly; and thus indeed does the soul lie open to the greatest harm, for while the operator seeks to exercise his power over the Daemons he hands over his soul into their horrible possession. Wherefore again, in a few words, we faithfully urge that anyone and everyone refrain from the abuse of this art. But if the Spirits fulfill the commands or will of the Operator, they are to be licensed to depart as follows. The Banishing if the Spirits Let the banishing be done just as the invocation, through the trumpet of Venus, with these words: Norcados Fenoram Anosiren (let the spirit be called once by his own name and continue): OparcliimAmosan Zezaphilos Aspairath Anthyras Zyrif.fon.

With these words then we finish our little book. But you, Dear Reader! Beware of abusing that which has been written here, lest you forget something, and if you do anything do it wisely, with a calm and steady mind, and this book will be of usefulness and solace to you.
