Can hallucination invade the spheres of pure reason?! IN 1577, WHEN these diaries begin, John Dee was at the pinnacle of his extraordinary career. On the eve of his fiftieth birthday, he was renowned throughout Europe as a scientist, astrologer and mathematician. Although his reputation as a sorcerer had dogged him since his Cambridge days, he was at last sufficiently confident and well respected to be able to withstand his detractors. The previous decade had seen the completion of his most influential works. His preface to Euclid's Elements (1570) has been described as a brilliant summary of the current state of scientific knowledge: a summary which-because it was in English rather than Latin-helped to inspire a whole new class of readers, the artisans and technical craftsmen who would be crucial to the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century.2 It brought together a range of subjects which Dee argued were all subject to the power of numbers: including architecture, optics, music, astronomy and navigation. Navigation was also the subject of his next book, completed in the summer of 1576. General and Rare Memorials Pertaining to the Perfect Art of Navigation was the first of four projected volumes combining propaganda with practical information. His purpose was to show that the establishment of a 'British Empire' (a term coined by Dee) was possible, desirable and historically justified. The first few pages of John Dee's diary show how much interest he managed to generate in his vision of expansion. Explorers, writers and politicians were all keen to question him about it. Meanwhile there was a constant flow of other visitors who came to use his library-the largest private library in the country-and to seek ·his guidance. One of his most committed admirers was Queen Elizabeth, whose coronation day in January 1559 had been chosen by Dee on astrological grounds. The early triumphs of her reign, therefore, reflected favourably on Dee himself ~ vii ~"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE Yet all this was about to change. In the late 1570S and early 1580s he suffered a series of setbacks which have coloured his entire subsequent reputatIon. First came the dramatic failure of Martin Frobisher's 1578 expedition in search of a north-western passage to the orient. Convinced that such a route existed, Dee supported the enterprise financially as well as by giving some of the sailors lessons in geography and navigation. He also believed that the ore which Frobisher had collected on an earlier expedition contained gold. Therefore the fleet's return in the autumn of 1578 brought a double disappointment. Not only had Frobisher failed to find a north-west passage: his massive cargo of ore was now discovered to be worthless. England's first serious attempt to become a great maritime power, in the way that Dee had envisaged, had ended in humiliation. Perhaps partly as a result of this, no one would now take on the expense of publishing his remaining three volumes on navigation. Indeed, John Dee was never to publish another book. The greatest setback to his career, however, came in March 1582 with the arrival at Mortlake of a twenty-six-year-old Worcestershire man named Edward Kelly, who claimed to have mystical powers which he was prepared to use in Dee's service. Kelly (or Talbot, as he initially introduced himself) knew enough about Dee's preoccupations to be able to tell him exactly what he wanted to hear. Most crucially, he knew that Dee had become weary of seeking answers to the mysteries of the universe by reading books and in discourse with other scholars. Dee had long sought the key to all knowledge; his 1564 text Monas Hieroglyphica was an attempt to incorporate the sum of hidden knowledge into one all-powerful symbol. He believed that his immense learning and piety must mark him out from other mortals. Surely, if he could find a way of communicating with God, he would be granted the universal answers that he craved. Although there may be no truth in the legends that have grown up around Kelly-that he was a necromancer, who had been pilloried and whose ears had been cropped for forgery-these diaries show that he was initially viewed with the deepest suspicion. The story of how he nevertheless managed to ensnare one of the most brilliant polymaths of his day, and maintain his grip for so many years, makes this a document of great psychological and human interest. As one of the first private diaries in the English language, it is also of exceptional literary and historical importance. John Dee kept up his record intermittently for several decades, often describing events as they were actually unfolding. Parts of t. Vlll t."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION the text are so revealing that Dee subsequently went to great lengths to conceal what he had written. Some entries were deleted with ink or physically cut out; and whole volumes were buried underground or hidden in his chimney. The first parts to be published came to light through the persistence of the book-collector Sir Robert Cotton (1571-1631). According to the antiquary John Aubrey, Cotton bought the field where Dee was said to have buried them and proceeded to dig them up. The story is confirmed by Meric Casaubon, who edited the manuscripts and published them in 1659 under the title A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years Between Dr John Dee Vt Mathematician of Great Fame in Q Eliz. and King James their Reigns) and Some Spirits:3 The book had been buried in the earth, how long, years or months, I know not; but so long, though it was carefully kept since, yet it retained so much of the earth, that it began to moulder and perish some years ago, which when Sir Thomas C. [Sir Robert Cotton's son] observed, he was at the charges to have it written out, before it should be too late. Casaubon went on to state his belief that, although there were obvious gaps in the story, these were unlikely ever to be filled: Now full fifty years, or not many wanting, being passed since this original came to Sir Robert, it is very likely, that had any more i.n all that time been heard of, Sir Robert, or Sir Thomas, hi s son and heir, would have heard of it, and got it as soon as anybody else: and because no more hath been heard of all this while, it is more than probable that no more is extant, not in England, nor I think anywhere else. Just three years later, however, a London confectioner and his wife-a Mr and Mrs Jones-discovered a secret drawer in an old cedarwood chest they had bought. It turned out to contain some olive beads, a cross, and about a dozen manuscript books. Their maid managed to waste about half of the papers 'under pies and other like uses' before it occurred to anyone that they might be important. In 1672 they came to the notice of the antiquary Elias Ashmole, who immediately recognised them as Dee's, and realised that one of the manuscripts dealt with the eighteen months preceding the first seances reported in Casaubon's True and Faithful Relation-'insomuch that divers particulars in the printed book are not to be understood without them.'4 But although Ashmole studied the manuscripts in great detail, and made laborious transcriptions, he never attempted to fill the gaps in Casaubon's to ix to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE edition by bringing them into the public domain. For the next century or so the spirit diaries helped to confirm Dee's unsavoury reputation, already current in his lifetime. Then in the late 1830S two manuscripts were discovered in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford which shed new light on Dee as a person-the 'mighty good man' and 'great peacemaker' that John Aubrey had described him as. These manuscripts were edited by James Orchard Halliwell and published in 1842 under the title The Private Diary of Dr John Dee. It has become commonplace to bemoan the deficiencies of Halliwell's edition: yet its critics often repeat its mistakes or make new ones. Although I have tried to correct these errors, I feel it is important to acknowledge the pioneering work that the twenty-one-year-old Halliwell did more than 150 years ago. He was one of only a small group of enthusiasts who realised that everyday documents from recent centuries could be worthy of study at all. In bringing together the diary material from all these manuscripts for the first time, I have attempted to combine accuracy with readability. The text throughout has been transcribed from or checked against the original manuscripts in the British Library in London and the Bodleian Library in Oxford. I was also able to draw on the proofreading skills of three seventeenth-century scholars: Meric Casaubon, Elias Ashmole and William Shippen, whose own hand-corrected copies of A True and Faithful Relation are preserved in the British Library and the Bodleian (see Bibliography) . The complete text of the spirit conferences, however, would fill about five volumes, and therefore cuts have had to be made. Meric Casaubon himself wrote that had more of the spirit diaries ever corne to light, an abridgement would probably have sufficed. The diary elements have been retained, therefore, at the expense of what the scientist and diarist Robert Hooke dismissed as 'a rhapsody of incoherent and unintelligible whimsies of prayers and praises ... , strange characters, uncouth and unintelligible names ... and relations of incredible occurrences':5 although large parts of the rhapsody have been left to show what Dee found so seductive.6 For the sake of readability, the omissions are not indicated by rows of dots; these are only used in the text where the manuscript is actually illegible. Scholars looking for definitive versions· of the original manuscripts are referred to c.L. Whitby's excellent transcription of the Mortlake Actions, and William Sherman's new edition of Ashmole MSs 487 and 488 (currently in preparation). It seems unlikely that a definitive edition of what Casaubon published as A True and Faithful Relation will ever be produced. The Latin has been translated (with the generous help of Professor David"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Furley, formerly Professor of Classics at Princeton University), except where the meaning is obvious or so cryptic as to be impossible to render accurately. Times of the day have also been left, since there was no satisfactory way of translating expressions such as 'hora 27'S a meridie'. The short passages written in Greek characters have been retained to show what Dee most wanted to keep secret. Dee resorted to Greek characters in the same way that Samuel Pepys employed his own unconventional blend of schoolboy French and Spanish, and these entries are often the most revealing of all. Again for the sake of readability I have modernised the spelling, except where this would have destroyed the sense of period. I have followed the same rule for place-names. People's surnames presented a different problem, since spellings like 'Rawlegh' or 'Rawly' (both used by Dee) are no less correct than Raleigh or Ralegh. Not wishing to fill the index with all of Dee's variations of the same name, I have chosen one and stuck to it. Finally, this edition could not have been completed (or even started) without the help and encouragement of a number of people.

He entered these details in the margins of almanacs, alongside the printed data on the planetary configurations for each day. As he later explained to Queen Elizabeth, his aim was to discover 'the heavenly influences and operations actual in this elemental portion of the world: 1 Few of his contemporaries would have questioned his belief that the stars and planets had an influence on worldly events. Dee was unusual only in his desire to assess this influence scientifically. Although he never went back to analyse the data he had collected, the fact that he informed the Queen about his plans shows that he regarded diary-keeping as one of the most important aspects of his work. Since he was concerned primarily with recording dates and times, his lack of elaboration in this part of the diary is often frustrating. Yet even Dee's laconic style cannot obscure the fact that this was a highly eventful period of his life. Not only was he helping to formulate England's foreign policy and being consulted by the Queen about her health and personal life: this was also when he married Jane Fromonds and, on his fifty-second birthday, became a father for the first time. o 1577 11 @ 16 Jan.

He claimed to have made 'some thousands' of these observations, 'very many, to the hour and minute', from 1547 onwards. At least two of the almanacs or ephemerides that he used have since been lost; one contained meteorological observations from May 1547 to 16 February 1551 (see Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1788, £ 2). All that remains of another is a single folio copied out by the antiquary Elias Ashmole a century later (see Appendix One). As Dee stated in his preface to Euclid, one of the main purposes of astrology was to reveal the glory of the Creator; and he used the Bible to support his beliefs, quoting a sentence from St Luke's Gospel on the title page of his Propttdeumata Aphoristica: 'And there shall be signs in the sun, moon, and stars.' In 1623 Francis Bacon (in his De Augmentis Scientiarum) suggested that astrology could be put on a scientific basis by correlating it with details of the weather and other worldly events, and astrologers such as Elias Ashmole and William Lilly followed his lead; but in the sixteenth century no one collected a wider variety of details or over a longer period than Dee did. (See Geneva A, Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind, pp. 77-8; Manchester, 1995.) 2 This visit may have been connected with Sidney's forthcoming embassy to Europe, or Drake's voyage of circumnavigation (see Biographical Guide)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHER OF MORTLAKE, 1577-1581 3 The Monas Hieroglyphica, which Dee himself described as a book of 'great rarity and remarkable quality', upon which philosophers would wish to expend 'intense studies and work, examining its depths'. 4 Published as General and Rare Memorials Pertaining to the Perfect Art of Navigation. William Sherman, in his book John Dee: The Politics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance, revealed that it is not the same as Imperium Brytanicum (see 15 August 1578), as previously thought. The manuscript Brytanici Imperii Limites is now in the British Library. One of Dee's first works had been entitled 'The true cause, and account (not vulgar) ·of floods and ebbs' (1553). Since the tides were controlled by the moon, they were of interest to an astrologer as well as to a writer on navigation; and the ancient belief that dead men's souls went out with the tide still persisted in Elizabethan times. 6 Geoffrey of Monmouth's largely fanciful History of the Kings of Britain, finished in around 1136, listed King Arthur's and King Malgo's conquests overseas. Thanks to Dee, Richard Hakluyt (nephew of 'Mr Hackluyt of the Middle Temple') repeated the claims in his equally propagandist but generally more reliable Principal voyages of the English Nation. 7 For the idea of bones as a symbol of life, see Ezekiel xxxvii. The sack may be identified with the womb or 'bag of nature' (2 October 1584). 8 Greenwich Palace was Elizabeth I's favourite summer residence; it was here, according to tradition, that Sir Walter Raleigh put his cloak over a puddle to prevent the Queen from getting her shoes we~. Later in her reign, however, she spent more and more time at Richmond Palace. Burghley, Walsingham, Leicester, Christopher Hatton and Raleigh all had houses nearby, and Elizabeth was later to die there. (According to one fanciful story she had gone there during her final illness to recuperate, on Dee's advice.) Other royal residences mentioned by Dee are Whitehall Palace, where Elizabeth's parents had celebrated their marriage in 1533; Somerset House, which was used later in her reign to accommodate visiting foreign dignitaries; Oatlands in Surrey, which was so small that some of the courtiers had to sleep outside in tents; Hampton Court; Windsor Castle, to which Elizabeth made extensive alterations; Nonsuch, Henry VIII's lavish hunting palace, which passed to the Earl of Arundel and then from 1579 to Lord Lumley; and Syon House in Brentford, which Elizabeth leased in 1594 to Henry Percy, the 'Wizard Earl' of Northumberland, and his successors. 9 Dee's 'Compendious Rehearsal' refers to his conferences with Dr Bayly, 'her Majesty's physician, about her Majesty's grievous pangs and pains by reason of the ache and the rheum, &c.' 10 The symbols for Mars and Venus (see Key to Symbols) were later combined"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE by Dee to record when he had sexual intercourse, in the belief that the moment of conception was at least as significant astrologically as the moment of birth. This was Dee's own personal symbol and was not meant to be understood by anyone else; indeed it has puzzled a succession of Dee's editors, although it does not occur before Dee's marriage to Jane Fromonds, nor in the seven or eight months before the birth of each of their children. Several decades l~ter another diarist and scientist, Robert Hooke, would join together the symbols for Venus and Cupid to record when he had intercourse with his housekeepers. (Robinson HW, Adams W, eds, The Diary of Robert Hooke; London, 1968.)

Dee recorded his wife's periods meticulously, usually in Greek characters. 17 'This night my wife dreamed that one came to her and touched her, saying, \"Mistress Dee, you are conceived of child: whose name must be Zacharias: be of good cheer, he shall do well as this doth.'\" 18 The alchemical secret involved 'the salt of acetyls one upon a hundred'. Proportions like this were central to the practice of alchemy; Edward Kelly later claimed that the transmutation of metals could be achieved with a tincture of 1:27223°. 19 'On April 6 1580, being the Wednesday in Easter-Week, about six of the clock in the evening, a sudden earthquake happened in London, and almost generally throughout the kingdom of England, which caused a remarkable consternation in the people. The great clock-bell in the Palace of Westminster struck of itself, and divers other clocks and bells in the City and elsewhere did the like. The gentlemen of the Temple being at supper were so much scared with the shock, that they ran from their tables and out of the hall with the knives in their hands.

(Grey Z, A Chronological and Historical Account of the Most Memorable Earthquakes; Cambridge, 1750.) The earthquake was also the subject of a famous correspondence between Edmund Spenser and Gabriel Harvey, published later the same year. 20 Muscovy House, the headquarters of the Muscovy Company, was in Seething Lane near the Tower of London. John Dee had been delivering directions to the navigators Arthur Pitt and Charles Jackman for the discovery of a north-east passage. His copy of the instructions, together with a rudimentary map ofVaygatz, still survives (British Library, Cotton Otho MS E VIII, ff. 77-9). WB. was probably William Burrow. 21 This note was not meant to be understood by anyone else; however, it may be significant that Dee (like the unnamed philosopher?) was approaching his sixtieth birthday. 22 The petty sessions for the division were held at Tendring in Essex. Mr Williams was from one of the most important families in the area. When his descendants moved to Stoke-by-Nayland in Suffolk in the eighteenth century, they called their house Tendring Hall. 23 If the voyage had succeeded, Dee would have gained most of Canada. 24 The Bishop of London was John Aylmer (see Biographical Guide). 25 Dee's 'Compendious Rehearsal' contains descriptions of this meeting, and that of 3 October, which were copied almost verbatim from the diaries. 26 Queen Elizabeth had gone to visit Dee's library on 10 March 1575, but on hearing of his wife's death she 'refused to come in; but willed me ro fetch my glass so famous, and to show unto her some of the properties of it' ('Compendious Rehearsal'). Dee had married Katherine Constable, the widow of a London grocer, in 1565 (Taylor EGR, Tudor Geography; London, 1930), though it is not known whether she was his only other wife. 27 Each part of the body was thought to be affected by different planets and star signs. In Taurus (according to the seventeenth-century astrologer William Lilly), Saturn influenced the heart, breast and stomach; Mars influenced the kidneys and throat; while the moon had an influence on the throat and legs.

Henrik may have been John Henrick, a physician from Ghent (Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue, p. 43). Thomas Radcliffe, third Earl of Sussex, and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, were old enemies; like many others, Radcliffe blamed Dudley for the fact that Elizabeth had never married. 32 Dee had been a frequent visitor to Antwerp between the 1540S and 1560s, and had bought many of his books there. In 1581 William the Silent was trying to establish a state there where religious toleration could be practised; but an attempt to establish the Duke of Alen<;:on as titular ruler was short-lived.

Enoch, the father of Methuselah, was believed to have transcended the mortal state; and although the Ethiopic Book of Enoch was unknown in Europe in the sixteenth century, the story had been embellished by writers such as Roger Bacon and Guillaume Postel. (See Clulee NH, John Dee's Natural Philosophy, p. 209) 3 See for instance Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy (trans. Freake J, pp. 74-8; London, 1651); Book IX of Paracelsus' Hermetic and Chemical Writings (ed. Waite AE; London, 1894). 4 Dee wrote that he had started invoking the archangels Raphael and Michael in 1569, and praying for wisdom ten years later (British Library, Sloane MS 3188). It is impossible to be sure how many skryers he tried out between 1569 and 1581, since he routinely destroyed the records of spirit conferences that he subsequently deemed to be bogus. Anael (or Annael) was one of the seven angels of creation. A diagram near the beginning of Dee's 'Mysteriorum Libri V' (Sloane MS 3188) shows Annael set above Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. 6 The Greek delta was Dee's shorthand for his own name. 7 Dee gives no explanation for these initials but they may stand for Michael and Gabriel, the only two angels mentioned by name in the Bible (although many others are mentioned in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha). 8 Of Famous and Rich Discoveries was the fourth and final volume of the series that started with General and Rare Memorials Pertaining to the Perfect Art of Navigation (London, 1577). It was never published, and the manuscript (British Library, Cotton Vitellius MS C VII, ff. 25-267) was later badly burnt. 9 The Aldaraia sive Soyga or ~abic book' had cost Dee £600, and was one of his most treasured possessions. Mter his death it passed to his assistant John Pontoys; in 1674 it was in the possession of the Duke of Lauderdale (see British Library, Sloane MS 3677, f. 142), and it seems to have been included in a sale of his books in 1692. Its subtitle was 'Tractatus Astrologico Magicus',"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE but its contents and subsequent fate are unknown.

(Lilly W, Christian Astrology, Modestly Treated of in Three Books, p. 597; London, 1647.) II Mr Clerkson acted as Dee's intermediary, introducing him to possible assistants and learned men. This candidate may possibly have been Thomas Robinson, who matriculated from Caius College, Cambridge, in 1583, and was the author of a poem entitled 'De lap ide philosophorum' (Venn J & JA, Alumni Cantabrigienses; Cambridge, 1922-27). 12 This was evidently an appearance of the Aurora borealis. Dee owned a book by Conrad us Bolovesus about a similar event in or before 1561, when the sky seemed to be on fire over large parts on Germany. (See Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue; no. 1190.) 13 On arriving at Dee's house, Edward Talbot/Kelly lost no time in making himself familiar with Dee's books, including his diary. Above the deleted entry for 9 March are the words: 'You that read this underwritten assure yourself that it is a shameful lie, for Talbot neither studied for any such thing: nor showed himself dishonest in anything.' And above this, Dee wrote: 'This is Mr Talbot, or that learned man, his own writing in my book, very unduly as he came by it.'"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"~ elcome to the good creature JOHN DEE DID not destroy all his records of the 'untrue Actions' with Barnabas Saul, as he would customarily have done. He kept one of them, 'for the better warrant of my such exercises to be made account of hereafter: As a result we are able to see how much more sophisticated and enticing Edward Talbot/Kelly's approach was from the very beginning. The angelic pronouncements now seem more resonant and the ideas more complex, building up a sense of timelessness and security while warning about the dangers of ignoring them. Speaking through Dee's skryer, the angels encouraged him in his search for wisdom and told him what he most wanted to hear: that they would help him decipher the mysterious Book of Soyga, and that he would live for over a hundred years. 0n earlier skryer, perhaps Barnabas Saul, had led him to expect imminent death.) They also set him a number of tasks that would inevitably take him some time to complete. Dee could not conceal his eagerness to comply: and by the end of the fourth conference, just a week after meeting his new skryer for the first time, he was convinced that he had found what he had been seekingfor so long. 10 Mar.

And also that I was once willed by a slayer, to call for the good angel Anchor, to appear in that Stone to my own sight. And therefore I desired him, to call him: and (if he would) Anachor and Anilos likewise, accounted good angels. I He then settled himself to the Action: and on his knees at my desk (setting the Stone before him) fell to prayer and entreaty &c. In the mean space, 1 in my oratory did pray and make motion to God and his good creatures for the furthering of this Action, and within one quarter of an hour (or less) he had sight of one in the Stone. But he still expected for two more: deeming this to be one of the three (namely Anchor, Anachor, Anilos). But I then came to him to the Stone: and after some thanks to God, and welcome to the good creature used, I required to know his name. And he spake plainly (to the hearing of E. T.) that his name is URlEL. 2 'Are you one of them,' said I, John Dee, 'that are answerable (upon due observations performed) to this Stone?'

URIEL: 'This seal, engraved in gold, will protect the body at every place and time and occasion, when worn on the breast.' So we ceased, with thanks to God: and I mused much upon this Action: and laid all up in mind, and writing. The same Saturday afternoon, hora 5, after that Mr E.T. had called Uriel, and I was come to the Stone and had used a short speech of thanksgiving to God: I then required some instruction for the purpose of Soyga. URIEL: 'Peace. You must use Michael.' l1: 'I know no means or order to use in the invocating of Michael.' In this time there appeared in the Stone a rich chair: and after a little while, it was out of sight. URIEL: 'There must be conjunction of minds in prayer, betwixt you two, to God continually. It is the will of God that you should jointly have the knowledge of his angels together. You had attained unto the sight of Michael but for the imperfection of Saul. Be of good comfort.' The chair came into the Stone again: and I asked what it meant. URIEL: 'This is a seat of perfection: from the which, things shall be showed unto thee, which thou hast long desired.' Then was there a square table brought into the Stone: and I demanded"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE what that table betokened. URIEL: 'A mystery, not yet to be known. These two shall remain in the Stone, to the sight of all undefiled creatures. You must use a four-square table, two cubits square: whereupon must be set Sigillum Dei, which is already perfected in a book of thine.3 This seal must not be looked on without great reverence and devotion. This seal is to be made of perfect wax. I mean wax which is clean purified: we have no respect of colours. This seal must be nine inches in diameter: the roundness must be 27 inches, and somewhat more. The thickness of it must be of an inch and half a quarter, and a figure of a cross must be on the back side of it, made thus: The table is to be made of sweet wood: and to be of two cubits high with four feet: with four of the former seals under the four feet.' The fashion of the four feet, standing upon the foresaid round seals, was showed. Under the table did seem to be laid red silk, two yards square. And over the seal did seem likewise red silk to lie four-square: somewhat broader than the table, hanging down with four knops or tassels at the four corners thereof Upon this uppermost red silk did seem to be set the Stone with the frame: right over and upon the principal seal. The table was showed to have on the four sides of it, characters and names, these, that are here in a schedule annexed, in four divers rows.4 URIEL: 'The characters and words on the sides of the square table are to be written with yellow, made of perfect oil, used in the church.' 6: 'What oil is that?' URIEL: That oil shall be opened unto you. The oil is perfect prayers: of other oil I have no respect. 'There is a spirit named Lundrumguffa using you, who seeketh your destruction, in the hatred of men, in the hurt of thy goods. Discharge him tomorrow with brimstone.

URIEL: 'The cursed will come to the cursed.' 6: 'I beseech you to discharge him: and to bind him somewhere far off, as Raphael did (for Tobias' sake) with the wicked spirit Asmodeus.'6 URIEL: 'But Tobias did his part.

Uriel being called by E.T. there appeared one clothed with a long robe of purple: all spanged with gold; and on his head a garland or wreath of gold: his eyes sparkling: of whom I asked whether the characters noted for the table were perfect. He answered: 'They are perfect. There is no question.' 6: 'Are you Uriel?' Then presently came in one, and threw the brave spirit down by the shoulders: and beat him mightily with a whip: and took all his robes and apparel of him: and then he remained all hairy and ugly. And still the spirit was beaten of him, who came in after him. And that spirit, which so beat him, said to the hearing of my skryer: 'Lo, thus are the wicked scourged.' 6: 'Are you Uriel, who speaketh that?' URIEL: ' I am he.

Hereupon my skryer saw Uriel go away: and he remained out of sight a little while. Then he came in again, and another with him, and jointly these two said together: ' Glorify God for ever.'

Being desirous to proceed in this matter, by consent, we bent ourselves to the Action. And after that E.T. had called Uriel and saw him, I came to the desk from my oratory. There did continually appear the chair and the table. I then being afraid that any other should come into the Stone, instead of Uriel, did earnestly require the spiritual creature appearing, to show who he was, and what was his name. At length he answered, and said to the hearing of E.T.: cUriel is my name.' He went away again, and came again, following or waiting upon another. And before that other, was a man having his head all covered with black. Then he that came so in the middle, did sit down in the chair, and spake this word following: 'Note.'

Then his sword did seem to cleave in two: and a great fire flamed out of it vehemently. Then he took a ring out of the flame of his sword, and gave it to Uriel, and said thus: 'I will reveal thee this ring, which was never revealed since the death of Solomon, with whom 1 was present. This is it, wherewith all miracles and divine works and wonders were wrought by Solomon. This is it, which philosophy dreameth of. Without this, thou shalt do nothing.'7 Then he brought in the seal which he showed the other day, and opened his sword, and bade the skryer read; and he read: EMETH8 Then the seal vanished away. And I said to my friend (the skryer): 'Indeed, this other day, I considered divers fashions of this seal: and 1 found them much differing, one from another: and therefore 1 had need to know which of them 1 shall imitate, or how to make one perfect of them all.' MICHAEL: 'Doubt not for the making of it: God hath perfected all things.' Then he went away, and Uriel followed him. And then 1 said to my skryer: 'It were good, we had ever some watchword, when we should not look for any more matter at their hands, every time of their visiting of us.' Whereupon (unlooked for of us) he spake again. MICHAEL: 'We lead time, time leadeth not us. Put up thy pen. The name of God be blessed for ever.'

Then he willed me very eagerly to drive them away, and 1 prayed fervently. And there seemed one to come into the Stone, which had very long arms: and he drove them away courageously. After that presently came one into the Stone, all white. Salamian reached this white one a cup. The white man held up the cup and said: 'I am called Medicina Dei.'

(Quoted by Tillyard EMW, The Elizabethan World Picture.) 2 Uriel-'Fire of God' -was one of the seven archangels. According to the Pseudepigrapha he was sent by God to answer the questions of Esdras (IV Ezra iv. I), and he has been identified as the angel who warned Noah about the Flood (I Enoch x. I). 3 In a marginal note, Dee contradicted Uriel: the form of the Sigillum Dei or Seal of God had not been perfected in any of his books. 4 In place of the promised schedule with characters and names, Dee added a marginal note: 'Beware: because an angel of darkness intruded here.'

Peter of Abano was the author of the spurious 'fourth book' of Cornelius Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia. 10 Dee identified Fortitudo Dei and Medicina Dei as Michael and Raphael, respectively. Michael, as the conqueror of Satan and the leader of the celestial armies, was a symbol of strength (e.g. Revelation xii. 7-9), while Raphael had been charged to heal the earth (I Enoch x. 6-7).

Dee believed strongly in the power of symbols, and was happy to spend much of March and April I582 receiving instructions for the design of the Holy Table and the sacred sigil to be placed in its centre. The beginning of what Dee termed his second book of mysteries has been lost or destroyed. The surviving record begins with the Archangel Michael telling Dee, through Talbot/Kelly, to draw a circle and divide it into forty equal parts. This is followed by a long and involved description (not reprinted here) of a succession of fontastic creatures bearing the numbers and letters to fill the forty spaces.

During one session (21 March 1582, not reprinted here), Michael promised to 'shut the ears of them in the house, that none shall hear us'. And although Dee was aspiring to walk and talk with God, he was constantly worrying about practicalities: whom to employ to engrave the holy ring, for instance, and whether to remove a bed from his 'furthermost little chamber' so that the room could be used for the seances. 3 After one or two attempts at spelling out the names of the angels from the t; 47 t;"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE Sigillum Dei with this formula, Dee came up with the following: Galas, Gethog, Thaoth, Horlwn, Innon, Aaoth and Galethog. 4 The Book of Soyga (see Uriel's opening remarks of IO March 1582). The pigeon (or dove), eagle, griffin, peacock, pelican and phoenix are all Christian symbols, denoting virtues such as constancy, courage, charity and chastity. (See Hall J, Dictionary a/Subjects and Symbols in Art; London, 1979.) 6 The German occultist Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) listed the same seven angels, saying that they were set over the seven planets: Zaphiel over Saturn, Zadkiel over Jupiter, Camael (or Zamael) over Mars, Raphael over the Sun, Haniel (or Anael) over Venus, Michael over Mercury and Gabriel over the Moon. (Three Books a/Occult Philosophy, trans. Freake J, p. 415; London, 1651.) 7 Lord Mountegle had died without male issue on IO November 1581. 8 Dee later added a marginal note: 'No such lamin was to be made.' A year and a day later, the spirit II told Dee that the form of the lamin was 'false and devilish' . 9 During his month's absence Edward Talbot/Kelly may have secretly returned home to Worcester, passing through Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, where he either met or renewed his acquaintance with his future wife, the eighteen-year-old Joan Cooper.

If about to announce anything, she creates for herself messengers, such as comets and other celestial signs' (Paracelsus, The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings, ed. Waite AE, p. 300; London, 1894). Dee was considered to be an authority on comets and their significance. Five years previously, according to his 'Compendious Rehearsal', he had been appointed to reassure Queen Elizabeth and her court that the comet of 1577 was not an ill omen. 12 From Long Leadenham (see 8 May 1590). 13 'On the west side of this street [to the south of St Paul's Cathedral) is one other great house, built of stone, which belongeth to Paul's church, and was sometime let to the Blunts, Lords Mountjoy, but of latter time to a college in Cambridge, and from them to the doctors of the civil law ... who kept a commons there; and many of them being there lodged, it is called the Doctors' Commons.'

The important post of searcher had been held since 1575 by one of the town's wealthiest merchants, Robert Welles. It was his duty to ensure that everyone leaving or entering the country through Rye had the correct licence. (Mayhew G, Tudor Rye; University of Sussex, 1987; Rye Corporation Records, Rye 47!I26/4.) 20 Mr Clement was possibly Joseph Clements, who in about 1575 travelled 'by way of Poland to Constantinople, where the said Joseph remained 18 months to procure a safe conduct from the grand Signior, for Mr William Harborne, then factor for Sir Edward Osborne, to have free access into his Highness' dominions, and obtained the same.'

Yet Dee's sense of distrust, which had been growing since May IS82, was forgotten almost as soon as Kelly returned in the autumn. Dee started a new chapter in his book of mysteries and entitled it 'Post Reconciliationem Kellianam~ Kelly took the opportunity to introduce a long succession of spiritual governors, including 'the disposer of God's medicines: King Carmara. But Dee, whose interest in navigation had been rekindled during Kelly's long absence, had his own agenda: and he was evidently hoping to establish his title to some new discoveries, possibly through the intervention of the angels. 'If I would have the King of Spain his heart to be inclined to the purpose I have in hand,' he asked on the afternoon of I7 November, 'what shall I do?' To which King Carmara replied: 'Great care is to be had with those that meddle with princes' affairs'-adding that. 'none shall enter into the knowledge of these mysteries with thee but this worker' (meaning Kelly).

Whereupon E.K. was in a great perplexity of mind, and was ready to have gone his way. And at my coming home told me a long process of this tragical act. But I comforted him, and would not yield to his opinion, but did declare my confidence in the goodness of God: for that we craved at his hands, things good and necessary: and that therefore he would not give his children a stone for bread, or a scorpion for needful food required &c.

Dee agreed that the calendar needed reforming but, using data from Copernicus, calculated that eleven days should be eli~inated rather than ten. He presented his treatise ('A plain discourse . . . concerning the needful reformation of the vulgar calendar') to Lord Burghley on 26 February 1583. It 'was broadly approved by a mathematical committee but rejected because of ecclesiastical opposition, on the grounds that it showed the influence of papism. England did not come into line with the rest of Europe until September 1752. (Whitrow GJ, Time in History; Oxford, 1988.) 3 The Feast of the Circumcision. 4 Paris Garden in Southwark, by the River Thames, was the site of arenas for bull-and bear-baiting. These spectacles usually took place only on Sundays and other holidays. A belief that God's wrath could be aroused by such profanities was common but not universal. Keith Thomas, in Religion and the Decline of Magic, quotes Thomas More: 'This is much like as at Beverley, late, when much of the people being at a bear-baiting, the church fell suddenly down at evensong time and overwhelmed some that then were in it. A good fellow that after heard the tale told: Lo, quod he, now may you see what it is to be at evensong when you should be at the bear-baiting.' Fairies were widely believed in and were sometimes called upon to impart occult knowledge. (See Latham MW, The Elizabethan Fairies; New York, 1930.) 6 'Her Majesty asked me obscurely of Monsieur his state. I said: \"He will die a vioient death.'\" The concept of biothanatos-the idea that some people are marked out to die a violent death-was later explored by John Donne in an essay of the same name. Just over a year after this strange conversation, Monsieur (the Duke of Alen<;:on) was dead of typhoid. 7 Although Hudson is one of the most famous names in the history of British navigation, little is known for certain about the family; nor is it known which member was present at this particular meeting. Henry Hudson the elder had died in 1555, the year that he co-founded the Muscovy Company. Christopher Hudson was an agent for the Company in the 1560s. Thomas Hudson took part in an expedition to Persia that set off in 1579. As for the legendary Henry Hudson the younger, one of the few details known about his personal life is that he was already a grandfather when he embarked on his fateful last expedition of I61Q-n. 8 Possibly the scholar and soldier John North (d. 1597), who later served with Sir Philip Sydney. 9 The book was an alchemical tract, supposedly by St Dunstan, but in fact almost certainly written by Kelly himself (and included in A.E.

On the morning of 2 April, Edward Kelly claimed that he could see flames, first in the Show-Stone and then bursting out towards him, causing such a severe burning sensation in his head that he was unable to read. Dee, however, was unsympathetic, telling Kelly that if he had 'learned the characters perfectly and their names: as they had both been commanded, he would have no diffic:ulty in recognising them. Kelly finally managed to read five rows of letters, between interruptions caused by bursts of thunder in his head and the sound of melodious singing. Over the next three days-on one occasion starting at half-past five in the morning-thirty-four more rows were received. At first Dee seems to have repeated all the words as he heard them, slowing \"things down considerably and eventually provoking Raphael to appear and warn him about the danger of invoking the angels by accident: 'Jfyou use double repetition in the things that follow, you shall both write and work all at once: which man's nature cannot perform.

And presently he cried out and said they had nipped him and broken his left arm by the wrist: and he showed the bare arm, and there appeared both on the upper side and lower side, imprinted deep in, two circles as broad as groats very red. And I, seeing that, sought for a stick: and in the meanwhile they assaulted him, and he rose and cried to me, saying: 'They come flying on me, they come.' And he put the stool which he sat on, between him and them. But still they came gaping or gyrning at him. Then I axed him where they were: and he pointed to the place, and then I took the stick and came to the place, and in the name of Jesus commanded those baggages to avoid, and smit a cross stroke at them, and presently they avoided.

NOTES I Forty more sets of forty-nine words were then dictated, after which Dee made a note to himself: 'I find divers doubts which I cannot order to my contentment.' He listed various errors and inconsistencies to raise with the angels later. 2 According to the voice, the Macedonian was defiled and guilty. 3 See 23 and 24 March 1583.

According to Dee's note, The last being of the Danes here was about the year 1040.' The normally meticulous Dee made a number of mistakes in deciphering the code: the symbol for 'x' is not the same as the one for'k'; the prince was called Menabon (or Menabonus), not Menaban; and 'Gordanili' (presumably the name of his tribe) should read 'Gordanigi'. Dr c.L. Whitby has identified 'Mons Mene' as Meon Hill, the site of an Iron Age hill fort in Warwickshire at the northernmost point of the Cotswolds. In 1824 a hoard of almost 400 iron currency bars-the first such hoard to be recorded-was discovered there (Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 33, 328-31, 1967). Huets or Huteos Cross was apparently on Northwick Hill near Blockley (see note 3, above). The other places on the treasure map have not been identified, and the crosses seem no longer to exist. It was commonly believed that crosses marked hoards of buried treasure, and many were pulled down by treasure-hunters in the sixteenth century. (See Thomas K, Religion and the Decline of Magic, chapter 8.) 6 The Queen was assuring Dee that a promise deferred is not a promise broken. 7 See 4 May 1582. 8 i.e . 'Should Adrian Gilbert be allowed to go home to Devonshire?' 9 This was the subject of much debate in Renaissance Europe. Leonardo da Vinci believed that spirits could not exist without bodies, but that to have a voice relied on the movement of air from the body, 'and air in it there is none' (The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, ed. Richter JP, vol. II , pp. 254-6; London, 1970). Cornelius Agrippa, on the other hand, wrote: 'We might doubt whether angels, or demons, since they be pure spirits, use any vocal speech or tongue amongst themselves, or to us: but that Paul in some place saith, If! speak with the tongue of men, or angels.' (Three Books of Occult Philosophy, trans. Freake J, p. 412; London, 1651.) 10 The buffoon in the medieval morality plays. He often carried a wooden dagger and wore and cap with asses' ears.

For the Book of Soyga, see 17 January 1582. 12 Dee had already tried to obtain such a licence. In a letter to Lord Burghley in 1574, he had boasted of his ability to find hidden treasure, and requested 'that her Majesty do freely give unto me, by good warranty and assurance of her letters patents, her right and propriety to all treasure trouve, and such things commodious, as ... by digging or search, anywhere, in her Grace's kingdoms and dominions, I, or my assignees, shall come to, or find.' He added that 'a 6 73 6"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE pot of two or three hundred pounds eYe. hid in the ground, wall or tree, is but the price of a good book or instrument for perspective, astronomy, or some feat of importance'; and he assured the Lord Treasurer that ' in zeal to the best learning and knowledge, and in incredible toil of body and mind, ... I know most assuredly that this land never bred any man whose account therein can evidently be proved greater than mine.' Although he offered Burghley half of all the profits, however, his request for a licence was turned down. (British Library, Lansdowne MS 19, ff. 81-3.) 13 Dee's chest and his chimney were his two favourite hiding-places. The chest full of books, which Barnabas Saul had told him about, may have been the one in which many of his own secret writings were discovered after his death (see Introduction). 14 The red powder-which Kelly now claimed to have found on Northwick Hill, together with the book of alchemy and the treasure map-was supposed to have alchemical powers. Much of Kelly's later reputation as an alchemist was based on the mystery with which he imbued it. A marginal note by Dee against a later entry (18 April 1587) indicates that the powder and other objects were found by digging. Dee seems to have kept some of the powder with him till the end of his life (see 17 July 1607). 15 'On Thursday': i.e. last Thursday (18 April). The following passage contains one of Dee's favourite themes, repeated verbally to the Emperor Rudolph II in 1584, and recurring several times in his published writings. In his preface to Euclid, he asked: 'Should I, for my 20 or 25 years' study: for two or three thousand marks spending: seven or eight thousand miles going and travailing, only for good learning's sake: and that, in all manner of weathers: in all manner of ways and passages: both early and late: in danger of violence by man: in danger of destruction by wild beasts: in hunger: ... in perilous heats by day, with toil on foot .... Should I for all this, have fished, with so large and costly a net, to have catched a frog? Nay, a devil?' He returned to the theme in his General and R4re Memorials Pertaining to the Perfect Art of Navigation and his 'Discourse Apologetical'. 16 According to Dr c.L. Whitby, this incident does not seem to have been recorded by contemporary chroniclers. 17 Dee was unhappy that his wife had caused offence with her unkind words. ~ 74 ~"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Eow pitiful is it, when the wise are deluded IT HAD BEEN a gamble to tell Adrian Gilbert about the angelic mysteries; and if Edward Kelly had been hoping for any favours from the man of the moment, he was disappointed. Several days of bitter argument-referred to only briefly in the diary-had apparently been resolved amicably on 23 April; but subsequently Kelly's role in the Actions became increasingly ambiguous. He began to express serious doubts about the authenticity of the Actions, and to drop the clearest hints that Dee might be being deceived. Dee's faith was too strong, however, to allow him to be deflected from his chosen course. 28 Apr. Sunday: after dinner, about 4 of the clock.

After supper, returning to our business, 1 first doubted of the heads of the letters in the border, to be written, which way they ought to be turned.

Never since the beginning of the world was this secret delivered, nor this holy mystery set open, before the weaklings of this world.'2 After that these things were finished, E.K. rose up from the table and went to the west window, to read a letter which was even then brought him from his wife: which being done, he took a little prayer book (in English meter made by one William Hunnis which Mr Adrian Gilbert had here: and it lay on the table by us all the while of this last Action), and with this book he went into his bedchamber, intending to pray on it a certain prayer which he liked. And as he opened the book, his eye espied strange writing in the spare white paper at the book's end,3 and beholding it, judged it verily to be his own letters, and the thing of his own doing: but being assured that he never saw the like of this character before this present hour, he became astonished, and in great wrath. And behold, suddenly one appeared to him and said 'Lo, this is as good as that other', meaning that which we had received.

And I viewing it found it to be meant to be the counterfeit of ours, but withal imperfect: and thereat laughed at and derided the wicked enemy for his envy, his ass-headed foolish ambition, and indeed mere blindness to do anything well. To conclude, we found that with an incredible speed this devilish figure was written down by some wicked spirit, to bring our perfect doings in doubt with us. But I by God's grace (contrary to such inconveniency) was armed with constancy, and confident good hope, that God would not suffer me (putting my trust in his goodness and mercy, to receive wisdom from him) to be so unjustly dealt withal or unkindly or unfatherly used at his hands &c., and intended after supper to make my earnest complaint to the Divine Majesty against this wicked intrusion and temptation of the illuding devil: and so we went to supper.

Hereupon I made most humble prayer with hearty thanks to our God.

The most important of them was King Carmara (see 21 November 1582). 2 The secret is not reprinted here because it consists only of various ways of writing the names of the spiritual kings and princes in different combinations and characters. (British Library, Sloane MS 3188, f. 94.) 3 Dee wrote in the margin: The title of the book was Seven Sobs of a Sorrowfol Soul for Sin.' The piece of paper, which was presumably Kelly's crib, was preserved by Dee in his manuscript. 4 Dee customarily recorded the Actions hastily as they were happening, then made his neat copy afterwards. Some first drafts for March and April 1583-in an illegible hand, on coarse grey paper-are preserved in the Bodleian Library (Ashmole MS 1790, ff. 24-8). 5 Dee underlined this several times. 6 The marginal note reads: 'Our testimony of this prophecy, all the world over, to be (by us) published.' In fact the angels' apocalyptic message would have come as no surprise to Dee. In 1564 he had bought a copy of Cyprian Leowitz's book De Coniunctionibus Magnis, which predicted the imminent coming of Christ and the end of time. 1583 was believed to be a particularly significant year because of a conjunction of the superior planets Saturn and Jupiter at the end of the 'watery trigon' (the triplicity of the signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces) and the beginning of the 'fiery trigon' (of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius), which was said to have happened only six times previously in the history of the world-including once in the time of Enoch and again at the birth of Christ. It was also believed that the full force of the planets' conjunction would be realised in 1588, a date which had been mentioned in connection with the end of the world for at least thirty years. In 1587 the chronicler Raphael Holinshed described the grip which these predictions had taken on people's minds: 'Either a final dissolution, or a wonderful horrible alteration of the world is then to be expected. All these considerations laid together ... made divers diversely affected; insomuch that some, conversing and conferring, looked for no less than was prophesied; and talking very religiously, seemed as though they would become sanctified people.' It is important to see Dee's apparent gullibility in this broader context. (See Aston"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE ME, 'The fiery trigon conjunction.'

And also the same year a great preparation of ships against England by the King of Spain, the Pope and other princes called Catholic eYe.' 9 On 6 April, Dee was told that the book of secrets had to be written in forty days, and he was unhappy about Kelly going away. Elias Ashmole (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1790, f. 62) pointed out that Kelly evidently did not leave on 7 Mayas Dee recorded. 10 'I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of the people.'"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"• new saviour THE ANGELS WERE already preparing Kelly and Dee for a long journey when, in the middle of IS83, several factors combined to make their departure a matter of expediency.

I More alarming, however, was the report that Edward Kelly was in danger of imminent arrest for counterfeiting money. Kelly may already have been pilloried for forgery, and he certainly seems to have feared that a conviction on this occasion would entail the death penalty. 2 Therefore the arrival of the powerfol and charismatic Prince Albert Laski-and his subsequent willingness to believe in the authenticity of the Actions-seemed to provide Dee with a new patron, and Kelly with a new protector. 13 May.

When 1 came home yesterday from the Court, and from London, and from the Lord Laski, 1 found that E.K. was purposed to ride forth of town, and intended to be away (as he expressly told me) five days: certain companions and his acquaintance having so appointed with him,. some tarrying for him in Mortlake and some at Brainford (as was perceived this day afterward, and as he confessed unto me). Whereupon 1 thought good to signifY so much unto the Lord Laski, who meant to come and refresh himself at my house as he was wont before, either this day or within two or three days after: who also delighted in E.K. his company, &c. Hereupon about the time ofE.K. his rising 1 wrote these lines, intending to send them presently to the Lord Laski, that word might be returned of his intent before E.K. should ride, 1 meaning and hoping to persuade E.K. to tarry so long, and upon such respect: Most Noble Prince, on returning home I found our friend Edward, who certainly appeared happy: but girding himself (as he says) for a journey of five days. And this morning he is preparing for departure, and he assures me that he will return within five days: although only our true and omnipotent God knows what the actual truth may be. This letter being now written, and not yet folded up, my friend E.K. was ready and came out of his chamber into my study; and 1 told him that 1 a 97 a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE was even now sending word to the Prince Laski of his riding out, and return after five days, and so showed him the letter: who when he came to the phrase 'What the actual truth may be', he was somewhat offended, saying: 'What secret meaning hath this, upon some of your two former conference?' 'Truly,' said I, 'even such as the circumstance of the letter doth import, that is; whereas you said that you intended to return within five days, or at the five days' end, it is uncertain whether you will, or shall, return later or sooner: and therefore \"what the actual truth may be\" of your return, or intent to return, only God doth know.' He would by no means admit that my sincere exposition, but seemed suspicious of some other undue constructions of those former words. Thereupon I took the letter and tore it in three pieces, and sent none: but in my mind referred all to God his disposition, assuring myself of God his most constant proceeding in his own affairs. Shortly after said E.K. to me: 'Certainly here is a spiritual creature in my right shoulder, who sensibly saith to me \"Come away\".' 'So,' said I, 'did one say to \"Saul, when they would have had him away to have drowned him, whom I stayed in this study by force, and so hindered the Devil of his purpose then: as appeareth by that unhappy man yet alive.' 'Nay,' said E.K., 'they have told me that ifI tarry here I shall be hanged, and ifI go with this Prince he will cut off my head, and that you mean not to keep promise with me: and therefore if I might have a thousand pound to tarry, yea a kingdom, I cannot. Therefore I release you of your promise of 50 pounds yearly stipend to me, and you need not doubt but God will defend you and prosper you, and can of the very stones raise up children to Abraham. And again, I cannot abide my wife, I love her not, nay I abhor her; and here in the house I am misliked, because I favour her no better.' To these, such his words spoken in great pangs and disquietness of mind, I replied and said that these his doings and sayings were not of God, and by my whole proceeding he might perceive what confidence I reposed in his dealing with the spiritual, our friends, seeing even to the uttermost penny (and more than my ability served unto conveniently) I laid out still about the performing of such things, as were by me to be done, &c. Well, on the sudden, down he went: upon his mare, and away toward Brainford. After whose going, my wife came up into my study, and I said: 'Jane, this man is marvellously out of quiet against his wife, for her friends their bitter reports against him behind his back, and her silence thereat, &c.

When I saw him I was very glad inwardly: but I remained writing of these records as I had yet to write of Tuesday's last Action. 'I have lent my mare out,' said he, 'and so am returned.' 'It is well done,' said I, and thereupon he sat down in the chair by my table where he was wont to sit: and it was 10 of the clock then. He took up in his hand the books which I had brought from London of the Lord Laski, written to him in his commendations, &c. And as he was looking earnestly on them, a spiritual creature did pat the book on the outside of the parchment cover, divers times, and once would have taken it out of his hands. Divers times I heard the strokes myself. At length he said: 'I see here the handsome maiden Madimi, and have done a pretty while.' Then said I to him: 'Why told you me no sooner?'

MADIM1: ' Cursed wives, and great devils, are sore companions.' ~: 'In respect of the Lord Treasurer, Mr Secretary, and Mr Rawlegh, I pray you, what worldly comfort is there to be looked for?' MADIMI: 'Madder will stain, wicked men will offend and are easy to be offended.' E.K.: 'Will you Madimi lend me a hundred pound for a fortnight?' MADIMI: 'Dost thou love silver and gold? The one is a thief, the other is a murderer. Come our of him, Barma!' E.K. felt and saw a spiritual creature go our of his right thigh. MADIMi: 'Where are thy 14 companions?'

Waite cast doubt on many of the lurid stories surrounding Kelly's life (pp. xv-xxx). The famous story of necromancy in the churchyard of Walton-Ie-Dale, Lancashire, first appeared in John Weever's Funeral! Monuments of 1631; Weever claimed that his informant, Paul Waring, was Kelly's accomplice. It was not until 1782, however, that the story of Kelly being pilloried and having his ears cropped first appeared in print (Nash TR, Collections for the History of Worcester shire, vol. 2, p. 446). The further embellishments published by Louis Figuier in his book L'Alchimie et les Alchimistes (Paris, 1860) make excellent reading, and may have been entirely in character, but are largely unverifiable. 3 Edward Kelly brought back earth from Newbury as well as the ten places marked on the treasure map (see 5 May 1583). 4 The governor of the Mines Royal was Sir Francis Walsingham; his deputy was Robert Beale. For an account of how strictly the monopoly was controlled, see Donald MB, Elizabethan Monopolies; Edinburgh, 1961. Meric Casaubon's edition of the spirit diaries, A True and Faithfol Relation, starts here.

The early pages in particular had been badly damaged by being buried underground, and the ends of several lines are missing. For the sake of readability I have not indicated where these gaps occur, as they do not seem to affect the meaning significantly. 6 Madimi or Madimiel (whose name features twice in the Sigillum Emeth) came to demonstrate that Prince Albert Laski was descended from the noble English family of Lacy. Her name also features in Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy (trans. Freake J , p. 435; London, 1651) as the spirit of Mars. 7 The Irish 'glib'-a mass of matted hair worn over the forehead-had in fact been outlawed by successive English deputies, including Sir John Perrot (Black JB, The Reign of Elizabeth, p. 473; Oxford, 1976). Madimi's information here is garbled and inaccurate; she may be referring to the elder Hugh de Lacy, first Lord of Meath and one of the conquerors of Ireland (who was murdered while inspecting his new castle at Durrow in II86), or to his second son, who became Earl of Ulster in 1205. The towns and villages listed by Madimi were the principal estates of the Lacy family after the Norman Conquest. t'J.

Dee described his Steganographia as a book 'so needful and commodious, as in human knowledge none can be meeter or more behoveful' . (See Evans RjW, Rudolf II and his World, p. 2i9.) His Liber Octo Questionum ad Maximilianum Cesarem had been published in Oppenheim in 1516. 14 This idea was to be repeated by John Milton in Paradise Lost: 'For spirits when they please/ Can either sex assume, or both.' (Book I, II, 423- 4.) 15 The cosmologist Giordano Bruno was also present at the lavish banquets and public disputations at Oxford in June 1583, later describing what happened 'when he disputed publicly with the doctors of theology in the presence of the Polish prince Alasco, and others of the English nobility.

(La Cena de fa Ceneri, quoted by Yates FA, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, pp. 205-10; London, 1964.) Bisham in Berkshire, where Laski stayed on his way from Oxford to Mortlake, was the home of Lord and Lady Russell. 16 Dee's suit probably concerned his attempt to regain the livings of Upton and Long Leadenham. According to his 'Compendious Rehearsal', he had been so preoccupied with his work on the reformation of the calendar the previous year that he forgot to get the great seal affixed in time to renew the licence.

(See 6-8 May 1585, however, for evidence that the pension was not always paid regularly.) 22 According to the 'Compendious Rehearsal', the Earl of Leicester had invited himself and Albert Laski to dinner at Dee's house. 'I confessed sincerely unto him,' Dee wrote, 'that I was not able to prepare them a convenient dinner, unless I should presently sell some of my plate, or some of my pewter, for it. Whereupon her Matie sent unto me (very royally) within one hour after 40 angels of gold, from Syon: whither her Matie was new come by water from Greenwich.' 23 Dee made this entry before setting off for the Continent-leaving his copy of Stadius' Ephemerides in Mortlake."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"~lIhber Peregrinationis Prim<e WHEN JOHN DEE embarked for the mainland of Europe in September Is83, he took with him the Holy Table, about six hundred books and a hundred manuscripts.

We departed from Mortlake about 3 of the clock after noon: the Lord Albert Laski (Vaywoda of Siradia, in Polonia) meeting me on the water, as we had appointed: and so brought night to London. And in the dead of the night, by wherries, we went to Greenwich to my friend Goodman Fern I the potter his house, where we refreshed ourselves. And thither came a great tilt-boat from Gravesend to take us in (by appointment of me and Mr Stanley) to go to our ships, which we had caused to lie seven or eight mile beyond Gravesend: to which ships we came on Sunday morning by sunrise.

But God in his providence and mercy had greater ... of us, so that we became clear: the boat half full of water, so that we sat wet to the knees, and the water with the billow of the seas came still beating in more and more. And in this mean trouble, one of our two boatmen had lost his long oar out of the boat into the water, and so not only we lacked the help of that oar, but also by reason they would have followed the wind and ebb for that oar (contrary to our course in hand and not able to become by): so with much ado we constrained them with the sail, our one oar, and the rudder to make such shift as they could to get to Queenborough Town. And in the mean space E.K. with a great gauntlet did empty most part of the water out of the boat, else it must needs have sunk by all man's reason.

NOTES 1 It is tempting to link Goodman Fern with John Ferne (d. 1609), a writer on heraldry w~o was employed by Albert Laski to trace the pedigree of the noble Lacy family (and who found, after much research, that there was no connection between the two families). 2 Queenborough's position at the mouth of the Thames made it an important point of departure for the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see Brereton W, My Travels into Holland and the I 7 Provinces, I634 ; Chatham Society, 1844). When Daniel Defoe went there at the start of the eighteenth century, however, it was nothing but 'a miserable, dirty, decayed, poor, pitiful fishing village'. 3 Mary, Elizabeth, and John Crocker were Dee's servants. 4 While in Dokkum, Dee told the angels (in an Action not included here): 'I wish to hear something about my private situation and that of England: both"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"UBER PEREGRINATIONIS PRIMlE, 1583-1584 out of patriotism and on account of my own reputation.' The Archangel Gabriel replied: 'In England, they condemn thy doings, and say thou art a renegade. For they say thou hast despised thy Prince.' Gabriel said that Dee could seek revenge by calling down whatever plague he wanted-on Dokkum, apparently, as well as on England. It is a sign of Dee's continuing level-headedness that he told Gabriel: 'Let God's will be done, not mine.' In the 15605 Emden had become important when a treaty resulted in the whole of the English cloth trade passing through it. Its wealth, however, is not evident from a vision that Edward Kelly had on 26 October: 'Now the town appeareth again. The sea runneth by it. There is an old rotten church standing at the town end .... It seemeth to be Emden in my judgement.' Between Emden and Hamburg, Dee and his companions took a route now followed almost exactly by the modern railway system. 6 Dee's brother-in-law, Nicholas Fromonds, was meant to be looking after the house and library. Drs Roberts and Watson quote this entry in John Dee's Library Catalogue, and comment that Kelly was either genuinely clairvoyant or had heard rumours from England about the despoliation of the library. 7 The Order of St John of Jerusalem was based in Rhodes between 1306 and 1523, before being driven out by the Turks. The story of Carmathar does not feature in the exhaustive Historia Johan Militarum by Henrico Pantaleone (Basel, 1581). It may be based on a story told by Sir John Mandeville about a knight of Rhodes who was tempted by a dragon disguised as a beautiful damsel. (The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, ed. Pollard Cw, p. 17; Glasgow, 1900.) 8 St Antony of Egypt (c. 251-356) is regarded as one of the founders of organised Christian monasticism. During his years as a hermit in the Egyptian desert he withstood a series of temptations, alternately seductive and terrifying. 9 'I suffered very great verbal injuries. This started at 1 o'clock and lasted for two hours, in Stettin.' 10 Poznan Cathedral had in fact been founded in 968 by Mieszko I; 1025 was the year of Boleslaw 1's coronation and also his death.

The translated calls contain strong echoes of the Psalms: see for instance Psalm 104. 6 See Dee's fourth question of 22 Februaryh March 1584. 7 Samuel Zborowski-the youngest of five noble brothers-had been one of the supporters of Henri de Valois, who had ruled Poland between 1572 and 1575. At a tournament after Henri's coronation in February 1573, Zborowski had ridden into the arena and thrown down the gauntlet, and been mortally insulted when no one accepted the challenge except a common soldier. He tried to assault the soldier, then swung his mace at a courtier who intervened. When the courtier died of his wounds, the new king sentenced Zborowski to perpetual banishment. Zborowski spent six years in Transylvania before returning illegally, and was soon causing more trouble by feuding with his neighbours. He finally provoked the chancellor, Jan Zamoyski, into arresting him and having him executed in the market-place at Krak6w. The furious response of his brothers brought the country to the brink of civil war, and ended up making their faction even more powerful than before. Albert Laski was among their sympathisers. 8 See Revelation xxi. 12; viii. 2. 9 Gabriel went on to deliver several more sequences of numbers, explaining the divisions and governments of the angels over the earth.

II Nalvage is ridiculing the propensity of geographers for describing the shapes of countries and land-masses in terms of human and natural characteristics. Abraham Ortelius, for instance, in his description of Italy, wrote that 'the ancient writers do liken it unto an oak leaf' and that it is 'not without great resemblance in the proportion and shape of a man's leg from the hip unto the sole of the foot.' 12 Most of the places mentioned by Nalvage are listed in Ptolemy's Geographia. Colchica, or ancient Colchis-the mythical home of Medea, and the goal of the argonauts-is sometimes identified with Mingrelia to the south-east of the Black Sea. Cireniaca was the coastal area of north-east Libya, while Carthago was the ancient city-state of Carthage on the Gulf of Tunis. The Nasamones were a people in central Libya and Egpyt. The description of the king's counsellors at Fiacim (not mentioned by Ptolemy) seems to come from Sir John Mandeville's account of Cathay: 'At one side of the emperor's t able sit many philosophers that be proved for wise men in many diverse sciences, as of astronomy ....

Rudolph's proteges included philosophers and antiquaries, cartographers, mathematicians and emblematists, poets and musicians, allegorical and Mannerist painters, and designers of clocks, fountains and automated musical instruments. After the death of the court astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1601, Johann Kepler was to spend the most productive years of his life at Rudolph's court. There was also regular contact between Prague and the other great intellectual centres of Europe. Visitors included the cosmologist and mystic Giordano Bruno, Dee's pupil Sir Philip Sydney, and the Flemish painters Jan and Pieter Brueghel (the sons of Pieter Brueghel the elder). However, it was Rudolph's legendary interest in alchemy and the occult, above all that must have led Dee to expect a warm welcome at his court.

Note: Satan's cunning and vicious stratagem. There was great disquietness in E.K. being come home from our host's house, where he had lyen all night upon a form: by reason he had been (which he never was the like afore, as he said) with wine overcome suddenly: yet intending with himself to take heed of being overshot in drinking of wine: being requested by the hostess to give her a quart of wine upon the good bargain he had in a cloak he bought of her for 5 ducats. In this company of drinking was Alexander, the Lord Laski his servant, who came with us to Prague: unto whom E.K. (when the drink on the sudden had overcome him) said he would cut off his head, and with his walking staff did touch him fair, and softly on the neck, sitting before him. This Alexander, being half-drunken himself, by and by took those words in great snuff, and meant to defend himself, and so took his weapon to him, and thereupon they by caused Alexander to go down. It was supper time, and I that night refrained to sup; and so tarrying at my lodging, and looking out, saw Alexander sitting on the great stone against our lodging. I called to him, and told him that they were at supper: and he came over to me, and he had wept much. He complained of E.K. his former words, and the touch of the staff, how it was against his credit to take that in good part, and spake many soldiers' terms of stout words, not worthy the recording. I thereupon went to our host's house, and would understand the very truth, and there I found E.K. fast on sleep on a form, most soundly, for which I was right sorry: and yet better pleased to perceive the words of E.K. which so moved Alexander (being half-drunken) to have been spoken by E.K. when wine, and not wit, bare rule: and so pleaded long time with Alexander, that of words spoken so as they were, no such exact account was to be given to him, &c.: and after two hours' persuasion caused Alexander to go to bed in our lodging, where he used to lie, for he would have gone out to our former inn, in those raging half-drunken pangs he was in: which I thought not good. This Monday morning E.K. coming home, and seeing Alexander as he came in, he said: 'They tell I should have spoken words which greatly offended thee yesternight, and that I touched thee with my staff, &c. I"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"AN AUDIENCE OF THE EMPEROR, 1584 know nothing of it'-and shook hands friendly with Alexander. 'Well,' saith Alexander, 'if it had been anyone else,' &c. E.K. came up to me. I told him how sorry I was for this mischance, and told him of the watchmen perceiving Alexander his disquiet mind, and hearing his words, they came to me and charged me to have a care of the peace keeping (as they did indeed): and farther said, that Alexander in his rage, said, that rather, or before, he should cut off his head, that he would cut E.K. in pieces. So soon as I had expressed that word of this drunken Alexander likewise (whom now I saw quiet, and E.K. also quiet), suddenly E.K. fell into such a rage, that he would be revenged of him for so saying, and for railing on him in the street, as he did, &c. Much ado I, Emericus and his brother had to stop or hold him from going to Alexander with his weapon, &c. At length we let him go in his doublet and hose, without a cap or hat on his head, and into the street he hasted with his brother's rapier drawn, and challenged Alexander to fight. But Alexander went from him, and said: 'Nolo, Domine Kelleie, nolo!' Hereupon E.K. took up a stone and threw after him, as after a dog, and so came into the house again, in a most furious rage for that he might not fight with Alexander. The rage and fury was so great in words and gestures as might plainly prove that the wicked enemy sought either E.K. his own destroying of himself, or of me, or his brother, &c. This may suffice to notify the mighty temptation and vehement working of the subtile spiritual enemy Satan, wherewith God suffered E.K. to be tempted and almost overcome, to my great grief, discomfort and most great discredit: if it should (as the truth was) have come to the Emperor's understanding, except he had known me well, &c. I was in great doubt how God would take this offence, and devised with myself how I might with honesty be cleared from the shame and danger that might arise if these two should fight, &c. At the least it would cross all good hope here with the Emperor &c. for a time, till God redressed it. After I had brought E.K. to some quietness (by yielding much to his humour &c. and saying little), not long after came my messager from my wife at Cracovia, and Hugh my servant with him, to my great comfort through her letters, and the full satisfying of me by Hugh my servant his knowledge farther than conveniently could be written.

In the mean space I sent Emericus to see what was of the clock: and the Chamberlain (Octavius Spinola) spied him out of the Emperor's chamber window, and called him, who came up to me, and by that time was the Chamberlain come out to me; and by Emericus he understood that I was the man the Emperor waited for. He came to me very courteously, hora tertia exacte a meridie, told me of the Emperor's desire to see me and to speak with me. So he returned to the Emperor into the privy chamber, and came out again for me, and led me by the skirt of the gown through the dining-chamber, into the privy chamber, where the Emperor sat at a table, with a great chest and standish of silver before him, my Monas and letters by him, &c. I came toward him with due reverence of three cursies, who showed me a gracious and cheerful countenance. Then I craved pardon at his Majesty's hand, for my boldness to send his Majesty a letter and the Monas Hieroglyphica (dedicated to his father). But I did it of sincere and entire goodwill I bare to his father Maximilian, and also unto his Majesty: and that the rather, because I had good proof of the favour which the Almighty God beareth unto his Majesty.

And of my estimation with the world of the learned, he had heard by the Spanish Ambassador; and also of my zealous mind towards his Grace: and commended the book Monas, but said that it was too hard for his Majesty's capacity; and added that the Spanish Ambassador told him that I had somewhat to say unto him that he would find useful. I answered 'So I have', and withal looking back whether any man were in the chamber or no, I found that we were alone.

And at length it pleased God to send me his light, whereby I am assured of his merciful hearing of my long, fervent, constant and continual prayer in the cause before specified: and that his holy angels, for these two years and a half, have used to inform me, and have finished such works in my hands, to be seen, as no man's heart could have wished for so much. Yea, they have brought me a Stone of that value that no earthly kingdom is of that worthiness as to be compared to the virtue or dignity thereof, &c.

'This my commission is from God. I feign nothing, neither am I an hypocrite, or ambitious man, or doting or dreaming in this cause.

Farther I said, his Majesty was to see and understand nakedly, from the beginning, the whole course of this angelical leading, instructing and comforting of me: for so I was commanded that I should, from the beginning, nakedly open unto Rudolph the manner of God his visitation and show unto him the holy vision: which my charge I am ready to do.

Then he told me that, long since, in Germany, he had heard of my fame, and had seen of my writings: and that he was very glad of the opportunity now of my coming to this city: and that otherways he was desirous of my acquaintance, but chiefly seeing the Emperor his Majesty 'Ore tenus' (for that was his phrase, 'by word of his own mouth') had willed him to hear what I had to say to his Majesty.

And herein I had dealed sundry ways: and at length had found the mercies of God such as to send me the instruction of Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel, and divers other his good and faithful messagers, such as I had here now brought books (about 18) to show him the manner of their proceeding: and that I thought it good to begin at the last book,13 which also concerned most this present Emperor Rudolph. And so I did: and so by degrees from book to book, lightly, I gave him a taste or sight of the most part, and also let him see the Stone brought me by angelical ministry, &c. All things being seen and heard, that in six hours I could show him, at length he required of me what conclusion or summary report he should make to the Emperor. I answered, as he had occasion of the things seen and heard; but if he would follow my counsel (somewhat expert in these divine and angelical doings) that his Majesty was to thank God for his great mercies and graces offered, and that by one who most sincerely and faithfully gave his Majesty to understand the will of God herein, and that his Majesty was to do as Mary (the blessed Virgin) did, to lay up all these my informations in his heart, and to say 'Behold the servant of the Lord, let thy will be done': 14 and so to attend the manner of the Lord his proceeding, while he framed his life, as it became every Christian to do. He said that he would write (for his own memory's help) some short note of his observations of my speeches, and things seen and marked: and that he would tomorrow (being Sunday) or on Monday, if he conveniently could, make a report to the Emperor, and so with all speed give me to understand further of the Emperor his Majesty's will and pleasure.

But on Monday Octavius Spinola had sent into the town for Emericus, and told him that the Emperor had care and desire to understand my doing with the Doctor: and therefore asked Emericus if I had been with the Doctor, and he affirmed that I had. 'Hereof,' said he, 'the Emperor will be glad.' And yet (as I began to note) Emericus, coming on Tuesday in the face of the Doctor in the Ritter-Stove, had not one word spoken to him, that either he had spoken to the Emperor or he had not. And therefore I suspect that the Doctor dealeth not honestly, faithfully or wisely in this so weighty a case. And forasmuch as he told me that the Emperor his Majesty was persuaded, that he was pious, &c., perhaps he would be loath now to prefer me to the speech of the Emperor, seeing both he himself and the rest of his council stood persuaded to the contrary of this King.

Whereof 1 was right glad, and went thither to dinner: who into his innermost study (where he himself was writing of letters) caused me to be brought. And after 1 had complained of injury and violence done unto me by foul slanders, and that, at his Honour's table (to which his Honour in my behalf had replied, and therefore most humbly and sincerely 1 did thank him), 1 said that the Emperor's Majesty himself could bear me witness that 1 used this phrase unto him: 'I did not come to you, Most Serene Emperor, on account of your riches, so that thereby 1 might become rich: 1 was sent by God, and do not dare do other than to declare his will unto your Emperor's Majesty.' And therefore how falsely they slandered me, it was evident. And because 1 perceive that Dr Curtz hath not dealt neither with due entertainment of me as of a stranger, or a student, or a mathematician, or of one whom (to my face) he gave great praise unto, as of one long since of great fame in Germany, and so in his good estimation, &c.: and least of all, as of one who offered so great courtesies to the Emperor's Majesty as he was made witness of: 1 thought good to send unto the Emperor's Majesty this letter following, and so read it unto him after dinner, when 1 showed him ' Librum Pragensem sive Cesareum', and moreover 'Librum Decimum' (whose former title was ' Libri Sexti Mystici Tertiarius'), and there showed him divers Actions in Latin already translated, because now to translate so to him of the English did seem to me both tedious and to him not so readily pleasant.

'Therefore,' said I, 'they are for the service of God, and not only man.' He said he was a sinner, and not worthy to be privy, much less to be a doer in them: notwithstanding, whatsoever he can do therein acceptable to God, he would be most obedient thereto. He desired a copy of the Emperor his foresaid letters, that he might consider circumspectly of the contents before he should deliver them; whereunto I consented.

NOTES 1 According to Dee's letter of introduction, and also his 'Compendious Rehearsal', Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor from 1519 to 1556) had approached him in 1549 after hearing reports of his great learning. Charles' brother Ferdinand I (1556-1564) sought him out similarly in 1563, and the following year Dee dedicated his Monas Hieroglyphica to Rudolph's father, Maximilian II (1564-1576)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE 2 Greek, Latin and Hebrew. (See Jones GL, The Discovery of Hebrew in Tudor England: A Third Language; Manchester, 1983.) 3 A translation of the letter can be found in C.H. Josten's edition of Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica (Ambix 12,93,1964). 4 The Book of Enoch (,Liber Mysteriorum, Sextus et Sanctus'), in Edward Kelly's handwriting, is now in the British Library (Sloane MS 3189). The tables are made up of apparently random sequences of letters and numbers. Although Dee found the letters V, A and A at the top right-hand corner of the fourth table, it is less clear where the other names are. The 'Great Turk' or Ottoman sultan at this time was Murad III (1574-1595). The expansion of the Ottoman Empire since the fourteenth century had kept alive the idea of the Turk as a byword for cruelty and an enemy of Christ. 6 The castle at Brandys on the Elbe, 20 kilometres north-east of Prague, was Rudolph's favourite summer residence. 7 The town of Nysa or Neisse is approximately half-way between Prague and Krakow. 8 See Matthew xxv. 29 (in the Parable of the Talents): 'Unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.' 9 cf. Matthew v. 22. 10 Uriel's words here clearly influenced Dee's subsequent decision to convert secretly to Catholicism, although this may not have been a radical shift for him. During the persecutions of Queen Mary's reign he had professed support for a Catholic interpretation of transubstantiation and the mass (see Clulee NH, John Dee's Natural Philosophy, p. 34). Expediency seems to have made Dee a latitudinarian. II Rudolph had in fact just produced his first illegitimate son with his mistress Katharina Strada. Although he is believed ultimately to have fathered between five and eleven illegitimate children, he never produced an heir, and the problem of his succession became a cause of increasing concern to his advisers. 12 'In the small section': Prague's Male namesti, or Small Square. 13 i.e. Dee's record of the Actions from the middle of August, which he entitled 'Mysteriorum Pragensium, Liber Primus, C;esareuque, anno 1584'. 14 cf.

On the subject of England becoming a wilderness, and filled with strange people, Dee commented: This is no contradiction, for thus this wilderness and filling is to be understood. The filling of it with strangers should have been for the conquest, and in a manner razing, or defacing of all cities, towns, and castles, and so to have brought it to a wilderness and desert.' 19 ' Perhaps, spiders flying in the air, are carried by strings of their own spinning, or making, or else I know not how' (Dee's marginal note). 20 Numbers xi. 31-3-21 Dee's letter to Rudolph (stating that he can make the philosophers' stone, and recommending himself for the position of Imperial Philosopher and Mathematician) is printed on p. 246 of A True and Faithful Relation. 22 Ramon Lull (c. 1232-1315), the Spanish mystic and poet, was born in Palma in Majorca and served as a soldier before devoting himself to a life of asceticism. His Ars Magna was intended as a guide to the acquisition of all knowledge. His ideas were still extremely influential in the sixteenth century, and Dee was a disciple, though the idea that Lull was an alchemist has now been discredited. Whether or not San Clemente was really descended from Lull, he was certainly well informed about his 'life; the Dutch alchemist Ewald de Hoghelande, who wrote a biography of Lull, drew most of his information from the Spanish ambassador. 23 The Bishop of London, John Aylmer, was more interested in persecuting Puritans than in denouncing sorcerers; nor is there any evidence that Queen Elizabeth was offended by Dee's departure. 24 Dee had met Federico Commandino at Urbino in the summer of 1563, and given him the manuscript of Machometus Bagdadinus' De Superficierum Divisionibus which Commandino subsequently published.

So I went to him, and came before he was ready. At his being ready he came forth, but nothing with so cheerful a countenance to welcome me as he did at the first. I conjectured that he suspected that 1 would take his words in evil part, which he had to say to me from the Emperor, which (after 1 had somewhat spoken of the book that I lent him, and some other that had written somewhat of such matter of division of superficies, 10 and he had told me that this my book was the most excellent in that argument, and so made a pause), he began in this sort in two parts to divide his speech, and said that his Cesarean Majesty, as far as his own faults (as condemned by me) were concerned, was"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE accustomed to dealing with his confessor at the appropriate time and place. Meanwhile, as far as I was concerned, his Cesarean Majesty was prepared to gratify me and be my benefactor in whatever matter lay within his authority. I hereupon answered, and said: 'I am sorry that my words have been understood and conceived in another sense by his Imperial Majesty than in the way that they ought to have been understood or conceived. For I did not desire to become his confessor: but I was ordered to inform him that his sins were condemned by heaven, and that is therefore what I did: from which he can derive more consolation than from the counsel of his own confessor. However, as for that favour which his Cesarean Majesty is now offering me, I accept it most humbly, and would like to be given the title of Imperial Philosopher and Mathematician, to prevent the Emperor's courtiers and my fellow Englishmen from thinking that I was involved in trivial matters, and that I was thus a suitable person against whom they might exercise their most maledictory tongues, as they have begun to do already with impunity, &c.' Then he spake of the second letters to the Emperor, the effect whereof he had heard at my hands, and had sent on Michaelmas Even to the Emperor's Majesty, a note and advise of them, as he now said: and did wish that they had been delivered before the Emperor had resolved on the former answer. 'Those letters,' said I, 'are in the Ambassador of Spain's hands; and if he will not deliver them today, I will fetch them for you.' 'If you do,' said he, 'I will deliver them straightway, for at 8 of the clock you shall have me in the Ritter-Stove, or hear of me there.' 'Then,' said I, 'I will straightway go to the Ambassador.' I went unto the Ambassador of Spain, and reported all that had passed between me and Dr Curtz. He said that by reason of his divers affairs he had not good opportunity, never since the receipt of my letters, to go to the Emperor's Majesty: but that this day he determined to deliver my letters with his own hand unto his Majesty. So with thanks given to his Honour I departed. I went to the Ritter-Stove (or chamber of presence), where I found none of the Guard, but very many sitting without. In the Stove were three or four, of which one went straightway into the privy chamber, and by and by Dr Curtz came out from the Emperor unto me. I asked him if he had told the Emperor of my grief conceived of his misunderstanding my words.

Among other things I told him that the Lord Ambassador would deliver my letters himself to the Emperor's Majesty. So I departed, and he returned back to the Emperor into the privy chamber. 7 Oct. Sunday, mane hora 7. I went to the Lord Ambassador his house, and there I learned that the Ambassador had yesterday delivered my letter to his Majesty: and that answer was to be expected at Dr Curtz. After dinner I went to Dr Curtz home to his lodging, and he had nothing as yet to say of the letter delivered by the Lord Ambassador. But we fell to other talk, and I told him plainly that I had not hitherto lived obscurely, neither without care of my good fame and name maintaining and increasing. Therefore if here for my sincere dealing I should seem to be despised, or not regarded, or to be but a trifler, my thought I should haye great injury. And sure I was that the Emperor's Majesty was much ruled by him, and as he did frame his judgement, so did his Majesty very oft resolve in such matters as mine; wherefore if I were not used in my causes as was reasonable, and for the Emperor's honour, it should not be laid to any other man's charge but to his, &c. He promised that he would deliver all in the best words he could, in friendly sort, &c. After this he showed divers his labours and inventions mathematical, and chiefly arithmetical tables, both for his invention by squares to have the minute and second of observations astronomical, and so for the mending of Nonnius11 his invention of the quadrant dividing in 90, 91, 92, 93, &c. I then opened to him my secret of my glass, for battering in a dark night, &c. He said that conclusion would be very acceptable to his Majesty. I told him that the glass was at Cracovia, and his Majesty should see it by God's leave. After this I told him that I would full fain have a passport or safe conduct to pass quietly and safely in any of the Emperor's dominions. He thought his Majesty would willingly grant that, and willed me to write three or four lines as I would have it. 8 Oct. At my coming home, I bethought me that I would gladly have the said passport, safe conduct or letters of passage more ample and beneficial, as for my wife, children, family, servants and goods whatsoever, and for one whole year to dure from the date of these presents I wrote thus on Monday mormng: The Englishman John Dee, the most devoted servant of his most serene Majesty, humbly begs his Cesarean Majesty that he may in his clemency deem it fitting to"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE grant to the same John Dee-on behalf of himself, his wife, his children, his family, his servants, his maids, his furniture and whatsoever else-his favourable and gracious letters of safe, peaceful and free passage through all and any pans, regions and roads of his great Cesarean Majesty's Empire, at any time within one whole year from the present date. joannes Dee I went to Mr Doctor Curtz, with these last letters fair written, and I found him to be at the Hof rate Carner in counsel: and so awaiting till they rose (half an hour after 8 of the clock) he came out with my letters in his hand, which I left yesternight with him. I showed him these last written: and he said they use to limit no time, but to make them indefinite. So he took the last, and I had the former letters back again. He went with them into the privy chamber. He said I should not need to send for the letters, but he would send them home by his man, and I went from him toward the Ambassador Don Gulielmo de Sancto Clemente, whom I found coming with the Ambassador of Spain (who came three or four days before, to give the Golden Fleece to the Emperor) 12 and the Marshal of the Court to go to the Emperor presently to have audience. And as I stood in the court of the Ambassador's lodging, and they three on horseback coming, the Ambassador my friend did put off his cap, so did the new Ambassador and Marshal twice very courteously to me. I saw it was no time to offer speech to the Ambassador; nor of my giving thanks, taking leave, and requiring his pleasure toward the Lord Laski: so following them to the Court, I passed forward home toward my lodging.

On his return to Prague, he wrote to the Spanish ambassador about the 'wonderful progress' he had made in the Actiom in the meantime: but he was also driven by an unprecedented seme of urgency, which the angels evidently did not share. On Monday I4 January IS8S, Edward Kelly described a vision of labourers digging with pickaxes: 'They make like square holes, and put in their wedges, and break up the rock or blackish stone (like iron-mine, or magnes stone) in roundish lumps as big as a twopenny loaf' But the vision went on for so long, and appeared so incomequential, that Dee begged God 'to proceed with us not only in allegories and enigmas but with clear and manifest truth: J Dee's impatience resulted partly from his desperate shortage of money.

E.K. was very unquiet in mind, and so expressed to me in words: for that A.L. had not paid him his money long since due: and chiefly for that he doubted very much of A.L. his turning to the Lord with all his heart, and constantly. So much did A.L. his former life and ungodly living and dealing offend him, and so void was he of any hope, that he became in a great excess of mind to find us coupled with so ungodly a man. I showed A.L. his last letters, how he was now in a monastery of his own, belonging to the Castle Rithwian8 (which he had now by a stratagem won from the unjust detaining of his adversary), and what penance and contrition he was in, what meditations, and what godly purposes, &c. But E.K. would not hope of his conversion, and thereupon utterly and resolutely intended with all speed to be gone from hence toward Prague, and willed me (if I would) to prepare my letters. He became very blasphemous against God, to my great grief and terror: what the issue thereof would be, so great was the blasphemy and rebellion against God and his holy purposes in us, that almost greater could not be uttered. I used as quiet words as I could, assuring him of God's mercies always ready, and his helping hand for all such as put their trust in him, and call upon him in their troubles and times of need, and so did betake him to God for that Tuesday night, being past 9 of the clock.

Rudolph's father Maximilian II allowed the Jews to return to Bohemia, and in 1577 Rudolph granted them a charter of privileges. By the end of the century there were about three thousand Jews in Prague. Dee added a note in the margin concerning his new son's spiritual regeneration: ' Infans baptizandus Mich.' (The infant must be christened Michael.') 6 This diary entry is followed by a vision in which an unnamed spirit expounds the scriptures at great length. After it has reprimanded Dee and Kelly as 'stiff-necked and stinking sinners', Dee records that he and Kelly 'long discoursed of sundry things, and each reproved other of haughtiness, or pride of mi~d, how justly we did it God knoweth'. Dee's own pride was notorious; the astrologer William Lilly (1602-1681) described him as 'the most ambitious person living, and most desirous of fame and renown' (quoted by Shumaker W, Renaissance Curiosa). 7 It is unclear what Kelly was referring to , but the manner of receiving the circle was similar to the way he received the angelic characters on 6 May 1583.

J Dee was prepared for a trap when the three of them called on the papal nuncio Germanicus Malaspina on 27 March I586. Malaspina delivered a passionate condemnation of the rise of heresy throughout Europe; but instead of accusing Dee himself of heresy, he proceeded to enlist his support in its eradication: 'If you, to whom angels present themselves, have received any counsel: I beg you to share it with me. ' Dee's reply was scrupulously polite but non-committal. It was up to God, not him, to decide who should share his mysteries.

It was entirely written in the angelic language, whose very clear translation into our own English language we had in another volume of the 28. Besides the 48 individual books, there was"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE one very short one, and this book was the Mystery of Mysteries and the Holy of Holies, for it alone contained the deepest mysteries of God himself and of the Almighty Divine Trinity which any creature shall ever be able to know. Of this we had not yet the key. Having separated the aforesaid volumes as commanded, and placed them upon the table, I said: ' Have I now (0 Lord) fulfilled thy commandment?' VOICE: 'Do you, Kelly, bring hither the little black bag, the book, and the powder which you have hidden.' This command of God was so unexpected and unacceptable to Ed. Kelly, that his heart was much overcome with amazement. He felt as if the joints of his spine, near his hip-bones, were being torn apart, and he was greatly afflicted by a pain such as he said he had never felt in his whole life. So great was his inward pain, and so fierce was the contention berween the flesh and the spirit, that when the pain and this struggle had reached their peak, he exclaimed: '0 Lord, I received not this at thy hands!' We exhorted him to obedience towards God, and E.K. replied to me: 'My spirit is willing to fulfil this command of God: but may God forgive me that my flesh betrays its weakness by creating this delay.' Then he suddenly leapt up from his seat, went away quickly, and returned with that little black bag containing the book and the aforesaid powder, which he placed on the table by the 28 books. The bag was new-made of black fustian, and it had new black clasps to close it, like some purses. I thought it was large enough to contain one peck of wheat. The book and that sacred powder had been assigned by God not just to the rwo of us, and our children, but also to other servants of God; and the keeping of this great treasure had been entrusted to E.K. I do truly and before God assert that this treasure's performance and power (potential and actual)5 are so great that the riches of all Christian princes and kings put together could not be regarded as worth even a tenth of it. I therefore encouraged E.K. with a few words and advised him to recall the faith of Abraham, who did not hesitate to offer his only son as a burnt sacrifice. VOICE: 'Put the books that lie here into the little bag.' E.K. put all those 28 books into the same little black bag and fastened it correctly with the clasps. VOICE: 'Now do you, Kelly, rise and remove the fire-bricks from the mouth of that furnace, and put the bag in their place. Pucci, join him, and see that he throws the bag and the books into the fire. Do not come back till the fire hath quite devoured them.' L1 188 L1"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"SACRIFICE AND SURVIVAL, 1586 They arose, and went to the furnace. Courageously and willingly they thrust the little bag into the fire. And while they were busy at the mouth of the furnace, I lifted up my voice to God, on bended knees: and with great joy, gladness and exultation I gave thanks to our God, and prayed that he might increase and confirm our faith. Meanwhile they applied themselves furiously and industriously to the completion of the holocaust. They put into the furnace some very dry little pieces of wood, and chips and shavings of timbers in great abundance. They stirred up, opened, and made light the heap of books with a small stick and an iron poker, so that the fire might the better burn them all up, and might turn whatsoever was combustible into dust and ashes. And when they had been busy at this for nearly a quarter of an hour, E.K. heard the voice say to him: 'Now bid Pucci go back to the oratory.' As soon as Pucci had joined me in the oratory, E.K.-who was standing before the mouth of the blazing furnace-cried out with a loud voice that he could see the shape of a man, from the midriff upwards, apparently moving to and fro in the middle of the fire. Yet his face could not be seen. 'He seems,' said E.K., 'to be gathering up something from the very top of the flames. Now I can see clearly that he is recovering the pages of the books from the fire, leaf by leaf 'Now he seems to have put together one whole book.' And (after a little while) he said: 'Now he seems to be holding a second book: but where he has put the first, I cannot see. 'Now from the top of the flames, he seems to be using his fingers to shape the little box that contained the powder. 'Now indeed he is vanished all of a sudden.' When everything that could be burnt had been consumed by the fire, and this vision had ended, E.K. came to us and said: 'Come, Pucci. Look, and judge.' Pucci went, looked closely, and returned. 'It appears to me,' he asserted, 'that nothing is left but ashes and stones, a very few coals, and a few sparkles of the paper leaves which the heat of the fire has forced to the sides of the furnace.' 29 Apr. A meridie circa IYz. As E.K. stood at the end of the gallery by his chamber, looking over into the vineyard, he seemed to see the little man the gardener, in all manner of behaviour and apparel, who is the chief workman or overseer of Mr Carpio his workme.n in the same vineyard. He seemed very handsomely to prune some of the trees.

E.K. bade his wife to go and see who was in the garden. She came up and brought him word: 'Nobody.' E.K. then came to me and said: 'I think there is some wicked spirit that would delude me' -and so told and said to me as is before noted. Then said I, ' I will go into the garden,' and bade E.K. come with me. We went down that way which this creature did go, but nothing we saw; went to the banqueting-house in the vineyard, but that place pleased us not; so we went along in the way by the cliff side, and sat down on the bank by the great pile of vine-stakes lying in the very south end of the vineyard. And we had not sat there half a quarter of an hour, but 1 espied under the almond tree, and on the south side of it, being the westerly almond tree, that is it which is standing on the westerly side of the straight path which leadeth from the north toward the south in the vineyard: 1 espied (I say) like a sheet of fair white paper lying tossed to and fro in the wind. 1 rose and went to it, and (to the praise of God his truth and power) there 1 found three of my books lying, which were so diligently burnt the tenth day of April last. The three books were: I. Enoch his book, 2. the '48 Claves Angeliae', 3. and the third was the book of my gathering of the 30 Airs, and entitled 'Liber Scientia: Terrestris Auxilii et Victoria:'.6 Thereupon E.K. coming to me, 1 fell on my knees with great thanks yielding to the God Almighty, and so did E.K., whose mind and body were marvellously affected at the sight of the said books, having no show or sign that ever they had been in the fire, neither by colour or savour, or anything wanting. And after we had sat half an hour under the foresaid almond trees, praising God and wondering at the miracle: suddenly appeared by us the self-same gardener-like person, but with his face somewhat turned away, and nothing thereof to be judged as of Ave the custom is. He said: 'Kelly, follow me.' E.K. went, and 1 sat still, awaiting his return. This gardener went before E.K. and his feet seemed not to touch the ground by a foot height. And as he went before E.K., so the doors did seem to open before him. He led him up the great stairs on the left hand by the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"SACRIFICE AND SURVIVAL, 1586 vineyard door, and so in at his own chamber door: and then on the right hand into the chamber where E.K. hath his new study, and then the door going out of that to the stairs opened of itself. And he went up those stairs, and at length brought him to the furnace mouth where all the books and papers had been burnt the tenth day of this April. And coming thither, there the spiritual creature did seem to set one of his feet on the post on the right hand without the furnace mouth, and with the other to step to the furnace mouth, and so to reach into the furnace (the bricks being now pulled away which stopped the mouth of the furnace, all saving one brick thick), and as he had reached into the furnace there appeared a great light, as if there had been a window in the back of the furnace, and also to E.K. the hole which was not greater than the thickness of a brick unstopped, did seem now more than three or four brick thickness wide, and so over his shoulder backward he did reach to E. K. all the rest of the standing books, excepting the book out of which the last Action was cut, and Fr. Pucci his recantation,? also to E.K. appeared in the furnace all the rest of the papers which were not as then delivered out. That being done, he bade E.K. go, and said he should have the rest afterward. He went before in a little fiery cloud, and E.K. followed with the books under his arm all along the gallery, and came down the stairs by Fr. Pucci his chamber door, and then his guide left E.K. and he brought me the books unto my place under the almond tree. NOTES 1 Dee's full account of the events between July 1585 and April 1586 has been published by C.H. Josten ('An unknown chapter in the life of John Dee,' Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 28, 223-57, 1965). Since most of it was written some time after the events being described, and reads like a chapter of autobiography, only the diary elements are included here. The translation in this chapter is based on a seventeenth-century translation contained in a manuscript in the British Library (Sloane 3645, ff. 22-38), which I have checked and corrected against the original Latin (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1790, ff. 1-19). 2 One of the objections came from the idea that angels would only present themselves to hermits, whereas Kelly and Dee lived with their wives and were therefore subject to worldly cares."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE 3 The English adjective 'revolute' refers to something that has completed a full revolution (e.g. around the sun).

Central to Aristotelian metaphysics was the idea that any change or movement can be defin\"ed according to the object's state before the change (its potency) and its state afterwards (its actuality). 6 These manuscripts are now preserved in the British Library (Sloane 3189 and 3191). 7 According to Dee, Pucci had made his recantation upon divine commandment.

After certain prayers had been poured forth to God, and having offered thanks for yesterday's miracle, we asked God for his advice about what should be done further about that miracle, &c., and what we should do with the Lord Rosenberg: whether we should admit him to our friendship and holy alliance, and what to do about his offer of a house.

On May Day after dinner I went over the water (being brought to the waterside in the Lord Rosenberg his coach, and Jacobus Menschik with me) unto the Lord Rosenberg his gardens and lodging by the waterside,3 whither he came to me by appointment. To whom, when I had read in Latin (ex tempore) the things that concerned him, I asked him what he had done since the time of my being with him,4 that I might the better understand these words spoken to him and of him. He told that he had often prayed since unto God for the forgiveness of his sins, and to open his eyes how he might serve him: and to make it to be evident unto him whether he be to marry or no, and where, or in what stock or kindred: and if it were his divine will, that he might receive comfort and instruction by me, and somewhat earnestly he had prayed also for his Master the Emperor, that he might bend himself to enjoy God his favour; yea, for his own marriage and amending of his loose life, while he yet sat at dinner this day at the Archbishop's table, his heart and thought did run very much upon it, &c. At these his words I rejoiced much to perceive the doing of the Highest, in the hearing of his prayer faithfully prayed, and that the answer which I 6 194 6"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE BAITING OF THE TRAP, 1586-1587 read unto him was so fitly applied unto his prayer as he also himself did perceive with great comfort and spiritual joy. He entreated much that I would pray to God that the Emperor might be restored to the favour of God, as he was when I declared my message unto him from the Highest. I answered that whatsoever the God of heaven and earth should appoint me to say or do unto his Majesty, I would most willingly rejoice in the faithful doing of it: and that it was my duty (as a Christian) to pray for his Majesty: but I could not make any promise of my prayer to be heard, but would highly rejoice if his Imperial Majesty would so use himself in God his judgement, as might be meritorious in the sight of our Redeemer. Such words and matter as this passed between us. And he said that he would in all points fulfil the advice and warning of God, in this Action expressed, and would marry a maiden as he was willed. And this day did acknowledge and account himself a happy man. These and other such good seeds for the service of God being sown between us, he went towards his Palace in the Court, and I to the waterside, and so over to the coach awaiting for me, and so came home. God be praised. 6 May. Being Tuesday, I entered my journey toward Valkenaw glass-house, and Leipzig Mart. There are divers Valkenaws, one by Egre, or Elbogen, not far from Carls Bath, westward from Prague about 18 Bemish miles, another in Behem, about II or 12 miles from Prague, northerly, a mile from Krebitz, and two miles from Leipzig, and a mile from Kamnitz.5 II May. Sunday. I came to Leipzig, and was at Peter Hans Swartz his house lodged. I found Laurence Overton (with much ado), an English merchant: to whom my wife (the last year) had showed no little friendship to himself, and Thomas, his partner's servant, in the time of his lying sick in our house, &c., at Prague. He came from England at mid-Lent. He confessed that Edmond my servant had been oftentimes with him at his house, and that he did think that he would come with the next ships after his coming from England, then to come within 16 days. I perceived by his divers express sayings that he was but a hollow friend unto me, and seemed half-afraid to deal either wi~h me or my man. There also I found a courteous gentleman called Mr Francis Evers, the Lord Evers his son of the north. And of all other matters omitting the rehearsal in these records (those matters I mean which at Leipzig and in this journey happened notably unto me, or I did myself), I cannot omit or pass without memory the copy of one letter which I wrote to the Queen"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE of England her Secretary, the Right Honourable Sir Francis Walsingham, as followeth.

And now, I find, neither servant, neither letter from him, neither word of mouth. I am forced to be brief That which England suspected was also here, for these two years, almost (secretly) in doubt, in question, in consultation Imperial and Royal, by honourable espies, fawning about me, and by other discoursed upon, pried and peered into. The Apostolic Nuncio (Germanicus Malaspina), after his year's suit unto me to be acquainted with me, at length had such his answer that he is gone to Rome with a flea in his ear,6 that disquieteth him, and terrifieth the whole state Romish and Jesuitical.

May-July. Be it remembered that Mr Francis Pucci, Florentine, whom at my going to Leipzig I left in our house at Prague, in the mean space had been at Frankfurt upon Main, and went from Prague about the same day that the Bishop of Piacenza, Nuncius Apostolicus, did exhibit to the Emperor a libel against us of most horrible untruths, &c.8 At his going from Prague he had that Nuncio's blessing, &c. In the mean space, and before his return to Prague, again it happened so, that the 30 of May last I received the Emperor's commandment: I, my companion and all mine to depart within six days out of Prague and so consequently out of all his kingdoms, dukedoms and lands.

And when mass was finished, the following words were found beautifully written on the piece of paper. But the next day, after they had been copied out for the most Illustrious Prince, every line and letter immediately vanished, and afterwards nothing on that sheet of paper remained visible.

Mr Francis Pucci came to Erfurt on Thursday after our supper, on horseback on a horse which he had bought at Naumburg Fair, &c. II July. He discoursed with E.K. and me that he thought we might obtain favour to return to Prague again if we would; that he had found this Nuncius Apostolicus more courteous than Malaspina, of whom he reported also, that it was credibly informed him that he was sore offended Il 197 Il"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE that we gave him no more honourable title in our speeches to him than 'Reverendissima Vestra Paternitas'. This Pucci framed the discourse of his talk to persuade us to think well of this Episcopus Placentius, that he was charitable towards us, and sorry that we were so uncourteously used, that he meant nothing else in his suit to the Emperor against us but that we might be examined, and then being found faulty, we should be sent to Rome: but after that he had begun to move against us, that he found the Emperor more eagerly bent against us than he himself was. Note. The Lord Rosenberg told us that when he did (in our behalf) advise the Emperor of his error committed in our extermination, that the Emperor answered that this Nuncius from his first audience did urge so vehemently against us, and also the Pope had sent commandment by letter to him to deliver us and send us to Rome, that he was forced in manner to do as he did. But if the commandment or his decree were to be made again, that it should not pass, or if this Nuncius Apostolicus had not sent this decree away to Rome, that he should not send it, &c. This I note in respect of the contrariety in the Nuncio's assertion, and the Emperor's, of our so hard usage. The foresaid eleventh day of July the foresaid Fr. Pucci, to prove this his intended persuasion of the Nuncius' good meaning toward us, and to make us believe that great benefit would ensue our going to Rome, did bring forth unto us a writing of his own hand which he read unto us, and at the hearing of it we mused much for many causes. I asked him then why the Nuncius had not subscribed this writing. 'It is all one,' said he, 'for that.' 'Hath he heard this read?' quoth I. 'Yea, that he hath heard me read this three several times unto him,' said he. ~d if you like of it,' saith he, 'wherein his power serveth him not to perform as much as is specified in the writing, he will make and use means to have it from his Holiness.' 'Well,' said I, 'take a copy hereof, Mr Kelly,' for I was riding toward Saalfeld about a house getting. Thereupon said he, 'Contented.' 'But I think it meeter to save and keep the original itself,' said E.K. 'Well,' said Pucci. And so the original was delivered to E.K. After 10 of the clock the same Friday, being the II day of this month, after breakfast, I rid toward Saalfeld about the house of the Earl Albert of Schwarzenberg, &c."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE BAITING OF THE TRAP, 1586-1587 But after I was out of Erfurt until my return again, I was so sore vexed in mind to think of Pucci his return to our company, as well as for his unquiet nature in disputations, as for his blabbing of our secrets without our leave or well liking or any good doing thereby: either in God his service, or our credit, but rather the contrary, ensuing albeit not of his intent, but by either his undiscreet handling of it, or of his undue hearers of him, &c. And also for his household behaviour, not acceptable to our wives and family, and also because we were warned that he should be cut off from our company, &c. And chiefly, now to consider that he had laid such a bait for us with our mortal enemy, to entrap us by fair fawning words, which by no means the Emperor would consent to do before by his authority, but rather to put us out of his kingdoms, &c. And imagining that he was a mighty explorator upon us, for this Nuncius Apostolicus and his adherents, that now he might perceive what we had done hitherto, what we were doing and what we intended to do, and considering that he urged at our hands an answer to the former writing, wherein also lay a trap for either in not answering it, or refusing to grant some points of it, or in our consenting to the whole, this Nuncius would pitch matter against us to our great disadvantage. Thus being tormented in mind in my absence, how we might be rid of this Fr. Pucci by quiet and honest means, I devised to write to this Nuncius to know if this writing were of his contriving only, or of Pucci his contriving only, or jointly, or if at the least the writing were according to his will and offer unto us, and so to send him\"away; wherein he could make no refusal, I intending not to make him privy of the content of my letter. And in the mean space of his absence I hoped that some good way and better means would appear or fallout, whereunto we might trust, &c. Thus I note my imaginations and discourses in the time of my absence. 13 July. I returned to Erfurt, hora 5 a meridie. I found Fr. Pucci desirous to have answer to the foresaid writing, and very much persuading this Roman voyage, using arguments out of our Actions, as that God said we should go to Rome in a certain month's space; that we ought to obey the Roman Bishop, and to love him, &c. I replied and said that he was not to urge God upon any his sayings to us, but to refer all to his most free disposition; his will was to be done and not ours; God was not bound to us, &c. He answered vehemently and often, that 'God is most devoted to us, and God has told us to go to Rome, and I believe and will believe him, and I will not believe otherwise unless God was to tell me, \"Non vobis,\" &c.'"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE 'Well,' quoth we, 'God hath declared unto us his meaning in that phrase, which we also advise you of, that it is not meant (by the speech) that we shall corporally go to Rome' -and so I brake off that his reasoning, and told him that we marvelled that he should urge this Roman voyage so violently and eagerly more than we. It appertained unto us as much as to him, &c. The same day I told him that he had heretofore offended God with his curiosity in our affairs otherwise than appertained unto his calling, as he may well remember his repentance therein and his forgiveness obtained. But that now he had offended much more in curiosity, and half in conspiracy against us with our mortal enemy this Nuncius Apostolicus, upon whom he did fawn, in whose favour he is, who joineth, counselleth with him in our affairs, who dare prescribe us what we have to do in so weighty affairs as our journey to Rome, who hath framed a bill accusing us confusedly of heresy and wicked magic, both falsely on one part, and dangerous to life, and infamous at the least in the other, and hereto requireth, urgeth, and in manner in God his name argueth by our Actions past, obedience. And therefore he hath separated himself from us, and hath set himself against us, &c. With great vehemency he said he intended nothing but well to us, and was explorator with this Nuncius for our behalf. 'We require none,' said I, 'neither we need any, for God seeth all and doth all for our benefit, if we will constantly love and serve him.' To be brief, he would seem to be worthy to be thought well of for his zealous goodwill and fidelity to us ward, in all his doings and sayings; the truth whereof God knoweth, to whom we commit the cause between him and us. 16 July. In talk with Fr. Pucci, I told him that I had written a letter with sufficient answer in general to the Nuncius' request and offer by him in writing brought to us, and in sum told him the chief contents of the letter. 12 Then said he: 'Whereas you write of the books burnt, why write you not unto him of the recovery of them, as I now perceive by you both that they are restored? And it shall be a disgrace to you if the Nuncius shall understand more by other than by yourself.' 'Thereof have I no care,' said I. 'What I have written, I have written, and I know the truth of my writing: and they are not all restored that I know of: and whatsoever he hath at my hands he may be assured is true. Whatsoever he shall otherwise hear, the credit thereof cannot be so good unless our record consent thereto.' Then said he: 'Why write you of those books burning being done before t\\ 200 t\\"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE BAITING OF THE TRAP, 1586-1587 your coming away? It is as if you wrote backward.' 'Have you no care, Mr Pucci, for the method of my letters,' said I. And I said farther: 'It is told me that unless you see my letters you will not carry them; you shall pardon me for seeing of them, the content I have sufficiently told you. And if you will not deliver them, I can get them delivered divers ways, or I may omit the sending of them, and write such a letter to the Nuncius that I had written answer to his requests, and offer sent by Fr. Pucci: but he would not bring the said my letter unless he might have a sight of it himself.' At the length, by farther discourse with E.K., he became resolved to go with the letter, and (by E.K. his order) he was to receive 50 dollars of John Carpio, that he should not be destitute of money at Prague. Note, this day Francis Pucci said to us both: 'How can you doubt of my fidelity toward you (whom I love as my own life), and against this Monster of Rome, whom my chief desire is, and long hath been, that he may be overthrown, &c.' Again, consider what fidelity, obedience and reverence he hath promised to the Pope and this Nuncius, as the writing brought by him, and so sore and many ways urged by him, for us to accept of, can specify.

And at her conception, her answer to the angel: 'Seeing I know not a man, &c.': and before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost, &c.14 It is evident hereby that this Pucci is very leprous, both in this heresy (what other he is infected with, God he knoweth) and also the former infidelity proved.

And we entered our journey toward Kassel, but that night we rode only three miles, to Gotha, our horses were so ill that we hired; and therefore sending them back again the next day, we hired a coach, &c. Postscriptum. Remember that Fr. Pucci, the morning before his going, required of me our letters testimonial to our friends, of his fidelity toward us. 'What needeth that,' said I, 'forasmuch as your deeds were as well known to them as to us, and your own conscience to yourself may serve abundantly. But our friends divers, who have warned us of you, and have marvelled why we would suffer you any longer in our house and company, would neither credit our letters as yet in this case: and would also condemn us of light judgement, or great blindness to judge the cause between you and us.' But truly I observed in him, now, a more proud presuming over us than hitherto, before, when he was sore rebuked, for over-crowing us, so as he began to do. Now, he said, he had as great authority as we to publish any of our secrets, at his discretion; that he ought to eat bread with us; that he understood our books of Actions better than we; that he needed not our consent or counsel to deal with the Pope his Nuncius: he did it by his duty general, of charity, &c.; he offered to order the Nuncius, and the Emperor, to the reclaiming of the decree made against us, &c.

Consider what this may import, that the decree touching him, being one of my household company, and of them that then did appertain to me: and whose name he is not afraid one way, and another way not abashed to thrust himself into the whole body of our revelations, as a principal fellow or receiver of them: by the first he ought to be afraid of the danger of the decree which banished us, unless he is assured of their goodwill who have showed themselves our mortal enemies; or else some other cause emboldneth him to some other purpose, &c. By the second he might be afraid of so great presumption, being but a probationer, not yet allowed of, and to us known to be cut off. All these points I cannot decipher and judge, but refer them to the profound wisdom and high providence of God, wherefore and how far he hath admitted him to be privy of our Actions, and so a witness to some purposes sufficient.

But if on the other hand he refused the 800 florins, or denied that any money was owed by us, we desired that too to be pronounced before witnesses and set down in a written document, so that we could make it known as and when necessary. Therefore we went from the Castle to the Court-house, and having gathered together a number of the leading citizens, a senior priest, and some of Lord Rosenberg's clerks, we brought out two great bags of money: and from one of them we counted out on the table 2000 ducats, more than 400 dollars, and 800 florins.

Writers like Gaspar Brusch predicted the second coming of Christ and the end of time. (Aston ME, 'The fiery trigon conjunction.' Isis 61, 159-87, 1970.) 3 Prague was one of the first cities in Europe to develop the fashion for artificially cultivated gardens. Rosenberg's Prague residence had an arcaded garden designed by the Italian architect Ulrich Avostalis de Sala, which Rudolph incorporated into his own palace grounds after Rosenberg's death. 4 Not recorded by Dee. Dee's destination, Valkenaw or Falkenaw, is now known as Sokolov, in the Czech Republic. By Dee's reckoning, one Bemish (Bohemian) mile = approximately eight kilometres. (See also the Gazetteer.) 6 This expression is used here in its original meaning: i.e. restless and terrified, like a dog with a flea in its ear. Presumably it was Kelly's diatribe on 27 March 1586 (see 'Sacrifice and survival', introductory note) that had so distressed him. 7 Saul was renowned as a persecutor of the followers of Christ before experiencing his vision on the Road to Damascus. After his conversion, he took to using his Roman name of Paul. 8 In the middle of May 1586 the new nuncio Filippo Sega, Bishop of Piacenza, had shown Rudolph a document accusing Dee.of necromancy and other occult arts. 9 Dee had arrived in Hesse-Kassel with a train of four coaches, and informed the Landgrave that he had left Rudolph's court voluntarily because of the Emperor's 'slender entertainment of him'. (See Clulee NH,fohn Dee's Natural Philosophy, p. 227.) 10 Dee left a blank here, but Meric Casaubon was probably right to assume that he was referring to Dr Curtz. II It has generally been assumed that Illustrissimus was Albert Laski. This entry makes it clear that Dee was referring to William of Rosenberg. He also referred to Rosenberg as ' Princeps'. 12 The nuncio's letter and Dee's reply are printed on pp. 431-3 of A True and Faithful Relation. 13 Pucci's reasoning was based on the opening of St Matthew's Gospel, which traces Jesus' genealogy from Abraham to Joseph. 14 Dee answered Pucci by quoting from Isaiah vii. 14, Luke i. 34, and Matthew 6 207 6"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE i. 18. However, the use of Isaiah vii. 14 as a prediction is based on a misunderstanding of the word 'virgin', since the original Hebrew referred merely to a 'young woman', who mayor may not have been sexually pure. 15 Although Dee was clearly right to distrust the Pope and his successive nuncios, he need not have suspected that Pucci was a papal spy. When Pucci himself set off back to Rome he was arrested, tried as a schismatic and beheaded. 16 Presumably on 16 October-unless Dee made a mistake over the dates, and the entries of 16 and 17 October in fact refer to the same incident.

Dee was not just offered £2000 a year to serve the emperor; Simkinson added that: 'He shall be conveyed through the land with 500 horses, and he shall be accounted as one of the chief est in the land next the Emperor.' The emperor was Ivan the Terrible's son Feodor, who was described by the diplomat Giles Fletcher after a trade mission in 1588 as 'a person of mean stature, somewhat low and gross, of a sallow complexion, and inclining to the dropsy, hawk-nosed, unsteady in his pace by reason of some weakness of his limbs, heavy and inactive, yet commonly smiling, almost to a laughter. For quality otherwise simple or slow-witted, but very gentle and of an easy nature.' Hakluyt, who quoted Fletcher's account, believed that the emperor was hoping to use Dee's 'counsel and direction about certain discoveries to the north-east, ... but because their conquest to Siberia was not as then fully settled ... it was for that time with all thankfulness refused.' 19 A 'menstruum' is defined as 'a key substance in alchemy'. The experiment continued until the end of January 1587. 20 'In fino equino' = 'in horse dung'. See for instance Basil of Valentine's alchemical treatise 'The Stone of Fire': Take crude Hungarian antimony, put that ground to a subtile powder, into a glass cucurbit with a flat bottom, and pour thereon the true vinegar of philosophers, rendered more accidental with its own salt. Then set the cucurbit firmly closed in horse dung . . . to putrifJ the matter in 40 days, in which time the body resolves itself, and the vinegar contracts a colour as red as blood.' (Quoted by Barrett F, Lives of the Alchemystical Philosophers, p. 235; London, 1815.) 21 Three weeks later a voice gave Dee and Kelly a warning: These that now come unto thee, have brought thee a great cluster of grapes, even as big as they can both carry: amongst the which, notwithstanding, there are many rotten.'

The 'new and strange doctrine' of marital cross-matching, as Dee called it, has generally been regarded by serious historians as something of an embarrassment: but it is clearly central to. the question of Dee's relationship with Edward Kelly, and shows how far Dee was prepared to go in the pursuit of knowledge. Although Dee's acceptance of the doctrine may seem extraordinary to the modern reader, it stemmed logically from his unquestioning faith in the goodwill of God towards him. Kelly's role in the affo.ir, however, is more ambiguous. He seems to have been genuinely reluctant to carry out the doctrine, and it is possible that he invented it as a way of bringing the Actions to an end-never expecting Dee to accept it. Alternatively he may have been angered by Dee's attempt to supplant him as skryer with the seven-year-old Arthur, and was looking for a way of reasserting the control he had established five years earlier with his vision of the two birds yoked together by God Finally, it cannot be a coincidence that, during the Action of 4 April, Joan Kelly's barrenness is mentioned for the first time.

I was glad that an offer was made of being every seventh day to be taught the secrets of the books already delivered unto us: thinking that it was easy for us to perform that unity which was required to be amongst us four; understanding all after the Christian and godly sense. But E.K., who had yesterday seen and heard another meaning of this unity required, utterly abhorred to have any dealing with them farther, and did intend to accept at their hands the liberty of leaving off to deal with them any more: which his understanding, as it was strange and unpleasant unto me, so I earnestly requested to be resolved therein in manner as followeth. At the same time and in the same place this ensued. Note. Upon Mr Kelly his great doubt bred unto me of Madimi her words yesterday spoken to him, that we two had our two wives in such sort as we might use them in common, it was agreed by us to move the question whether the sense were of carnal use (contrary to the law of the commandment) or of spiritual love and charitable care and unity of minds, for the service of God advancing.

After our going out of the chapel, and at our being at dinner, when we four (whose heads so were united, in a pillar showed, as is before set down), I found means to make some little declaration of our great grief (mine chiefly) now occasioned, either to try us, or really to be executed, in the common and indifferent using of matrimonial acts amongst any couple of us four: which thing was strange to the women: and they hoped of some more comfortable issue of the cause. And so we left off. After dinner, as E.K. was alone, there appeared unto him little creatures of a cubit high: and they came to the still where he had the spirit of wine distilling over out of a retort. And one of them (whose name they expressed Ben) said that it was in vain so to hope for the best spirit of the wine, and showed him how to distil it and separate it better, and moreover how to get oil of the spirit of wine as it burned in the lamps: and began to ask E.K. what countryman he was. And when he had answered 'an Englishman', he asked then how he came hither. He answered 'by sea'. Then said he: ~d who helped you to pass the marvellous great dangers of the sea?' And so took occasion to speak of the benefits which God had hitherto done for us, very many. And this Ben said then among very many other things (as Mr E.K. told me on Saturday night after supper, holding on his talk almost till 2 of the clock after midnight) that he it was that delivered him, or gave unto his hands the powder.? And also he said either then, or the next day at the furthest, that unleast he would be conformable to the will of God in this last Action declared, that he would take the virtue and force of the powder from it, that it should be unprofitable, and that he should become a beggar. And of me also he said that I did evil to require proof or testimony now that this last Action was from God Almighty, and said that I should be led prisoner to Rome, &c. He told of England, and said that about July or November her Majesty should from heaven be destroyed; and that about the same time the King of Spain should die.

He said, one (now abroad) should at Milford Haven enter, and by the help of the Britons subdue the said conqueror, and that one Morgan a Briton should be made King of the Britons, and next him, one Rowland, &c.8 He said also that this Francis Garland was an espy upon us from the Lord Treasurer of England, and that Edward Garland is not his brother: and that so the matter is agreed between them, &c.

Milford Haven was considered to be particularly vulnerable because of its proximity to Ireland; in 1589 the adventurer Sir William Stanley was to recommend it to the Spaniards as the most strategic place from which to invade England (Calendar of State Papers, vo!' 225, no. 51). 9 Kelly reported that he was then delivered a set of numbers and letters with which he could decipher the Book of Enoch which had been dictated to him"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE at Mortlake.

II This is the second and last recorded occasion on which Dee shared a vision in the Stone (having been shown by his 'guide', Edward Kelly). Dee's semantic quibble may be based on the fact that in late and medieval Latin, the Archangel Michael is usually 'Nuntius [or Nunciusl Michael' , while 'Michaelium' refers to the Church of St Michael. Dee would have been reassured by this visitation from his guardian angel (see IO March 1582). 12 'The agreement signed.' An earlier agreement, drawn up on 21 April, was rejected by Kelly, who drew up his own declaration condemning it as 'a doctrine damnable, and contrary to the laws of God'. 13 'The agreement put into practice.' Part of the page has been cut out with a knife or scissors. 14 Dee himself probably deleted these lines. They were not subsequently included in Meric Casaubon's edition of Dee's spirit diaries. 15 An unflattering reference to Kelly by the papal nuncio Filippo Sega sheds light on this passage; in a letter to Pope Sixtus V in April 1586, he referred to 'John Dee and his companion the cripple' (see Evans RJW, Rudolf II and his World, p. 227). 16 'After this full moon Jane had them not.'

His formulae and recipes started to be printed or circulated in manuscript form throughout central Europe.2 Then in I588 Edward Dyer, one of Dee's oldest friends, arrived in Trebon on a mission from Queen Elizabeth: not in response to the pleas for help that Dee had been sending her for the previous three years, but to try and persuade Kelly to return to England Lord Burghley wrote to commend Kelly's wisdom and assure him of generous rewards at Elizabeth's court.

In fact the diary shows that angelic conferences continued to take place (see for instance 25 July 1587 and 5 March 1588). It also appears that the cross-matching was not an isolated event, but continued into the summer of 1588 (see entries for 26 May and 4 July). 2 Typical headings were ' From the Englishman Edu. Keleo' and 'This was used by Edoardus Gelleus, the English alchemist' (Evans RJW, Rudolf II and his World, pp. 226-7). 3 'Terrible suspicion because of the treachery .. .' The rest is smudged and illegible. 4 Kelly's alchemical treatise 'The Humid Path' states that 'water and earth may . . . be brought to the perfection and excellence of gold, if the heavenly rays, which are instrumental in the ripening of that metal, can be brought to bear on them.'

II 'Jane had some few drops of blood: to our great fear, of aborsement.' 12 Dee's own radius astronomicus ('of ten foot long, having the staff and cross very curiously divided into parts equal') was apparently still in Mortlake; he was later to complain to the Queen about its loss during his absence. 13 ~er sunset, it was told me that some in the house hold reports that I dealt with the Dive!.

Waite's collection of Kelly's AlchemicaL Writings). 16 See Dee's rule 'for the describing of an heptagon' (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1790, ( 28).

Dee evidently believed that it was propitious that he was born exactly forty weeks after the doctrine of cross-matching was first put into practice. 21 Dee owned a copy of a treatise entitled ' De Magnete' by Petrus Peregrinus (Peter of Maricourt). Dee's speculation that the midwife's husband might be related was not far-fetched; midwives were among the best-educated members of society throughout Europe at this time. (See Marland H, ed. The Art of Midwifery; London, 1993). 22 Dee may have been afraid that Kelly was about to leave him for Rosenberg, and he would therefore have been reassured by reports of Rosenberg's displeasure. 23 'With the necessary conditions.' Variations on this expression occur several times over the following months, and indicate that the angels or Dee himself had imposed various restrictions on his relations with Jane. 24 Threats ('minae') may finally have induced Dee and Joan Kelly (I.K.) to put the doctrine of cross-matching into practice together. 25 'About 10 in the evening, Mr Edward Dyer did injure me unkindly'-perhaps because he revealed that he was interested less in Dee than in Kelly. (See Clulee NH, John Dee's Natural Philosophy, p. 228.) 26 'Them-very few and pale. Good reconciliation made with Mr Dyer with words, E.K. mediating.' 27 Dee put a cross above the '!\\ of Albert Laski's name, perhaps implying that he was now the true king after Stephen's death. 28 The letter, in Dee's most exquisite handwriting, can be seen in the British Museum (Harleian MS 6986, ( 45): 'Happy are they that can perceive and so obey the pleasant call of the mighty Lady Opportunity,' he wrote, and thanked the Queen for summoning him and Kelly home 'into your British Earthly Paradise'. 29 It was unusual for this conjunction to occur twice within a month. He made a similar note on his record of Kelly's nativity (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1788, f. 140), which is headed: ' Rarum quid-* ~ et ~ii, instabat.' 30 In the section on perspective, Dee described how the glass could make 'things far off, to seem near, ... small things, to seem great: and ... one man, to seem an army.' Then he added his customary personal touch: 'A gentleman (which, for his good service done to his country, is famous and honourable: and for skill in the mathematical sciences, and languages, is the odd man of this land, &c.) even he is able: and (I am sure) will very willingly, let the glass and proof be seen.'

Kelly had already given Rosenberg an ounce and a half, and said that it would be multiplied. 32 After Kelly left for Prague to be feted by the Emperor, Dee never saw him again. 33 The psychoanalyst and student of alchemy e.G. Jung wrote that Frankfurt was 'a centre of alchemical philosophy' at this time, since it was the home of the alchemist Gerhard Dorn and Rudolph II's court physician Michael Maier Qung CG, Memories, Dreams, Reflectiom; London, 1963). After leaving Frankfurt (with his train of three coaches and fifteen horses), Dee travelled to Kassel and stayed with the Landgrave William of Hesse-Kassel (see 18 June 1586 and Biographical Guide). He then travelled north. From Diepholz to Oldenburg he was escorted by twenty-four soldiers to protect him from a band of 'eighteen enemies horsemen well appointed' who had lain in wait for five days to set upon him; and from there to Bremen he was accompanied by six harquebusiers and musketeers, because of 'an ill-minded company lying and hovering for me in the way'. As he commented in his 'Compendious Rehearsal', 'this was a very dangerous time to ride abroad'. 34 According to the stars, the prognosis was bad: unfavourably aspected by Saturn, and with the mooQ on the cor leonis, affecting the heart. 35 The English adventurer Sir William Stanley had switched sides in 1587 when he surrendered the Dutch city of Deventer (of which he was governor) to Spain. Mr Overend was probably Hugh Overend, who wrote to Walsingham in August 1589, warning him that the traitor Thomas Berryer ' had been released and had received money to do some ill service at Ostend' (Calendar of State Papers, vol. 225, no. 59). 36 To have his horoscope cast by Dee, who later recorded his nativity in his copy of Stadius' Ephemerides (25 October 1554): 'D. Daniel van der Meulen Antwerpiae, mane hora 4.' He may have been the same Daniel van der Meulen who in 1598 was so moved by the plight of his sick brother that he tried to negotiate peace between Spain and the United Provinces. (Biographisch Woordenboek der Nederlanden, vol. 12; Haarlem, 1869.) 37 Tatton and Leister were carrying a message from Edward Kelly to Lord Burghley: 'Fourteen days before the Feast of Pentecost last past, one Parkyns, born in England, and now a Jesuit, came from Rome to city of Prague in Bohemia. And there coming to an inn, where the said Edward Kelly was; and uttering divers novelties, among others he plainly (but as it were in great secrecy) opened to the said Sir E.K. this horrible conspiracy against her Majesty: that there were now seven such ways or means, concluded and agreed upon by the Pope and his confederates, for the murthering of the Queen, that if the first, second, third, fourth and fifth failed, ... the sixth or seventh should take effect.

The much-repeated story of how Dee's library was destroyed by a mob of angry neighbours has recently been revealed as a myth. I Yet it is true that a handful of his former friends {most notably the navigator John Davis' and the politician Nicholas Saunders} had helped themselves during his absence to over five hundred of his books and many of his prized possessions. His quadrant had been 'most barbarously spoiled and with hammers smit in pieces: while his magnes stone had been broken up and sold for a fraction of its original cost. Dee estimated his total loss to be almost £400: a crippling sum for a man who had 'not one penny of certain foe, revenue, stipend, or pension: 2 In his 'Compendious Rehearsal' of I592, Dee reminded the Queen of how faithfully he had served her, and then listed his needs. He wanted a post in an academic or similar institution, with accommodation for himself, his wife and children, as well as his servants and his guests; a supply of food and fuel; and access to a printing-house where some of his own books could be printed. He also hoped to set up a new laboratory where he could personally oversee his workers. The ideal location, he suggested, would be somewhere on the south coast of England, preferably near Winchester College {where he hoped to send his four sons}. In this way he would soon restore his reputation, so that 'rare and excellent men from all parts of Christendom' would come to seek his guidance once again. 22 Nov.

However, the story of the knighthood may simply have been another of Kelly's deceptions; for years he had been passing himself off in Bohemia as being 'of the knightly kin and house called Imaymi in· the county of Conaghaku in the kingdom ofIreiand' (quoted by Evans RJW, Rudolf II and his World, p. 226). 4 The Calendar o/5tate Papers (vol. 226, nos 90-2) refers to a John Spenser who had travelled to Venice in the winter of 1589190 as a spy for Lord Burghley, collecting information against papists and recusants. Dee was apparently still communicating with the angels, although no spirit diaries exist for the period between May 1587 and March 1607. 6 Brentford Fair was usually held in July. For Bishop John Aylmer, see the Biographical Guide. Although his biographer John Strype makes no mention of any feasts, Aylmer was notorious for forbidding certain fasts. 7 Dee's name had first been mentioned in connection with the provostship of Eton in the mid-1560s (see the ' Compendious· Rehearsal'). The archbishop was John Whitgift. 8 In his 'Compendious Rehearsal', Dee stated that he had 'given or lent' Conrad Nesselbrenner 70 dollars in return for some unspecified services for the Queen. Dee's deliberate refusal to give details, and the air of mystery with which he surrounded the transaction, has fuelled speculation that he was working as a secret agent. The Lord Chancellor was Sir Christopher Hatton. 9 Denis Zacaire's manuscript was on the subject of the philosophers' stone. Drs Roberts and Watson (john Dee's Library Catalogue) were unable to discover its fate after Dee's death. 10 The castle in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, overlooked the River Teifi. It contained about twenty rooms as well as a chapel, prison and brewhouse. The castle was later held for King Charles during the Civil War, and blown up at the end of it. (Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments in wales and Monmouthshire, vol. 5, p. 220; LQndon, 1917.) II Dee was hoping that one of the new incumbents would vacate a position that"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE he could fill. For instance, 'the worshipful Mr Dr Bennet (the present incumbent of the Mastership of St Crosses) might be persuaded to be promoted ... by her Majesty; especially if the bishopric be of better living far, than St Crosses' ('Compendious Rehearsal'). I2 Aubrey managed to obtain for Dee 'a few advowsons of rectories, endowed with vicarages in St David's diocese', but in the 'Compendious Rehearsal' he was to complain that 'there never came penny unto me of them; neither is it certain whether ever or never there shall; but of charges sustained (about the writing and seals to them belonging) I am too certain.' 13 'About treasure, a book. Maria.' Maria or Mary had been one of Dee's servants. In an Action of April 1587 (when Dee had described her as his 'old maid'), Kelly had said that she would see 'the wonderful days to come' (A True and FaithfuL Relation, Actio Tenia, p. 13). 14 Dee wrote to William Camden about Arthur on 22 May 1592: 'He is of an exceeding great and haughty mind naturally: ready to revenge rashly &c. The natural inclination is to me evident: as who hath 0 in horoscopo, and 0-€ in corde Leonis ... You may alter this natural courage to true fortitude, and not to frail rash fancies: Socrates did overcome by grace divine, and his industry, his untowardness, signified by the art physiognomical &c. You know the history. This spiritual grammatical concords of good manners I have great care that all my imps may be instructed in to the more apt and skilfuJ serving of our Creator &c. Sir, my wife hath delivered unto him some more apparel, and furniture in a little chest with lock and key, yea and with some towels to wipe his face on: after the morning and other washings of hands and face: willing him, to buy him a stone basin: and a pot of a pottle to have always clean and wholesome water in, for his use. The boy like the abundance of meat well: but very bashfully he said that the proportion of drink is somewhat too little ... For now and in the summer's seasons, the proportion of drink naturally doth increase, above winter's appetite thereof. Thus I am bold to cumber your worship with these my speedy ragged lines.' (British Library, Cotton Julius Caesar MS V, f. 45.) 15 'I borrowed ten pound of Master Thomas Smith to be repaid at Christmas next. Philosophatur.' 16 'Maria came again at 7 in the afternoon.' 17 See also 31 January 1594. Dee himself had turned sixty-five earlier in the month. 18 The mastership of the Hospital of St Cross at Winchester matched all of Dee's criteria for an ideal position: he envisaged setting up a private research institute, from where he could 'enjoy the commodious sending over into divers places beyond the seas for things and men very necessary; and for to have the more commodious place for the secret arrival of special men to"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"MASTER OF A FULL POOR CELL, 1589-1594 come unto me there' ('Compendious Rehearsal'). 19 There was an unusual number of planets in a trine aspect to each other, as highlighted by Dee in his copy of Stadius' Ephemerides. The symbol for 'trine' is the same as that which Dee used for his own name. 20 This notice is accompanied by a sketch of a death's head. Dee was referring not to Richard Candish the politician, but to the circumnavigator Thomas (whom, confusingly, John Davis also called Richard). The exact date of his death is in fact a mystery. He is generally believed to have died in 1592, but Candish's own account of his 'last days' (reprinted by Hakluyt) may have been faked by him. (See Edwards P, Last Voyages: Cavendish, Hudson, Ralegh; Oxford, 1988.) 21 'Today the wind blowing west and by south as it hath for rwo days past, very boisterous, the Thames is so void of water by forcing out the fresh and keeping back the salt, that in divers places men have gone over rwo hundred paces and then flung a stone to land. A certain collier on a mare rode from the north side to the south and back again on either side of London Bridge.' (Quoted by Harrison GB, ed., The Elizabethan Journals, vol. I, p. 160; London, 1939.) 22 The book by Francken (see 9 July 1587) had in fact been printed in 1584. Dee had bought Sommerus' Refutatio Scripti Petri Carolii editi Wittebergtt (printed not at Ingolstadt but at Krak6w) while on the Continent, and apparently showed it to Archbishop Whitgift to demonstrate his own orthodoxy: but Whitgift's chaplain and successor Richard Bancroft liked it so much that he later had it bound and embossed with his archiepiscopal coat of arms. It is in the library of Lambeth Palace to this day. (Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue, pp. 157-8.) . 23 Dee received the commissioners in his former library, where he had placed three tables: one for them to sit at, a second covered with letters and testimonies of his studious life, and a third covered with books he had written. ('Compendious Rehearsal.') 24 This was a special day for Dee, and he underlined the positions of all the planets in his ephemerides. . 25 For Richard Meredyth, Bishop of Leighlin, see the Biographical Guide. 26 Although Edward Maynard did not die until 10 January, Dee noted on the previous day that: This day death seized on him.' 27 Dee's usual abbreviation for the Archangel Uriel. 28 Mrs Twine was possibly Joanna Pumfrett, wife of the physician Thomas Twyne, and mother of the Oxford antiquary Brian Twyne. Mrs Banister may have been the widow ofThoinas Banister, navigator and agent of the Muscovy Company, whose death on his fifth expedition to Persia is described in Hakluyt's Principal Voyages and Navigatiom. 11 271 11"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE 29 A year earlier, the Privy Council had reported 'great anxiety ... that the enemy will attempt to surprise the town of O stend' (Acts of the Privy Council, 27 August 1592); and in July 1593, Spanish ships were seen off the Brittany coast. It was widt;ly feared that the King of Spain's 'malice was increased by his loss and shame received in '88'; and that since 'his resolution still was to invade this kingdom, ... he desired some nearer place from whence to invade England' (see Harrison GB, ed., The ELizabethan Journals, vol. I, pp. 157, 196-7, 251; London, 1939). 30 The Marshalsea was the second most important prison in London during Elizabeth's reign; it was used mainly, though not exclusively, for debtors. 31 Possibly as payment for casting his horoscope. Dee recorded his nativity at the front of his copy of Stadius' Ephemerides. (28 September 1563: 'Mr John Ask ante meridiem, by York six mile on this side.') 32 'A sudden pang of anger between Mr Nicolls and me.' Almost nothing is known about Richard A1red-or what he disclosed to Dee-except that he was a Lancastrian who had matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1575. 33 Distrust of Spain was still rife at Elizabeth's court in 1594, fuelled by the abortive 'Spanish blanks' conspiracy of the previous year. Dee may have helped to fan the flames by denouncing the royal physician, Dr Lopez, for an alleged attempt to poison the Queen. John Aubrey's description is probably as unreliable as ever ('the doctor betrayed it, beshit himself), but Lopez was indeed 'executed in this year. 34 Roberts and Watson (John Dee's Library CataLogue) have identified Mr Harding as John Harding, Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford, and Mr Abbot as either George Abbot (the future archbishop of Canterbury) or his brother Robert. 35 'So Hughes Day' may have been the title of a piece of poetry or prose: possibly the 'heavenly admonition' which Dee delivered to the Queen on 3 May. 36 According to the CaLendar a/State Papers (vol. 248, no. 121), Dee was still hoping to succeed to the Hospital of St Cross 'on the death or resignation of Dr Rob. Bennet, the present incumbent~. In fact Dr Bennet was to outlive Dee by eight years. 37 Theobalds, Lord Burghley's country seat in Hertfordshire. 38 Saturn and Mars were believed to be malevolent planets (see William Lilly's Christian Astrology; London, 1647). 39 Lord Howard of Effingham (see Biographical Guide). 6 272 6"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Dldieu to the Court and courting AFTER FIVE YEARS of rejection, the post that Dee was finally offered-the wardemhip of the Collegiate Chapter at Manchester-matched none of the criteria that he had expressed to the Queen so optimistically in his 'Compendious Rehearsal: However, at the age of sixty-seven he decided to accept what would be the most arduous as well as the least rewarding position of his career. Although he performed the endless administrative duties with his customary diligence, his reputation as a conjuror meant that many of the Fellows were bitterly unhappy with the appointment.

Among their publications were the Ephemerides of Stadius and Sir Thomas More's Utopia."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"ADIEU TO THE COURT AND COURTING, 1595-1601 4 Dee's information was wrong (see Biographical Guide). 5 'Lent to Master Laurence Dutton twelve shillings.' 6 The warden and Fellows of Manchester College were lords of the manor of Newton, and court leets were held there regularly. Newton may also have been where Dee lived; the name certainly features a disproportionate amount during his years in Manchester. 7 Cowly had been servant to Dee's friend, the antiquary Robert Cotton (1571-1631). On 10 May 1596 Dee wrote to Cotton to assure him that he would never dream of 'coveting, desiring or longing after my neighbour's wife, or any servant of him. If I might have a thousand pound to solicit or procure any man's servant to forsake his master or mistress, and to come to me, or any other, I would not do it.' (British Library, Cotton MS Julius Caesar C III, f. 136.) 8 The Bank was the Saviles' house on Beacon Hill, overlooking Halifax. 9 A commission drawn up by Dee and issued in May 1598 complained about 'the decay and poor estate of Christ's College in Manchester'; the commission of June 1596 is likely to have been a preliminary version. 10 Rafe Holden was a college-tenant of the Great Brereridings (or Brier Riding), some reclaimed land in Salford o~ned by Manchester College. II Hough End, in the chapelry of Chorlton cum Hardy, Manchester, was the seat of the cloth merchant Nicholas Mosley, who became lord mayor of London in 1599. 12 It may be significant that Francys, who was born between Madimia and Margaret, is not mentioned here. If she was already dead, it may explain why John Dee felt able to put her godmother's present to her in pawn (see 17 February 1597). 13 The feast-day of Michael the Archangel. Michael was the only archangel honoured with a feast in the western calendar until the twentieth century, when Gabriel and Raphael became similarly distinguished. 14 Robert Stephens, whose Concordance was printed in 1555, also published a version of the New Testament and a Latin thesaurus. Pezelius' book De Gena Domini was an attack on Luther. Dee had met Pezelius in Bremen on his way back to England (see 16126 November 1589 and footnote). 15 The writer John Wier had been a pupil of Cornelius Agrippa. Edmund Hopwood was keen to read his book on demons because of the hysteria about demoniacal possession that had gripped the county since 1594, when nine-year-old Anne Starkie had suddenly been 'taken with a dumpish and heavy countenance and with a certain fearful starting and pulling together of her body', while her ten-year-old brother John was unable to stop shouting."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE Their father Nicholas employed a conjuror naf!1ed Edmund Hartley, who managed to cure the children with 'certain popish charms and herbs', but then began making ever-more extortionate demands: threatening that unless he was given an annual pension, together with a house and grounds, the children would once again be taken by the Devil. Starkie eventually approached Dee, 'whose help he requested, but he utterly refused, saying he would not meddle, and advised him that setting aside all other help, he should call for some good preachers, with whom he should consult concerning a public or private fast'. In fact Dee did summon Hartley to him on 8 December 1596, and 'sharply reproved' him, while Hopwood became involved when he took the children's testimony: but it was Dee's new curate, Matthew Palmer, who ended Hardey's career. Having found him in the company of a terrified local woman, Palmer asked what he was doing; and when Hardey replied 'that he came to pray with her', Palmer challenged him to say the Lord's Prayer. Hartley 'began to fumble about it very ill-favouredly, but could not for his life say it to the end'. Palmer thereupon accused him of being a witch, and had him sent to the Lancaster assizes where he was arraigned, convicted of conjuring evil spirits, and hanged. (More G, A True Discourse concerning the Certain Possession and Dispossession of 7 Persons in one Family in Lancashire; Middlesborough, 1600; Darrell J, A True Narration of the Strange and Grievous Vexation by the Devil of 7 Persons in Lancashire; no place, 1600.) 16 De Morbis Puerorum by Hieronymus Mercurialis (1583). I7 For the Bishop of Lincoln, William Chaderton, see the Biographical Guide. 18 Perambulation of a parish was an ancient custom to preserve or establish its boundaries. Two days earlier Dee had written to Mr Langley, parson of the neighbouring parish of Prestwich: 'My desire is, that your worship would request some one, or two, of the ancient of your parish, to be also beholders of our bounds notifYing, toward your parish in that place: my neighbours do intend to come on Wednesday next in the morning, about 9 or 10 of the clock to that part that is by Goodman Smehurst's house, and so toward the birch tree, that is called the Leeless Birch; and thereabouts, for a little space ... for avoiding of undue encroaching of any neighbourly parish, one on the other.' (Quoted by J.E. Bailey in his edition of Dee's Diary for the Years I595-I6oI.) 19 Despite intermittent wars the Polish grain trade was still booming, reaching its peak in 1618 (see Davies N, God's Playground: A History of Poland, chapter 8). In Gdansk alone there were about five hundred local merchants dealing with foreign traders, mainly from England and the Netherlands. 20 ' In Judah God is known' are the opening words of the 76th Psalm. 21 The notorious treatise against witchcraft, compiled by two Dominican"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"ADIEU TO THE COURT AND COURTING, 1595-1601 inquisitors at the end of the fifteenth century, was one of the most influential books on the European mainland during Dee's lifetime. Only a few copies are known to have been sold in England, however, before the first English translation several hundred years later. 22 According to Halsbury's Laws of England, so-called 'tenant right estates'-copyhold estates for three lives, with benefit of renewal-were particularly common in the north of England. 23 Literally 'my grief' or 'my bitterness' . 24 Alport Park (see 19 August 1597) had formerly been in the possession of the warden, before passing to the earls of Derby. The new warden's house, in Deansgate, was not built until after Dee had left Manchester. 25 J.E. Bailey, in his 1880 edition of Dee's Manchester diary, identified the gate as 'the lower gate, or gate-house' and stated that 'there are yet gate-marks in the old wall'. 26 In September 1596 there had been a complaint that Goodyer had encroached on the waste-land near Cloughe House. Dee's position as warden involved him in a great number of legal disputes, many of them otherwise unrecorded. 27 The living of Upton upon Severn fell vacant at least once during this year, and Dee must have hoped to have it restored to him. His informant may have been Miles Smith, who succeeded to the living in 1604 and became Bishop of Gloucester in 1612. 28 This entry is followed by a 27-month gap, broken only by a drawing of a dagger against the dates 24-27 March 1598, and Dee's abbreviation for the Archangel Uriel against 26 April 1598. 29 The commission had been set up to investigate encroachments upon the manor of Newton. 30 'Concerning certain differences of bodies and spirits.' The book was never written. 31 The Bishop of Chester was Richard Vaughan (see Biographical Guide). 32 Dee's efforts to rectify the 'decay and poor estate' of Manchester College (see 18 June 1596) seem to have been rewarded. The organ had been removed during the Reformation fifty years earlier. 33 Rowland Dee was among the pupils of Manchester Grammar School, under the physician and writer Thomas Cogan (1545?-1607). 34 'Let the truth prevail.' It is uncertain what Dee had been hoping for, but it was presumably related to his subsequent decision to burn his records of Barthilmew Hickman's untrue actions.

J Theodore's coneeption '''2nd birth had been the culmination of Dee's collaboration with Kelly, and since Dee continued to believe in the validity of the angelic Actiom, ,he may also have believed that Theodore had been brought into the world for some special purpose, like a host of great figures who had been c;onceived and born in equally extraordinary circumstances: including the patriarch Isaac, john the Baptist, jesus, and Dee's supposed ancestor King Arthur. Furthermore, apart from the written records of the Actiom, and the ritual paraphernalia such tiS the Holy Table, Theodore himself was the only tangible product of the whole enterprise, and his death must have tested Dee's deepest-held convictions to the limit. Meanwhile the Fellows of Manchester College did not soJttn towards him, and rumours continued to spread about Dee's satanic practices. In june I604 he petitioned Kingjames I to let him be tried for witchcraft, in an attempt to clear his name, but the King refused. He was finally driven from Manchester after the death of his wife in March I605.2 Back in Mortlake he persisted with bis work on the trammuttttion of metals;3 and in his eightieth year he asked one of his first skryers, Barthilmew Hickman, to make contact with the angels once again. }) 0 1607 11 @ 20 Mar.

And when the astrologer Richard Napier met Dee in July 16°4, Napier recorded that they talked about Ewald de Hoghelande's book on transmutation and the works of Ram6n Lull (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 1488, ( 21). 4 Robert Cecil (see Biographical Guide) had been created first Earl of Salisbury rwo years previously. 5 See 23 March 1583. 6 According to the Old Testament, God extended Hezekiah's life after being moved by his prayers and tears (II Kings xx. 6; Isaiah xxxviii. 5). 7 Although Dee had left Manchester for good, he seems to have retained the wardenship for financial reasons. 8 Edward Eccleston had lost some money, and suspected that he had been robbed by a carpenter named Thomas Webster, 'of the age under 40, not more, within the county of Lancaster'. He hoped that Dee, in his capacity as a 'cunning man' or wizard, could find Webster and/or the treasure. A note to this effect, written by Eccleston, is attached to the manuscript of the Actions. For the ubiquity of cunning men at this time, see chapter 8 of Thomas K, Religion and the Decline of Magic. 9 A bell-shaped salt container; see 19 January 1601. 10 The Abbey of St Mary Pratis or Delapre was just to the south of Northampton; the house passed to the Tate family after the dissolution of the monasteries.

II Among the noblemen killed in the Battle of Northampton (10 July 1460) was the Duke of Buckingham. Many of the dead were buried in the grounds of the convent. 12 After the relative stability of King Stephen Bathory's reign, the election of the Catholic Sigismund III to the throne of Poland was bound to incur the hostility of Protestant Sweden; and when in 1592 Sigismund succeeded also to the Swedish throne, war was inevitable. In 1598 Sigismund was defeated at Strangebro by the Protestant regent of Sweden, his uncle Charles, and he was deposed the following year when his uncle was proclaimed Charles IX. Sigismund never abandoned his claim to the throne of Sweden, however, and open war berween the rwo countries broke out again in 1607."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"JEPILOGUE THE FATE OF John Dee's library had been settled on II July 1607, when the Archangel Raphael told him to entrust it to the merchant John Pontoys. Unfortunately Pontoys was no bibliophile, and he later allowed the library to be dispersed· but among the books he kept for himself was the volume of Maginus' Ephemerides which Dee had used as a diary between 1585 and 1601. One of the first entries Pontoys made was against the date 26 February 1609, where he drew a death's head and wrote: Jno d, hor: 3.a.m.' Although Dee is usually believed to have died in December 1608, this note is a clear indication of the true time and date of his death. 1609 was also the year that CaMeo constructed his first telescope and thereby established himself as one of the founders of modern science. Like Dee's crystal ball, CaMeo's telescope was an optical device, and we should not assume that it was always obvious which of the two instruments would have the greater impact. The most conspicuous' difference, perhaps, lay not so much in the instruments themselves as in the approaches of the two scientists. While Dee believed that he could appeal directly to Cod to reveal the key to all knowledge, Calileo stated that science could only progress by adding 'one small truth' to another. Exactly fifty years later, when Meric Casaubon published his volume of Dee's spirit diaries, he wrote on the splendidly grandiloquent title-page that, had the angelic conferences succeeded, they would have led to a general alteration of most STATES and KINGDOMS in the world~ The fact that such an alteration was effected not suddenly, by Dee, but gradually, by Calileo, has been one of science's greatest lessons of the past four hundred years."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"APPENDIX ONE IN HIS 'Compendious Rehearsal' of I592, John Dee told Queen Elizabeth that he had kept a record of the noteworthy events of his life for the previous forty-five years.

FRISEuND: an imaginary island in the North Atlantic. As late as the nineteenth century its identity was still being debated by serious geographers like Alexander von Humboldt. (Karrow RW, Mapmakers of the Sixteenth Century and their Maps; Chicago, 1993.) Dee's theory that it had been conquered by King Arthur formed the basis for his extravagant claims for Queen Elizabeth's titles to lands across the Atlantic (see Clulee NH, John Dee's Natural Philosophy, p. 182).

Each entry below appears under that chosen spelling, which is not necessarily the one most customary today. Peers are entered under either the family name or the title, whichever makes for easier identification: i.e. whichever was ordinarily used by Dee. ALASKI, ALBERT. See LASKI, ALBERT. ALEN90N, FRAN901S, DUKE OF (1554-1584). Elizabeth I's ' Frog Prince' and one of her favourite suitors. Between 1579 and 1582 the question of whether Elizabeth would marry 'Monsieur' became one of the most pressing matters of state. The prospect of their marriage, however-never popular with the English people-became fraught with political danger when lie accepted an invitation from William the Silent to become sovereign of the Protestant states in the Low Countries, to try and break the Spanish stranglehold there. ANDERSON, SIR EDMUND (1530-1605). Lord chief justice of the court of Common Pleas from 1582. He presided over some of the most contentious trials of the time, including those of Edmund Campion and Sir Walter Raleigh, and was notorious for his harsh treatment of the prisoners. Dee's visit in May 1592 may have been in connection with the trial of Sir John Perrot. ASHLEY, ANTHONY (155l-1628). Clerk of the privy council and author of The Mariner's Mirror of Navigation (1588); knighted in 1596 for his role in the attack on Cadiz, undertaken to prevent Spain from building a new Armada. His wife Jane had survived a serious illness earlier in the year that the family came to stay with Dee; Ashley had written to Lord Burghley saying that she was 'in danger of death'. AWBREY [AUBREY], WILLIAM (1529-1595). Civil lawyer and politician. His great-grandson, the antiquary John Aubrey, wrote a brief account of his life in which he noted that 'the learned John Dee was his great friend and kinsman, as I find by letters between them.' His wife was Wilgiford Williams, ' whom he married"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE very young, as a maiden, and enjoyed to his death'. John Aubrey added that 'the figure in his monument at St Paul's is not like him; it is too big.' AYLMER, JOHN (1521-1594). Bishop of London from 1577. He was notorious for his hatred of puritans, and was said to enjoy irritating them by playing bowls on Sunday. His biographer John Strype (Historical Collections of the Life and Acts of ... John Aylmer, London, 1701) described him as 'bold, free in speech, stout in words', with 'a quick and somewhat hasty spirit'. In November 1581 the Queen was told of 'great disorders in Essex, a considerable part of his diocese; and that the ministers there in their several churches had ways and forms of their own, all different from the appointed service.' Although Strype ostensibly set out to discount the numerous slanders against the bishop, he devoted much of his book to repeating them. BARNES [BARNE] , GEORGE (d.1593). The son of a former lord mayor of London and founder member of the Muscovy Company, he himself became a governor of the Muscovy Company in 1580 and lord mayor six years later. He was knighted (also like his father) in 1587. BEALE, ROBERT (1541-1601). Antiquary, member of parliament and diplomat. Having read the death warrant to Mary Queen of Scots, and written an eye-witness account of her execution, he was later to complain that his role in the affair had blighted his career and made his name 'odious to the whole world'. His wife Edith was Sir Francis Walsingham's sister-in-law. BEDFORD, FRANCIS RUSSELL, SECOND EARL OF (c.1527-1585). Politician and diplomat. He was Francis Drake's godfather, and may have visited Dee in 1577 in connection with Drake's voyage of circumnavigation that began later the same year. He was the father of John, Lord Russell, and of the Countesses of Warwick and Cumberland. BELLINGHAM, EDWARD (c.1545-1605). Justice of the peace from about 1573, and later a member of parliament; his house in Putney was near Dee's. BLUNT [BLOUNT], CHARLES (1563-1606). Soldier and favourite of Queen Elizabeth; he fought at Zutphen with Sir Philip Sydney. Later in Ireland he succeeded in crushing Tyrone, where the Earl of Essex had failed. He became the eighth Lord Mountjoy in 1594, after the death of his brother William. BLUNT [BLOUNT], SIR MICHAEL (c.1529-1609). Lord lieutenant of the Tower of London from 1590 before he was himself imprisoned there in 1595-6. He was a distant cousin of Charles Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, and laid an unsuccessful claim to the barony on the latter's death. BODINUS [BODIN], JOANNES [rEAN] (1520?-1596). French antiquarian and political economist; like Dee, he was 'a strong believer in astrology and the reality of the spirit world, deeply influenced by Neoplatonic mysticism and the magic of numbers' (Evans RJW, Rudolf!! and his World, p. 17). He visited England in 1581 as secretary to the Duke of Alen<;:on.

BROGRAVE, JOHN (1538-1613). Lawyer, who in 1577 had been described as 'very learned, poor, smally practised, worthy of great practice' . Success came to him almost immediately afterwards; he became attorney of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1580, and was member of parliament for Boroughbridge when Dee met him in 1596. BROMLEY, SIR THOMAS (1530-1587). Lord chancellor from 1579. Studious and grave but also outspoken, he opposed the suggested marriage between Elizabeth and Alen'Yon. In 1581 Sir Francis Drake courted his favour with 800 dollars' worth of gold plundered from the Spanish. It is not known which of Bromley's four sons Dee met in December of the same year. BUCKHURST, THOMAS SACKVILLE, FIRST BARON (1536-1608). Privy councillor, diplomat and favourite of Queen Elizabeth. With Thomas Norton he co-wrote Gorboduc, which was acted before the Queen in 1562, and which has been called the earliest English tragedy. In 1599 he became lord treasurer after the death of Burghley. BURGHLEY, WILLIAM CECIL, FIRST BARON (1520-1598). Elizabeth I's chief secretary of state (from 1558) and lord treasurer (from 1572). Dee was introduced to him in 1551, when Cecil was a junior secretary of state to Edward VI. The meeting resulted in Dee being granted a pension, and Dee subsequently regarded Cecil as his natural patron: asking for money and support in February 1563, and a further annual pension of £200 in October 1574. When Burghley (as a political realist) failed to respond enthusiastically to Dee's plans' for imperial expansion, Dee took offence and felt that he was being ~arginalised at court. BURROW [BOROUGH/BURROUGH], WILLIAM (1536-1599). Navigator and explorer who first sailed to Russia at the age of sixteen. In 1579 he was involved in a dispute with Michael Lok over a ship that the latter had bought for Frobisher's third voyage; Lok was thrown into the Fleet Prison. By 1583 Burrow was controller of the navy, and involved in hunting down pirates, ten of whom were hanged in August of that year-the month that he apparently snubbed Dee. Hakluyt's Principal Voyages of the English Nation contains extensive references to him. BYRON, SIR JOHN (d.1603). Landowner in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire; sheriff of Lancashire in 1572 and 1581. His son, also John (d.1622), was knighted in 1603. CAESAR, JULIUS (1558-1636). Judge of the Admiralty court (after the death of David Lewis) and one of the masters of requests. Dee corresponded with him regularly. Although an unreliable judge, he was popular and humane; Izaak Walton stated that he was kept alive beyond the natural span by the prayers of those he had relieved. He was knighted in 1603. CAMDEN, WILLIAM (1551-1623). Writer and antiquarian. He began to collect"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE material for his monumental Britannia while in his early twenties, and accepted the post of second master at Westminster School in 1575 in the knowledge that it would leave him time to continue his researches. By the time that Arthur Dee entered Westminster School in 1592, Camden's Britannia had gone through three editions in London and one in Frankfurt. From 1593 he devoted his life to travelling and writing. According to John Aubrey he owned a copy of Stadius' Ephemerides which, like Dee, he used as a diary. CANDISH [CAVENDISH], RICHARD (d.160I?) Politician, diplomat and translator of Euclid into English. His memorial in Homsey church was designed by Margaret, Countess of Cumberland. CANDISH [CAVENDISH] THOMAS (1560-1592). Circumnavigator and naval adventurer, whose first voyage to the West Indies and Virginia was primarily piratical. He was the third sea-captain to sail around the world (1586-8). On his return he was treated as a hero, and his achievement was celebrated in popular ballads; but he blamed John Davis for the failure of his final voyage, and is said to have died at sea of a broken heart. (See Edwards P, Last Voyages: Cavendish, Hudson, Ralegh; Oxford, 1988.) CAREY, SIR GEORGE (1547-1603). Soldier, shipowner and marshal of the Queen's household. In the year before. the launching of the Spanish Armada he was responsible for restoring the defences of the Isle of Wight. CARTER, OLIVER (1540?-1605). Fellow of Manchester College. A zealous puritan, and author of An Amwer unto Certain Popish Questions and Demands (1579), he was also extremely suspicious of Dee. He died of the pestilence, and was buried just three days before Jane Dee. CECIL, ROBERT, FIRST EARL OF SALISBURY (1563-1612). Diplomat who learnt his skill in statecraft from his father, the first Lord Burghley. He acted as secretary to Lord Derby, before becoming secretary of state in 1596. Although reserved and ininspiring, he became one of the most powerful statesmen in the country, and from his father's death in 1598 to his own death in 1612 responsibility for the main burdens of state was his alone. He played a large part in the negotiation of peace with Spain in 1604, and the following year helped to unravel the Gunpowder Plot through his highly efficient secret service. His wife was Lord Cobham's daughter Elizabeth. CECIL, SIR THOMAS (1542-1623). Soldier, member of parliament and naval volunteer against the Armada. His father, the first Lord Burghley (whom he ' succeeded in 1598), considered him a great disappointment. His wife was Dorothy (co-heiress of John, Lord Latimer), with whom he had thirteen children. CECIL, WILLIAM. See BURGHLEY, LORD. CHADERTON, WILLIAM (1540?-1608). Bishop of Lincoln (from 1595) and Dee's predecessor as warden of Manchester College (from 1580).

A near-contemporary of Dee's at St John's College, Cambridge; like Dee he was one of the original Fellows of Trinity College. He became Bishop of Chichester in 1557, and according to Thomas Fuller 'scarce was he warm in his bishopric, when he fell a-burning the poor martyrs: ten in one fire at Lewes, and seventeen others at several times in sundry places.' On Elizabeth 1's accession he was sent to prison, where he died a month later. CLINTON, EDWARD FIENNES DE, NINTH LORD CLINTON AND SAYE (1512-1585). Lord high admiral and confidant of Lord Burghley. His wife Elizabeth had been Henry VIII's mistress and was the mother of the king's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond. Jane Fromonds was in her retinue at court. COBHAM, WILLIAM BROOKE, SEVENTH BARON (d.1597). Diplomat and lord chamberlain of the Queen's household. His wife was Frances, daughter of Sir John Newton. COOK [COKE], ROGER (b.1552). Dee's alchemical assistant from 1567 to 1581. He returned to Dee's service briefly in 1600, but by 1606 was working for the 'Wizard Earl' of Northumberland, and may have been employed as an alchemical assistant at the court of Rudolph II up to the Emperor's death in 1612. (Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue, p. 43.) CRADOCKE [CRADOCK], EDWARD. Alchemist and Oxford professor, most of whose writings concerned his search for the philosophers' stone. CROFT, LADY. Daughter of Edward Blount and godmother of Katharin Dee. Her husband, Sir James Croft (c.1518-1590), had been lord deputy of Ireland and governor of Berwick, but by the early 1580s was as desperate for patronage as Dee was. Having already been sent to the Tower under Queen Mary, he was imprisoned there again by Lord Burghley on conspiracy charges. Croft believed that the Earl of Leicester was behind the charges, and his son Edward (by his first wife) employed a London sorcerer named John Smith to kill him by magic. When Leicester died in September·1588, Edward Croft and John Smith were sent for trial, but the charges were dismissed. CUMBERLAND, COUNTESS OF [LADY MARGARET CLIFFORD] (1560-1616). Daughter of Francis Russell, second Earl of Bedford, and younger sister of the Countess of Warwick. She married George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, in 1577. She spent much of her later life fighting for her daughter Anne's right to succeed to the family estates. Edmund Spenser dedicated his 'Four Hymns' (in praise of love and beauty) to her and her sister. CURTZ [KURTZ/KURZ VON SENFTENAU], JAKOB (d.1594).

He was still an MP at the start of the troubles that led to the Civil War, and was impeached by the Long Parliament in 1641, though the proceedings were allowed to drop. DAVIS [DAVIES, DAVYES), JOHN (C.1552-1605). Navigator. His exact date of birth is not known but in 1568 Dee and an assistant (WEM) 'elicited by magic' the date of 3 May 1552 (Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS 423, f. 294). Davis himself may have been actively interested in the spirit world: a document in the British Library (Additional MS 36674, ff. 58-62), dated 24 February 1567, describes some visions seen by a skryer of this name, and his master 'HG' , who was possibly Humfrey Gilbert. He made three voyages to discover a north-west passage to the orient, and established that Greenland is separate from America. However, a voyage to the South Seas (1591-3) ended in failure, his colleague Thomas Candish claiming that Davis had fatally deserted him. Davis returned to England (having provisioned his ship with 14,000 dried penguins), to find that his wife Faith had taken a lover, a forger named Milburne (described by Sir Walter Raleigh as 'a fugitive and dissolute person'), who tried to discredit Davis to protect himself from his revenge. (Faith Davis may have been the 'errant strumpet' referred to by Dee on 18 October 1579.) Although historians such as Geoffrey Elton and Christopher Morris have stated that his reputation remained untainted, he seems to have been one of the principal despoilers of John Dee's library; almost every page of Dee's meticulous library catalogue contains the words 'Jo. Davis spoyle' against one or more books (Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue). On his final voyage, to the East Indies, he was hacked to death by Japanese pirates. DAY, WILLIAM (1529-1596). Chancellor ofSt Paul's Cathedral (a position which Dee hoped to succeed him in) and bishop of Winchester from the end of 1595. He was a zealous puritan, and as provost of Eton (1562-1595) he had devoted much time and effort to destroying all vestiges of the unreformed faith in the college chapel. The destruction of the rood screen alone had taken three weeks. DEE, ARTHUR (1579-1651). Eldest son ofJohn and Jane Dee; he became a successful physician, serving first ·the Tsar of Russia and then King Charles I. Elias Ashmole translated his mystical work Fasciculus Chemicus and was gratified to receive a letter from Arthur Dee, in retirement in Norwich, expressing his amazement 'that you or any man should take the pains to translate any book of that nature into English, for the art is vilified too much already by scholars that daily deride it.'

She was the mother of Arthur (1579-1651), Katharin (b.1581), Rowland (b.1582), Michael (1585-1594), Theodore (conceived during the marital cross-matching, and born in 1588), Madimia (b.1590, and named after the spirit who delivered the doctrine of cross-matching), Francys (b.1592) and Margaret (b.1595). She died of the plague (which may also have killed Rowland, Madimia and Margaret) and was buried in the Collegiate Church of Manchester on 23 March 1605. DEE, JOHN (1527-16°9). Alchemist, mystic, book-collector, astrologer, mathematician and pioneering advocate of the British Empire, John Dee was born on Saturday 13 July 1527, to Johanna and Rowland Dee. His father was a gentleman sewer (not server, as sometimes stated) at the court of King Henry VlII; Dee also claimed to be descended from Roderick the Great, Prince of all Wales, as well as from King Arthur. At the age of fifteen he was sent to' St John's College, Cambridge, where (according to his own account) he studied for eighteen hours a day. He became a Fellow of the newly founded Trinity College, and gained his lifelong reputation as a sorcerer after devising some special effects for a production of Aristophanes. In 1548, on his second trip to the Continent, he became a student at Louvain in the Low Countries; two years later in Paris he delivered a series of lectures on Euclid, in front of so many listeners 'that the mathematical schools could not hold them; for many were fain, without the schools at the windows, to be audirors and spectators, as they best could help themselves thereto' ('Compendious Rehearsal'). On returning to England he was introduced to King Edward Vl and given an' annual pension of a hundred crowns, which he exchanged for the living of Upton upon Severn in Worcestershire; he also became rector of Long Leadenham, Lincolnshire, later the same year. On the accession of Queen Mary he was imprisoned on suspicion of trying to kill her 'by enchantments'. One of his cellmates, the Protestant Barthlet Green, was burnt at the stake in 1556. Dee, however, was pardoned; and on Mary's death he found himself in favour with the new queen, Elizabeth. With his huge library, eventually amounting to at least 2000 books and 200 manuscripts (many of them saved from destruction after the dissolution of the monasteries), he became revered as one of the most learned men in the country. Over the next two decades he wrote all his most important books, including the Propttdeumata Aphoristica (a collection of observations on astrology and astronomy, 1558), the mystical Monas Hieroglyphica (1564), his 'Mathematical Preface' ro Euclid's Elements of Geometry (1570), and his contribution to England's imperial ambitions, General and Rare Memorials Pertaining to the Perfect Art of Navigation (1577). He also wrote a tract on the reform of the calendar, which he claimed occupied his attention so much in 1582 that he missed the deadline for renewing the licences for his parsonages. This sudden loss"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE of income was one of the factors that led him to seek the patronage of a succession of foreign princes from 1583 to 1589: Prince Albert Laski and King Stephen Bathory in Poland, and the Emperor Rudolph II and William of Rosenberg in Bohemia. However, during these years he was driven principally by his belief that he was following the wishes of God and the angels, who were communicating to him through his seer Edward Kelly. On finally returning to England he found that his library had been despoiled by various former friends who had helped themselves to many of his most treasured books and possessions; he spent the next few years trying to restore them and seeking paid employment. His appointment as warden of Manchester College, in 1595, ended his influence at court. On one of the few occasions that he returned, in June 1604, it was to present a petition to King James I in an attempt to dispel his reputation as a sorcerer. He asked to be put on trial and executed if found guilty; but James dismissed the petition, and the image of Dee as a reclusive crystal-gazing magician has endured ever since. For John Dee, however, what we would now describe as magic was the crucial link between science and religion. He tested this link to the limits, staking his entire reputation on it; and although he himself was never disillusioned, his career marks the final break between the two in western thought. John Dee died in Lo.ndon on 26 February 1609, and was buried in the chancel of Mortlake Church. The memorial had already vanished by the time John Aubrey went looking for it seventy years later.

Although there have been several excellent studies of Dee's work and his times, a full modern biography has yet to be written.) DEE, KATHARIN (b.1581). Eldest daughter of John and Jane Dee. Legend has cast her in the role of Miranda to Dee's Prospero. According to Elias Ashmole, 'When Doctor Dee lay sick of the sickness whereof he died, his maiden daughter Katherine conveyed away his books unknown to him [to sell them for food] about a fortnight before he died which when he came to understand, it broke his heart.' The notoriously vague John Aubrey stated that she was later 'married in Southwark to a flax-dresser whose name I have forgot.' (Josten CH, Elias Ashmole, pp. 1299, 1333.) DENY [DENNY], EDWARD (c.I547-1600). Godson of King Edward VI. He sailed with his cousins Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humfrey Gilbert in 1578. After a stint of privateering he went to Ireland In command of a hundred men; in September 1580 he was complaining bitterly to Walsingham about the country and the people. He entered parliament after returning to England. DERBY, WILLIAM STANLEY, SIXTH EARL· OF (c.1561-1642). Younger brother of Ferdinando Stanley, the fifth earl; he succeeded to the title-and some of the buildings of Manchester College-on his brother's death in 1594.

DRAKE, SIR FRANCIS (1540-1596). Admiral, circumnavigator and pirate. In 1577, before Drake set off round the world, Dee received visits from many of the principal backers-Francis Walsingham, the Earl of Leicester, Christopher Hatton and Edward Dyer-making it likely that he was involved in planning the voyage. DUCKETT, SIR LEONEL (d.1590?). Member of parliament and· one of the first investors in the slave trade. He raised the subscription for John Hawkins which in 1562 allowed the African Company to be established; like Dee he also backed Martin Frobisher. He owned mines in the north of England and Germany as well as in Devonshire. (Duckett GF, Duchetiana; London, 1874.) .As lord mayor of London in 1572, he tried to limit the amount of cloth used by the apprentice boys in their trunk-hose, which according to John Aubrey 'made a kind of mutiny among them: and they made this distich on him, viz.: \"Good Sir Lionel with your long nose/What have you to do with the prentices' hose?'\" DYER, EDWARD (1543-16°7). Poet, diplomat and member of the brilliant circle that included Sir Philip Sydney and Edmund Spenser. He met Dee in or before 1566, became his pupil and remained one of his most loyal friends, although between 1588 and 1591 he was more interested in Edward Kelly-travelling to Bohemia several times to try to lure him back to England. He was knighted in 1596. EDWARD, ROGER. Friend of Dee's and correspondent on navigational matters. EGERTON, SIR THOMAS (1540?-1617). Lawyer and politician who became master of the rolls in April 1594, lord keeper after the death of Sir John Puckering, and lord chancellor in 1603.

In 1601 he bought the Harefield estate of Sir Edmund Anderson. ELIZABETH I, QUEEN OF ENGLAND (1533-16°3). Brought up in the reformed faith, Elizabeth was imprisoned for a time (like Dee) during the reign of her sister Mary. On succeeding to the throne in 1558, it was largely her affection for Dee that kept him safe from his many detractors.

Member of parliament, and sheriff of Lancashire in 1591-2. He had been involved in remedying the abuses of Manchester College in 1578. FLETCHER, RICHARD (1547?-1596). Courtier and ecclesiastic. As dean of Peterborough he had acted as chaplain at the execution of Mary Queen of Scots in 1587, much against her will, and occupied her last moments by haranguing her. As bishop of Bristol (from 1589) and Worcester (from 1593) he spent most of his time at his Chelsea home, and finally persuaded Burghley to give him the bishopric of London instead: although he promptly offended the Queen by his unsuitable second marriage, and was barred from the court and stripped of his episcopal jursidiction. William Camden attributed his early death to his pipe-smoking. FOSKU [FORTESCUE], JOHN (1533-1607). Scholar and politician. As a distant relation of Queen Elizabeth he was appointed to oversee her studies, and on her accession he was appointed keeper of the Great Wardrobe. He was a long-serving member of parliament who became chancellor of the Exchequer in 1589, and acquired such a large fortune that in 1599 he was able to buy the Oxfordshire town of Burford for £2500.

In 1598 he was appointed to the commission to enquire about the decay and poor estate of Manchester College. GERARDE [GERARD], SIR THOMAS (d.160I). One of the leaders (with Sir George Peckham) of the English· Catholic group of expansionists. In the early 1570S he had been involved in at least one half-hearted attempt to free Mary Stuart from captivity, and he had to pay a heavy fine after being imprisoned for treason. On 19 April 1582, an informer ('PH') wrote to Lord Burghley: There is a muttering among the papists that Sir Humfray Gilbert goeth to seek a new found land, Sir George Peckham, and Sir Thomas Gerard goeth with him. I have heard it said among the papists, that they hope it will prove the best journey for England that was made these 40 years.'

He gave his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh £10 when Raleigh first went to court, and served as his agent for about thirty years. In the summer of 1583 he was given a grant 'to discover and settle the northerly parts of Atlantis, called Novus Orbis, not inhabited or discovered by any Christians hitherto but by him. The said Adrian Gilbert, John Dee, and John Davis to be exempt from all customs, for ever.' (Calendar o/State Papers, vol. 161, no. 24.) Towards the end of his life he became alchemical assistant to Mary, Countess of Pembroke. GILBERT, SIR HUMFREY (1537-1583). Navigator and advocate of direct trade with Asia and the native Americans. He was among the first Englishmen to suggest that North America should be colonised, to 'settle there such needy people of our country, which now trouble the common wealth, and through want here at home are enforced to commit outrageous offences, whereby they are daily consumed with the gallows' (quoted by Quinn DB, The Voyages and Colon ising Enterprises o/Sir Humphrey Gilbert; London, 1940).

GREY, ARTHUR, FOURTEENTH BARON GREY DE WILTON (1536-1593). Soldier. He was disgraced and imprisoned after brutally assaulting Sir John Fortescue, and he saw his subsequent appointment as lord deputy of Ireland as more of a punishment than an honour. He arrived in Dublin in August 1580, with the poet Edmund Spenser as his secretary, and almost immediately had to deal with an invasion of Italian and Spanish forces at Smerwick. Together with the Earl of Ormond he forced their surrender and laid waste the region to prevent the revolt from spreading. GRINDAL, EDMUND (1519?-1583). Archbishop of Canterbury from 1576. He angered the Queen by refusing to suppress organised Bible-study groups among the clergy and laity, which it was feared would lead to open questioning and criticism of the Church; as a result he was deprived of his temporal jurisdiction, although he continued to perform some ecclesiastical duties. It was widely believed that the Earl of Leicester had set the Queen against him, because Grindal had refused to grant a dispensation for bigamy to Leicester's physician Dr Julio. HACKLUYT [HAKLUYT], RICHARD. Lawyer, and cousin of the writer and geographer Richard Hakluyt the younger.

Vice chamberlain of Queen Elizabeth's household. In 1581-2 he backed the expedition of Edward Fenton (who had sailed with Frobisher) to Cathay. The Queen chose him to convey her displeasure when the Earl of Leicester accepted the governorship of the Low Countries in February 1586. In early 1594 Henedge himself was out of favour, but he redeemed himself with his lavish entertainment of the Queen in December that year (as recorded by Dee). HERBERT, JOHN (c.1540-1617). Member of parliament and protege of Robert Cecil; he was master of requests from 1586 to 1600, and was knighted in 1602. In May 1617 he fought a duel with Sir Lewis Tresham, brother of the Gunpowder conspirator Francis Tresham, and the incident may have led to his death two months later. HERBERT, MARY (c.1577-1634). Daughter of Sir William Herbert; she was made his sole heiress on the condition that she married 'a gentleman being of my surname, Herbert'. She met this condition by marrying the fifteen-year-old Edward Herbert (later first Lord Herbert of Cherbury) in 1599. HERBERT, SIR WILLIAM (c.1554-1593). Writer, coloniser ofIreiand, and neighbour of the Dees in Mordake. He studied alchemy and provided astrological material for Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica. HERIOT [HARRIOT], THOMAS (1560-1621). Mathematician, astronomer, and tutor to Sir Walter Raleigh. He travelled to Virginia as surveyor on Sir Richard Grenville's expedition of 1585-6; having impressed the native Americans with various instruments (including a 'perspective glass whereby was showed many strange sights'), he returned with the first potatoes to be brought to England. The navigator John Davis said that 'for theoretical speculations and most cunning calculation', Heriot was matched only by Dee. In his lifetime Heriot was also renowned as a magus, and he may have worked as an alchemist for Raleigh and the 'Wizard Earl' of Northumberland in the Tower of London in the early years of James 1's reign.

In the summer of 1573 she and her sister caused some scandal at court by showing themselves to be 'very far in love' with the Earl of Leicester. She married Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, in or before 1595. Jane Fromonds may have waited on her at court for a while before marrying John Dee. HESKETH, RICHARD (b.1553). 'Agent of Antwerp', whose nativity was recorded by Dee: 'The 24 or 25 ofJuly 1553, between I and 4 after noon, by guess conjecture, born Richard Hesketh at Ayghton [Aughton] in Lancashire' (Bodleian Library, t:. 331 t:."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE Ashmole MS 423, f. 294). It does not seem possible to identify him with the Roman Catholic exile Richard Hesketh (also born in Lancashire) who was executed for treason on his return to England in 1593. HICKMAN [HIKMAN], BARTHILMEW (b.1554). One of Dee's first skryers and also his last, born at Lower Shuckburgh in Warwickshire. Dee's record of his nativity ('my conjecture, upon his own report of circumstances') is one of the first surviving entries in any of his ephemerides. HITCHCOK [HITCHCOCK], ROBERT. Author of the 1580 treatise A Politic Plat for the Honour of the Prince, the Great Profit if the Public State, Relief of the Poor, Preservation of the Rich, Reformation of Rogues and Idle Persons, and the Wealth of Thousands that Knows not how to Live. John Dee encouraged Hitchcok to promote his plan, which involved building up a national fishing fleet to rival that of the Dutch. Holland had grown into a major power on its fishing fleet, and Hitchcok believed that four hundred large ships of seventy tons or more could be used to provide the whole country with herring, and employment for 10,000 men. He invited all members of parliament who represented English ports to dinner at Westminster in 1576, to hear his proposals, but they were deemed too expensive to put into practice. HOBBY [HOBY], SIR PHILIP (1505-1558). Diplomat, who in the service of Henry VIII and Edward VI travelled widely in Spain, Portugal and France and the Low Countries. Despite being a Protestant he was also employed by Mary Tudor. HOLLAND, RICHARD (1557-1618). Sheriff of Lancashire in 1573, 1582 and 1596; Edmund Campion described him as 'a rigid puritan' . In 1602-3 he tried to replace Dee with a more suitable warden of Manchester College. HONE, JOHN. Former canon of Lincoln who became an advocate of the Doctors' Commons in 1589. HOPWOOD, EDMUND (1541-1612). Justice of the peace in Manchester, and deputy lieutenant to the Earl of Derby. HOWARD, CHARLES [SECOND BARON HOWARD OF EFFINGHAM] (1536-1624). Cousin of Queen Elizabeth, and commander-in-chief of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada. Although he was ruthless against the Spanish, and against those perceived as traitors at home (including Mary Queen of Scots and the Earl of Essex), he showed great compassion to the ordinary seamen under his command and helped to set up the charity for the relief of disabled sailors; the 'Chest at Chatham' . HRADEC [NEWHOUSE], ADAM OF (d.1596). One of Rudolph's most trusted advisers, despite his reputation as a heavy drinker and his frailty caused by a chronic wasting disease; he was chancellor from 1585 and burgrave from 1592. With Rosenberg he was involved in attempts to discover the philosophers' stone (Evans RJW, Rudolf II and his World, p. 216). JULIO, DR [BORGARUCCI].

Although Edward Kelly dominates"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE John Dee's diaries, almost nothing about his life is known for certain. He was born in Worcester, and may have trained as an apothecary. There is no evidence that he studied at Oxford (as the antiquary Anthony Wood was informed) or that he was assistant to the mystic and mathematician Thomas Allen. According to legend he had his ears cropped in 1580 for forging documents or money, and was involved in necromancy in a Lancashire churchyard. He seems to have possessed little charm but great magnetism, and while he made enemies easily he also impressed some of the richest, wisest and most powerful men of his day. Although Dee was distrustful of him at first, their partnership only ended in 1589 because Kelly found that it was more profitable to work as court alchemist to Count William of Rosenberg and the Emperor Rudolph II. He helped to develop the abandoned goldmines at ]ilove, south of Prague, and according to the Czech writer Ivan Svitak he used the accumulated waste material there to effect magical transmutations, using mercury to extract microscopic amounts of gold from what looked like ordinary soil. He seems to have amassed a huge fortune, and bought about twenty houses in Prague, including the so-called House of Dr Faustus at the cattle market (Charles Square). From 1591 to 1593 he was imprisoned at Krivoklat, west of Prague: not because he had disappointed Rudolph, according to Svitak, but to prevent him from being kidnapped by Lord Burghley's agents. In 1594 he was apparently in Peter of Rosenberg's army, fighting the Turks; but shortly afterwards he fell into debt, and in 1596 he was imprisoned in the castle at Briix, western Bohemia, after wounding an assistant of the alchemist Sebald Schwertzer. He is said to have broken a leg in an escape attempt in November 1597, and died of his wounds, but it is possible that this master-illusionist in fact survived to join a group of foreign alchemists practising in Russia. (Svitak I, 'John Dee and Edward Kelly.' Kosmas [The Journal of Czechoslovak and Central European Studies] 5, 125-38, 1986. Svitak's article is fascinating and his theories seem plausible, but they are somewhat undermined by some obvious inaccuracies and by the author's claim at the end of the piece to be a reincarnation of Kelly himself.) Edward Kelly's Alchemical Writings were edited by A.E. Waite in 1893. His poetry in particular is sexually charged and shows a contempt for academic learning. KELLY, [KELLEY], JOAN (b.1563). Born Joan Cooper at Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire; Dee recorded her date of birth as 23 June, 'toward evening', and the baptismal records show that she was baptised five days later. There is no record of her marriage to Edward Kelly in 1582, nor of her death. The parish records (which only started in 1563) show that she had two younger sisters; her brother Edmond was apparently older. KELLY [KELLEY], THOMAS. Younger brother of Edward Kelly; Dee recorded his date of birth as 17 October 1565, 'hora quarta a meridie at Worcester'. Ivan Svitak believes that he was involved in his brother's final (possibly fatal) escape attempt. ('John Dee and Edward Kelly.' Kosmas 5,137,1986.) KENT, COUNTESS OF (c.1554-after 1602).

When Dee met her she was married to the soldier Sir John Wingfield, who had served with Sir Philip Sydney in the Low Countries. In her final years she relied on charity from the Queen. KHUNRADT [KHUNRATH], HENRICK [HEINRICH) (1560-1605). Leipzig physician and occult philosopher. It may have been on Dee's advice that he travelled to Bohemia, where he became William of Rosenberg's court physician shortly before the latter's death. KILLEGREW [KILLIGREW), SIR JOHN (d.1584). Member of parliament and justice of the peace in Cornwall; notorious as a cattle thief and for using his office as piracy commissioner to trade with the pirates and smugglers around his estates on the Cornish coast. Although he was often warned about his behaviour, he was so powerful locally that he took little notice. In January 1582 he seized a Spanish ship sheltering in Falmouth and stole its cargo of cloth. He was summoned before the privy council but there is no record of any punishment, and it is possible that Dee's proposed solution (see I September 1582) had the desired effect. (Hasler pw, The House of Com mom 1558-1603; London, 1981.) KYFFIN, MORRICE (d.1599). Soldier, translator of Welsh poetry, and one of Dee's pupils. He left the Dees £10 in his will. LASKI [ALASKIIALASKO], ALBERT [ALBRECHT) (1536-1605). Count Palatine ofSiradia, Polish landowner and patron of the alchemical, occult and Paracelsian sciences. In the Polish succession crisis of the mid-I570s he drew up a large private army, and although he endorsed Stephen Bathory as king, his ultimate aim was to become king himself. He cut an impressive figure on arriving in England in 1583 in pursuit of his political ambitions; one contemporary, Dr Stephen Batman, described him as 'a man of comely personage, princely behaviour, and liberal'. Having first made unsuccessful approaches to the mystic Thomas Allen, Laski impressed Dee with his'apparent generosity and his interest in religious reform, but proved a disappointment on both counts. LEE, RICHARD (before 1548-1608). Illegitimate son of Sir Anthony Lee, and half-brother of the 'Queen's Champion', Sir Henry Lee of Woodstock. He fought as a volunteer against the Armada, and was knighted in the spring of 1600 before travelling to Russia as ambassador; he was received in great style at Archangel by a delegation from Boris Godounof, but he failed to acquire the rights for England to trade with Persia through Russia, and the trip was a personal disaster for him. The Muscovy Company and the Queen both refused to meet his expenses, and Sir Richard never managed to free himself of his debts. (Hasler pw, The House of Commons 1558-1603; London, 1981.) LEGH, CHARLES. One of the first singing men appointed by the foundation charter of Manchester College in 1578; clerk of the Manchester Court leet in 1585-7, and later steward of the College.

LEICESTER, ROBERT DUDLEY, EARL OF (1532?-1588). Queen Elizabeth's favourite and one of Dee's former pupils (in mathematics, geometry and navigation) who became one of his most influential friends. It was Dudley who introduced Dee to Elizabeth and suggested that he should choose the most astrologically propitious date for her coronation. He was an advocate of colonial expansion and also one of Sir Francis Drake's principal backers. The antiquary Anthony Wood later stated that no one knew the Earl better than Dee. LEISTER, GEORGE (c.1566-1612). Soldier and diplomat. He began his career in the service of the Earl of Leicester; in 1586 he was put in charge of 150 infantrymen in the Netherlands. After meeting Dee in Trebon, he and Robert Tatton composed a letter on behalf of Edward Kelly about the alleged treachery of Christopher Parkins, and carried it to Lord Burghley. He became member of parliament for Thirsk in 1597. LEWIS, DAVID (1520?-1584). Judge of the Admiralty court from 1558, and joint commissioner from 1575. He investigated Martin Frobisher and John Hawkins, among others, on suspicion of being pirates. LOK, BENJAMIN. Alchemist, who studied at Dee's house between 1580 and 1582, and whose alchemical treatise A Picklock to Riply his Castle was copied by Arthur Dee at some time after 1602. He and his brother Zacharie may have been among the fifteen children of the traveller Michael Lok (1532?-1615?), who was one of the principal investors in the ill-fated voyages of Martin Frobisher in the mid-1570S, and became governor of the newly formed Cathay Company in March 1577.

Bishop of San Severo from 1583, and papal nuncio: first at the court of the Emperor Rudolph and later with King Stephen Bathory's successor, Sigismund III, in Poland and Sweden. MERCATOR, GERARD (1512-1594). Flemish cosmographer. He studied at Louvain and produced his first globe in 1536. Dee owned two of his globes and commissioned him to make other instruments as well. Dee also addressed his Propt£deumata Aphoristica to Mercator, and acknowledged the debt. he owed to their discussions together, whereby his 'whole system of philosophising in the foreign manner laid down its first and deepest roots~. MEREDYTH [MEREDITH], RICHARD (c.155O-1597). Rector of Angle in Pembrokeshire from 1580. He went to Ireland in 1584 as chaplain to the lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, and became bishop of Leighlin, rebuilding the bishop's house and impoverishing the see by granting long leases of its lands.

ORMOND [ORMONDE], THOMAS BUTLER, TENTH EARL OF (1532-1614). Courtier, politician and colleague of the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sydney. His strong Irish sympathies ironically enabled him to persuade the independent ruler of Ulster, Shane O'Neill, to acknowledge the supremacy of England. Ormond was only enticed away from Ireland by the attentions of Queen Elizabeth, which"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE were obvious enough to cause some scandal and to keep him at court for five years. ORTELIUS, ABRAHAM (1527-1598). ' Citizen of Antwerp and geographer to Philip the Second, King of Spain' was how he described himself on the title-page of his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570)-the first great atlas of modern times (although the word 'atlas' was not used in this sense until Gerard Mercator published his book of maps fifteen years later). In the same year that Ortelius visited Dee he also visited William Camden and encouraged him in the preparation of his magnum opus Britannia. OSBORN [OSBORNE], EDWARD (1530?-1592). Merchant, traveller and governor of the New Turkey Company. He owed his fortune to the rich London merchant Sir William Hewett, to whom he had been apprenticed and whose daughter he saved from drowning when her nurse allowed her to fall into the Thames from their house on London Bridge. As soon as she was old enough her father arranged their marriage, and Osborn thereby succeeded to Hewett's estates in Yorkshire and London (Hasler pw, The House of Commons [558-[603; London, 1981). He became lord mayor of London in 1583 and was knighted the following year. PACKINGTON [PAKINGTON], JOHN (1549-1625). Courtier and favourite of Queen Elizabeth, renowned for his good looks, recklessness and extravagance. PARKINS [PARKYNS/PERKINS], CHRISTOPHER (1543-1622). Jesuit and scholar, who taught in Italy and then met Edward Kelly in Prague in about 1588. Kelly accused him of being a papal emissary and a conspirator against Queen Elizabeth, and Parkins was arrested on returning to England. Having established his innocence, with the help of a commendation from King Sigismund III of Poland, he built a distinguished career as a diplomat and MP. He was knighted in 1603. PECKHAM, SIR GEORGE (d.1608). 'The chief adventurer and furtherer of Sir Humfrey Gilbert's voyage to Newfound Land' (Hakluyt), and, with Sir Thomas Gerard, one of the leaders of the Catholic expansionists. PERROT, SIR JOHN (C.1527-1592). Lord deputy of Ireland (responsible for the summary execution of at least eight hundred rebels) and reputedly the illegitimate son of Henry VIII. In 1592 he was tried on suspicion of having 'imagined' the death of Queen Elizabeth; although the charge was flimsy, he had made many powerful enemies, including Sir Christopher Hatton, whose daughter he had seduced. Having been condemned to death in June 1592, he died in the Tower before he could be executed. PEZELIUS [PEZEL], CHRISTOPHER (1539-16°4). Theologian who had studied at Wittenberg under Philip Melanchthon; he subsequently became strongly anti-Lutheran. He was appointed superintendent of Bremen in 1581. PICKERING, SIR WILLIAM (1516-1575). Once a suitor for Queen Elizabeth's hand, and one of Dee's early pupils (in logic, rhetoric, arithmetic and astronomy). PLAT [PLATT], HUGH (1552-1608).

POLE, WILLIAM (1561-1636). Antiquarian, author of The Description of Devonshire, MP, and investor in the Virginia Company. His father, also William (1515-1597) was an MP and lawyer. PONTOYS [PONTOIS], JOHN (1565-1624). Merchant with interests in Poland and America; in the last years of Dee's life he became one of his closest companions, and Dee may have died at Pontoys' house in Bishopsgate Street. (RobertS J, Watson AG,John Dee's Library Catalogue, pp. 59-65.) PUCCI, FRANCIS (1543-1597?). Florentine priest who had a crisis of faith in 1571 and embarked on a series of travels around Europe. He met Dee and Kelly in Krak6w in 1583 or 1584, and followed them to Prague. He believed that the world would begin anew in 1600, and that mankind needed to be united spiritually by then. After leaving Prague in 1591 he was arrested, handed over to the Inquisition and beheaded in Rome. PUCKERING, SIR JOHN (1544-1596). Speaker of the House of Commons and lord keeper of the great seal. Queen Elizabeth rwice visited his 'poor hermitage' at Kew (where Dee also called on him) and was lavishly entertained. RAWLEGH [RALEIGH, RAWLY, RAWLEIGH], SIR WALTER (1552-1618). Courtier, navigator and writer. When Dee met him in 1583 he was at the height of his favour with the Queen. In October 1595-after his first term of imprisonment-he was back in favour, and had just returned from his voyage of exploration around Trinidad and up the Orinoco. Durham House in the Strand, London, where he entertained Dee, had belonged to Elizabeth; s he gave it to Raleigh in about 1583. RAYNOLDS [RENOLDES], THOMAS. ' Gentleman' who in 1578-9 sailed with Sir Humfrey Gilbert on rwo expeditions to 'annoy the King of Spain by fitting out a fleet of warships under pretence of a voyage of discovery, and so fall upon the enemy's shipping' (as Gilbert put it) . ROGERS, DANIEL (c.1538-1591). Scholar, diplomat and intelligence agent. When Dee met him in June 1578 he had just returned from a year's negotiations in the Low Countries about the terms on which Queen Elizabeth was to lend £20,000 to the States General. ROMFF [RUMPF], LORD WOLF (d.1606). One of Rudolph II's most powerful ministers and a bibliophile with an extensive library of manuscripts. He was dismissed by the Emperor in a fit of rage, precipitating the political confusion of Rudolph's last years. ROSENBERG [ROZMBERK], POLYXENA OF. Daughter of Rudolph II 's chancellor Vratislav von Pernstein (d.1582); she has been described as a bibliophile with a lively intellect (Evans RJW, Rudolf 11 and his World, pp. 287-8). After the death of her husband, William of Rosenberg, she married Zdenek Lobkovic, who was to become Rudolph's chancellor in 1599. ROSENBERG [ROZMBERK], WILLIAM OF (1535-1592). Rudolph II's burgrave, from one of Bohemia's most powerful and respected families. As a centre of learning and"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE alchemy, his court was second only to Rudolph's. Dee described him as 'vice-regis Bohemi;e', as well as referring to him as 'Illustrissimus' and 'Princeps'. Although he was a deeply devout Catholic, he believed in religious freedom, and his death robbed the Emperor ora strong\" controlling influence. ROSSELl [ROSEL/ROSELLI], HANNIBAL [ANNIBALE] (c.1524-1592). Italian friar and mystic, whose six-volume commentary on the Pymander of Hermes Trismegistus was published in Krak6w between 1585 and 1590. RUDOLPH II [RUDOLF], HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR (1552-1612). Son of the Emperor Maximilian II. He spent much of his boyhood at the court of his uncle, Philip II of Spain, and it was probably there that he first encountered Dee's books, which Philip had bought while he was in London (Kamen H, Philip of Spain; London, 1997). Rudolph became emperor in 1576, and turned Prague into one of the greatest centres of learning in Europe. However, he also attempted to compensate for his lack of political power by creating an aura of mystery around him. Sir Philip Sydney, who visited his court in 1577, described him as 'few of words, sullen of disposition, very secret and resolute'; and the image of the melancholic, mad Emperor, who was steeped in the occult arts (and who had his horoscope cast by Nostradamus) was confirmed by many others who met him. Towards the end of his life he was seen so little that there were persistent rumours that he had died; and his habit of dismissing or imprisoning his most faithful advisers severely weakened his position. From 1591 to 1606 he waged an indecisive and financially draining war against the Ottoman Empire, while at home his Catholic sympathies angered the Bohemian Protestants, causing deep divisions. Control of Bohemia, Hungary, Austria and Moravia was finally wrested from him by his brother Matthias. RUSSELL, LADY (1528-16°9). Born Elizabeth Cooke, she became renowned as one of the most learned women in England, together with her sisters Ann (mother of Sir Francis Bacon) and Mildred (who married Lord Burghley). She devoted her gifts especially to organising grandiose funerals, and writing memorial inscriptions in Latin, Greek and English. After the death of her first husband, Sir Thomas Hoby, she married John, Lord Russell in 1574; he was a member of parliament (serving on a committee concerned with ports) before dying in 1584. SANCTO CLEMENTE [SAN CLEMENTE], GULl ELMO DE. Spanish ambassador at the court of Rudolph II. He had started his career in the Spanish navy, and he retained a lifelong distrust of England; although he was well disposed to Dee, the numerous anglophobic references in his ambassadorial letters have been seen as helping to fuel Spain's desire to conquer England in the years leading up to the Armada (Chudoba B, Spain and the Empire; New York, 1969). On the death of King Stephen Bathory of Poland, he supported the candidature of Rudolph's brother Maximilian with large sums of his own money. SANDERS [SAUNDERS], PATRICK (c.1582-1638).

He later gained a name for himself as a physician, astrologer and ~ 339 ~"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE crystal-gazer. SAUL, BARNABAS. One of Dee's first skryers. He had been recommended as 'a good seer, and skryer of spiritual apparitions, in crystalline receptacles, or in open air': but Dee was unable to reconcile Saul's 'intents of practice' with his own 'pure, sincere, devoted and faithful prayer unto thee only'. SAUNDERS [SAUNDER], NICHOLAS (1563-1649). A former pupil of John Dee's, who became an MP and was knighted in 1603. He has been identified as one of the main despoilers of Dee's library; many of the books ended up in his possession, but he may have been too influential (as a protege of Lord Burghley) to be named. (Roberts J, Watson AG, John Dee's Library CataLogue, pp. 50-I.) SAVILE, HARRY (1570?-16I7). Antiquarian and doctor, who (according to Anthony Wood) was known as 'Long' Harry Savile. He is not to be confused with the scholar Sir Henry Savile (1549-1622), whom Dee may have met in February 1583. SAXTON, CHRISTOPHER (1542-C.161O). 'The father of English cartography' who, between 1574 and 1579, undertook the first survey of all the counties in England. (Evans 1M, Lawrence H , Christopher Saxton: ELizabethan Map-Maker; Wakefield, 1979.) SEGA, PHILIP [FILIPPO] (d.1596). Bishop of Piacenza from 1578, who succeeded Malaspina as· papal nuncio in Prague and was largely responsible for Dee's expulsion from Rudolph's d~minions (although there was also deep mutual distrust between Rudolph and Sega). He believed strongly in the policy of Pope Gregory XIII, continued by Sixtus V, of using the nunciature actively as a way of rooting out heresy. He became a cardinal in 1594. SKYDMOR [SCUDAMORE], SIR JOHN (C.1542-1623). Gentleman usher to Queen Elizabeth, patron of the mathematician Thomas Allen, and benefactor of the Bodleian Library. In his will he expressed the hope that he would be received 'into the company of the heavenly angels and blessed saints'. His second wife Mary was one of Dee's most loyal friends at court, and with Blanche Pary had tried to obtain for him the mastership of the Hospital of St Cross at Winchester. SLED [SLEDD], CHARLES. Spy who worked for Sir Francis Walsingham in England, denouncing Catholic priests. At the trial of Edmund Campion in November 1581 he was paid to give false evidence against Campion and his co-defendants; he claimed that one, named Kirby, had described the Queen as the whore of Babylon and planned to kill her (Waugh E, Edmund Campion, 3rd edn; London, 1961). On 4 April 1583 Sled dined with Dee and provoked Kelly into 'a great anger' (British Library, Sloane MS 3188, f. 74V). A notice in one of the practice-books of the astrologer William Lilly refers to 'Charles Sledd an apothecary, who used the crystal, and had a very perfect sight' (Ashmole MS 421, f. 191). SMYTH [SMITH], HUGH. Arctic explorer who sailed with Arthur Pitt and Charles Jackman in 1580; his account of his travels is included in Hakluyt's PrincipaL Voyages of the EngLish Nation. STAFFORD, EDWARD (1552?-1605). Diplomat and negotiator for the suggested marriage between Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Alen<;:on. In October 1583"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE he was appointed ambassador to France (with Richard Hakluyt the younger as his chaplain) and knighted. His wife during this period was Douglas, daughter of William, first Baron Howard of Effingham. STANLEY, SIR WILLIAM (1548-163°). Catholic adventurer, soldier and mercenary, who first fought in the Low Countries for the Duke of Alva. He nevertheless served Queen Elizabeth in Ireland, where he became greatly feared and hated, before joining the Earl of Leicester's forces to help the United Provinces against Spain in 1585. In 1587 he changed sides again and, as governor of Deventer, surrendered it to the Spanish. Over the next fifteen years he planned at least three invasions of England. Guy Fawkes was one of his subalterns, but there is no evidence that Stanley himself was involved in the Gunpowder Plot. STEPHEN BATHORY, KING OF POLAND (1533-1586). The youngest son of the palatine of Transylvania, Stephen studied in Padua and served at the imperial court in Vienna as a young man. Later he fought for Transylvania's independence and was imprisoned in Prague between 1565 and 1567. In 1571 he was elected prince of Transylvania, and five years later he became king of Poland, supported by a faction which was determined to exclude his sworn enemies, Rudolph and the Habsburgs. He managed to crush internal revolts, fought off an attempted invasion by Ivan the Terrible and healed many of the religious divisions brought about by the Reformation: but his death caused a succession crisis which tore the country apart again. SYDNEY [SIDNEY], SIR HENRY (1529-1586). Diplomat, lord deputy of Ireland and patron of the Muscovy Company's first navigator Richard Chancellor. In the 1550S he introduced Dee to some of the most powerful men of the time, including his brothers-in-law Robert and Henry Dudley . . Sydney and Dee remained regular correspondents. He died less than six months before his eldest son Philip. SYDNEY [SIDNEY], SIR PHILIP (1554-1586). Poet, statesman, soldier and John Dee's most brilliant pupil; Dee's influence can be seen in Sydney's knowledge of mathematics, chemistry and philosophy. (Chapter 6 of Peter French's John Dee: The WorM of an Elizabethan Magus is devoted to Sydney and his circle.) Sydney's death after Zutphen evoked an outpouring of grief from all classes that has seldom been paralleled. TALBOT, EDWARD. See KELLY, EDWARD. TATTON, ROBERT (1566-1624). Graduate of University College, Oxford (like his travelling companion George Leister), and native ofWythenshawe in Cheshire. TOMAS IN [THOMASINA], MRS. Queen Elizabeth I's dwarf (described by her as 'o ur dearly beloved woman'), who was allowed to appear at court wearing the Queen's old clothes. TOWRSON, WILLIAM. Member of the Muscovy Company from 1576 and an investor in Edward Fenton's voyage of 1582. He may have been the father of the navigator Gabriel Towrson (d.1623). TURNISER [THURNEYSSER VON THURN], LEONHARD (1530-1596). Physician and"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE DIARIES OF JOHN DEE writer on alchemy and medicine. The son of a Swedish goldsmith, he worked mainly in Germany and later in Italy. He does not seem to have made a good impression on Dee, who travelled to Frankfurt on the Oder in 1578 to consult him about the Queen's health (see Roberts J , Watson AG, John Dee's Library Catalogue). VAUGHAN, RICHARD (1550-1607). Chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, and bishop successively of Bangor, Chester and London. He had been a protege of the rigidly anti-puritan Bishop John Aylmer, and he continued Aylmer's work, but without incurring the same unpopularity. WALMESLEY, THOMAS (1537-1612). Lawyer who became serjeant-at-law in 1580. Thomas Cecil, Lord Burghley, later described him as one of the three 'learnedest judges' in the country, although it was widely believed that his large fortune had been amassed by accepting bribes. He was knighted by James 1. WALSINGHAM, SIR FRANCIS (c.I530-I590). Statesman, diplomat, spy-master and, from 1573, chief secretary of state. He was a keen advocate of colonial expansion and naval exploration, and frequently consulted Dee about navigational matters. His wife Ursula owned land at Skirbeck and Boston in Lincolnshire, and was presumably involved in the attempt to persuade Dee to exchange the living of Long Leadenham for that of $kirbeck (25 November 1579). WARREN, EDWARD (d.1609). Servant to the earls of Derby from the 1580s. WARWICK, COUNTESS OF (1548-16°4). Anne, daughter of Francis Russell, second Earl of Bedford; Queen Elizabeth was present at her wedding in 1565 to Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick. She was an investor in Frobisher's second voyage, and remained one of Dee's most loyal friends at court. According to her niece, Lady Anne Clifford, ' she was more beloved and in greater favour with the said Queen than any other lady or woman in the kingdom'. WHITGIFT, JOHN (1530?-1604). Archbishop of Canterbury from 1583; his private fortune enabled him to restore the primacy to its former magnificence. Although he treated Dee with kindness and courtesy, he was a strict disciplinarian and relentless in pursuing the Church's enemies. He was at the Queen's bedside when she died. WILKS, SIR THOMAS (1545?-1598). Member of parliament, diplomat and protege of Sir Francis Walsingham. In October 1581 he examined Edmund Campion on the rack in the Tower. The Earl of Leicester recommended him to Queen Elizabeth with the words 'Her Majesty doth not know what a jewel she hath of him'; but Wilks was so tactless in his reports of Leicester's own mistakes that the latter was soon describing him as 'a villain, a devil, without faith or religion'. Despite Wilks' success at securing monopolies and patents for himself (e.g. for printing and the supply of white salt), by the 1590S he was deeply in debt, and this may have led to his undisclosed 'offer philosophical' to Dee. WILLIAM IV, LANDGRAVE OF HESSE-KASSEL (1532-1592). Astronomer and patron of the arts and sciences, whose court Dee resorted to after his exile from Prague. Dee presented him with a pamphlet about the impending apocalypse, and"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"BIOGRAPHICAL GUIDE (having already been let down by Laski, Rudolph II and Stephen Bathory) may have hoped that William would help him to bring about the universal reformation. In 1587 the Landgrave commissioned some nautical charts from Dee, containing information gained from Drake's voyage of circumnavigation, and they also corresponded on political matters. WILLOUGHBY, PEREGRINE BERTIE, LORD WILLOUGHBY DE ERESBY (1555-1601). Military commander, who succeeded Sir Philip Sydney as governor of Bergen-op-Zoom and also served in France. He complained to Lord Burghley that his duties were bankrupting him (being obliged to pay the troops from his own pocket), and he spent hi s last years in poverry and ill health. Dee recorded his nativity. His sister was the Countess of Kent. WlTICHIND [WlTEKlNDUS], HERMANN (1522-16°3). Writer and university professor. Dee owned two books of his, on astronomy and horology. WaLLY [WOLLEY], SIR JOHN (d.1596). Secretary to Queen Elizabeth and member of parliament for twenty-five years. In 1588 he was appointed (with Lords Cobham and Buckhurst) to search for the author of the Marprelate tracts. He was one of the two commissioners appointed to hear Dee's 'Compendious Rehearsal'. YONG [YOUNG], RICHARD. One of the most virulently anti-Catholic judges of the age; almost every reference to him in the Calendar of State Papers concerns his judgements against papists and recusants. An item dated January 1590, for instance (vol. 230, no. 30), deals with information against a Mrs Dewse, and 'her desire to be revenged of her enemies, one of whom was that thief, Justice Young, who lived by robbing papists; the others were Sir Rowland Hayward and others, whose pictures of wax she would have made and then prick them to the heart.' Since Dee referred to Yong as his ' brother' , he must either have married a member of the Fromonds family, or been a brother or brother-in-law of an earlier wife. ZAMOYSKI, JAN (1542-1605). Member of one of Poland's most eminent families, which was at the centre of Polish politics and history for four centuries. Zamoyski was Stephen Bathory's grand chancellor from 1575.
