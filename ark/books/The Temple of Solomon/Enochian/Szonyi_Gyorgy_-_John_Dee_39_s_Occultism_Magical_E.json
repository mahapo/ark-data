Szo ́ ́nyi presents an analysis of Renais-sance occultism and its place in the chronology of European cultural history.Culling examples of “magical thinking” from classical, medieval, and Renaissancephilosophers, Szo ́ ́nyi revisits the body of Dee’s own scientific and spiritual writingsas reflective sources of traditional mysticism. Exploring the intellectual foundationsof magic, Szo ́ ́nyi focuses on the ideology of exaltatio, the glorification or deificationof man. He argues that it was the desire for exaltatio that framed and tied togetherthe otherwise varied thoughts and activities of John Dee as well.“György E.

Her Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964)and other works belonging to the intellectual tradition of the Warburgschool introduced me to those aspects of Renaissance cultural history,which were almost terra incognita in contemporary Hungarian scholar-ship. I must emphasize “almost” because—in spite of all ideological pres-sure and limitations—I had professors, Bálint Keseru ́ ́ and Tibor Klaniczay,who were aware of the trends of intellectual history and called my atten-tion to these works. It was they—and two other teachers, László Vekerdiand Bálint Rozsnyai—who encouraged me to summarize this excitinglynew image of the Renaissance in a small book which was published inHungarian under the title Secret Sciences and Superstitions: Questions ofFifteenth through Seventeenth Century Cultural History (Szªnyi 1978). Thetopic has been haunting me ever since.My early studies were stimulated by the question: how had it beenpossible that the so-called man-centered Renaissance also witnessed thegolden age of magic? I was surprised to see how closely magic intertwinedwith the early modern scientific ideas on the one hand and with thepremodern world picture on the other. I became even more surprised,however, to realize that magic did not disappear with the collapse of itsfoundation, the organic world picture. Magical approaches and magicalsymbolisation are present even in our contemporary world, and it is achallenging task to trace the roots of this tradition with the methodologi-cal equipment of the modern intellectual historian. As I see them today,these questions cannot be fully answered on the basis of the objective orpositivistic techniques of traditional approaches to the history of science.We also need help from religious studies and historical anthropology. Theconcept of self-fashioning also seems useful, leading us, to some extent,to the territory of psychology as well.The primary subject matter of this book is the magic of John Dee,of whom I also became aware through the works of Frances Yates. His"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"character seems a suitable focus for researching Renaissance occultismbecause his career and works clearly demonstrate the various sides of thiscomplex phenomenon. His connections with Central Europe, at the sametime, justify why I, a scholar from Hungary, choose him as an anchor formy presentation of early modern magical symbolism.A number of heterogeneous topics meet in my book, but there is aconnecting link which, according to my intention, provides coherence tomy treatment. This is, the ideology of exaltatio, that is, the deification ofman, which I see as the intellectual foundation of magic, a foundation thateven today validates magical aspiration and its scholarly research. I alsoargue that it was the desire for exaltatio which framed and tied together theotherwise amazingly heterogeneous thoughts and activities of John Dee. Igive a definition of exaltatio in relation to magic in the chapters under theheading “Definitions.” The following two parts of my book operate withdifferent methodologies. After the Introduction, in the chapters of thesecond part entitled “Input ‘In many bokes and sundry languages...,’”I analyse a selection of eminent magical texts—all in the possession of Deeaccording to his library catalogue. Although these texts were all known toDee, my aim is not simply to offer a review of his sources. As new histori-cism and related recent trends angrily rejected the positivistic ideals ofsource-hunting, I also think that what needs to be grasped here is thecomplex and often paradoxical interdependence of cultural and ideologicalinclinations and appropriations. In this section I disregard the chronologyof Dee’s intellectual development, and instead present the ingredients ofthe ideology of magic according to the chronology of European culturalhistory. The fact that Dee absorbed ancient, medieval, and Renaissancelores in a particular order and that his thought became composed of dif-ferent layers of high and popular culture will become meaningful in the lastpart of the book, entitled “Output ‘Glyms or Beame of Radicall Truthes.’ ”There I revisit Dee’s works, following the order in which he wrote them,from his early scientific treatises to his most voluminous body of writings,the spiritual diaries or, as he called them, the Libri mysteriorum.As for my intended methodology, textual interpretation will be comple-mented by historical approaches that touch upon various subtexts andcontexts, including the history of mentality, historical anthropology, andcomparative religion. I hope my chapters dealing with “Dee and theInterpretive Community” will highlight a little explored aspect of Deestudies. Here I connect the magical program to its psycho-sociologicaland politico-ideological contexts, using concepts such as patronage, self-fashioning, and techniques of identifying the Other. Some of these chap-xivPREFACE"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ters will deal with East-Central Europe, since this is the territory whereI might offer unique information to Western readers.My approach is markedly hermeneutical, so I cannot neglect histo-riography, the trends of interpretation that preceded mine. The oftenheated debates of the last decades (over hermeticism or over the “Yatestheses”) did not always concentrate solely on the historical questions.Quite understandably, they also served as exercise fields for the transitionfrom modern to postmodern historical and cultural theory. One of myobjectives is to juxtapose the results of classical (that is the Warburgian-Yatesian) intellectual history with the newer approaches and see what isstill useful in the classical material, which, in the controversy related tothe history of science, has almost entirely been discarded. We certainlycannot overlook two lessons of the post-structuralist philosophy of his-tory: 1) We have to accept that historicist reconstruction is nothing elsethan an ideological fiction, so whatever conclusion we arrive at, we can-not present it outside the hic et nunc position of us, the interpreters.2) It also appears today that the efforts of the great intellectual historiansto boil down each epoch or period to a single great leitmotif of ideas orsocial structure has been a failure and has led to (self )deception. Al-though it is a natural drive of any researcher to operate with abstractionsand categories suitable for generalizations, one must be extremely carefulnot to blur the distinction among often contrary tendencies and thevariety of opinions, desires, and ideologies—the evidence of otherness inthe process of explanation and abstraction.This book incorporates the material presented in two of my previousbooks on Dee, one written in Hungarian (Szªnyi 1998), the other inItalian (Szªnyi 2004). It should not be thought, though, that the threebooks are identical, related to each other through mechanical translation.I wrote the present book directly in English, having in mind the interestsand needs of English or American readers, which differ from those of theHungarians or Italians. I should also add that since the completion of thethree books, a lot of things have happened in Dee scholarship. In fact,since the 1988 publication of Nicholas Clulee’s monograph on Dee’snatural philosophy, Dee studies have been booming, producing newevidence, new editions, new approaches, and new monographs almostevery year. My present book is intended to represent Dee research as itstands in around 2000, and I am also aware of the fact that parallel withmy work, other books are also being written or have just appeared.xvPreface"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsI have already mentioned some of my Hungarian masters but here Ishould also acknowledge the tremendous inspiration which the personalacquaintance of Dame Frances Yates meant to me. I met her for the firsttime as a young university student, coming from the East, thanks to athree-week British Council study trip, and naively ringing the doorbell ofthe Warburg Institute. She was most ready to meet me downstairs at thereception and then lead me into that “Temple of Renaissance Scholar-ship,” as I emotionally fancied it. Later on, I was privileged to be herpersonal guide during her last lecture tour abroad, which led to Hungaryin the summer of 1981. Today I look at these experiences with a moresober eye but I think one should never entirely recover from these ritesof initiation. Next to her, among English scholars, I owe most to RobertJ. W. Evans (the exemplary historian and philologist, in many ways theopposite of Frances Yates) who encouraged and helped me since thebeginning of my studies.My academic worldview was significantly formed during those occa-sions I spent on various scholarships near the historical sources and in theinspiring communities of colleagues.

His retorts are full of boiling, bubbling liquids; his mind is onthe boil too, nursing dreams, noble or mad ambitions of omniscience,omnipotence, eternal life, and the ability to create gold or synthetic life—the famous homunculus. As the Great Work comes to a halt, some super-natural help is needed. The Magus now turns to God, praying for morestrength, or, resorting to illicit assistance, calls on Satan. Often he is con-fronted with other men, friends or adversaries, dilettante antiquarians orgreedy princes, who look at him with expectation or awe, who try to stophim or urge him to further efforts—but certainly cannot follow him on hisdangerous path towards the unknown and forbidden. Almost invariablythe end is failure. The Magus is punished for his arrogant self-conceit, orthe Opus Magnum is disturbed by intruding bores—the retort blows upor the Adept cannot endure the presence of the Devil—until finally theMagus is paradigmatically killed among the flames of his laboratory.The above narrative has roots as old as literature; the archetypal storyof the magician gained cosmic significance in the Renaissance and hasbeen popular ever since. Is this a story taken from life or merely derivedfrom the pressure of literary conventions and the demands of the readingpublic? Does it follow the logic of scientific investigation, mixing experi-mentation with the supernatural? Is this all allegory and parable, or doesit have a more direct relevance? One might be surprised that this literary3"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMframework has even passed into twentieth-century fiction, virtually un-shaken by the development of the natural sciences and the disqualificationof magic as a scientific discipline. Should we then see this literary phe-nomenon as a reaction against the self-assuredness of the sciences? Isthere any way of reconciling the rational-scientific way of thinking andthe magical-occult worldview?Questions like the above may bother the reader who finds himself inthe web of modern fiction focusing on the theme of the magus, such asThomas Mann’s Doctor Faustus, Marguerite Yourcenar’s The Abyss,Robertson Davies’s What’s Bred in the Bone, Umberto Eco’s Foucault’sPendulum. The list could be extended ad infinitum. Looking at thesenovels of esoterica, we can clearly see the fascination of modern writerswith the culture and world picture of the Renaissance, even if they placetheir plot in a contemporary setting. Due to the appeal of the sixteenthcentury, these magus figures paradigmatically seem to be variations eitheron the character of the historical, legendary Faust, perhaps the mostfamous black magician who ever lived, or his contemporary, the whitemagus-scientist Paracelsus. In fact, the hero of this book, the Englishmagus-mathematician John Dee also offers himself as a suitable modelfor such characters. What is more, there is a growing set of modernnovels in which Dee features as the main or secondary but neverthelesskey character. One could start with Gustav Meyrink’s The Angel of theWest Window (1928) and more recently with Eco’s Foucault’s Pendulum(1987) or Peter Ackroyd’s The House of Dr. Dee (1993).1This increasing interest in Dee as a magus—and one should takeinto consideration the whole spectrum of publications between the abovementioned fictional works and the newly published scholarly monographs(such as Sherman 1995 and Harkness 1999), the manuals on Dee’sEnochian magic (e.g., Laycock 1994), or the interest in his angelic con-ferences (cf. Fenton’s edition, Dee 1998)—should hopefully justify yetanother book on Dee’s magic, this time focusing on his occultism as aself-contained discipline, although nevertheless situated, as Nicholas Clulee(1988) suggested, “between science and religion.”The word magic makes one associate a variety of things which mayhave little in common, except perhaps the atmosphere of secrecy, somemysterious elements, and, above all, the human will to control andmanipulate the rationally incomprehensible sphere of life. Intervening inthe supernatural world may happen in different ways and with differentintentions: with pious or wicked purposes, with religious zeal or with ascientific interest, a philosophical or a folkloric foundation with guidance"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"5Principles and Demarcationsfrom theory or from rituals. There was a time when enlightened scholarswould speak about the disappearance of magical superstitions as a desiredresult of the accumulation of knowledge and the development of sci-ences. Even nineteenth-century anthropologists, such as Edward B. Tylorand James Frazer, would create a scholarly paradigm assuming a lineardevelopment from magic through religion to science.2 These expecta-tions, in fact, have not been fulfilled so far, and by now cultural theoryand the social sciences have virtually given up the hope. One should addthat it has also become unusual to mechanically identify magic and theoccult with scanty superstitions.Trying to map the place of magic in the complex of human culture,E. M. Butler claimed that she did not want to define it in any restrictiveway as “pseudo-science,” or “pretended art,” or “debased religion” (1980,2). Instead, she approached magic as an independent, self-containeddiscipline that naturally connects to other areas of human intellectualactivity. This standpoint locates Butler among those intellectual histori-ans who in this century step by step broke with the views of patronizingpositivist anthropology that labeled magic as outdated irrational misap-prehension. The seriously focused scientific interest in magic, however,was only the first step of a new understanding. It did not question thenotion originating in the seventeenth-century paradigm shift of theScientific Revolution, according to which human thinking had two irrec-oncilable and separate tracks, the discursive-rationalistic way of scienceand the mystical-irrational way of magic.It was especially the opposing movements of Romanticism and posi-tivism around the middle of the last century that emphasized this fatalantagonism. The scientists interpreted esoteric attitudes as a kind ofprimitive phase in the development of mankind, which, in the course ofintellectual progress, necessarily had to give way to logical thinking andthe experimental sciences. The adepts of the spiritual approach, on theother hand, excluded discursive logic and historical thinking from theirfield. Let us compare, for example, two opposing early nineteenth-century opinions:The improvements that have been effected in natural philosophy haveby degrees convinced the enlightened part of mankind that the materialuniverse is every where subject to laws, fixed in their weight, measure,and duration, capable of the most exact calculation, and which in nocase admit of variation and exception. Beside this, mind, as well asmatter, is subject to fixed laws; and thus every phenomenon and occur-rence around us is rendered a topic for the speculation of sagacity and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"6JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMforesight. Such is the creed which science has universally prescribed tothe judicious and reflecting among us.It was otherwise in the infancy and less mature state of humanknowledge. The chain of causes and consequences was yet unrecognized;and events perpetually occurred, for which no sagacity that was then inbeing was able to assaign an original. Hence men felt themselves habitu-ally disposed to refer many of the appearences with which they wereconversant to the agency of invisible intelligences. (Godwin 1834, 1–2)At about the same time as William Godwin’s proclamation ofscientism, Mary Atwood was already working on her voluminous sum-mary of esoteric philosophy, which was finally anonymously published in1850. Due to a religious revelation and a moral panic, she later consid-ered her book too dangerous for the general public and took great painsto suppress the edition. The text has, however, survived and provides uswith an interesting insight into that mode of thinking that seems to havechanged so remarkably little from Hermes Trismegistus through Paracelsus,Jakob Boehme, and Swedenborg to Atwood herself, Rudolf Steiner, Ma-dame Blavatsky, and indeed to many of our own contemporaries. Speak-ing about alchemy, Atwood asserted its reality as follows: “But manythings have in like manner been considered impossible which increasingknowledge has proved true. . . .” This may sound nearly like scientismbut the second part of the sentence touches upon the theme which iscommon in all esoteric thinking:. . . and others which still to common sense appear fictitious werebelieved in former times, when faith was more enlightened and thesphere of vision open to surpassing effects. Daily observation even nowwarns us against setting limits to nature. [. . .] The philosophy of moderntimes, more especially that of the present day, consists in experimentand such scientific researches as may tend to ameliorate our socialcondition, or be otherwise useful in contributing to the ease and indul-gences of life; whereas in the original acceptation, philosophy had quiteanother sense: it signified the Love of Wisdom.

Consequently, whenwriting a book on the intellectual patterns of Renaissance magic and itsrepresentative, John Dee, I find it important to reflect on the historiog-raphy of the subject by looking at the intertextually connected chain ofinterpretations offered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Modern metadisciplines, in the humanities but even in the naturalsciences, have been expressing a growing suspicion of claims for absolutevalidity. In cultural theory, weighty arguments have been put forward tosubvert the earlier scholarly self-assurance. To begin with, post-structuralismon the whole (from hermeneutics through deconstructivism, reader-response theory, and new historicism, whether idealist or Marxist) hasrejected the basic assumption of old historicism that the past can andshould be faithfully reconstructed. These trends have also increasinglyconsidered the interpretation of historical “facts” as a kind of fictionalizednarrative, a discourse, that is constructed in the field between the tradi-tions in the possession of the narrator on the one hand, and by the oftenantagonistic individual and community interests at work on the other. Inthe light of Thomas Kuhn’s propositions, it becomes particularly interestingto see the consequences of the above mentioned interpretive strategies inthe history of science. The current propositions of social science theoryhave taught us to follow the principle: each fact or phenomenon has multiplesides and aspects and the same subject examined from different angles willproduce different profiles. The problem is that our theory, even if we haveone, will not be helpful in finding the ultimate correct interpretation.Thus, instead of enforcing selection and hierarchy over our subject, itseems desirable to introduce a polarity of viewpoints that will consider thepolyvalent and polysemic character of each historical “fact.”3"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"8JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThe historiography of Dee research faithfully mirrors the paradigmshift of historical and cultural theory. In his time John Dee was a re-spected scholar and although sometimes he was accused of being a “con-juror,” even half a century after his death he was still remembered as “thewise doctor.” The publication of his spiritual diaries by Meric Casaubonin 1659, however, especially in the light of the distrustful preface of theeditor, gradually undermined his reputation and by the time of theEnlightenment he became considered, if at all, as a poor, credulous, anddeluded philosopher who got stuck among the manipulations of hischarlatan alchemist, Edward Kelly.4Dee was not much mentioned then until the nineteenth century,when some historians unearthed his diaries and letters and, as part of apositivistic historical reconstruction of the Elizabethan age, publishedthose (cf. Dee 1841, 1842, 1843, 1851, 1854, and 1880). While thesepapers were treated as important documents of their time, the evaluationof their author did not change, and the expressions “superstition,” “de-lusion,” and “obscure magic” were often used to describe him. Also thefactual accounts of his life were mixed with anecdotes of dubious origin.It was not until 1909 that the first biography of Dee appeared by Char-lotte Fell Smith. It gave a general picture about the Doctor, but since shewas not a professional historian, much less a historian of science, Dee’sscholarly activities were not treated in detail and his magic was inter-preted hardly at all.At that time the history of science had a teleological approach and onlythose achievements that pointed toward future developments of sciencewere acknowledged. Everything else was dismissed as a failure or a deadend. With such a mentality the safest field from which to assess Dee’sscholarship was that of geography and thus he earned an important placein E. G. R. Taylor’s Tudor Geography (1930) and some generous mentionsin F. R. Johnson’s Astronomical Thought in Renaissance England (1937),especially as someone who, in his Mathematicall Praeface, usefully contrib-uted to the creation of a mathematical vocabulary in the vernacular.The situation had greatly changed by the middle of the centurywhen, especially due to the research of the Warburg school (Franz Saxl,Paul Oskar Kristeller, Erwin Panofsky, Edgar Wind, and others), a radicalreassessment of the intellectual climate of the Renaissance was under-taken. This new approach acknowledged the importance of the magicalworld picture in the “antechamber of the Enlightenment.” The scholarsworking on this interpretation focused primarily on the neoplatonic re-vival of Ficino’s Florentine Academy and its influence all over Europe in"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"9Principles and Demarcationsthe first half of the sixteenth century. A typical fruit of this approach wasD. P. Walker’s monograph Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino toCampanella (1958), which traced the development of neoplatonic magicin the works of Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Agrippa, Giordano Bruno,and others. Walker belonged to the Warburg school; in fact, he was amember of the Warburg Institute of London, as was his famous colleagueDame Frances Yates. The latter was an extremely imaginative and eruditescholar who became receptive to the new interpretation of the Renais-sance and developed it into an attractive and arresting vision that wassoon to be known as the “Yates thesis.” If one tries to summarize herthesis in a few sentences, the following model emerges. As Ernst Cassirerhad already stated in his groundbreaking study on the Renaissance (TheIndividual and the Cosmos, 1963 [1927]), the most important philosophi-cal innovation of that period had been the redefinition of man’s place inthe universe. The basic framework—the Great Chain of Being—remainedmore or less the same until the late seventeenth century when man’s placewas no longer seen as being fixed anymore. Instead he was imagined ascapable of moving along the Chain of Being, either ennobling and elevat-ing himself to the level of God, or degrading and associating with thebrute beasts. Following the footsteps of Cassirer, Kristeller, and others,Yates came to the conclusion that the neoplatonic philosophers of theRenaissance developed the idea of man’s elevation not only from theworks of Plato and the Hellenistic neoplatonists, but also, in fact prima-rily, from the hermetic texts, attributed to the “thrice great” HermesTrismegistus. The Yates thesis also implied that the Renaissance maguswas a direct predecessor of the modern natural scientist because, as theCorpus hermeticum suggested, the magus could regain the ability to ruleover nature that the first man had lost with the Fall. While the magi ofthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were mostly individual researchers,their seventeenth-century followers, as Yates proposed, came to the ideaof collective work and formed secret societies, such as the Rosicrucians.For a while these ideas seemed to revolutionize our understanding of theearly modern age and the birth of modern science. In such a context themagical ideas that had previously been discarded by intellectual historiansnow appeared to be important ingredients of human ambitions to under-stand and conquer nature.The changing concepts of the Renaissance influenced the appreciationof John Dee, too. Already in 1952 historian I. R. F. Calder had written aPh.D. dissertation in which he had contextualized Dee’s magic as aneoplatonist theory. Although this thesis remained unpublished (today,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"10JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMhowever, it is available on the internet), it inspired Frances Yates to includeDee as a key figure in her narrative of the neoplatonic-hermetic Renais-sance, and in fact Dee featured as a favorite character in all of her laterbooks (1964, 1972, 1979). As a climax of this trend, in 1972, Peter French,a student of Frances Yates, wrote a full-size monograph devoted entirely toDee in which he characterized the English doctor as a prototype of theRenaissance magus.No matter how convincing the Yates thesis appeared and how elo-quently it was presented by its author, by the mid-1970s critical refusalscould also be heard. The debate included questions of philological accu-racy; for example, scholars could not agree to what extent the hermetictexts influenced the magi of the sixteenth century, or to what extentFrances Yates’ conjectures on humanist and secret political links betweencertain English intellectuals and the German Rosicrucians could be vali-dated. One should remember that just in those years post-structuralismstarted proposing serious revisions in the theoretical framework of thestudy of intellectual history, and perhaps this turn of conceptualizationdid the most for a new interpretation of John Dee.5The post-structuralist historians started reproving intellectual histo-rians for attempting to simplify history into great, overall patterns inwhich differences and contradictions were neglected and overlooked forthe sake of the coherence of the “grand narratives.” Yates was also sus-pected of having reduced those Renaissance magi to unproblematic cham-pions of hermetic neoplatonism, when in fact more complicated, oftencontradictory intellectual patterns should have been detected. In relationto Dee, it was Nicholas Clulee who in 1988 ventured into writing withthe aim of displaying the wide spectrum of influences and programs atwork in the course of the career of the Doctor. Clulee rebuked the sharedconcept of the Warburg/Yates school as follows:what is common to these works is that all approach Dee as a problemof finding the correct intellectual tradition into which he appears to fit,both as a way of making sense of his disparate and often difficult tounderstand works and activities and as a way of establishing his impor-tance by associating him with an intellectual context of recognizedimportance for sixteenth-century and later intellectual developments.(1988, 3)In his own presentation Clulee has managed to establish a dynamicpicture as opposed to the more static previous image of the hermetic"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"11Principles and Demarcationsmagus. He also differentiated among various periods in Dee’s career duringwhich his intellectual outlook as well as the direction of his attentionchanged. Clulee particularly emphasized the medieval origins, such as al-Kindi and Roger Bacon, at the foundations of Dee’s magical experiments.The importance of the Yates/French interpretations lay in the recog-nition of magic as worthy of history of science investigations. They thuslegitimized a preoccupation that had previously been considered mereobscurantism. Building on this legitimation of magic as a focus of in-quiry, Clulee highlighted the diachronic reorientation during Dee’s careerand brought into the discussion the medieval roots of sixteenth centurymagic and science that had been overshadowed by the Yatesian enthusi-asm for neoplatonic hermeticism.6 The next phase in the course of Deestudies was heralded by William Sherman’s monograph of 1995, ThePolitics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance, in which theauthor revealed a synchronic multiplicity in Dee’s diverse interests andactivities. If one contrasts the last three important opinions on Dee inmodern scholarship—that of Yates/French, Clulee, and Sherman—onesees that each of them has contributed at least one important proposal toour understanding of Renaissance magic and its famous Englishpracticioner. While looking at this historiographical line, we see a directionof scholarship moving from a somewhat static and simplistic interpreta-tion of “Dee as an English magus” toward a more complex contextuali-zation in intellectual history, in which elements of discontinuity havebecome emphasized and in which the originally proposed “master narra-tive” has become subverted by more and more—often conflicting andcontradictory—subtexts.It is interesting to notice to what extent the different orientations ofscholarship determined even the possible range of questions and subjectareas which a work on Dee could examine. As is well known, in his earlycareer the Doctor had a humanistic orientation and concentrated onmathematics, but from the 1580s he gave up these endeavors and almostentirely involved himself with angel magic, or in his own terminology“angelic conversations.” Researchers have been perplexed by the appar-ently sudden turn which transformed the venerable scientist into aneccentric enthusiast. Approaches from the viewpoint of the history ofscience—which, until recently constituted the majority of Dee scholar-ship—found this phenomenon difficult to come to terms with, and atbest a superficial explanation was advanced, according to which thehumanist became disappointed with the rational principles and logic ofscience and—not unlike Doctor Faustus, although avoiding the direct"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"12JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcontact with Satan—could only imagine achieving his intellectual goalswith the help of supernatural powers.7 Very few efforts have been madeto embrace both Dee’s scientific experiments and his angel magic in theirentirety and interconnectedness, especially given that such an examina-tion would seem to promise little benefit for historians of science. Untilrecently, interpreters of Dee’s magic have tried to underline the impor-tance of magic as a vital precondition to the scientific revolution, andwith this consideration in mind, Frances Yates invented the term“Rosicrucian Enlightenment” (cf. Yates 1968 and 1972).As I have mentioned, the Yates thesis was challenged by historians ofscience, and although Clulee (1988) and Sherman (1995) have to someextent successfully restored Dee’s place in the distinguished portrait gal-lery of science history, this restoration hardly includes his magic. Mysuggestion is to shift the focus of interest from the history of science tocultural anthropology and the history of mentality, inverting the usualquestion—“which elements of Dee’s complex and largely unscientific ideascontributed to the development of modern science?”—by asking “in whatway Dee’s scientific activity inspired his visionary and occult program?”Seeking the company of angels may seem an eccentric monomania forthe enlightened researcher; indeed, some historians have even suggestedthat Dee had become mentally ill (cf. Heilbronn, in Dee 1978, 15 and43). By contrast, anthropologists and historians of mentality have learnedhow deep the roots of occult thinking were in the world picture of thesixteenth century.8 Among the most recent contributions to Dee schol-arship, it is Debora Harkness whose approach seems to combine thehistorical and the anthropological concerns and thus her interpretationruns quite close to my own. Although I became acquainted with herbook of 1999 only at the stage when I had nearly completed my mono-graph, I shall reflect on her suggestions in the following discussion.Looking at the relationship between magic and science in the earlymodern age, it would be a simplification to claim, as Frances Yates did,that Renaissance neoplatonist magic, let alone hermeticism, fostered thescientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in a directway. On the other hand, it is possible to say that in the works (as wellas in the minds) of Dee and his fellow scientists/magi, layers of discursivelogic and irrationalism, scientific thinking and occultism, happily coex-isted in a variety of ways that would be dangerous to generalize. Eachcase should be approached individually: some of them entertained magi-cal concepts that complemented their scientific thinking (Giordano Bruno,Francis Bacon); in others the two orientations showed an almost total"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"13Principles and Demarcationsdiscontinuity (Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton); in still other cases scienceand magic were intermixed in a somewhat disorderly concoction (Paracelsus),and in Dee’s case it seems that his magical ideas totally absorbed his scientificorientation, although in his middle career one can still see independentlyfunctioning subsystems in his thought (e.g., his interest in geography or hisideas about the publicity of science). To handle such a complexity ofideology and ideas, one needs to analyze the intellectual and the psycho-logical constitution of the investigated subject as well as the philosophicaland social contexts in which he was situated. At present, it seems to me,historical anthropology and post-structuralist iconology can offer the mostfruitful methodologies to cope with this task.THE POST-COMMUNIST PERSPECTIVEIn the year 2000, what can a scholar coming from Eastern Europe offer?Perhaps a few sentences about the background of my Dee research maybe appropriate here. As I have already pointed out, I consider the histo-riographical aspect of great importance, especially to monitor the transi-tions that led from the negative attitude of the last century’s positiviststo the understanding of today’s historians. For East-Central Europeansthis process is particularly significant, since the establishment of officiallyenforced Marxist theory after World War II has made us particularlysensitive to nuances of theoretical grounding. Since state-promotedMarxism was almost exclusively interested in economic and social historywith an emphasis on class struggle and a typological prefiguration offuture revolutions, historical research in several fields became cut off fromthe main trends of Western scholarship during the 1950s and 1960s. Ithappened particularly in intellectual history, but also in the history ofmentality and historical anthropology. The examination of areas thatwould testify to the inherent role of a “superstitious” misconception suchas magic in a “progressive” age like the Renaissance was at best notencouraged in the centers of historical research and the syllabi of highereducation listed more important issues on the agenda—such as the fightof the repressed for a better life and for liberation from ideologicalmanipulation—than the investigation of the stubborn persistence ofpremodern ideas. Interestingly, this homophonic Marxism suppressed eventhe reception of alternative Marxist concepts. Thus, not only intellectualhistory and the analysis of cultural symbolization remained beyond thehorizon of our historians, but so did the works of radical writers such as"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"14JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe early Foucault, whose works otherwise would have been availablefrom the 1960s.Although Renaissance research in Hungary was less affected by theofficial party ideology than other, more contemporary fields of history,the elimination of the mentioned white spots could only start in the mid-1970s, and only with small steps. Scholars such as the late Tibor Klaniczaydid a lot to disassociate period styles from the labels “progressive” or “re-actionary,” thus enabling, for example, a balance within Baroque researchin general, or an examination of the shadowy side of the Renaissance underthe banner of Mannerism (cf. Klaniczay 1977). In this engagement thepropositions of the Yates school came in more than handy and greatlyrefreshed the research topics as well as the vocabulary of our Renaissancescholarship. It should be noted here that the newly discovered intellectualhistory in East-Central Europe became not only a research tool and atheoretical orientation but also a means of ideological resistance against thegrim, official party line. I set about examining John Dee and Renaissanceoccultism with this motivation in mind.From the early 1980s, as a young scholar, I was applying for schol-arships to the West with the intention of learning more not only aboutthe facts, which were not readily available in Hungary, but also about themethods and theories that seemed so balanced, objective, and wide inspectrum compared with what was practiced at home. Without a partymembership, of course, it was not easy to get such a stipend. After a briefvisit in 1984, I finally received a Fulbright grant which in 1986 enabledme to get to the sources in the Folger and the Huntington Libraries.One can imagine my enthusiasm arriving at those shrines of learningI had heard so much about, and also how stunned I was in realizing thatthe approach I wanted to follow was just going out of fashion. It wasenough to buy Raman Selden’s The Reader’s Guide to Contemporary LiteraryTheory and see that as opposed to twenty-eight pages on Marxist theories(the book has 149 pages) no (sub)chapter was devoted to any form ofintellectual history. The preface explained: “I have not tried to give a com-prehensive picture of modern critical theory. I have omitted, for example,myth criticism, which has a long and various history, and includes the workof such writers as Gilbert Murray, James Frazer, Carl Jung, and NorthropFrye. It seemed to me that myth criticism has not entered the main streamof academic or popular culture, and has not challenged received ideas.”9 Alook at the programs of talks and seminars at the libraries where I spentmy time warned me that with new historicism and feminism on the offen-sive, I could hardly hope for sympathetic support towards my interests. I"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"15Principles and Demarcationswitnessed an enormous divergence between the nature of the bulk of thebooks available at those libraries and the scholarly discourse I came acrossin the lobbies or during coffee breaks.10This abrupt paradigm shift in literary scholarship can be well illus-trated by Norman Rabkin’s words, which, although they refer toShakespeare criticism, can easily be extrapolated to most researched au-thors and literary periods:Only yesterday it was widely assumed that the critic’s job was to ex-pound the meaning of literary works. Today, under an extraordinarilyswift and many fronted attack, that consensus is in ruins. The reader-response theories argued in various ways by such critics as Stanley Fishand Norman Holland call into question the power of an imaginativework to elicit a uniform response from its audience; Jacques Derridaand his deconstructive allies see language and art so intractably self-reflexive as to be incapable of analyzable significance; Harold Bloomargues that all reading is misreading, that one reads well only to findoneself in the mirror.11Since the time of its publication, Rabkin’s examples have become out-dated in the context of the present post-structuralist vogue, but his diagnosisstill has the same startling validity. The problem is still not “why there is somuch bad criticism,” but “much more importantly: why is much of the bestcriticism vulnerable to attacks of the new critical trends, so that the kinds oftheoretical rejection of critical study I mentioned at the outset have been ableto find so ready an audience?” (Rabkin 1981, 4).From 1986 onward I have developed an understanding of a greatmany of the concerns post-structuralists raised against traditional criti-cism, especially against close reading and the history of ideas. I myselfhave become aware of the reductionist dangers of explaining culturalphenomena from a set ideological framework, although I (and otherEastern European scholars) had suffered more from Marxist reductionismthan the so-called “bourgeois idealist” or “humanist” approaches. In fact,I did find that new historicism could be suitably used as a weapon againstthe stalemate approaches that were to be changed in the East Bloc around1990. And I have also learned that one of the strengths of post-structuralistapproaches is that they can successfully reveal the politics of interpretation.Capitalizing on this insight, as an outsider, I would like to propose torevisit some of the fields of the historiographical battles.It may seem surprising, but at this point, after the above historio-graphical and theoretical excursus, I would like to advocate a kind of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"16JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcautious return to the Yatesian “master narrative,” albeit with somemodifications. While the above described diversification of the historicalunderstanding of Dee has made me sensitive to the subtleties of ourresearched subject, alongside these I have become convinced that none-theless there was little or no changes in the central concern of Dee’sphilosophical investigations. In spite of the various activities and diversetheoretical approaches he applied, I see a permanent and invariable fea-ture that characterized all his works and actions. This was a fervent desirefor omniscience in order to understand the divine plan of creation andGod’s intentions with the cosmos and man. His ambition was to use hisknowledge for elevating himself to the level of God, thus realizing thepotential granted in the Genesis: “And God said, let us make man in ourimage, after our likeness: and let them have dominion [ . . . ] over all theearth. So God created Man in his own image, in the image of Godcreated he him” (Genesis 1:26–27). To describe this ambition I use theconcept of exaltatio, as I shall explain it in the following introductorychapters. Parallel to my view, Deborah Harkness used another, similarmetaphor, found also in the Bible: she compared Dee’s natural philo-sophical orientation to building Jacob’s ladder. This mytho-icon sup-ported the ideology that communication between heaven and earth waspossible, and as Harkness notes, “Dee, along with many of his contem-poraries, searched a variety of authoritative treatises for information onhow to ascend ‘Jacob’s ladder’ to learn the secrets of the cosmos, and thendescend to share that information with the waiting world” (1999, 60).In the followings I am thus going to approach Dee as a “magus” whohad an amazingly wide range of interests but who also increasingly hada focused obsession, a magical program, not necessarily to improve thesciences in order to prepare for the scientific revolution, but rather to findan alternative system of knowledge. Since Dee clearly distinguished be-tween science after the Fall and that of the primordial wisdom (the“radicall truthes” as he called it), we have to take seriously the fact thathere we are really talking about alternative systems of knowledge. His aimwas to restore the Adamic or Enochian wisdom of the Golden Age thathad been lost with the Fall and which would not be compatible with themethods and means of the fallen science relying on discursive logic. Dee’sprogram was by no means exceptional in the intellectual spectrum of thelate Renaissance but in its compactness—together with its variety—itremains certainly outstanding.The examination of magic is pertinent in our age, too.

In spite of its rigid doc-trines, however, it invests the world with a multiplicity of meanings thatfor its believers and researchers seems inexhaustible. I am going to exam-ine the paradoxical relationship of literature, culture, science, and theoccult, concentrating on the epoch of the Renaissance, which witnessedthe crystalization of the esoteric philosophy, parallel to the birth of Car-tesian logic and modern experimentation.It is intriguing to examine the parallel rise of two such contrary worldpictures between which we can still observe intricate cross-fertilization. Iam suggesting that occult philosophy and magic to some extent have cata-lyzed the development of experimental sciences—by now this has becomea commonplace in science history—at the same time they have fostered asubversive approach that in fact prevented the ultimate conquest by thelogical-rational world picture. Thus it contributed to the survival of asymbolic language, with some pathos one might say, and to the continuousrebirth of poetry. It is because of this effect that I propose an investigationinto the ideology and iconography of occult philosophy."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"2Mysticism, Occultism, Magic ExaltationFALL AND REBIRTHIn my introductory sentences I referred to the many fields and aspects ofmagic that in their entirety cannot be addressed in the present book. I aminterested in that particular ambition of magic that aimed at producing acomplete explanatory system of the world and since the early modern erahas offered itself as an alternative to what we nowadays call the scientificway of interpretation. I am looking for the intertextualized documents ofthis primarily theological-philosophical program with its roots reachingback to Antiquity and with its various manifestations in Renaissance art,science, and also in diverse social practices. I shall concentrate on thoseelements that from the classical and Judeo-Christian sources became ab-sorbed in European high culture, although—as we shall see—from time totime I will have to touch upon aspects of popular cultural programs as wellas black magic and witchcraft.Since the forthcoming investigations will try to analyze the occultphilosophy and its manifestations in various symbolic systems—religion,magic, and art—it seems natural and necessary to start with some expla-nations of how I understand the key terms: mysticism, occultism, andmagic. I relate all of these to the ambition and desire of man to reachexaltation and union with the Deity. A suitable start might be to recall theancient, archetypal experience of mankind concerning the Fall, precipitatedby some original sin, the loss of Eden, or the Golden Age. This theme caninvariably be found in all religions and mythologies (cf. for example Barr19"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"20JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM1992; Delumeau 1995; Eliade 1968 and 1992). This negative experience,however, has always been counterbalanced by the age-old ambition of manto regain the lost harmony, eventually to deify himself and regain hisposition at the side of God. The Hungarian cultural historian and sociolo-gist Elemér Hankiss has named these experiences and the efforts to handlethem the Promethean and the Apollonian strategies of humankind. Theformer comprises the technical side of civilization aiming primarily at thedemarcation of human Lebensraum from the uncontrolled and chaoticuniverse by means of fences, walls, electronic rays, and innumerable otherdevices that provide the boundaries of those spheres within which thehuman being is the commanding master. The Apollonian strategy meansa spiritual demarcation or fence-building: symbolization—the creation ofa sphere of myths, illusions, images, and artworks.1 The agenda of exaltatiocan be connected with this latter strategy.As an attentive reader of the Bible, Dee was, naturally, well aware ofthose pieces of information in the sacred book that intrigued many Renais-sance philosophers. Primarily among such topics was the doctrine assertingthe dignity of Adam in Paradise and, related to this, the omniscient intellec-tual capacity given to man prior to the Fall. Particular signs of this excep-tional power and knowledge were Adam’s linguistic qualities, namely, that hecould directly converse with God and that he was entrusted to name thecreatures of the world in Paradise. As we can read in Genesis:And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field,and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see whathe would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature,that was the name thereof. (2:19)The basis for this privilege was, of course, God’s original intention in thecreation of man:And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: andlet them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl ofthe air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth....So God createdman in his own image. (Gen., 1:26–27)This happy state and high status, then, as we know, was ended by ourforefather’s disobedience. Even so, whole generations of Renaissance think-ers were enthralled by these words, which encouraged them to try theimpossible: to regain the lost dignity and reinstate themselves in the bosom"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"21Mysticism, Occultism, Magic Exaltationof God.2 They were searching for other hopeful instances in the Bible thatwould testify to the possibility of occasional magical exaltations. So someverses of the Psalms suggested that man had (almost) the same all-powerfulprivileges as the angels:What is man, that thou art mindful of him?For thou hast made him a little lower than the angelsand hast crowned him with glory and honor.Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands:thou hast put all things under his feet. . . . (Psalm 8:4–6)And in the Wisdom of Solomon one could read that the mighty kingdirectly received omniscience from the Creator:God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive as is meetfor the things that are given me: because it is he that leadeth untowisdom, and directeth the wise. [. . .]For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are,namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of theelements.The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: the alterations ofthe turning of the sun, and the change of seasons. [. . .]And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them I know.(Wisdom 7:15–21)This Biblical framework naturally encouraged the savants of theRenaissance to look for parallels and reinforcements among their highlyesteemed classical authorities. Among the Greeks we find these notionsmost crystallized in the works of Plato. According to his poetically ex-pounded mythology, the charioter of the Symposium and of Phaedrus, thesoul imprisoned in the body, with good fortune, may remember theworld of ideas and this arouses the desire in man to elevate himself abovethe physical existence and to open a channel of communication with thetranscendental world, the divine.If a man makes right use of such means of remembrance, and everapproaches to the full vision of the perfect mysteries, he and he alonebecomes truly perfect. Standing aside from the busy doings of man-kind, and drawing nigh to the divine, he is rebuked by the multitudeas being out of his wits, for they know not that he is possessed by adeity. (Phaedrus 249c–d; Plato 1963, 496)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"22JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMPlato distinguished between four such channels, as he called them,sacred enthusiasms, or furies. As none of these forms of communicationwith the transcendental is a logically concievable experience, we can callthem mystical apprehensions. Among them the first two (religious enthu-siasm and prophetic fury) are rather passive operations. They happen toman without the active cooperation of the medium who is suddenlyenlightened through epiphanic revelation. The other two—furies of loveand poetry—are more active and inspire individual acts, leading even toa creative process. Thus man becomes the imitator of divine creation andeventually a partaker of the transcendental reality. At this point Platoclearly differentiates between the uselessness of the imitative poet whocreates without sacred elevation and the high quality output of the in-spired bard. One should remember this distinction in adopting the com-monplace about Plato’s condemnatory opinion of painters and poets:There is a third form of possession or madness, of which the Muses arethe source. This seizes a tender, virgin soul and stimulates it to raptpassionate expression, especially in lyric poetry. [. . .] But if any mancome to the gates of poetry without the madness of the Muses, per-suaded that skill alone will make him a good poet, then shall he andhis works of sanity with him be brought to nought by the poetry ofmadness, and behold, their place is nowhere to be found. (Phaedrus245a; Plato 1963, 492)It is obvious that such mystical experience cannot be classified as partof the common human knowledge, which normally derives from discur-sive logic. Yet it is still some kind of knowledge, in my definition, occultknowledge, that is, a secret learning which is a privilege of the hypersen-sitive elect.At this point it may be worth recalling Edgar Wind’s distinction be-tween the three senses of the term mystery. According to him it refers torituals, figurative understanding, and magical practices (1968, 6 and thewhole of chapter 1). These three phases, naturally, could never be strictlyseparated from each other; however their interrelatedness also comprisedsome sort of internal evolution. Originally ‘the mysteries’ meant collectiveritualistic practices, such as the rites of Eleusis at which the ancient philoso-phers (such as Diogenes Laertius, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, and others) lookedwith distrust and irreverence as befitting only the vulgar multitude. Plato’sopinion, however, was more ambiguous. On the one hand he spoke withirony about the possibility of such hierophany, according to his famous"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"23Mysticism, Occultism, Magic Exaltationmaxim: “Many are the thyrsus-bearers but few are the bacchoi.”3 But onthe other hand he himself emphasized that the final end of wisdom was thepurgation of the soul from the follies of the body and that the truephilosopher’s occupation “consists precisely in the freeing and separation ofsoul from body” (Phaedo 67d; Plato 1963, 50). While this separationhappens naturally in death, the wise man has to try to achieve it while stillalive. For Plato a rational excercise, the art of dialectic, was a feasiblealternative way to cleanse the soul and achieve communion with the Be-yond (Wind’s phrase). In this sense, in philosophy, ‘the mystery’ is to beunderstood figuratively.Plato’s chief follower, Plotinus, was more permissive concerning thepossibility of syncretic approaches to philosophy and religion. Althoughhe claimed that “the gods must come to me, not I to them,”4 he alsoapproved the significance of manifest symbols for those who are still onthe outside but aspire to enter.Although Plato himself did not care much for magic, its hellenisticrevival resulted from the inner logic of his theory of enthusiasms. Inaddition to the four sacred madnesses, inevitably was added a fifth chan-nel through which one could contact the transcendental. If poetic inspi-ration could be defined as a mystère littéraire (Festugière 1932, 116ff.),the mystical exaltation ought to have been achieved also by means ofincantations, application of sacred names and numbers, or other magical-ritualistic procedures. Plotinus, and especially his disciples, the hellenistic“Platonici” (Porphyry, Iamblichus, Proclus, and Synesius) accomplished acomplex program of syncretism that resulted in the fact that magic be-came gradually readmitted as a handmaid of philosophy and, as Windwryly remarked, “soon rose to become her mistress” (6). In this contextmagic may be defined as that type of human action that, exploitingoccult knowledge, connects man’s intellect with the supernatural andthrough this connection man tries to exercise his will in the spirit world.It is well known to what extent the neopletonist philosophers of theRenaissance came under the spell of this syncretic, theological under-standing of magic, especially since they did not see an unbridgeabledivide between this hellenistic inheritance and the Christian doctrines.The final goal remained the same: the deification of man, a programwhich was corroborated by the biblical doctrine according to which manwas created after the image of God and shared all God’s characteristics.The most important among those characteristics were omniscience andomnipotence, which all magi craved. Christian magic seems to havefollowed Plato’s logic in the Phaedo, namely that while man normally"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"24JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcould expect the union with the divine only after death, magic tried toovercome the existential limits of the human species and elevate theindividual soul to the world of ideas during earthly life. Nothing expressedthis objective better than Pico della Mirandola’s passionate words in Dehominis dignitate:Who would not long to be initiated into such sacred rites? Who wouldnot desire, by neglecting all human concerns, by despising the goodsof fortune, and by disregarding those of the body, to become the guestof the gods while yet living on earth, and, made drunk by the nectarof eternity, to be endowed with the gifts of immortality though still amortal being? (section 16, Pico 1948, 233)This was the program that the Renaissance magi became obsessed withand this became the lifelong aspiration of the English mathematicianJohn Dee, too.To sum up the set of definitions established so far: first of all, mys-tical experiences constitute the widest category within which one findsoccult knowledge, a somewhat more systematic body of doctrines devel-oped on the basis of mystical experiences. Occult knowledge is thus asynthetic amalgam of traditionally transmitted lore and its philosophi-cally organized explanation. And, as we can safely claim that only asmaller circle of the recipients of mystical experiences became consciousof occult wisdom, an even smaller circle among those would attempt toexpress active, magical will. Depending on the magical program and theevoked agents of the magus, one can thus distinguish between white andblack magic.THE ORGANIC WORLD MODELAfter the preliminary definitions we need to identify the intellectualframework that provides the theoretical basis for a magically orientednatural philosophy. First and foremost it is a hierarchical world picture,since in a uniform cosmos there is no transcendental sphere. A furtherprerequisite is the belief in the organic, or even occult, mystical corre-spondences between the elements of this hierarchical universe. Typicalsystems of such occult correspondences are astrology and alchemy. Thelatter has an important offspring, spiritual alchemy, which interprets thetransmutation of metals on an allegorical-emblematic level and aims atthe purification of the human soul."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"25Mysticism, Occultism, Magic ExaltationWe may also add that without the speculative Greco-Hellenisticphilosophy no such complexity of European magical lore could havedeveloped. All Christianized magical thinking can be traced back to thederivations of Platonism or Plotinus’ doctrine of emanations. I do notwant to describe in detail the organic world picture; it is enough to referto classical works that contributed to our understanding of that worldmodel, so different from our own based on the Cartesian cosmos and theachievments of the Scientific Revolution. It was Arthur O. Lovejoy whoin 1936 first employed the concept of “the Great Chain of Being” incultural history (cf. Lovejoy 1960), which later became popularized inE. M. W. Tillyard’s controversial The Elizabethan World Picture (1946)and further explained in a great number of scholarly monographs, includ-ing S. K. Heninger’s important books (1974 and 1977). Although theconcept of the Great Chain of Being—since it suggested a grand narrativeor a universal formula in which scholars hoped to distill the essence of thepremodern world picture—has been recently challenged, in my opinion,with ample fine tuning, it is still tenable, as is shown by the contemporaryinfluential theory of Jurii Lotman who derived his cultural semiotics froma typology of world models, contrasting the medieval vertical with themodern horizontal ones.5 Instead of repeating the already known featuresof this premodern world model, here I would rather like to recall theevolution of the ways it was imagined and visualized throughout the cen-turies up to the great paradigm shift of the seventeenth century.The central idea and metaphor was summarized by Cicero in hiscommentary to the dream of Scipio as follows:Since from the Supreme God Mind arises, and from Mind, Soul, andsince this in turn creates all subsequent things and fills them all withlife, and since this single radiance illuminates all and is reflected ineach, as a single face might be reflected in many mirrors placed in aseries; and since all things follow in continuous succession, degenerat-ing in sequence to the very bottom of the series, the attentive observerwill discover a connection of parts, from the Supreme God down to thelast dregs of things, mutually linked together and without a break. Andthis is Homer’s golden chain, which God, he says, bade hang downfrom heaven to earth.6The chain metaphor obviously recapitulated Plotinus’ concept of emana-tions; however, it also relied on Aristotle’s natural philosophy since it was thelatter who produced a graphically conceivable picture concerning the struc-ture of the universe by dividing it into the sublunary and translunary spheres.7"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"26JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMCicero’s visual metaphor was further developed and Christianized byPseudo-Dionysius, the Areopagite who inserted the orders of angels intothe Chain. His popularity was unshaken during the Middle Ages and hissystem gained a most sophisticated form in Aquinas’ scholastic theology.From the time of scholasticism more and more specialized works tried toexplain and further develop the design of the Great Chain of Being andthis culminated in the natural philosophy of the Renaissance, includingthinkers such as Agrippa, Paracelsus, Fludd—and John Dee. These“scientific” descriptions are not easy to follow for the modern reader, butfortunately we also have literary-artistic visions as well as graphic illustra-tions showing how the fundamentally unchanged world model gainedmore and more refined explanations and representations up to the sev-enteenth century.Hartmann Schedel’s late medieval world chronicle offered a naively“realistic” scheme of the hierarchies of the world, and this approach waspreserved until the early decades of printing, as can be seen from theillustration in the 1493 edition (Figure 2.1).8 The spheres of the createdworld are surrounded by the hierarchies of spirits and angels and the wholestructure of the cosmos is kept in place by the four principal winds.FIGURE 2.1A late medieval representation of the seventh day of the Creation, resulting in theGreat Chain of Being.

The diagram actually offers two parallelcolumns, one representing the Great Chain of Being—that is, the mac-rocosm—while the other chain shows the corresponding levels of cogni-tion and sensation—that is, the functions of the microcosm (Figure 2.2).Bouelles, a well-known occult philosopher of the early sixteenth centuryand one of the chief authorities on number symbolism, correspondedwith Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples, Germain Ganay, Trithemius, and others.It is worth noting that his books on secret numbers, mystical geometry,and the seven ages of the world—including the one this illustration istaken from—were featured in Dee’s library in seven editions, both inLatin and in French.9Renaissance magic naturally issued from the idea of the Great Chainof Being and its correspondences. It is not by chance that the Renaissancemagi so often referred to the system, such as Agrippa in his introductiontoDe occulta philosophia:FIGURE 2.2Representation of the “Grait Chain of Being” from Charles de Bouelles, Liber deintellectu (Paris, 1510), 42v.

(1.1; Agrippa1997, 3)Needless to say, Agrippa was one of Dee’s main inspirations in turningto the occult philosophy. What the English Doctor could not know was,that after his death there was to come yet another exalted, last soar of themagical philosophy which was to produce the most fascinating and beau-tiful illustrations that kept alive the splendor of this intellectual endeavorlong after it became invalidated by the great paradigm shift effected by theScientific Revolution. Dee’s compatriot Robert Fludd was one of the lastgreat occult philosophers of the Renaissance, and in the early decades ofthe seventeenth century he further refined the organic world model andcreated the following captivating diagram (Figure 2.3). At the foot of thescheme one finds the earth as the base of material existence, at the top theHoly Trinity represents pure intelligence. God and the earth are connectedby a reversed, “formal pyramid,” which indicates the diminishing amountof intelligence alongside the downreaching chain. While “formality” (standingFIGURE 2.3The “formal” and “material” pyramidal components of the universe. Robert Fludd, Utriusquecosmi . . . historia (Oppenheim, 1617–1619), 1:89.

As Heninger notes, materiality and for-mality are two basic paradigms of existence and they structure the cosmosin a symmetrical frame (1977, 28).These notions were so strong that they survived the Middle Ages andcontinued to dominate the scientific concepts of the Renaissance. Phi-losophers such as Ficino devoted long passages to describe the angelichierarchies and their relation with the material world:Seraphim speculate on the order and providence of God.Cherubim speculate on the essence and form of God.Thrones also speculate, though some descend to works.Dominions, like architects, design what the rest execute.Virtues execute, and move the heavens, and concur for the workingof miracles as God’s instruments.Powers watch that the order of divine governance is not interruptedand some of them descend to human things.Principalities care for public affairs, nations, princes, magistrates.Archangels direct the divine cult and look after sacred things.Angels look after smaller affairs, and take charge of individuals astheir guardian angels.10What is more, as we know from Lovejoy, the metaphor of the Chain ofBeing did not immediately disappear after its scientific foundations hadbeen discredited. The aesthetic beauty of symmetry and divine ordercaptured the imagination of poets from Dante until the Enlightenment.In the Age of Reason, Alexander Pope celebrated the hierarchy of beingsas follows:Vast Chain of Being! Which from God began,Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,No glass can reach! from Infinite to thee,From thee to nothing . . .Essay on Man (1733), quoted from Abrams et al. 1986, 1:2269.From the concept of the chain of being followed another importantcharacteristics of the premodern world model, that is, its supposed or-ganic character. As opposed to the seventeenth-century paradigm in whichthe world was compared to a machine or a clock, wound up and allowedto run by God, in the late Renaissance the cosmos had been likened to"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"30JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMa living organism governed and moved by sympathies, drawn by likenessand analogies.11 The spiritus mundi entirely filled the universe withinwhich each layer of the hierarchy was mirrored in the other, analogouslyfunctioning tiers. The orders of angels were duplicated in the celestialand planetary hierarchies, which in turn governed the elemental spheresof the material world. This intricate system of correspondences was ex-tremely old. It had been present long before Aristotle, preceding even thePlatonic and Pythagorean mathematical theology. Its roots had reached asfar as the Egyptian and other Eastern philosophies. Correspondencescharacterized magical and astrological speculations from the beginnings,as can be seen in the ancient text of the Smaragdine Table:That which is beneath is like that which is above: and that which isabove, is like that which is beneath to worke the miracles of one thing.And as all things have proceeded from one, by the meditation of one,so all things have sprung from this one thing by adaptation.12This concise maxim named the spheres above and beneath but alsoreferred to the correspondences between the two worlds, the large and thesmall, that is, the macro and microcosms, the latter being man who was seenas a miniature model of the universe. The most important elements of thisconcept can best be viewed in contemporary diagrams and illustrations.Both classical and biblical sources spoke of the double nature of man,namely that he was composed of the material and of the intellectual worlds.His microcosm was connected with the macrocosm through the four ele-ments as well as through the intelligences. The occult side of these corre-spondences was manifest in the notions of astrological determinism, whichpresupposed the unity and organic nature of the world.One of the most compact representations of these correspondences isfound in a 1472 publication of Isidore of Seville. The key words placedin the circular diagram—Mundus–Annus–Homo—underline the unityof cosmos and man existing in time. The combination of the elementsand qualities with the cycle of time, the yearly seasons within a geometri-cal compound, is so perfect that the famous Warburg Institute has se-lected this emblem as its own device. Since this diagram is so well known,I have chosen another, impressively elaborate version from 1555, fromone of the books John Dee also possessed. His personal acquaintanceOronce Finé, the French mathematician, devised it for his De mundisphaera, sive Cosmographia (Figure 2.4). Like on Isidor’s diagram, Finéalso sets up the four elements and the four qualities, but connects them"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"31Mysticism, Occultism, Magic Exaltationaccording to a complicated system of correspondences showing “con-venientes,” “contraria,” and “repugnantes,” summarizing the whole asfollows: “Figura elementarium, primarumquae qualitatum, tam con-venientium quam discordantium ad invicem.”13While the diagram of Isidore and Finé provides the theoretical frame-work for expanding on the occult correspondences, another medievalillustration leads us to one of their concrete applications: the astrologicaleffects on man’s body (Figure 2.5: Gregor Reisch, Margarita philosophicaFIGURE 2.4The expanded tetrad of the elements and qualities.

It is important to note that John Dee’s imagi-nation was no doubt fertilized by the above illustrations, since he notonly possessed Finé’s treatise, but also the exquisitely beautiful Reischedition (R&W 1385); as for the works of Isidore, he had three valuablemanuscripts (R&W M94a, M114k, M119).Woodcuts like the above, deriving from medieval manuals, becameextremely common in Renaissance almanacs and emblem books, continu-ing their career well into the early modern era. An emblematic treatmentof the microcosm is attractively visualised in Henry Peachem’s MinervaBrittana (1610, cf. Figure 2.6) and many more complex diagrams can beFIGURE 2.6 Homo microcosmus.

The octave or diapason sounding on themonochord refers to the harmony that had been subject to philosophicFIGURE 2.7 Man—Cosmos—Day—Night.

On this particular illustration the two partsof the body, belonging to the day and to the night, are kept together bythespiritus mundi, represented by the monochord. On it, following theproportions of the golden mean, one can see the stages of the descensionand ascension of the soul. The macrocosm and the microcosm are alikedivided into three empires: the elemental, the ethereal, and the empy-rean. The parts of the body correspond to these orders.14 Kircher’s zodia-cal man is important because, according to scholarly literature, this authorwas the last to offer such speculative diagrams in a strictly scientificallyorientated monograph (Godwin 1979b, 92).From the above simplified presentation, I believe that we can drawthe conclusion that the theoretical framework of occult and magical naturalphilosophy was provided by the principles of the Great Chain of Being,the notion of correspondences, and the analogical interpretations of themacro- and microcosms. It is true that not all theorists of the organicworld picture proceeded to deal with magic, but the reverse can be safelyclaimed: no magic could be imagined without the organic world model.THE DOCTRINE OF EXALTATIONFinally, before moving on from the area of definitions and demarcations,a brief elaboration is needed concerning the term and concept of exaltatio,the doctrine according to which man—with the help of certain tech-niques, including magic—could bring himself into such a state that enableshim to leave the body and seek the company of the Deity.I have decided to employ the term exaltatio to describe this programof deification, according to which a mystically elevating state can beachieved through the grace of God, by the efforts of the individual, orby accidental fortunate circumstances. In the latter two cases the exalta-tion needs catalyzers or supernatural help.For Ficino the experiencing of beauty could launch the soul upwardinto the world of ideas, but he himself was most intrigued by the pos-sibility that, in constructing talismans, the magus himself could mobilizedemonic or angelic agencies. This option was even more emphasized byPico della Mirandola and Cornelius Agrippa. As Pico wrote in the Ora-tion, “Thou, constrained by no limits, in accordance with thine own freewill,in whose hand We have placed thee, shalt ordain for thyself thelimits of thy nature” (section 3, Pico 1948, 225, emphasis mine). And in"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"35Mysticism, Occultism, Magic Exaltationorder to corroborate this view, he cited biblical loci, classical authorities(referring to the Greek mysteries, Plato, Pythagoras, Chaldean oracles), aswell as Christian scholars (Pseudo-Dionysius, Duns Scotus, Aquinas,Albertus Magnus). As he observed, the result was invariably the same, amiraculous exaltation:We shall measure therefrom all things that are and shall be and havebeen in indivisible eternity; and, admiring their original beauty, like theseers of Phoebus, we shall become her own winged lovers. And at last,roused by ineffable love as by a sting, like burning Seraphim rapt fromourselves, full of divine power we shall no longer be ourselves but shallbecome He Himself Who made us. (section 16, Pico 1948, 234)Paracelsus went even further in expanding his vision about the infinitepossibilities of the magus:Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source ofenergy, from which new arts flow. [. . . ] When a man undertakes tocreate something, he establishes a new heaven, as it were, and from itthe work that he desires to create flows into him. [. . . ] For such is theimmensity of man that he is greater than heaven and earth. (Astronomiamagna;Paracelsus 1928–1933, 12:183 [1951, 45])The above quotations do not involve the expression exaltation, which infact was rather exceptional in classical and humanist Latin. The sense inwhich I use it, however, can be extracted from dictionaries of the Latinlanguage. The great Teubner, for example, gives the following division forthe connotations of exaltatio:☞I. ‘actio sursum levandi, extollendi, elevatio’ (A/ a proprie [hicafferuntur etiam ei loci, quibus sensus quidam myst. vel transl. perplanam alleg. accedit]: 1/ in universum [variarum rerum allevatio]: a/corporaliter: astrorum; b/ incorporaliter: vocis “tuba vocis exaltatio inprædicatione divina” [Is. 58, 1]; 2/ peculiariter: de crucis sive Christi incruce elevatione; B/ translate de conditione [syn. ascensio; opp.humilitas]: 1/ bono sensu: “ædificavit Moyses altare et vocavit nomen eius‘dominus exaltatio mea’” [Exod. 17, 15].

This elevation can happen through thegrace of God (see the quotation from Exodus) or as a reward of humanexcellence (as in Matthew 5:11–12: “Blessed are ye, when [men] shallrevile you, and persecute [you], and shall say all manner of evil againstyou falsely, for my sake. / Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is]your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which werebefore you” [gaudete et exultate quoniam merces vestra copiosa est in cælis]16).The expression—as most signs that have symbolic connotations—en-velops negative meanings, too (in malam partem). It may stand for superbiaorelatio, that is, pride and conceit. As we shall see in the forthcominganalyses, all of these meanings will play an important role in the conceptof magical exaltatio. Passive as opposed to active elevation on the one hand,assertive enthusiasm as opposed to conceitful delusion on the other, allcontribute to the complicated cultural history of occult aspirations.There are a great number of phrases in the texts dealing with thedeification of man that characterize the magical exaltation: elatus, elevatio,exultatio, furor, illuminatio, inspiratio. I have chosen exaltatio as a collectiveterm for all these primarily because of its connotations in modern Euro-pean languages—think of the French term l’exaltation [praise, elevation,admiration], or the German exaltiert, or the English exalted. Beyond theeveryday meanings one should remember that the term exaltatio in astrol-ogy refers to the position of a planet in the zodiac where its power is thegreatest. Alchemy also uses this term. For example, Edward Kelly in hisTheatro astronomiae terrestri (Hamburg, 1676) speaks about the “exaltationof Mercurial water” (1999, chapter 7); and according to the conclusion ofthePractise of Mary Prophetess in the Alchemicall Art the sister of Moses“Joyned with three seeds she does aspire To be exalted in the Fire.”17In an alchemical treatise published in 1680 and attributed to GeorgeRipley, one can also read about the “First Matter” that contains the fourelements “pure in their Exaltation.”18 Furthermore, according to the 1612lexicon of Martin Ruland, exaltation is an operation by which a sub-stance is raised into a purer and more perfect nature (Ruland 1984, 138).The same dictionary points out the relationship between exaltatio and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"37Mysticism, Occultism, Magic Exaltationsublimatio, which is not only a chemical process but also a key term inspiritual alchemy that indicates the purification process of the soul, some-times compared to the resurrection of Christ.Relying on the rich net of connotation, I consciously use exaltatiosomewhat ambiguously in the sense that a person can reach the state ofexaltation either by accidental circumstances or by his/her own will. Andthis initiative can spring from deep faith as well as from self-conceit. In myopinion the vague borderline between mysticism and magic can be foundin the transitory area leading from passive happening to conscious action.The last remark of my introduction should be devoted to a veryimportant caveat. No one should think that the significance of exaltatiois restricted to being an abstract term of philosophy, thus constituting atrend of speculative thinking. The program of deification combined withmagic had far-reaching consequences for those who adhered to it. Theoccult outlook not only determined their thinking, the metaphysical goalalso customized their behavior, social interaction, strategies of self-fash-ioning, the iconography of their gestures, as well as their poetic imagina-tion. In the ensuing chapters I hope to demonstrate this complexity withthe example of John Dee."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Part 2Input“In many bokes and sundry languages . . .”"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"3The Sources of Renaissance MagicThe library of John Dee has fascinated researchers of his life and work.Since the bookstock has been dispersed, the main sources by which toassess it have been the handwritten catalogues that remained unpublisheduntil recently.1 Frances Yates referred to this fabulous collection manytimes and advocated that its catalogue be published.2 Peter French ana-lyzed its contents and tried to measure the scope of the subcollectiondealing with magic (1972, 40–61). Nicholas Clulee did the same, onlywith greater accuracy, helped by the proofs of Roberts and Watson’smagisterial edition of the catalogues that, with important studies andindices, finally appeared in 1990.

In fact, the acquisition of a book wouldnot mean that its owner immediately incorporated it into his own thought.This is all true. However, in the following section, I am not going to takeinto consideration the chronology of Dee’s own intellectual evolution; ratherI shall turn to this in the third part. In the present section I shall tracemagical ideas relating to the doctrine of exaltatio according to that sup-posed genealogy of wisdom as believed by Dee and his contemporaries. Asis well known, in spite of its late Hellenistic origin, in the sixteenth centurytheCorpus hermeticum was considered to be the most ancient non-Judeo-Christian source that could authenticate those biblical loci about the dig-nity of man. Due to this firm Renaissance conviction, I find it appropriateto start our review with the writings of Hermes Trismegistus.TRADITIONS OF CLASSICAL MAGICFrances Yates and the Rediscovery of Renaissance MagicSince cultural history, like epic narratives, consists of intricate, intertwin-ing plot elements, it seems advisable to begin the tale in medias res. Tostart to map John Dee’s intellectual horizon, the second half of the fif-teenth century will be an appropriate point. By this time Renaissancehumanism had consolidated itself, which meant the recovering of thecultural and philosophical heritage of Antiquity. Parallel with that, a newinfrastructure of intellectuals was developed by the formation of academiasas an alternative network to the medieval universities.3 Perhaps the mostimportant among these private academies was the Florentine neoplatonistcircle presided over by Marsilio Ficino and sponsored by the Mediciprinces. The importance of the Florentine Academy, naturally, has beenknown since the emergence of Renaissance studies.4 Frances Yates, how-ever, in her book Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (1964)"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"43The Sources of Renaissance Magiccontributed observations about the interests of the Florentine philoso-phers that resulted in a thorough reconsideration of Renaissance magic;something that had been seen as a highly suspect and superstitious oc-cupation turned out to seem a respected and ambitious program, fully inharmony with the man-centered world picture of the Renaissance.Not that Yates was the first to notice the gravity of magic in earlymodern thought. Since the time of Burckhardt it had been noticed byothers, and the meticulous works of Thorndike, Kristeller, Walker, andseveral others grounded the reassessment of magic. It was neverthelessYates who, with great erudition, pointed out that the Florentineneoplatonists, and notably Ficino, not only concentrated on Plato andthe Platonici in trying to create a syncretic classical-Christian philosophy,but that an important group of their sources consisted of the obscure andirrational texts of the so-called hermetic tradition.This textual lore came to the attention of the neoplatonists first ofall by chance, then due to a colossal philological error. Ficino himself toldthe story in the preface of his Plotinus commentary addressed to Lorenzoil Magnifico: in 1560 a monk from Macedonia had brought the manu-scripts of the Corpus hermeticum to Prince Cosimo. The chance elementin this story relates to the fall of Byzantium in 1453, which started alandslide effect: monks, humanists, scholars were fleeing from the Turksand taking refuge in Italy, often carrying with them important manu-scripts and other cultural treasures. The political changes gave a thrust toGreek studies in Italy (note, for example, the activities of Cardinal Bessarionwho gave his valuable collection of Greek manuscripts to the library ofthe San Marco in Venice and who himself greatly contributed to thespreading of Greek studies as well as to reconciling classical philosophyand Christian theology in Western Europe).Related to this historical accident was the ensuing philological gaffe,namely that old Cosimo became so excited about the hermetic texts thathe ordered Ficino to interrupt the Plato translations and to undertakethe Latin rendering of Hermes’ writings: “mihi Mercurium primoTermaximum, mox Platonem mandavit interpretandum.”5 This extraor-dinary situation inspired Dame Frances to the following exclamation:“There are the complete works of Plato, waiting, and they must waitwhilst Ficino quickly translates Hermes, probably because Cosimo wantsto read him before he dies. What a testimony this is to the mysteriousreputation of the Thrice Great!” (Yates 1964, 13).While Ficino worked on the translation, he also cross-referencedwhat classical and Christian authorities had to say on the hermetic writings."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"44JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMIt seems that he had weighty enough sources to conclude that the writ-ings of Hermes Trismegistus belonged to the most ancient divine revela-tions in the possession of mankind. In fact, he became convinced thatthey were of the same age if not older than God’s teachings communi-cated to and through the biblical Moses.Before turning to the hermetic treatises, it might be useful to recall ina few words the modern textual history of the Corpus hermeticum. Reitzenstein’spioneering edition of one text, the Poimandres (1904), was followed by WalterScott’s four-volume complete publication (1924–1936), which, although todayno longer considered to be textually reliable, still contains numerous inter-esting observations and comparisons. The mid-twentieth-century large-scaleedition of A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugière (Nock 1945–1954) is still con-sidered definitive, and Festugière’s complementary studies also belong to themost important interpretations of these texts (1950–1954). Parallel to theseeditions, Kristeller discovered the relationship between the hermetic texts andthe Italian humanists of the Cinquecento (1937–1945; 1943). His researchwas rounded out by the studies fostered by the Warburg Institute (by thenin London): after Raymond Klibansky’s The Continuity of the Platonic Tra-dition during the Middle Ages (1939), it was D. P. Walker who first associateddirectly neoplatonist philosophy, hermetic lore, and Renaissance magicalinterests in his Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella (1958).Frances Yates also worked within this intellectual milieu but her Bruno bookof 1964 demonstrated the individualistic features of her approach to hermeti-cism and magic.Another publiction of the Hermetica should still be mentioned: BrianCopenhaver’s English translation (1992), which not only offers a highlyaccurate text but also broad contextual—philological, social, and cul-tural—interpretations for the understanding of Hermes’ writings. It shouldbe mentioned that Copenhaver contributed important articles to theassessment of the debates concerning the Yates thesis (1978; 1988; 1990),and in the dedication of his Hermetica edition he paid tribute to theachievement of Yates and two other great Renaissance scholars: “Manybear the wand, but few become bacchoi: Frances Amelia Yates, DanielPickering Walker, Charles Bernard Schmitt.”While the studies of Scott and Festugière had no direct relation toRenaissance research, and Kristeller touched upon the questions of Renais-sance magic only peripherally, Yates broadened Walker’s rather narrowlydefined scope of interest and placed magic in the wider contexts of earlymodern cultural history. She also intended to give a general explanation forthis rather surprising phenomenon and, while doing so, came to far-reaching"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"45The Sources of Renaissance Magicconclusions that called for a radical reinter pretation of the history ofRenaissance science and intellectual development. Her significance in thereintegration of the Hermetica into early modern intellectual history wascorrectly summarized by Brian Copenhaver as follows:accepting Festugière’s analysis and calling ‘the critical and historicalproblem of the Hermetic literature [. . .] irrelevant [because . . .] theywould have been entirely unknown to Ficino and his readers,’ Yatesmade ‘the great Egyptian illusion’ and the chronological misconcep-tions eventually resolved by Casaubon [the] major themes of her study,which focuses on figures of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,from Ficino through Bruno and somewhat beyond. [. . .] Needless tosay, the Hermetica soon became required reading for many students ofearly modern thought and letters whose interests were otherwise quitefar from the fascinating puzzles of Hellenistic, Roman, and Egyptianreligion and philosophy. (1992, lviii–lix)Yates’ understanding of hermeticism was closely related to Walker’sthesis, according to which the philosophy of Ficino encouraged a newinterpretation of magic, drawing inspiration, as in contrast to medievalmagic, from Hellenistic occultism. Apart from Plato, Ficino’s readingsconsisted of Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Proclus, and the laterneoplatonist Psellus—and also the hermetic treatises, Pythagorean numbermysticism, Chaldean and Sybilline oracles, and Orphic hymns, all of whichtogether constituted an ancient prisca theologia that was considered to beas authentic and valuable as the biblical revelation. This was the philologi-cal error of Ficino and his contemporaries: namely that they turned withthe greatest reverence to textual materials that, by and large, were not olderthan the Hellenistic culture of the second and third centuries.This is why Ficino tired in his attempt to reconcile Christianity andthe neoplatonic-hermetic tradition. Thus his neoplatonism was moretheology (as shown by the title of his Theologia Platonica) than naturalphilosophy, and consequently his demonology, astrology and magic mustalso be interpreted from a religious perspective.According to Walker, as a result of Ficino’s theological outlook,Renaissance magic developed in two directions: partly into an entirely“white,” in Walker’s terminology, spiritual magic, and partly into a morecomplex demonic magic, which, from the viewpoint of Christian dogmas,was of more heterodox nature. In this second tradition—which includedauthors such as Trithemius and Agrippa—the use of Hellenistic-neoplatonicsources was complemented by other, more medieval, elements of magic."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"46JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMContinuing Walker’s investigations, Frances Yates found the impact ofthe hermetic texts prevailing in Ficino’s works, to which the Florentinephilosopher’s younger colleague, Pico della Mirandola, added elements ofJewish cabala. From this dual heritage issued the special ideology that Yatescalled the “hermetic tradition” (see also Copenhaver’s summary, 1988, 79–83; and 1990). According to Yates, this hermeticism not only contributedto the formation of the Renaissance image of man, but also to the evolu-tion of the Scientific Revolution. Needless to say, this claim presented agreat challenge to those science historians who, brought up in schoolsbased on the Cartesian cogito, were eagerly looking in each and everyepoch only for signs of progress towards the final victory of rationalism.As well as the challenge to the history of science challenge, anotheraspect of the Yates thesis concerned the importance of the hermetic tra-dition to the development of Renaissance philosophy. Yates asserted thatamong the followers of Ficino, hermeticism became a coherent hermetic-cabalistic system that evolved into a religious trend offering an alternativeway to individual purification and self-redemption. This reformed occultphilosophy provided a higher prestige to that kind of magic which, in thefifteenth century, emerged from a suspect, semi-legal status to a disciplinethat could give important impetus to the examination of nature and tothe conducting of daring experiments.6Due to the so-called hermeticism debate inspired by the Yates-thesis,our understanding of Renaissance magic is now much more refined thanthe propositions of Dame Frances themselves were thirty-five years ago.We must not forget, however, that this improvement has in no small partresulted from her often contradictory stimulation. All of those scholarswho have been working on the correction of Yates’s sometimes exagger-ated and simplified ideas were, after all, inspired by her to accomplisha complex and interdisciplinary task, which has been furnishing newresults ever since.It was also Frances Yates who located Dee in the context of Renais-sance hermeticism and, in fact, pinpointed him as being the prototype ofthe Rosicrucian magus. This rather schematic Dee image has been radi-cally augmented during the past fifteen years; however Yates’s insistencethat the natural philosophy of Renaissance magic cannot be fully appre-ciated without a careful assessment of neoplatonic and hermetic occult-ism is still a pertinent admonition to Dee scholars.In the following subchapters I shall revisit those source materials ofRenaissance magic that—according to our present knowledge—led the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"47The Sources of Renaissance MagicFlorentine neoplatonists to include magic as an important ingredient oftheir Christian-humanist ideology.Hermetic MagicThe manuscript (now known as the Florence MS Laurentianus 71, 33)given by the Macedonian monk to Ficino was a fourteenth-century copyof fourteen short treatises that the Florentine philosopher translated andin 1471 published under the title Mercurii Trismegisti Liber de Potestateet Sapientia Dei, e Græco in Latinum traductus à Marsilio Ficino...Tarvisii.As the first discourse was called Poimandres, Ficino titled the whole col-lection of the Corpus hermeticum “Pimander” (Ficino 1576, 1836; Garin1988, 15–20; Yates 1964, 14 ff.).Following his usual habit, the translator prefixed an Argumentum tothe texts in which he displayed the genealogy of Hermes Trismegistus andasserted his date to be identical with that of Moses. He concluded fromthis “fact” that the wisdom of Hermes was part of the same divine rev-elation as the canonized texts of the Old Testament. He justified his viewby citing the affirmative opinion of the early Christian writer Lactantius,whose approval, in his view, well balanced Augustinus’ condemnation ofanother hermetic text, that of the Asclepius.7The first treatise of Ficino’s translation introduces the divinePoimandres (spirit of the unlimited power, that is Nous) who appears toHermes Trismegistus in his dream. The Thrice Great Prophet requestshim as follows:“I wish to learn about the things that are, to understand their natureand to know god.” I said. Then he [Poimandres] said to me: “Keep inmind all that you wish to learn, and I will teach you.” Saying this, hechanged his appearence, and in an instant everything was immediatelyopened to me. I saw an endless vision in which everything becamelight—clear and joyful—and in seeing the vision I came to love it. (CH1.3–4; quoted in Copenhaver 1992, 1).This situation is well known in the literature of mysticism: the nar-rator receives inspiration in a trance-like state and communicates withthe transcendental world through intuitive revelation. In the vocabularyofPoimandres, the expressions of light and shadow, enlightenment andradiation, dominate:"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"48JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMAfter a little while darknesse arose separately and descended—fearfuland gloomy—coiling sinuously so that it looked to me like a snake.Then the darkness changed into something of a watery nature, inde-scribably agitated and smoking like a fire. [. . .] But from the light [. . .]a holy word mounted upon the watery nature, and untempered fireleapt up from the watery nature to the height above. (ibid.)Apart from the conflicting interpretations of textual scholarship (Copenhaver1992, 97–102), in more general terms the orchestration of this treatiserecalls Plato’s world of ideas, the neoplatonic doctrine of emanation, andalso Genesis in the Bible. Could this syncretic approach have inspired JohnDee in his craving for omniscience through divine revelation? He certainlyhad several versions of the Corpus hermeticum in his library (see note 15below) and the mystical-epistemological tour of the soul was not alien tohis own program. In connection with a desire for knowledge, Dee was alsointerested in the primordial beginnings: the mythology of creation, theGolden Age, and the question of Fall and rebirth prominently feature inhis angelic conversations (Dee 1659, 92 ff.).According to Poimandres, the elements of nature have arisen “fromthe counsel of god, which, having taken in the word and having seen thebeautiful cosmos, imitated it” (I.8). The actual creator thus was not theMind [nous], but rather by his spoken word [logos] he gave birth to aSecond Mind [demiourgos]. This craftsman-like creator in turn createdseven governors who “encompass the sensible world in circles” (I.9).As the Hungarian classical philologist Tamás Adamik notes, thegenre of Poimandres is a vision with an unmistakably characteristicstructure (Adamik 1997, 177). It is introduced by the appearance ofPoimandres and Hermes’ address to him; then follows a three-part rev-elation. After the story of the creation of the cosmos (4–11), man’screation is recounted (12–23). In spite of similarities with Genesis, inPoimandres man is endowed with much greater power than Adam. Itseems as if this man could receive even the fruit of the Tree of Knowl-edge—and without any punishment!Mind, the Father of all, who is life and light, gave birth to a man likehimself whom he loved as his own child. The man was most fair: hehad the father’s image; and god, who was really in love with his ownform, bestowed on him all his craftworks. And after the man hadobserved what the craftsman had created with the father’s help, he alsowished to make some craftwork, and the father agreed to this. Enteringthe craftsman’s sphere, where he was to have all authority, the man"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"49The Sources of Renaissance Magicobserved his brother’s craftworks; the governors loved the man, andeach gave a share of his own order. (1.12–3)After this, man “broke through” into the vault of the created world and,when he looked at his own image in the earthly waters, came to like itand wished to stay there. Nature thus “took hold of her beloved, huggedhim all about and embraced him, for they were lovers” (1.14). Man thusremained on the earth as part of nature, but he also preserved in himselfthe original, divine constitution. Because of this, his character is uniquelydual, different from all other creatures:Because of this, unlike any other living thing on earth, mankind istwofold—in the body mortal but immortal in the essential man. Eventhough he is immortal and has authority over all things, mankind isaffected by mortality because he is subject to fate. (1.15)Anthropology then is followed by eschatology (24–26): Poimandres ad-vises Hermes about how he can perfect himself in striving to ascend tohigher and higher spheres. The first recommendation is to adhere toasceticism. As a result, the human being rises up through the cosmicframework, through seven zones, surrendering the psychological muzzlesof material existence, from evil machinations and arrogance to reckless-ness and deceit. Due to the teachings of Poimandres, Hermes also per-ceives that the fate of man is not death, since he might have power togain immortality. He also recognizes that humanity is sleeping in igno-rance and that it may be his mission to wake them up and spread thenew wisdom:Then he [Poimandres] sent me forth, empowered and instructed on thenature of the universe and on the supreme vision, after I had giventhanks to the father of all and praised him. And I began proclaimingto mankind the beauty of reverence and knowledge. (1.27)Here there is apparent a compelling genealogy in the hermetic writ-ings, transmitted through Ficino to John Dee. In the Hermetica manappears to be a close relative, a brother of the craftsman-demiurge, andhis wisdom combines reverence and knowledge that could be paraphrasedas theology and science. Although the theoretical Hermetica does notfeature overt magical elements (cf. Copenhaver 1992, xxxiii; Festugière1967, 59–60; Fowden 1986, 57–75), I believe that Yates was right inpresuming that the Renaissance philosophers—and Dee certainly among"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"50JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthem—were attracted by the potential combination of miraculous deedsand spiritual exaltation. An illuminating proof of this expectation mightbe a hitherto unnoticed remark in Ficino’s argumentum to the Pimander:Among philosophers he [Trismegistus] first turned from physical andmathematical topics to contemplation of things divine, and he was thefirst to discuss with great wisdom the majesty of God, the order ofdemons, and the transformation of souls. Thus he was called the firstauthor of theology. . . . (Ficino 1576, 1836; translated in Copenhaver1992, xiviii)Here Ficino sets up a taxonomy of wisdom that displays a dualism ofscience and theology but at the same time acknowledges a dynamism, anevolution from the first to the second. No doubt, Ficino envisionedhimself moving along this line (cf. Allen 1994, 97–100), and as we shallsee, Dee’s intellectual history can be described in the same paradigm:“from science to magic,” the highest form of which was no longer a setof active operations [magia naturalis], but rather a conscious and openreception of the divine revelation—“conversations with the angels” aboutthe majesty of God and the transformation of the soul.The thirteen tracts following Poimandres constitute a heterogeneousmix of tone, language, and philosophy. They are, however, connected byrecurring characters (Nous, Hermes, Agathodaimon, Asclepius, Ammon,Tat, and Isis), a loose Egyptian framework (for some scholars a meredecoration, for others part of the synthetised traditions), and a looselydefined hermeticism that, according to Festugière, was no more than “acertain turn of mind that lies in bending every philosophical inquiry inthe direction of piety and knowledge of God” (1967, 39).The study of the original hermetic lore has developed during the pasttwo decades as much as (if not more than) Dee studies. Copenhaver givesan admirably concise and clear account of the divers conflicting conceptsand traditions amalgamated here: theoretical and technical, contempla-tive and pragmatic, religious and magical, literary and cultic, gnostic,Greek, and Egyptian (Copenhaver 1992, lviii). In spite of this criticalvariety, except for Reitzenstein who voted for a definite Egyptian origin,the first modern textual editors and interpreters such as Scott, Nock, andFestugière all thought that the hermetic literature by and large consistedof eclectic, late Hellenistic Greek philosophy with traces of Judaism andeven less Zoroastrianism. Festugière sharply differentiated between opti-mist and pessimist gnosis on the one hand, and between theoretical and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"51The Sources of Renaissance Magicpopular hermetica on the other. His views remained so dominating afterthe publication of his “monumental deposit of hermetic studies”(Copenhaver’s expression, cf. Festugière 1950–1954; 1954; 1967; 1972)that an occasion to improve them could arise only with the discovery ofnew source materials, especially the Coptic Nag Hammadi texts and theArmenianDefinitions.8 This was largely done by Jean-Pierre Mahé, whoreestablished the Egyptian ancestry of the Hermetica seventy-five years after“Reitzenstein’s Egyptomania” (Copenhaver’s expression). The last weightyword in the debate was that of Garth Fowden, who—although he spokeof “the Egyptian Hermes”—managed to establish a golden mean betweenthe extreme positions of Festugière and Mahé. The strength of his case liesin his caveat concerning the characteristics of a syncretic culture in whichthe individual elements are not easy to separate.Since I am interested in the possible impact of hermetic thought onRenaissance occultism and particularly on John Dee’s philosophy, thislater development of hermetic studies is of less importance. From amethodological aspect, however, the strong commitment of Fowden andCopenhaver to syncretism will be very important.Although Copenhaver emphasized that the magical aspects of the theo-retical Hermetica are insignificant compared to the astrological-alchemicalmagic of the practical or technical tracts that were never considered integralparts of the Corpus hermeticum (1992, xxxii), he himself recalled that thelack of magic in the Corpus may reflect more the biases of later editors thanthose of the authors. William Grese pointed out the same: “It is not knownwhen the collection was made, why it was made, or what was excluded.The lack of more references to magical practices may reflect more theselection of texts that have survived than the actual situation in antiquity”(Grese 1988, 49). At this point, it may be useful to recall some furthernotices of Copenhaver. In harmony with Frances Yates (1964, 40 ff.),Copenhaver also acknowledged the magical importance of the “god-making”passages of the Asclepius (23–24, 37–38), furthermore he emphasized that“instead of a theory of magic, the theoretical Hermetica present a theory ofsalvation through knowledge or gnosis, yet this theory was the product ofa culture that made no clear, rigid distinction between religion and magic”(1992, xxxvii). Finally, we should also bear in mind that neither the age ofHellenism nor the Renaissance made such a distinction between philo-sophical and technical treatises as did Festugière in calling the latter “popu-lar,” which meant inferior, in fact obscure, gibberish.Ficino and his contemporaries did not know about many of thehermetic texts now considered to be component parts of the Corpus"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMhermeticum. On the other hand, they had access to a great amount ofmagical literature deriving from the original technical hermetica, includ-ing Arabic sources, such as Al-Kindi, Abu Ma’shar, Jabir (Latinized asGeber, the alchemist), and others who spoke much about Hermes andwhose writings were accessible throughout the Middle Ages. The Tabulasmaragdina, the Picatrix, and various treatises bearing the name of Hermes(The Book of Hermes on the Six Principles of Nature,Book of Proposi-tions . . . said to be by the Philosopher Termegistus, etc.) also circulated fromthe eleventh century9 and there is no reason to think that the learnedneoplatonists would not have associated the two groups of sources thatall claimed to be revealed writings of Hermes Trismegistus.Let us now return to that text that was known to Ficino, and al-though it survived in Latin, it was not disassociated from the Greekcorpus of hermetic writings. It was the Asclepius, which had been spokenof by many classical and medieval Christian authorities and was alsomentioned by a number of medieval philosophers, such as AlbertusMagnus, Bernardus Silvestris, John of Salisbury, Alain de Lille, Vincentof Beauvais, Guillaume d’Auvergne, and others.10 This tract was oftenconsidered to be a synopsis of Egyptian religion and contained importantmagical ideas as well. It received bad and good critiques during its careeruntil Ficino and his readers—according to Frances Yates—considered it“to be the Mosaic piety of the Egyptian Genesis, and the Christian pietyof Egyptian regeneration would have rehabilitated in their eyes the Egyp-tian religion of the Asclepius” (1964, 41). She also added: “The rehabili-tation of the Asclepius, through the rediscovery of the Corpus hermeticum,is, I believe, one of the chief factors in the Renaissance revival of magic”(ibid.). It is time to look then at the magical contents of the Asclepius.The introduction of the text describes a situation when HermesTrismegistus, Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon meet in an Egyptian templewhere the four men receive exaltation and revelatory teachings throughthe mouth of Hermes on the nature of the cosmos and that of man.Scott thought the text falls into three, almost independent parts. Thefirst being a coherent, well-structured treatise on the trinity of God,the world, and man (De tota summitate: Deus, Mundus, Homo); in this thestress falls on the role of man. The second part represents dualist gnosis anddeals with the origin of evil (De origine mali). The third one is a highlycorrupted text, the leitmotif of which is the relationship between the godsand man, which is why it is usually referred to as De cultu deorum.11Ficino’s attention was caught primarily by two motives in the Asclepius.The first was its anthropocentric approach, which described man’s impor-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"53The Sources of Renaissance Magictance and potential power almost with the erudition of the humanists.The following sentences became a quasi-bible of Renaissance moral phi-losophers and provided important ideological support for magical theo-ries, too:Propter haec, o Asclepi, magnum miraculum est homo. . . —Because ofthis, Asclepius, a human being is a great wonder, a living thing to beworshipped and honored: for he changes his nature into god’s, as if hewere a god; he knows the demonic kind inasmuch as he recognizes thathe originated among them; he despises the part of him that is humannature, having put his trust in the divinity of his other part. [. . .]Everything is permitted him: heaven itself seems not too high, for hemeasures it in his clever thinking as if it were nearby. [. . .] He iseverything, and he is everywhere.—Omnia idem est, et ubique idem est.(Ascl. 6; quoted from Copenhaver 1992, 70)One of the most intriguing sections of Asclepius claims that theomnipotence of man, the possibility of his exaltatio, is proved by the factthat he himself is capable of creating living gods. As Trismegistus explains:And since this discourse proclaims to us the kinship and associationbetween humans and gods, Asclepius, you must recognize mankind’spower and strength. Just as the master and father [. . .] is maker of theheavenly gods, so is mankind who fashions the temple gods who arecontent to be near to humans. (Ascl. 23)Then we learn thatThe figures of gods that humans form have been formed of both na-tures—from the divine, which is purer and more divine by far, andfrom the material of which they are built, whose nature falls short ofthe human. [. . .] Always mindful of its nature and origin, humanitypersists in imitating divinity, representing its gods in semblence of itsown features, just as the father and master made his gods eternal toresemble him. (ibid.)As it turns out, the sage here refers to statues, not simple represen-tations, but rather “statues ensouled and conscious, filled with spirit anddoing great deeds, [. . .] statues that make people ill and cure them,bringing them pain and pleasure as each deserves” (Ascl. 24). This notionrecurs once again towards the end of the treatise:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"54JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMLet us turn again to mankind and reason, that divine gift whereby ahuman is called a rational animal. What we have said of mankind iswondrous, but less wondrous than this: it exceeds the wonderment of allwonders that humans have been able to discover the divine nature and howto make it. Our ancestors [. . .] discovered the art of making gods. To theirdiscovery they added a conformable power arising from the nature ofmatter. Because they could not make souls, they mixed this power in andcalled up the souls of demons or angels and implanted them in likenessthrough holy and divine mysteries, whence the idols could have the powerto do good and evil. (Ascl. 37)12Let us imagine what John Dee would feel if he happened to read orremembered his reading of the above passage on the holy mysteries ofcalling up the souls of demons or angels, while preparing himself for asession to meet Madimi or Nalvage. The quoted paragraphs of the Asclepiuscan be considered a very powerful statement about the exaltation of manand they indeed captured the imagination of the Renaissance philoso-phers and magi.To understand their enthusiasm, we must remember that the Renais-sance of the humanists was a retrospective epoch. As Frances Yates sug-gested, “the great forward movements of the Renaissance all derive theirvigour, their emotional impulse, from looking backwards” (1964, 1). Therevived classical view of a cyclical history—even if counterbalanced bythe eschatological linearity of Christianity—made the humanists con-stantly aware of the lost Golden Age and the need for researching andstudying the past as far back as one could reach in time.By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries more and more thinkers andscholars entertained the idea that the Golden Age could be restored onearth in the material life of humans, provided one could restore thepristine wisdom, the ancient theology. The Florentine neoplatonists weregreatly concerned with this, and one can say that no matter how ad-vanced was their new, man-centered ideology, it gained its energy througha determined search of the past, highly appreciative of everything thatwas ancient and antiquated.13Most of the humanists were engaged with a well-defined classicalheritage—that of Greco-Roman philosophy and literature. Some of them,on the other hand, tried to reach back to an antedeluvian, pristine wis-dom which they sought in Pythagorean number mysticism, the Chaldeanoracles, Jewish speculations, and Egyptian magic. One of the most es-teemed sources in this respect was the Corpus hermeticum, although muchwas to be learned from the Sybilline Oracles, the Orphic Hymns, and from"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"55The Sources of Renaissance Magicthose later commentators who in the Hellenistic era were preoccupiedwith the prisca theologia.I have already recalled the impetus that led to the hermetic interest ofFicino’s Florentine Academy, as well as the ideological background of thephilological misrepresentation by means of which they examined thesewritings as testimonies from the times of Moses. This firm belief was notshaken until 1614 when the Protestant Isaac Casaubon—interestingly, thefather of Meric, who published the documents of Dee’s spiritual magic, asystem partly derived from the Hermetica—philologically proved that thehermetic texts included biblical and Greek diction and etymologies thatdisproved their supposed ancient age.14 Preceding this denominational aswell as textual polemic, however, the sixteenth century saw the triumphantprocess of the hermetic texts: prior to 1614 Ficino’s 1471 edition wasrepublished on twenty-two occasions by various European presses, and,parallel with this, other humanist editors produced further publications. Toselect just a few representative works from Copenhaver’s list (1992, lxix),in the first half of the sixteenth century Italian, French, Dutch, and Spanishversions were published; the first Greek critical edition was prepared byTurnebus in 1554 (Mercurii Trismegisti Poemander, seu de potestate et sapientiadivina.

She devoted long passages and chapters to topics suchas the infamous medieval magical primer, the Picatrix, and its possibleinfluence on Ficino. But she interpreted Ficino’s magic as something thatturned away from this “rude and primitive” medieval inheritance andelevated magic onto a prestigeous level, justified by the scholarly andphilosophical apparatus of neoplatonist humanism (1964, 80, 108).It must be recognized that Yates was simplifying when she postulateda sharp dichotomy between medieval and Renaissance magic, since themedieval lore, at least a large portion of it, was nothing but a derivationof the classical heritage incubated by Arabic schools. She was also reluc-tant to see that Ficino, when he had interpreted magic enveloped into thehumanist ideology, had also relied on the praxis of medieval magic, andhis operations with talismans, for example, were not necessarily less primi-tive or naive than that of his medieval predecessors.Let us now have a quick look at the magical ideas of the so-calledPlatonici, a textual heritage that also featured abundantly in John Dee’slibrary17 but received comparably the smallest attention from Yates andthe Yatesian interpretation of Renaissance magic. Since my main concernhere is the theme of exaltatio in relation to magical practice, I shallconcentrate on those passages that presupposed, described, and eventu-ally approved magical practices in order to come—as Proclus put it—“todirectly experience the Primordial and Divine Powers” (De sacrificio etmagia, quoted in Iamblichus 1989, 149).Those who considered themselves true philosophers have alwaysspoken with contempt of magic as something that is contrary to reason-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"57The Sources of Renaissance Magicable thinking and suits only the ignorant mob. Plato and his followers,such as Plotinus, were no exceptions to this attitude. It is easy to findpassages in their works that condemn or ridicule magic and mysticalrituals.18 Still, as Brian Copenhaver claimed, “if one wishes to find thephilosophical and scientific roots of Renaissance magical theory—as dis-tinguished from the genealogy of the magus—one looks not to the eclec-tic pieties of Hermes Trismegistus but to the neoplatonists” (1988, 84).As we have already seen with the help of Edgar Wind’s explanations(see pg. 23), some elements in Plato’s mysticism led to a development inphilosophy inclining towards the reintegration of dialectics and religionand turned the philosopher into a hierophant. Although Iamblichus iscredited as having fathered the first comprehensive scheme of occultphilosophy (see Ronan’s introduction in Iamblichus 1989, 4), most of theHellenistic philosophers, beginning with Plotinus, became sensitive toissues of the reversed emanation, that is, the ascension of man and thecatalyzing of this ascension by magical means. The latter intention wasof course connected with their concepts of demons and demonology,which is by no means an easy subject in relation to the philosophicalschools of the Hellenistic period.There is no place here to give a comprehensive survey of classicaldemonology or the scholarly literature written on the subject; let it beenough to mention that the whole history of neoplatonism was ambiguousin this respect, and Plato was no exception. He often spoke of the gods,but the nature of his gods can be understood in several ways. P. Merlan (inArmstrong 1995, 32 ff.) distinguishes among three possible interpretations:that the gods are used as myths or literary devices, or that they are deri-vations of the first principles, or that they are theologized, personifiedversions of the principles. In Plotinus, the second hypostasis (i.e., the tran-scendent source of reality) contains ideas, intellects, and gods. The questionof demons arose in connection with the problem of evil; according to Platoand Plotinus, the One could not contain anything corrupt, so evil came tobeing through the imperfections of the emanations.The demon world, however, soon became heterogeneous, accommo-dating various sorts of spirits. Plato spoke of demons in connection withthedaimón of Socrates, and in the Symposium attributed a whole systemof demonology to Socrates’ teacher, Diotima (202e–203a). It is worthquoting from these passages because the wise woman gave quite an ex-tended classification of spirits with functions that have important reso-nances in the history of magic:"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"58JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM[Diotima]...spirits, you know, are half-way between god and man.[. . .] They are the envoys and interpreters that ply between heaven andearth, flying upward with our worship and our prayers, and descendingwith the heavenly answers and commandments, and since they arebetween the two estates they weld both sides together and merge theminto one great whole. They form the medium of the prophetic arts, ofthe priestly rites of sacrifice, initiation, and incantation, of divinationand of sorcery, for the divine will not mingle directly with the human,and it is only through the mediation of the spirit world that man canhave any intercourse, whether waking or sleeping, with the gods. Andthe man who is versed in such matters is said to have spiritual powers,as opposed to the mechanical powers of the man who is expert in themore mundane arts. There are many spirits and many kinds of spirits,too. . . . (203a, Plato 1963, 555)Preceding the above explanation, Diotima is said to have accomplisheda magical act that would later accord with Agrippa’s description of themighty magus, commanding the governing powers of nature: “a womanwho was deeply versed in many [. . .] fields of knowledge. It was she whobrought about a ten years’ postponement of the great plague of Athenson the occasion of certain sacrifice . . .” (201d).It was Xenocrates, who, expanding Plato’s notions on demons, estab-lished a dichotomy between good and evil spirits. He also set up a tri-partite hierarchy of these beings: some had simply always existed as de-mons; a second class consisted of souls of men that, after death, hadseparated from their bodies, becoming demons; the third category con-sisted of souls, still remaining in the body (Armstrong 1995, 35).Plotinus followed Xenocrates’ typology (Enneads III.4–5) and at onepoint, in spite of his general scepticism concerning interaction with spir-its, even asserted that demons can be invoked:Even the Celestials, the Daimones, are not on their unreasoning sideimmune: there is nothing against ascribing acts of memory and expe-riences of sense to them, in supposing them to accept the traction ofmethods laid up in the natural order, and to give hearing topetitioners . . . (IV.4.43, Plotinus 1991, 330)TheEnneads, of course, have many intriguing passages concerning thestate of exaltatio and man’s intercourse wih the Deity as well as with de-mons. The most cited passages can be found in IV.4, which is titled by"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"59The Sources of Renaissance MagicPorphyry as “Questions Concerning the Soul, II.” Here Plotinus examinesthe upward journey of the soul in relation to the nature of the universe,which he describes as a homogeneous and organic unity filled with andruled by correspondences. In sections 30–31 he raises the problem ofastrology of which he had a generally derogatory opinion. He certainlydenied that the stars, as higher intelligences, would have memory or sen-sation; on the other hand, he did not exclude the possibility that the starscould have an influence on human destiny. This would result from theorganic nature of the cosmos being filled with occult correspondences. “Ourproblem embraces all act and all experience throughout the entire Cosmos—whether due to nature, or effected by art,” says Plotinus (IV.4.31) and in thefollowing sections he describes the World Soul (One-All) that isa sympathetic total and stands as one living being; the far is near; ithappens as in one animal with its separate parts: talon, horn, finger,and any other member are not continuous and yet are effectively near;intermediate parts feel nothing, but at a distant point the local expe-rience is known. (4.32, Plotinus 1991, 319)Since this united cosmos is ruled by order and harmony (following theordinance of numbers), “The Universe is immensely varied, [. . .] it mustcontain an untellably wonderful variety of powers, with which, of course,the bodies moving through the heavens will be most richly endowed”(4.36). True magic follows from this order, it is “the primal mage andsourcerer—discovered by men who thenceforth turn those same ensorcella-tions and magic arts upon one another” (4.40).Plotinus was definitely cautious in his assessment of magic. The onlynotion he accepted without reservation was the universal correspondences,which, at least indirectly, admitted the concept of sympathetic magic.Speaking about these sympathies, he stated that “the prayer is answeredby the mere fact that part and other part are wrought to one tone likea musical string which, plucked at one end, vibrates at the other also”(4.41), and thatthe art of doctor or magic healer will compel some one contre topurvey something of its own power to another centre. Just so the All:it purveys spontaneously, but it purveys also under spell; a petitionbrings to some one part the power laid up for each: the All gives to itsmembers by a natural act, and the petitioner is no alien. (IV.4.42,Plotinus 1991, 329)"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"60JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMFicino later made use of his ideas to develop the method of talismanicmagic in De vita coelitus comparanda.19In Enneads IV.3 there is a much discussed paragraph that seems toconnect Plotinus to the magic described in the hermetic Asclepius, namelyhis interpretation of supposed human potential to create living gods:Those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beingsby the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the natureof the All; they perceived that , though this Soul is everywhere trac-table, its presence will be secured all the more readily when an appro-priate receptacle is elaborated, a place especially capable of receivingsome portion or phase of it, something reproducing it, or representingit and serving like a mirror to catch an image of it. (IV.3.11, Plotinus1991, 264)Although most historians of philosophy deny Plotinus’ involvementin magical practices and few ascribe any great importance to the Egyptian-Persian influence in his philosophy, the above passages could easily catchthe attentive but philologically less sharpened eyes of Renaissance think-ers, such as Ficino or even John Dee. One should add, that in Porphyry’sfamousLife of Plotinus which was known and used throughout the earlymodern period, some of the biographical data could support the conjec-tures concerning a syncretic Plotinian-hermetic-oriental derivation oftheprisca theologia, comparable to the methods of the pious magi of theRenaissance.To begin with, Porphyry argues that the first teacher of whom Plotinusreally approved was the Alexandrian sage Ammonius. Although next tonothing is known about his philosophy (Armstrong 1995, 196 ff.), he,as a teacher, had also been associated with the philosophical sect ofhermeticists. As Garth Fowden recently suggested, in the second andthird centuries of the Roman Empire, a characteristic intellectual elitecrystallized that was educated in Greek philosophy but had becomedissatisfied with pure philosophizing. They formed small sects that trans-mitted oral teachings and Ammonius Saccas might have been the leaderof such a group (Fowden 1986, 112–29). According to Fowden,Ammonius represented that common denomintor from which Plotinusdeveloped a systematic philosophical doctrine while the supposed her-metic groups produced only fragments, accidentally surviving products ofmystical contemplation bordering on theosophy and religion. The figureof Ammonius may be a symbolic embodiment of the overlap betweenhermeticism and neoplatonism as well as within hermeticism between"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"61The Sources of Renaissance Magicphilosophical and technical writings as has been pointed out in recentscholarly literature (see Grese 1988).One should also note another similarity between Hellenistic neo-platonism and hermeticism: Scott and Festugière both pointed out whatshouldnot be looked for in the Hermetica. There is neither a canonizedbody of texts preserving the revelation of God, nor any traces of theurgicpractice, that is, a set of rites and sacramentalism (cf. Scott 1924–1936,1:7). These shortages interestingly coincide with what Armstrongcharacterised as Plotinus’ mystical “religion”: “There is no place in it forrites or sacraments, nor are there any methods of prayer or meditation ordevices for concentrating and liberating the mind such as are used by boththeistic and non-theistic mystics” (Armstrong 1995, 260).Let us return to Porphyry’s Life. He furthermore informs the readerthat Plotinus became so interested in Eastern, Persian, and Indian phi-losophy that he undertook to participate in Emperor Gordian III’s cam-paign against the Persians (ch. 3). Although this episode is dismissed byArmstrong with claims that “his thought is entirely explainable as a personaldevelopment of Greek philosophy, without any need to postulate Orien-tal influences” (1995, 200), two other incidents shed light on a moresyncretic nature and eventual magical practices in the master’s life. Inchapter 10 of Porphyry’s Life we learn that Plotinus’ only enemy, Olympiusof Alexandria, had tried to practice star magic against the master butPlotinus had such a strong soul power that the harmful magic reboundedon Olympius, who then stopped his machinations. According to theother episode (related in the same chapter) once an Egyptian priest cameto Rome and offered to invoke Plotinus’ personal daimón. When Plotinusagreed, they went to the Iseum and the Egyptian conjured up the spirit,who, to the amazement of the participants, turned out to be a real god.The priest told Plotinus, “You are singularly graced; the guiding-spiritwithin you is not of the lower degree but a God” (ch. 10, Porphyry 1991,cx). The séance was unfortunately interrupted because a jealous helperstrangled the apotropaic fowls used in the divination, so no conversationcould ensue with the protecting god. Still, Plotinus himself remained soimpressed, that he wrote a treatise “On Our Allotted Guardian Spirit”(Enneads, III.4). Although these episodes do not undeniably prove thatPlotinus himself ever performed magical ceremonies, they certainly mayhave kindled the fantasy of the Renaissance readers of Porphyry’s Life andcould have contributed to the concepts of early modern demonology.20Among the followers of Plotinus, it was Iamblichus of Chalcis (242/3–325A.D.) who developed a systematic occult philosophy. His philo-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"62JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMsophical thought was characterized by a new approach to religion, asA. C. Lloyd formulated it: “to describe the change in anthropologicalterms—it was no longer merely the myth which was regarded as philo-sophically relevant but the ritual” (1995, 277). Copenhaver referred tohim and the tendency he represented noting that “a Syrian writing inGreek could embrace with the word philosophy a body of practical,religious literature that bore little trace of the rational analysis still im-plied by \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0005\u0002\u0003\u0007” (1988, 83). However this can hardly belittle hisstriving to grasp the essence of exaltatio in terms that would suit bothintellectual thinking and intuitive enlightenment. This theurgy was notonly to unite philosophy and religion, but also receptive contemplationand active magic. As Lloyd recalled Bidez’s classic observation, “the ap-pellation was intended ‘to go one better than the theologian and remindpeople that the theurgist does not limit himself to talking about the godsbut knows how to act.’ ”21To Plotinus’ neoplatonism Iamblichus added elements of Egyptianmysticism, or at least what was thought to be Egyptian mysticism, andhe also became interested in the Chaldean tradition. As a consequence,he adopted the view that the religious activities of the initiates were moreeffective than those of philosophers. This was quite a sharp turn from thestandpoint of his predecessors in neoplatonist philosophy who rankedintellectual inquiry and the enlightenment resulting from it either as thegoal of life or at least the best means to it (cf. Lloyd 1995, 295 ff.). Thisdebate can best be seen in the controversy between Iamblichus andhis immediate predecessor, Porphyry: Iamblichus’ main theological-philosophical work De mysteriis was in fact an answer to Porphyry’s Letterto Anebo, a rather sceptical work, denying that the practice of theurgicrites could lead to salvation. Iamblichus’ views expressed in De mysteriiscorroborate the common perception that he was not only a deeply reli-gious philosopher but also a clairvoyant, who claimed to have raisedphantoms by the intervention of the gods. His consideration about themutually interrelated nature of knowledge and intuitive revelation (aunion with the deity, i.e. exaltatio) runs as follows, undoubtedly suggest-ing the superiority of intuition over reason:You may not think all the authority of the energy in theurgic operationsis in our power, and that you may not suppose the true work of themconsists in our conceptions. [. . .] Nevertheless, efficacious union [withdivine natures] is not effected without knowledge; yet knowledge doesnot possess a sameness with this union. (II.11, Iamblichus 1989, 62)22"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"63The Sources of Renaissance MagicHe treated daemons and spirits quite extensively throughout his work andsaw them as important engines of revelation and catalyzers of the union:may it not be natural to divinity to extend a phantasm from itself? Buthow can that which is firmly established in itself, and which is thecause of essence and truth, produce in a foreign seat a certain deceitfulimitation of itself? By no means, therefore, does divinity either trans-form himself into phantasms, nor extend these from himself to otherthings, but emits, by illumination, true representations of himself, inthe true manners of the souls. (II.10, 61)One can easily imagine Dee’s thrill when he encountered the followingpassage in De mysteriis:A god, an angel, and a good daemon instruct man in what their properessence consists. [. . .] Angels and daemons always receive truth fromthe Gods, so that they never assert any thing contrary to this. . . .(II.10, 59)The functioning of a spirit contact is explained in one of the next chap-ters. This is again something John Dee could adopt as important guide-lines for his own “angelic conversations”:He who [appears to] draw down a certain divinity, sees a spirit descend-ing and entering into some one, recognizes its magnitude and quality,and is also mystically persuaded and governed by it. (III.6, 69)In the rest of the work Iamblichus surveys various modes of divina-tion, such as incantations, specific inspirations, and touching dead bod-ies, and devotes lengthy chapters to weighing the possibilities of astrol-ogy, that is, the influence of the stars on individual lives and the ways ofgetting to know this influence. A part of his work corresponding to thetypology of divination is the typology of sacrifices. These sacrifices are thetrue catalyzers of exaltatio that help to attain a state in which divinationcan be successful. His definition of true enthusiasm is the following:“There is a time when we become wholly soul, are out of the body, andsublimely revolve on high, in conjunction with all the immaterial Gods”(V.15, 114). As we shall see, this definition not only corresponds with theaspirations of Plato, Plotinus, and the unknown author(s) of the Corpushermeticum, but also with that of the Renaissance magi, most eloquently"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"64JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMexpressed in Pico’s encomium, but also echoed in Dee’s various writings,including his Mathematicall Praeface.Before concluding this subchapter on the classical traditions of magic,one more name must be mentioned, that of Proclus, who in recent researchincreasingly features as a possible major source for Renaissance magic.Proclus (410/12–485 A.D.) is perhaps the best known among thefourth- and fifth-century neoplatonists of Athens. He came from Con-stantinople via Alexandria to the seat of Plato and studied under Plutarchof Athens and Syrianus, becoming acquainted with Orphic and Chaldeantheology, too. In spite of the expansion of the, by now, official andenforced Christianity, he remained a defender of pagan worship, evenfollowed the Chaldean rituals and observed the Egyptian holy days (Lloyd1995, 304 ff.). It is no surprise that he was also believed to have beenable to conjure up luminous phantoms and spirits, just as his predeces-sors Plotinus and Iamblichus did. Although he left behind a voluminouscorpus of philosophical writings (including the Elements of Theology anda series of commentaries on various books of Plato), for the moment,however, only two small fragments are of interest, those directly dealingwith divination and magic.The first had been known only in Ficino’s Latin translation (whichthe Italian called “Proculi opusculum de sacrificio interprete MarsilioFicino Florentino”) until Joseph Bidez unearthed the Greek original andpublished it in the sixth volume of his Catalogue des manuscrits alchimiquesGrecs.23 Recently two English translations of the Greek original wereproduced by Brian Copenhaver (1988) and Stephen Ronan (1989).Copenhaver also prepared a superb edition of Ficino’s Latin24 and in-cluded Bidez’s Greek text making a complex comparison possible. Theother fragment has been preserved in Michael Psellus’ Accusation againstMichael Cerularius before the Synod and has recently been translated byStephen Ronan under the title “On the Signs of Divine Possession.”25Although two very short fragments, they offer a condensed syncreticessence of classical (that is, Hellenistic-neoplatonic) magical conceptswithout excluding the occult notions of the Hermetica. One of the mainthemes of the first fragment is the notion of sympathy, likeness, andanalogy, which provides the framework for the workings of occult corre-spondences as well as for the practice of magic:So by observing such things and connecting them to the appropriateheavenly beings, the ancient wise men brought divine powers into theregion of mortals, attracting them through likeness. For likeness is sufficientto join beings to one another. (lines 17–20, Proclus 1988, 103)"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"65The Sources of Renaissance MagicThe organic system of the universe is asserted by the statement ofline 46: “Thus all things are full of gods. . . .” The theoretical frameworkis connected with the occult practices invented by mankind: “Theauthorities on the priestly art have thus discovered how to gain the favorof powers above, mixing some things together and setting others apart indue order” (lines 70–73, Proclus 1988, 105).This process was the case inalchemy, as is well known, but Proclus also employed it to account forthe creation of living statues of gods, as we have already learnt from theAsclepius.26 Proclus also touches upon ritual or ceremonial magic. Hementions that through consecrations and other divine services people“achieved association with the [daemons], from whom they returnedforthwith to actual works of the gods” (lines 92–93, 105).Copenhaver’s impressive philological inquiry (1988) has proved thatthe examples of natural and ceremonial magic mentioned in Proclus’fragment can be encountered in most authorities of Renaissance magic,especially in the works of Ficino and Agrippa. Thus he has convincinglyestablished Proclus’ magical treatises among the sourceworks of Renais-sance occultism.The other fragment in Psellus’ paraphrase (as published in É. desPlaces’ Oracles Chaldaiques) touches upon the “physiology” of exaltatio,that is, the sacred enragement, and connects it with the evocation ofspirits. As Psellus sums up, Proclus claims thatthere are men who are possessed and who receive a divine spirit. Somereceive it spontaneously, like those who are said to be ‘seized by God’either at certain periods or intermittently and on occasion. There areothers who work themselves up into a state of inspiration by deliberateaction. In order for a Theagogy and an inspiration to take effect, theymust be accompanied by a change of consciousness. (Proclus 1989, 150)When divine inspiration comes, there are cases where the possessed becomecompletely beside themselves and unconscious; others, conversely, showremarkable strength. His last advice suggests that it is “necessary to beginby removing all the obstacles blocking the arrival of the Gods and toimpose an absolute calm around ourselves in order that the manifestationof the spirits we invoke takes place withoult tumult and in peace” (ibid.).kAlthough the neoplatonist philosophers hardly ever mentioned the her-metic texts and vice versa, and, consequently, most students of the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMHermetica have been reluctant to see a direct neoplatonic influence in thetexts, one must admit that the two traditions were not so separate andirreconcilable as first appears. I would like to refer to two textual in-stances that corroborate this view, one from Iamblichus’ De mysteriis, theother from the practice of the late enthusiastic follower, the Renaissanceneoplatonist Marsilio Ficino.As for Iamblichus, he reflected on Porphyry’s wry remark that Egyp-tian wisdom is basically Hellenistic philosophy (see the Letter to Anebo,VIII.35–38 in Porphyry 1989, 19) by drawing a detailed parallel betweenthe two:For the books which are circulated under the name of Hermes con-tain Hermaic opinions, though they frequently employ the languageof the philosophers: for they were translated from the Egyptian tongueby men who were not unskilled in philosophy. [. . .] The Egyptiansdo not say that all things are physical. For they separate the life of thesoul and the intellectual life from nature, not only in the universe butalso in us. [. . .] They likewise arrange the Demiurgus as the primaryfather of things in generation; and they acknowledge the existence ofa vital power, prior to the heavens, and subsisting in the heavens.(Ibid. VIII.4, 132–33)27A particularly interesting aspect of the above section is that Iamblichusrefers not only to the theoretical hermetica here, but also mentions thetechnical aspects, including astrology, the interpretation of the zodiac, thedecans, and naming the leading planets.Iamblichus’ approach suggests that later neoplatonists in fact did notsee the Hermetica and their own philosophy as isolated from each other,as many modern intellectual historians have suggested. In the fifteenthcentury, in setting himself to revive the pagan achievements of neoplatonism,Ficino certainly thought likewise. He, for example, found it very appropri-ate to unite the two traditions, namely the philosophy of emanations andthe spirit-lore of the Platonici on the one hand and the mythology ofexaltatio drawn from the Corpus hermeticum on the other. It was not co-incidental that he decided to expand his Hermetica translation into ananthology of neoplatonic mysticism, the contents of which were preservedin Ficino’s Opera as follows: “Dionysii Areopagitae translatio cum suisargumentis” (Ficino 1576, 2:1–1128); “In divinum Platonem epitomae”(1129–1533); “In Plotinum Philosophum ex Platonici familia nati” (1534–1800); “Expositio Prisciavi & Marsilii Theophrastum defenso, ac phantasia,& intellectu” (1801–1835); “Mercurii Trismegisti Pymander, de potestate"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"67The Sources of Renaissance Magicac sapientia Dei item Asclepius de voluntate dei” (1836–1870); “Iamblichusde mysteriis Aegyptiorum, Chaldeorum, atque Assiriorum” (1873–1907);“Proclus de anima & daemonum [commentariis in Alcibiadem Platonisprimum]” (1908–1928); “Proclus de sacrificio & magia” (1928–1929);“Porphyrius de occasionibus sive causis ad intelligibilia nos ducensibus”(1929–1932); “Porphyrius de abstinentia animalium [de animi ascenta &descenta]” (1932–1938); “Psellus de daemonibus” (1939–1944); “Pithagoreaurea verba & symbola” (1978–1979).Here one finds those late neoplatonists (Iamblichus, Proclus,Porphyrius, Psellus) whom Brian Copenhaver identified as being Ficino’smain inspirations, together with the tracts of the Corpus hermeticum, or,as Ficino translated it, “Mercurii Trismegisti Pymander, de potestate acsapientia Dei item Asclepius de voluntate dei.”28 And if we decide to lookfor John Dee’s possible sources of hermeticism, we find that he had theentirety of this literature at his disposal, not only a copy of Ficino’s Opera(R&W 204), but also a beautiful 1516 Aldus edition of Ficino’s “anthologiaesoterica” (R&W 256)29 that is now kept in the Folger Library andpreserves Dee’s marginalia on Iamblichus and the other Platonici as wellas on the hermetic treatises (cf. Clulee 1988, 277n. 75; Håkansson 2001,213; Harkness 1999, 228).MEDIEVAL MAGICMedieval magic has not been excluded from the recent radical reinterpre-tation and revaluation of magical and occult lore. As with intriguingquestions related to the Hermetica or Renaissance magic, the research ofthe Middle Ages has also led to the discovery of new texts as well as tothe development of new theories on the meaning and the use of thosetexts. If we want to classify the medieval traditions of magic as possibleinput for Dee, again we shall have to look into his library cataloguesbecause this is where we have a good chance of encountering missinglinks between his collection and the presumable sources of his magic.One category is well represented and clearly visible in his collection:medieval texts that engaged in the definition and classification of magic,often either condemning it entirely or refuting just some of its branches.30The second category would be those scholarly works oriented to-wards scientific questions whose authors restricted themselves to magianaturalis, optics, and alchemy. The best example in this category wouldbe Roger Bacon, who, as Nicholas Clulee has shown (1971, 1973, 1988),"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"68JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMwas one of Dee’s favorite authors, especially in his early career. Bacon’sworks were widely represented in Dee’s library,31 but belonging to thiscategory one could also mention Al-Kindi’s De radiis (R&W M149b,DM 42); Arnaldo de Villa Nova (Opera, R&W 299); Ramon Lull (Op-era, R&W 1421; Arbor scientiae, R&W 1415; Ars magna, R&W 1418);and Johannes de Rupescissa’s De quintae essentiae (R&W 1436).A third group of sources would be medieval mystics, reflecting on thehierarchical world model, angelology, spiritual illumination, and relatedsubjects. The following great authorities should be mentioned here: firstand foremost Pseudo-Dionysius, whose complete works Dee possessed inan 1556 edition that survives with his heavy annotations (R&W 975, cf.Harkness 1999, 113 ff.). A work of similar scope was De omnibus rebusnaturalibus by Pompilius Azalus, a 1544 Venice edition of which be-longed to Dee (R&W 134) and also survives with his emphases andannotations. These notes indicate that the Doctor purchased this copy asearly as 1550, probably during his visit to Paris and—then, or later on—he heavily glossed the chapters on angels (Roberts & Watson) 1990, 83;and Harkness 1999). Among medieval mystics a writer of great impor-tance for Reformation millenarism and chiliasm was Joachim of Fiore.His apocalyptic visions can be compared in many ways with that of Dee’sangelic conversations and in fact Dee had a considerable collection ofJoachim’s works, including his Opera (R&W 436, 706, 2028).32Finally, the most obscure and problematic group of possible sourcetexts are those proliferated from the thirteenth century and dealt withdivination and various forms of ceremonial magic. In this category weface a strictly unpublishable manuscript lore that until recently has beenneglected as trash and bogus literature. However, lately, largely inspiredby the pioneering studies of Richard Kieckhefer, it has increasingly cometo the forefront of attention.33 And there are good reasons to believe thatJohn Dee’s angelic magic had much to do with this murky and myste-rious tradition. It was Stephen Clucas (1998, 200?) who recently hasmost emphatically pointed out this possibility, analyzing carefully a greatnumber of medieval manuscripts of ritual magic and comparing themwith Dee’s own ritual magic as developed in his Spiritual Diaries. It wasalso Clucas who has noticed in Dee’s library catalogue that the Doctorin fact possessed such manuals of medieval ceremonial magic.34Having set up a general typology of medieval magic, I would like tostate that in magia naturalis there was little or no trace of the mysticismand theological orientation of magical exaltatio that characterized theHellenistic neoplatonic philosophers or the hermetic writings. All this"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"69The Sources of Renaissance Magicdoes not mean that the hermetic tradition was totally absent in theMiddle Ages. Although we find few hints concerning it in the officialdiscourse of theological schools and universities, ancient magical lore didfind shelters in which to survive. To discover those we have to look at theevidence concerning medieval ceremonial magic.Medieval Ceremonial MagicIf the concepts of this magic were mainly platonic, the actual practiceshad a much more dubious origin. We gather more and more evidenceabout the existence of a complex magical lore during the Middle Ageswhich in certain respects reached back to the Hellenistic period or evenearlier, without having much in common—admittedly—with the con-ceptual ideas of Hermes Trismegistus or the Platonici. Arthur Waite calledthis lore “ceremonial magic” (1961 [1911]) and recently it has beenRichard Kieckhefer who has done the most to examine this textual heri-tage (1989).As in my earlier discussion of the relationship between the philo-sophical and the technical hermetica, I have to restate my suspicion con-cerning the possibility of maintaining a clearly visible borderline betweenthe high (the more or less accepted magia naturalis) and “underground”(perhaps a better expression than the rather problematically used adjec-tive “popular”) magic of the Middle Ages.35An interesting feature of this corpus is that among the medievaldocuments of ceremonial magic a great many treatises survived under thename of Hermes—some of them are alchemical, while others deal di-rectly with conjurations and divination by means of manipulations usingangelic names. It seems reasonable to associate at least some of these textswith the technical hermetica recently studied by Fowden (1986) andGrese (1988). The technical hermetica certainly offered a great deal ofpractical information from alchemical operations to various ritualistic spells,conjurations, enumerations of demons, and the like. Although most ofthem (such as the Egyptian-Greek papyri and the Coptic library) wereunknown to the Renaissance magi, it is also true that—as I have justmentioned—many similar texts did circulate in the Middle Ages as a rathersecret and illegal body of literature associated with the name of Hermes.Already Waite has noticed that these two groups of texts could havehad some connection with each other: “Between the most ancient pro-cesses, such as those of Chaldean Magic, and the rites of the Middle Ages,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"70JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthere are marked correspondences and there is something of commondoctrine. The doctrine of compulsion, or the power upon superior spiritsby the use of certain words, is a case in point” (Waite 1961, 9). Then headds: “The Ceremonial Magic of certain Graeco-Egyptian papyri offers theclosest analogies with the processes of the Kabalistic school” (ibid.).Lynn Thorndike, in his History of Magic, described the scope of thepopularity of this literature and summarized their main contents. Heidentified a large number of thirteenth- to seventeenth-century manu-scripts that contained alchemical and magical treatises associated withHermes (among them, The Book of Hermes on the Six Principles of Nature,and Book of Propositions . . . said to be by the Philosopher Termegistus; cf.Thorndike 1923–1958, 2:214–29). It is interesting to notice that thesewritings enjoyed a partly positive reception. For example, Robert of Chester’sLatin translation (from the year 1144) of an Arabic alchemical treatiseunder the name of Hermes described the supposed author as one of thethree “Hermeses,” namely Enoch, Noah, and himself, the Triplex, who wasat once king, philosopher, and prophet (Thorndike, 215). Another fifteenth-century manuscript, containing a treatise on the fifth essence ascribed againto Hermes, characterized the author as “the prophet and king of Egypt,[who] after the flood of Noah, father of philosophers, had [the text] byrevelation of an angel of God to him sent” (219). This is reminiscent ofthe Enochian legends, suggesting that some privileged men after the Fall orthe Flood were entrusted by God to possess divine wisdom and teachmankind the skills and technologies of survival. As we shall see later, thismotive constituted a central theme in John Dee’s angel magic.Thorndike also mentions specific treatises of theurgy and necromancyunder the name of Hermes, which treated magic images, incantations,and spells using the names of God. These were strictly condemned by thescholastic philosophers and scientists: Albertus Magnus included them inhis list of evil books on necromantic images often of which Christianswere to beware, and Guillaume d’Auvergne, bishop of Paris, although hementioned Hermes and Asclepius approvingly, generally considered thisnecromantic-hermetic literature to be dangerous.36The above scholastic authors condemned even more strongly anothergroup of similar literature that survived under the name of Solomon,legendary king and savant of the Jews. Treatises with such titles as Defigura Almandel,Clavicula Solomonis, and Ars Notoria Solomonis circu-lated in great numbers from the thirteenth century until the seventeenthcentury and contained invocations of angels for the purpose of seekingcommunion with God, as well as mystic figures and magical prayers"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"71The Sources of Renaissance Magic(Thorndike 1923–1958, 2:279–90; Clucas 200?; Fanger 1998). Theyoften stated that the Creator revealed this art through an angel to Solomon,and it was useful for acquiring all the liberal and mechanical arts in ashort time. In fact, the Solomonic art is more than that. In the Libersacer, or Liber juratus of Honorius, which consists of ninety-three chaptersand is supposed to be derived from a conference of magicians who de-cided to condense all their knowledge into one single volume, one learnsabout a variety of topics, among others how to compose of the greatname of God of in seventy-two letters, how to redeem the soul frompurgatory, how to get your wish from any angel, how to learn the hourof one’s death, how to control spirits by words or seals, and many moremundane goals, such as how to open closed doors, catch thieves, and findlost treasure. Interestingly, two chapters, 91 on the apparition of deadbodies and 92 on the creation of animals from earth, were omitted, ascontrary to the will of God.In spite of this tactful caution of its authors, Albertus Magnus auto-matically included them in the list of evil books, and Guillaume d’Auvergnecalled them “cursed and execrable” books (cf. his De legibus, quoted byThorndike, 1923–1958, 2:281). Roger Bacon classified the Solomonicliterature as something that “ought to be prohibited by law” (Thorndike,279), and in his famous epistle “concerning the marvelous power of artand of nature” wrote as follows:It ought to be denied, which is claimed by some, that Solomon andother wise men composed these books—for books of this sort are notreceived by the authority of the Church but only by seducers whoaccept the naked letter and themselves compose new books and mul-tiply inventions and inscribe renowned titles on their works. . . . (Bacon1923, 19)One cannot fail to notice that this illicit literature in many respectspoints back to the technical hermetica (Fanger 1998a); however, they alsoreveal a more immediate source, namely the early cabalistic literaturewith its concentration on characters and magic names (Kieckhefer 1998).Gerschom Scholem provided us with a full account of the developmentof this early medieval Jewish mystical literature (Scholem 1974 [1946])and he also gave illuminating hints concerning the continuous popularityof this kind of magic, in spite of and against the development of ratio-nalistic philosophy. Mystics and philosophers, as he suggested, were “botharistocrats of thought; yet Kabbalism succeeded in establishing a connec-tion between its own world and certain elemental impulses operative in"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMevery human mind. It did not turn its back upon the primitive side oflife, that all-important region where mortals are afraid of life and in fearof death, and derive scant wisdom from rational philosophy. Philosophyignored these fears, out of whose substance man wove myths, and inturning its back upon the primitive side of man’s existence, it paid a highprice in losing touch with him altogether” (Scholem 1974, 35). Onecould add to this concept two points: to begin with, Scholem’s dichotomybetween rational philosophy and the cabala could be applied to otherforms of mystical wisdom, such as Pythagoreanism, gnosticism, andhermeticism. Second, beside the fears and anxieties of “the primitive sideof life,” which were better answered by mysticism than philosophy, oneshould also take into account the desire for deification, the drive forexaltatio that has never ceased to be a major ambition of humankind.And this ambition characterized certainly not only the popular register ofculture but caught the highest minds, too.Returning now to the mixed textual lore of medieval ceremonialmagic, by observing that these works were in constant use in the formof manuscript literature as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,one can see a continuity between the medieval and the Renaissance tra-ditions of divinatory magic. One can also easily accept the possibility thatthe great Renaissance magi, a Trithemius, an Agrippa, or a John Dee, didnot model their magical practices only on the venerable philosophicalsources of the neoplatonists, or that of the “real” Hermes Trismegistus;they also must have tried out the illicit methods at their disposal, extract-ing them either from medieval or from contemporary underground sources.As opposed to the medieval teachers, what encouraged them to doso? On the one hand, undoubtedly their increased self-confidence, cata-lyzed by the rediscovered hermetic tradition. On the other, the complex-ity of the traditions. In spite of the condemnations of the medievalauthorities, tracts of ceremonial magic all claimed to be pious and toaspire to magical exaltation. The Solomonic Liber juratus, for example,described itself as follows:This is the book by which one can see God in this life. This is thebook, by which anyone can be saved and led beyond a doubt to lifeeternal. [. . .] This is the book which no religion possesses except theChristian, or if it does, with no advantage.37With their enlarged self-confidence, the Renaissance magi could seeand acknowledge Christian piety in places where their medieval predeces-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"73The Sources of Renaissance Magicsors expressed abhorrence and disgust. In this attitude the Renaissancemagi were, of course, also encouraged by their extensive classical learning,whether Christian or pagan. They could take courage from the Christianconcept of the angelic hierarchies elaborated by the Pseudo-Dionysius,who also spoke much about the possibility of religious exaltatio and aunion with God during earthly existence. He wrote about the souls thatby means of angels as good leaders, they can be uplifted to the generousSource of all good things and, each according to his measure, they areable to have a share in the illuminations streaming out from that Source.(The Divine Names 696c, in Pseudo-Dionysius 1987, 73).The Renaissance magi could easily find similar passages in the worksof the neoplatonists, in the hermetic treatises, or, even, in such murkymedieval tracts as the infamous Picatrix. If we take a look at that text,we shall have made an almost full circle, to arrive at the connecting linkbetween Hellenistic and Arabic hermeticism and medieval ceremonialmagic, which all seem to have inspired Renaissance neoplatonic magic.38This text is the only one, however, among my examples in this bookthat does not feature in Dee’s library catalogue nor does he mention thetitle of the Picatrix in any of his writings. Nevertheless, I find it usefuland necessary to include it among the input sources of Dee for thefollowing reasons: as I shall show in the next chapter, the Picatrixdefinitely influenced many of the great Renaissance magi who wereDee’s most important sources: Ficino, Trithemius, and Agrippa. Deehimself was interested in Arabic magical literature, as many of his ref-erences show (see, for example, his treatment of alnirangiat in theMathematical Preface; cf. Clulee 1988, 167), not to mention his highlytreasured Book of Soyga, the “Arabik Book” that Harkness recentlyidentified as an English-Latin compendium of astrology and ceremonialmagic (1999, 44–45). Even if Dee did not read the Picatrix itself, hemust have been familiar with it through his other readings and itsconcept of exaltation may have been amalgamated with his own ideol-ogy of deification by means of magical science.Magical Exaltatio in the PicatrixI would like to call attention to the fact that the earliest surviving copiesof the Hermetica are medieval codices, which indicate the uninterrupted"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"74JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMinterest in hermeticism even during the Middle Ages.39 There is anothermedieval textual lore, however, that not only testifies to the survival ofhermetism but also demonstrates the active use of this tradition, a kindof medieval rewriting or recycling of the Hermetica. This is the fascinat-ingPicatrix, which may, or may not have been known to John Dee.The Hungarian scholar Miklós Maróth noted concerning the Picatrixas follows: “[it shows] that the neoplatonic interpretation of the worldwas still feasible for certain groups, outside the circles of scholastic phi-losophers. Those who today could be called ‘the practicioners of theoccult’ ” (Maróth 1995, 24). In the Middle Ages this magical treatise wasattributed to an Arabic scholar, Maslama al-Magriti; today it is ratherseen as a compilation, summa, that documents the interest of Arabicscience in hermeticism. Alphons, King of Castile, had it translated intoSpanish in 1256 and this later became the basis of a Latin translation.Until the twentieth century no printed edition was known, the survivingmanuscripts deriving from the later Middle Ages.40 According to theLatin text, Picatrix (Buqratis, Picatris) is none other than the author ofthe book: liber, quem sapientissimus philosophus Picatris in nigromanticisartibus ex quampluribus libris composuit (a book on magical arts compiledfrom several others by the wisest philosopher, Picatris).ThePicatrix is good evidence that Hellenistic neoplatonism—like otherelements of the Greek philosophy—returned to Europe via Arabic media-tion. This text is similar to previously mentioned medieval magical sourcesin that it discusses at length the ways of sympathetic magic, among themastrology. It suggests that a constant energy radiates from the stars to theEarth and influences the happenings here. In the Picatrix magical-astrologi-cal observations are mixed with philosophical considerations:These two sciences [i.e., magic and alchemy] aim at boosting a desireto study. But this goal can be reached only by the philosophers, thosemen who are familiar with all the fields, branches and steps of wisdom.These two sciences are at the end of philosophy like a conclusiondrawn from premises in a syllogism. Mark this well, because I have justrevealed to you a marvellous secret. (Picatrix 1.1)47The material world is full of occult sympathies drawn from thecorresponding stars and planets. With appropriate knowledge and skillsthe researcher can discover and use these energies, says the Picatrix. It ismost important to know the hidden correspondences. If, for example,someone wants to exploit the energy of Venus, he has to know what"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"75The Sources of Renaissance Magicanimals, plants, metals, and stones belong to her, and he must use thosewhen trying to contact the demon of that planet.So far this is not radically different from the sympathetic magic of theLiber secretorum Alberti Magni and other similar treatises capitalizing on theconcept of the organic world model. The peculiar feature of the Picatrix isthat, reaching back to the hermetic tradition, it pays great attention tothe spirits and demons of the universe. What is more, the explanation ofthe spiritual hierarchies is done in an elaborate symbolic-mythologicalframework that also derives from the Hellenistic ideology. The cornerstoneof magic in the Picatrix is the assumption that man can contact the decansand the demons of the planets by using magic talismans as mediators.Talismans—by the power of images and inscriptions—capture the virtue ofthe planetary demon even to the point of conjuring it up. To illustrate thiswith the example of Venus, the researcher needs to know the symbolicattributes of Venus and these will be used to form the image on thetalisman, which has to be made of the appropriate metal, and will have tobe used only in the astrologically appropriate moment.ThePicatrix also discusses a great number of correspondences, re-lated to the various talismans described in the first part of the treatise.Here follow description of the images of a few planets:Two images of Saturn:“The form of a man with a crow’s face and foot, sitting on a throne,having in his right hand a spear and in his left a lance or an arrow.”“The form of a man standing on a dragon, clothed in black and hold-ing in his right hand a sickle and in his left a spear.”Two images of Jupiter:“The form of a man, sitting on an eagle, clothed in garment, witheagles beneath his feet. . . .”“The form of a man with a lion’s face and bird’s feet, below them adragon with seven heads, holding an arrow in his right hand. . . .”An image of Mars:“The form of a man, crowned, holding a raised sword in his righthand.”An image of Sol:“The form of a king sitting on a throne, with a crown on his head andbeneath his feet the figure (magic character) of the Sun.”An image of Venus:“The form of a woman with her hair unbound riding on a stag, havingin her right hand an apple, and in her left, flowers, and dressed inwhite garment.” (Picatrix, 2.10).42"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"76JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMWhile the first part of the treatise provides the necessary informationon talismans and the way they should be made, the second part dealswith the correspondences of the macrocosm and the microcosm and thisis where we find passages relating to the role of man as a potential magus.These suggest that astrological determinism can be suspended if man (bymeans of magic) learns how to master nature:Man is a small world, similar to the great cosmos, consisting of a com-plete, living and sensible body and a sensible soul. [. . .] He possessesdivine power [. . .] can make miracles and can manufacture miraculousimages. [. . .] God ordained him to become the inventor of all sciences,with a prophetic faculty to understand everything and to recognize thevaluable in everything. . . . (1.6; Ritter and Plessner 1962, 35–38).Eugenio Garin compared this image of the human being to the hermeticmagus, even to Pico’s oration on the dignity of man (1983, 50).The fourth book of the Picatrix contains an interesting mythologicalfable that is a direct reference to the magical deeds of Hermes Trismegistus.According to the text he was not only the first to create magic talismans,but through his magic power founded a wondrous city in Egypt:There are many among the Chaldeans who can create magic images,and they claim that Hermes was the first to make such [talismans] andby their help he regulated the Nile. [. . .] It was also he who foundeda city in Eastern Egypt which was 12 miles long, with a palace in themiddle and with a gate on each of the four sides. He attached theimage of an eagle to the eastern gate, a bull to the western, a lion tothe southern, and a dog to the northern. Then he infused a living spiritinto the images which then could speak with voice and none couldenter without their consent. [. . .] In the middle of the palace he builta tower and in it he placed a shining body which produced every daylight of different color while on the seventh day returned to the firstone. [. . .] Around the city he placed statues. By the power of these theinhabitants remained virtuous, free from vickedness and vices. Thename of the city was Adocentyn. (4. 3)43In the description of this marvellous city Garin finds a predecessorof sixteenth- and seventeenth-century utopias, such as those of Filareteand Campanella. Frances Yates furthermore emphasized the relationshipof this text to the motif of the magical, man-made statues in the Asclepius.I could add that the ambition to reveal the great secrets of Nature could"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"77The Sources of Renaissance Magicalso be compared to the vision of Hermes Trismegistus before Poimandres,described in Corpus hermeticum 1:When I wanted to reveal the secret working of the world and theprocess of creation, I found a dark cave, full of shadows and winds. Icould see nothing and I was unable to light my torch. Then I saw abeautiful creature in my dream who said: “Put your torch under a glassjar in order to protect it against the winds and then it will shine in spiteof the storm. Thus you will be able to penetrate even into the under-world region.” (3.6; Ritter and Plessner 1962, 198)Yates and Garin highlighted two different, although complementary,aspects of the Picatrix. For Yates its importance lay in the links with thehermetic literature and ideology. She emphasized how the medieval texthad moved forward from a philosophical vision towards practical magic,the construction of talismans in order to exalt their users. As she wrote,“The work is thus a most complete text-book for the magician, giving thephilosophy of nature on which talismanic and sympathetic magic is basedtogether with full instructions for its practice. Its objects are strictlypractical; the various talismans and procedures are used to gain specificends, for the cure of various diseases, for long life, for success in variousenterprises, and so on” (Yates 1964, 54). Garin appreciated the theoreti-cal depth, the attachment to the speculative neoplatonic philosophy: “[I]tputs all the vast inheritance of ancient and medieval magic and astrologyinto, on the one hand, the theoretical neoplatonic picture, and on theother the hermeticist one” (Garin 1983, 48). Both emphasized, however,that the motive of bold human inquiry and the ambition to researchnature had been crucially important in the grounding the notion of thedignity of man by the time of the Renaissance. The secret magical lorepreserved by the Arabs provides a connecting link with both the magicaltheology of the Florentine neoplatonists and the experimental natural-ceremonial magic of the sixteenth century.John Dee, as a truly versatile Renaissance man, was equally interestedin science, technology, and inquiry into the occult. He could thus takeinspiration from all the intellectual trends summarized in this chapter ofmedieval magic. Indeed, he seems to have researched the path of magianaturalis advertised by Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus as well as thetechniques of talismanic magic originally worked out in the Picatrix, untilhe came to crave a direct communication with God and the spirit world,somewhat along the lines of Clavicula Solomonis and its type of literature."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"78JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMKeeping a chronological track of possible sources, in the followingchapter I shall examine the elements of Florentine neoplatonism thatundoubtedly contributed to the formation of Dee’s program of exaltatio."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"4Florentine Neoplatonismand Christian MagicJohn Dee’s library catalogues as well as his marginalia and scholarly ref-erences show that in his syncretic magical system one of the main inspi-rations undoubtedly came from the neoplatonist magi, especially Ficinoand Pico. In the part of my book entitled “OUTPUT” I shall discusstextual parallels and influences. Here I intend only to summarize brieflythe ideas and iconography of magical exaltatio as seen in some works ofFicino and Pico.FICINO’S TALISMANIC MAGICFicino’s translations of Plato were published in Florence between 1462and 1468, sponsored by the Neoplatonic Academy of Lorenzo de’ Medici,il Magnifico. These publications exercised a major influence on the sub-sequent development of Renaissance philosophy as well as on the earlymodern history of magic. Ficino’s scholarly output was complex andversatile, far exceeding the present sketch of pre- and early modern Westernmagical traditions. From the angle of this narrower scope, his ideas onbeauty, love, and celestial correspondences are of particular interest.The philosophical discussions of beauty and love go back as far asPlato himself and his mentor, Socrates. The former treated these ques-tions in his dialogues Symposium and Phaedrus, and came to the conclu-sion that the catalyzer of love was beauty, which appeared in the physicalas well as in the metaphysical spheres of existence. Thus religious desire79"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"80JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcould also be explained as the analogy of the soul’s craving for perfectbeauty. This explanation proved to be congenial for many Renaissancetheologians, too, such as Cardinal Bembo, one of Castiglione’s protagonistsin his The Courtier. Ficino himself remained evasive in defining the border-line between theology, philosophy, and even pious, white magic. The com-mon ground among the three areas seemed to be a curious blend of aphilosophy of beauty and love, a poetical theology, and a theory of magicbased on the sympathetic love among the elements of the universe.1The Florentine philosopher wrote extensive commentaries on Plato’sworks that he later collected under the title Theologia platonica (1482).In this work Ficino expanded his philosophy of beauty. As Tibor Klaniczaysummed up: “beauty is nothing else but the symbol of divine perfectness,that is the reflection of God in the sensible world, a visible aspect ofTruth. Beauty derives from a creative act of the divine, consequentlyMan, who can also create beautiful things, becomes partaker of the di-vine attributes” (1975, 14). And this is precisely the point of the amal-gamation of philosophy and magic in Florentine neoplatonism. And alsoat this point we can detect Ficino’s great synthetizing ambition, how heenriched Plato’s philosophy with that of the other neoplatonists as wellas with his admired hermetic lore. To begin with, let us remember thecommand of the creative Mind, Nous from the eleventh tract of theCorpus hermeticum:Thus, unless you make yourself equal to god, you cannot understandgod; like is understood by like. Make yourself grow to immeasurableimmensity, outleap all body, outstrip all time, become eternity and youwill understand god. Having conceived that nothing is impossible toyou, consider yourself immortal and able to understand everything, allart, all learning, the temper of every living thing. Go higher than everyheight and lower than every depth. (1.20, in Copenhaver 1992, 41)As we shall see, this concept of hermetic deification will not only echoin Ficino’s philosophy, but also become one of the most importantcommonplaces of Renaissance magic, expounded in innumerable fifteenth-and sixteenth-century works, from Pico through Reuchlin, Agrippa, Giorgi,Lazzarelli, Gohory, Paracelsus, Postel—whose works were important read-ings of John Dee.In his commentary on the Symposium, Ficino identified magic withlove. In fact he called love “a magus”:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"81Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian MagicWhy do we think love is a sorcerer? Because in love there is all thepower of enchantment. The work of enchantment is the attraction ofone thing by another because of a certain similarity of their nature. Theparts of this world, like the parts of a single animal, all hanging fromone author, are joined to each other by the mutuality of one nature.[. . .] From their common relation a common love is born, and fromthat love a common attraction, and this is true enchantment. (Inconvivium Platonis de amore, 6.10; Ficino 1944, 91/199)Using this general framework, Ficino relied on a wide range ofsources—from the Neoplatonici through the Asclepius, even the LatinPicatrix—in order to integrate and elevate magic onto the rank of ven-erable science. He not only translated and propagated the magical viewsof the Platonici and the Corpus hermeticum in his already mentionedAnthologia esoterica (Ficino 1497, 1516), but he also developed one of themost ambitious theories of astral magic in his late work, the Three Bookson Life (De vita triplici . . . , 1489). Brian Copenhaver characterized thisbook as follows: “Ficino took natural magic to be as much the provinceof the natural philosopher as cosmology, astronomy, matter-theory. Thewisdom of the magus and the learning of the philosophus were distin-guishable but interdependent parts of the same enterprise . . .” (Copenhaver1988a, 274).In the remaining part of this subchapter I shall concentrate on thiswork of Ficino, which, according to Copenhaver, was “the fullest Renais-sance exposition of a theory of magic and the most influential suchstatement written in post-classical times” (ibid.).2De vita . .. consists of three books. Its first part, De studiosorum sani-tate tuenda, was written in 1480 and deals with the ways of preservingthe good health of scholars. The second book, De vita procurenda, treatsthe possibility of prolonging human life. This was written last among thethree books, completed just before publication in 1489. From the view-point of magic, the third part is the most important and most discussed:De vita coelitus comparanda, which is about the capturing of the celestialpovers.Ficino dedicated the whole work to Lorenzo de’ Medici and inthis dedication mentioned important facts pertaining to his whole schol-arly career:I had two fathers—Ficino the doctor and Cosimo de’ Medici. From theformer I was born, from the latter reborn. The former commended me"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"82JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMto Galen as both a doctor and a Platonist; the latter consecrated me tothe divine Plato. And both the one and the other alike dedicated Marsilioto a doctor—Galen, doctor of the body, Plato, doctor of the soul.Therefore, for a long time now I have practiced the medicine salutaryto souls under Plato: after translating all his books, I straightawaycomposed eighteen books concerning the immortality of souls andeternal happiness, so to the best of my ability repaying my Medicifather. Thinking I ought next to repay my medical father, I have com-posed a book On Caring for the Health of Learned People. In addition,after this, learned people desired not only to be healthy for a while, butalso, being in good health, to live a long time. And so I then gave thema book On a Long Life. But they distrusted terrestrial medicine andremedies in a matter of such importance; and so I added a book OnObtaining a Life Both Healthy and Long from Heaven, so that from thevery living body of the world, a more vigorous life might be propagatedas if from a vine into our own body, which is in a way a part of theworld’s body. (Gen. Proem., Ficino 1989, 103–105)The program is clear: based on the doctrine of correspondences,Ficino offers medical methods that utilize cosmic forces for maintainingthe human body and prolonging human life. The first book containsrelatively little magical material; it concentrates instead on the correspon-dences of the macro- and microcosms. Complying with the concept ofthe four elements and the four humors, Ficino tries to define the natureof scholars and outline the dangers following from their way of life.Separate chapters are devoted to the threats of coitus, overeating, andgetting up late. Next to the body, Ficino pays attention to psychology aswell: he enlists cosmic rules that should be observed by the melancholiclearned persons.The second book was dedicated to Filippo Valori, a Florentine noble-man in the service of the Medicis who sponsored the publication of thisbook as well as the Plato translation. This treatise also starts with medicaladvice derived from the doctrine of correspondences and discusses howto regulate the bodily fluids and the body’s temperature, what diet isgood for the elderly, and what the advantages of ascetic life are. The bookalready introduces various magical concepts, offering recipes that followthe popular medieval concepts of sympathetic magic, including chapters10 (“On Gold, Foods Made of Gold, and the Revitalization of OldMan”) and 19 (“The Medicine of the Magi for Old People”). Also in thisbook we come across the leitmotif of Book Three, which led Ficino to"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"83Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicthe ground of Christian neoplatonic magic. This is nothing other thanthe notion that astrological influences have medicinal effects, as is ex-plained by mythological characters in chapter 13 (“What means of fo-menting all the parts of the body the elderly may receive from the plan-ets”) and 15 (“Mercury addresses the elderly and counsels them aboutpleasure, odors, song, and medicines”). One should note that old peopleare counseled to converse while traversing the green fields under theleadership of Venus (chapter 14) and, if their body dries out, to “choosea young girl who is healthy, beautiful, cheerful, and temperate, and whenyou are hungry and the Moon is waxing, suck her milk” (ch. 11, Ficino1989, 197). As Frances Yates ironically remarked: “We might be in theconsulting room of a rather expensive psychiatrist who knows that hispatients can afford plenty of gold and holidays in the country, and flowersout of season” (1964, 63).Book Three is dedicated to Matthias Corvinus, the Hungarian Re-naissance ruler, who on several occasions unsuccessfully invited Ficino tohis court. According to Ficino’s dedication,The ancient philosophers [. . .] judged, as I suppose, that the elementsand all that is composed therefrom would be known by them in vain,and that the motions and influences of the heavens would be tooaimlessly observed, if the knowledge of both, taken jointly together, didnot eventually lead to life and happiness for themselves. Thoughts ofthis kind profited them, as it seems, first of all in the present life; forPythagoras and Democritus and Apollonius of Tyana and all who havemade this their special study have by using the things they knew at-tained good health and long life. (Proem 3, Ficino 1989, 237)These introductory words indicate that the following treatise belongs tothe territory of astrological medicine, and one should also note thatFicino emphasizes the importance of utilizing celestial forces for main-taining the body in this earthly life—a typical Renaissance concern!The next passage of the dedication also reveals Ficino’s source andinspiration in writing this book:Now among the books of Plotinus destined for the great Lorenzo de’Medici I had recently composed a commentary on the book of Plotinuswhich discusses drawing favor from the heavens. With all this in mind,I have just decided to extract that one (with the approval of Lorenzohimself ) and dedicate it especially to your Majesty. (Ficino 1989, 239)"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"84JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThe first chapter of this famous book again recapitulates some basicsof the organic world picture and the correspondences: the celestial powers,the World Soul, the planets, and the demons. Ficino, following Plotinusand the hermetic tradition, asserts that each planet and the houses of thezodiac have their demons and governing angels, which translate the willof the World Soul (Anima mundi) toward the inferior spheres.The system of will transfer (in Plotinus, “emanation”) sustains theharmony of the world (chapter 2), a notion which became a centralcomponent of the Renaissance world model, primarily due to Ficino andthe other neoplatonist philosophers. As the miniature model of the cos-mos, the human soul is capable of absorbing the strength of the WorldSoul through the rays of Sol or Jupiter. This is how one becomes of solaror jovial temperament (chapter 4). The point is that all these astral forcescan be used for medical purposes in order to improve man’s physical andmental functioning (chapter 10).In chapter 13 Ficino introduces the concept of talismanic magic,probably borrowed from the Picatrix: “On the power acquired from theheavens both in images, according to the Ancients, and in medicines.”The following chapters enlist the various planetary and stellar forces andthe talismanic images corresponding to them. Chapter 16 treats thequestion of the rays from which images are thought to obtain their force.After the “flames without light” (Ficino 1989, 321) penetrate the metalsand gems embellished with the magic images, they “imprint in themwonderful gifts, since indeed they generate supremely precious things inthe womb of the earth” (323). This is as when the rays of a beautiful eyegenerate great love in one who beholds that eye (as Ficino already hadexplained in his Symposium commentary).3 Chapter 18 describes talis-mans already known since Antiquity and in some of them elements ofDee’s hieroglyophic monad can be recognized. It is even more so inchapter 19, which advises on the construction of a general image, repre-senting the whole cosmos. As we shall see, again, in this respect Dee’sMonas was the ultimate achievment (see chapter 6 below, p. 161 ff ).Beginning with chapter 21, Ficino adds to the treatment of powerfulimages a description of powerful words, incantations, magical prayersand he offers a seven-grade typology of celestial influences according tothe seven planets. The theoretical introduction is followed by practicaladvice: how to find our place in the web of astral influences, how todefend against the harmful domination of Saturn, how to capitalize onJupiter’s benevolent strength (chapter 22). The next chapter gives thefollowing counsel: “To live well and prosper, first know your natural"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"85Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicbent, your star, your Genius, and the place suitable to these; here live.Follow your natural profession” (Ficino 1989, 371). The influence of thetalismanic magic of Picatrix is quite obvious here: the complex of prereq-uisites—place, astrological and physical correspondences (zodiac, plan-etary position, materials, colors, and odors) and the magical images onthe talismans and the accompanying incantations—all follow the tradi-tions of hermetic and Arabic authors.Beginning with chapter 24 further pieces of advice are gathered anddirected to scholars specifically: “By what system people dedicated tolearning may recognize their natural bent and follow a manner of lifesuitable to their guardian spirit.”The closing, twenty-sixth chapter summarizes astrological magic re-turning to the theoretical plane again: “How by exposing lower things tohigher things, you can bring down the higher, and cosmic gifts especiallythrough cosmic materials.” Ficino’s wording is a clear product of Renais-sance neoplatonism inspired also by hermetic magic:As Plato teaches, echoing Timaeus the Pythagorean, the world has beenproduced by the Good itself the best it could possibly have been. It istherefore not only corporeal but participating in life and intelligence aswell. (3.26, Ficino 1989, 385)The definition of the magus and the encomium of magical practices followthis tone, concluding again with an equation between magic and love:Agriculture prepares the field and the seed for celestial gifts and bygrafting prolongs the life of the shoot and refashions it into anotherand better species. The doctor, the natural philosopher, and the sur-geon achieve similar effects in our bodies in order to both strengthenour own nature and to obtain more productively the nature of theuniverse. The philosopher who knows about natural objects and stars,whom we rightly are accustomed to call a Magus, does the very samethings: he seasonably introduces the celestial into the earthly by par-ticular lures just as the farmer interested in grafting brings the freshgraft into the old stock. [. . .] The Magus subjects earthly things tocelestial, lower things everywhere to higher, just as particular femaleseverywhere are subjected to males appropriate to them for impregna-tion, as iron to a magnet to get magnetized, as camphor to hot air forabsorption, as crystal to the Sun for illumination, as sulphur and sub-limed liquor to a flame for kindling, as an egg-shell, empty and full ofdew, to the Sun for elevation, or rather the egg itself to the hen forhatching. (3.26, 387)"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"86JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMHis own definition Ficino strengthens by the authority of Plotinus andHermes Trismegistus:Plotinus uses almost the same examples in that place where, para-phrasing Hermes Trismegistus, he says that the ancient priests orMagi used to capture in statues and material sacrifices somethingdivine and wonderful. (3.26, 389)4This locus is a good example to show with what determination Ficinotried to amalgamate his different sources: Plato, the Platonici, and thehermetic tradition. While moderns scholars are usually sceptical aboutPlotinus’ approval or even knowledge of the Corpus hermeticum, Ficinothinks him to have paraphrased Hermes. This claim is not void of cul-tural politics, though: Plotinus’ opinion was more acceptable for Chris-tian authorities than that of Hermes Trismegistus, so it could serve as amediator for the Christianization of the Hermetica.But now let us get back to Hermes, or rather to Plotinus. Hermes saysthat the priests received an appropriate power from the nature of thecosmos and mixed it. Plotinus follows him and thinks that everythingcan be easily accomplished by the intermediation of the Anima Mundi,since the Anima Mundi generates and moves the forms of natural thingsthrough certain seminal reasons implanted in her from the divine. [. . .]The Anima Mundi can easily apply herself to materials since she hasformed them to begin with through these seminal reasons, when theMagus or a priest brings to bear at the right time rightly grouped formsof things. [. . .] Sometimes it can happen that when you bring seminalreasons to bear on forms, higher gifts too may descend, since reason inthe Anima Mundi are conjoined to the intellectual forms in her andthrough these to the Ideas of the Divine Mind. (3.26, 391)In Ficino’s interpretation, then, magic is nothing else but thecapturing and manipulation of supernatural forces in order to freeman’s soul and intellect from the burden of the material world. Thegoal is to unite the human spirit with the divine not only after deathbut during earthly life, in the form of exaltatio. The roots of this con-cept originated in neoplatonic hermeticism but for the Renaissancephilosopher the platonic concepts of Supreme Good, creative Nous,and the transmitting demons could be easily associated with Christiandoctrines: God, angels, and the human soul. Ficino’s purpose was pre-cisely this association: the Christianization of neoplatonism and her-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"87Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicmetic magic. A good example of this process can be seen in his com-mentary on Plato’s Symposium, when his discussion of demons involvesthe Pseudo-Dionysian discourse on angels:The good daemons, our protectors, Dionysius the Areopagite is accus-tomed to call by the proper names, Angels, the governors of the lowerworld, and this differs very little from the interpretation of Plato. [. . .]Plato does not in the least bind spirits of this kind within the narrowlimits of the spheres, as he does the souls of earthly creatures in bodies,but asserts that they are endowed with such great virtue by the supremeGod that they are able to enjoy the vision of God at once, and they areable without any labor or care to rule and move the globes of the worldaccording to the will of their father, and by moving them, easily governlower creatures. Therefore it is rather a difference in words betweenPlato and Dionysius than a difference in meaning. (In conviviumPlatonis . . . , 6.3; Ficino 1944, 79/186)Florentine neoplatonism was not the only trend in Christian philoso-phy to assimilate the teachings of Plato. Its intellectual novelty was nev-ertheless the emphasis on magical possibilities (through the synthesis ofthe Platonici and hermeticism) that was to enable humankind to assumea more central and important role than previously had been permitted inthe framework of medieval Christian philosophy.A look at the critical history of De vita . .. can refine the characterof Ficino’s magic so far outlined. The first extensive analysis was done byD. P. Walker (1958) whose views were further developed by Frances Yatesin her book on Bruno under the heading “Ficino as Christian-Renaissancemagus” (1964, 62–84). Her thesis was grounded on a reading of Devita . . ., and this well fitted the concept of the dignity of Renaissanceman as established by Cassirer.5 As Cassirer suggested, the Renaissancepreserved the idea of the Great Chain of Being, but the great innovationwas that man’s place changed—from fixed to movable. As a result theneoplatonists thought man could climb up the Chain, even up to God.This possibility intensely occupied Renaissance philosophers who triedto validate the idea from the works of Plato and other pagan sources,mixing them with the ideas of Christian mystics, such as the works ofPseudo-Dionysius.This philosophical exaltatio was supposed to be comparable to areverse emanation in Plotinus’ system, first described by Plato in hisSymposium and the Phaedrus. The human soul encaged in the materialbody does not entirely forget about its supernatural origin and keeps"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"88JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMlonging for it.6 And when the human perception encounters somethingbeautiful, this earthly beauty reminds the soul of its divine heritage, andthe soul then longs even more strongly for the heavenly perfection. Andif the soul is strong and disciplined enough, it can break out of the prisonof matter and can dine with the divinity: the exaltatio happens.One of Ficino’s important theoretical works was his commentary onPlato’s Symposium,7 where he Christianized Plato’s theory of love and alsoarticulated the doctrine of the deification of man. In this process the cata-lyzing agents are Plato’s four furors or “sacred madnesses”—prophetic, religious-mystical, poetical, and love (cf. Phaedrus 244a–249c), which are able to liftthe soul from—in Ficino’s wording (7.13–14)—dissonance to harmony andfrom variety to unity. The first step is done by poetic madness:The Soul cannot return to the One unless it itself becomes one. Thewhole soul is filled with discord and dissonance; therefore the firstneed is for the poetic madness, which through musical tones arouseswhat is sleeping, through harmonic sweetness calms what is in tur-moil, and finally, through the blending of different things, quellsdiscord and tempers the various parts of the soul. (7.14; Ficino1944, 231)The other madnesses follow and complete the elevation of the soul,climaxing in Christian, holy love:Finally, when the soul has been made one, it recovers itself into theOne which is above essence, that is God. This the heavenly Venuscompletes through Love, that is through the desire for the divine beauty,and the passion for Good. So the first kind of madness tempers disso-nant and unharmonious parts. The second makes the tempered partsone out of many. The third makes it one above all parts; and the fourthinto One which is above essence and above the whole. (7.14, 232)To sum up: Ficino laid down the theoretical framework of hismagic in his commentaries on Plato and Plotinus by means of “re-platonizing” Pseudo-Dionysius and amalgamating it with a syncreticmix of classical traditions. The magical praxis of exaltatio using astro-logical talismans was, on the other hand, grounded in his De vitacoelitus comparanda and again can be considered to be the result of thefusion of various earlier practices."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"89Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian MagicAccording to Frances Yates the most dominating intellectual force onFicino’s development of neoplatonic magic was Egyptian-Hellenic her-meticism. Based on this assumption she coined the historical category“Renaissance hermeticism,” which she considered to be the most impor-tant intellectual achievement of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.Research over the past few decades in many ways has broken with DameFrances’ thesis, philologists above all demonstrating that the magic ofFicino was more complex, relying on sources outside hermeticism, suchas the Platonici, Arabic and Jewish sources of the Middle Ages, andmedieval sympathetic magic.8Taking all this into consideration, one has to conclude that the cat-egory of hermeticism must either be enlarged ad infinitum to accommo-date all the signficant phenomena Frances Yates tried to bring under thislabel; or it has to be understood as a well-defined but by no meansgenerally influential intellectual trend. However, I would still like toemphasize with Yates what an important inspiration the doctrine of as-cension/exaltatio meant for the forging of the man-centered world pic-ture of the Renaissance.If the Yates thesis, including her model of the “Rosicrucian En-lightenment,” has become outdated in current historical research, eventoday’s historians have to face the facts according to which occult phi-losophies produced an amazing amount of written, printed, and illus-trated material during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in genresranging from philosophical tracts to spiritual diaries, from poetry tolearned theology, not to mention the popular imagination of the age asmanifested in anecdotes, broad sheets, volksbuchs, and intriguing playson the stages of Europe. And also there remains the surprising fact thatneither the occult philosophies nor their complex iconography disap-peared after the scientific recolution.Compared with this variety of the Western esoteric tradition, Yates wasalso right to point out that Ficino’s magic was largely restricted to a pious andlimited version of talismanic lore. The purpose of the next subchapter is toshow what giant steps were taken in Renaissance magic after Ficino’s initialexperiments, resulting in the fact that in the second half of the sixteenthcentury John Dee could encounter a more enlarged and complicated magicalworld picture than Ficino had dreamt of seventy-eighty years earlier.The first step in this development was undertaken by Pico dellaMirandola who integrated Jewish cabala into neoplatonic-hermetic magic,as manifested in his De hominis dignitate."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"90JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMPICO’S ENCOMIUM OFEXALTATIOFicino always made a point of detaching himself from dark or evil magic,calling his own system theology. This division of magic into white andblack had been in use since Antiquity. The word magia originally referredto the practices of Persian priests, and the abused version of this practicewas identified as “black magic.”9Greek philosophers, such as Plotinus, differentiated between theurgyandgoétia (Dodds 1951), while Christian theologists talked about miraandmiracula as opposed to wicked maleficia and veneficia(Flint 1991,33). The Catholic Church, in spite of the the careful distinguishing ofmany theologians, did not like theurgy either. It is almost surprisingthat Ficino never encountered a conflict with the church because of hisexperiments with magic; his disciple, Pico, on the other hand, hadto face serious charges of heresy several times during his short life(1463–1494).As I shall show later, the typologizing of magic always depended onsubjective motivations, and the labelling of esoterically oriented mindseither as venerable magician or wicked witch and conjuror always be-longed to the repertoire of power politics.No doubt, with his bold ideas and gestures Pico provoked the sus-picion of church authorities. The dangerous elements of his philosophywere as follows: he articulated the doctrine of the dignity of man in amore inflammatory way than his master, Ficino; he openly advocatedmagic as being a suitable means for the elevation (exaltatio) of man to thelevel of God; and, last but not least, in professing magic he introduceda new methodology taken from the Jewish cabala. In this section I brieflyoutline the system of cabala and its connecting points to Christianmysticism, then examine Pico’s cabalistical magic as a life program givento the people of the Renaissance.Cabala and ‘exaltatio’Cabala is the theosophy of the Jewish religion, that is, a mystical-philosophical system. The word itself means “received doctrine” or “tra-dition.” Opinions differ about the origins of this tradition. Believersspeak about a time even before the revelation given to Moses; historiansconnect it to Merkabah mysticism beginning in the first few centuriesB.C., then flourishing in the Hellenistic period. The historically distinct"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"91Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magiccradle of the cabala is the early Middle Ages (eighth and nineth centu-ries), and its real flourishing starts from the twelfth century.10The two fundamentally important texts of the cabala are the SeferYetsirah or the “Book of Formation,” and the Zohar or the “Book ofSplendor.” Neither of them is possible to date precisely. The Sefer Yetsirahis supposed to have been written between the second and the sixthcenturiesA.D. The Zohar is a much later development; it must havebeen compiled toward the end of the thirteenth century, in spite of itsclaiming the authorship of Simeon ben Yohai, a scholar of the firstcentury A.D.No matter the exact dates of composition, these books obviouslyrelied on earlier oral or textual traditions, and what seems to be rathercertain is that the roots of cabala reach back to the period more or lesscoinciding with the creation of the other great corpuses of mystical lit-erature: the Corpus hermeticum and the early Christian gnostic literature.Thus the Jewish cabala also sprung from that cosmopolitan and decadentatmosphere of the decaying Roman Empire where religious systems al-most freely mixed, became open to mysticism, and sought individualrevelation. Most of these experimental trends were influenced to someextent by Hellenistic neoplatonism as well as the Eastern mystical lore,from Egyptian magic through Persian Zoroastrianism to the early Chris-tian gnosticism. All of these tried to explain the creation of the materialworld from the divine Mind (variations on the emanation theme) andthey also tried to provide man with a key to be able to transfer himselfbetween these two worlds, the material and the supernatural.Among all these religious and theosophical efforts, Jewish cabalastands out because of its coherent system. Although there was a greatvariety even within Jewish mysticism, after the synthetizing schools ofSamuel Abulafia (1240–1292) and Abraham Gikatilia (1247–1305), thesystem attracted Christian thinkers, too.11 As has been recently demon-strated, this medieval Jewish mysticism excercised a great influence onmedieval ceremonial magic, especially on its “underground” angelology.But it was some of the great Renaissance humanists—especially Pico andReuchlin—who rediscovered this lore for themselves and established theChristian cabala as an important trend in Renaissance cultural history.The most important key to the ideas of the cabala is the Sefirot, or thesystem of divine emanations. According to the doctrine that was groundedin the Sefer Yetsirah, God—that is, En-Sof the infinite—fills and contains theuniverse at the same time. Since God is infinite, it cannot be comprehended.In order to demonstrate its existence, God then became active and creative,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"92JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMemanated from itself. This process is described by the sefirotic tree, whichconsists of ten sefira, usually arranged in a special order:12Kether(the Supreme Crown of God)Binah (Intelligence)————————Hokhman (Wisdom)Gevurah or Din(Power)———————Hesed (Love or Mercy)Rahamin or Tifereth (Compassion or Beauty)Hod (Majesty)———————Netsah (Endurance)Yesod (Foundation)Malkhuth (Kingdom)With the appearance of Kingdom the emanation is completed, the Spiritbecomes manifested in the material world. The characteristic arrange-ment of the sefirot is often called the Tree of Life, where the stages ofemanation are grouped in triads, forming three columns and three tiers.The right side is the “Black Column,” standing for mercy, which ispositive, active, and male. The left side is the “Silver Column,” standingfor severity and is negative, passive, and female. In the middle one findsthe column of equilibrium, standing for grace and divine will. The threetiers represent the three aspects of the divine nature: the upper threesefirot constitute the Divine Spirit, the next three the Divine Soul, whilethe lower three the Divine Will (Halevi 1979, 6 ff.).Graphic representations of the sefirot became common by the timeof the Renaissance. One of the much reproduced early prints is fromPaulus Ricius’ Portae lucis (Augsburg 1516), which shows a Jewish caba-list, deep in meditation, holding the sefirotic tree in his hand.13 To illus-trate the structure of the sefirotic tree, I am referring here to Cesare di’Evoli’s diagram, which was printed in his De divinis attributis in 1573.The woodcut clearly represents the triads composed of the elements ofthe sefira (Figure 4.1), and, needless to say, John Dee had this volume inhis library.14During the emanation this threefold nature manifests itself in fourphases, which is why the cabala is said to consist of four worlds. This hasto be understood in such a way that the ten sefirot are repeated fourtimes, or that the emanation repeats itself on four occasions. The first tensefirot constitute the world of Manifestation, or Atsilut, that is, the pri-mal emanation of the divinity. The next emanation is Creation, or Beriah,the Throne, or Merkabah with the highest angels. This is followed by theworld of Formation, or Yetsirah, the domain of the angels and the worldof Making, or Asiyah, the spiritual archetype of the material sphere,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"93Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicsomething like Plotinus’ hypostasis of Nature (Scholem 1974, 272). Thethreefold and fourfold connections of the sefirot are repeated in eachsubsequent world until the Spirit unites with Matter. Aspect four is asimportant as the aspect three, since—as we learn from the Zohar—thetree has four parts (root, trunk, branch, and fruit), there are four ele-ments, and the most special name of God (the Tetragrammaton) alsoconsists of four letters: JHVH (Halevi 1979, 8–9).The theory of the four worlds has roots in the Book of Isaiah: “Evenevery one that is called by My Name [Atsilut]: for I have created [Beriah]him for My Glory, I have formed [Yetsirah] him; yea, I have made [Asiyah]him” (43:7). The teachings of the sefirot thus are not only a cosmogonybut also a means for biblical exegesis that was used for the interpretationof the Pentateuch, the Books of Moses. One of the most important episodesin these books was, of course, the appearance of humankind, the missionof Adam on earth. The same threefold and fourfold logic was then appliedto the explanation of man, too. According to the four worlds, the micro-cosm of man also has a fourfold structure. As the cabalists explained, thereFIGURE 4.1 The Sephirotic Tree. Cesare d’ Evoli, De divinis attributis, quae sephirot ab hebraeisnuncupata (Venice, 1573), 8v.

(Ezek. 1:26–27)This man of Atsilut is the first reflection of God who has all the potentialfor will, intellect, compassion, and action. According to the cabala, allcreatures derive from this Adam Kadmon, including the angels and arch-angels. No wonder such notions also gave rise to ambitions of exaltatioand catalyzed efforts to contact the world of angels.The next Adam is of Beriah, who was created on the sixth day. Hestill possessed fully the emanation of God and the angels became jealousof him. This Adam existed already as an independent intellect; however,he had not yet been tested. The examination took place in Eden, theWorld of Formation where the male and female principles were sepa-rated. After the Fall, the fourth Adam came to life, the mortal, who hadto interact with the sphere of Matter and had to justify himself in theWorld of Making.As Scholem explains, the sefirotic tree is anthropomorphic and thesimile of man is often used to describe the sefirot.“The Biblical word that man was created in the image of God meanstwo things for the Kabbalist: first, that the power of the Sefiroth, theparadigm of divine life, exists and is active also in man. Secondly, thatthe world of the Sefiroth is capable of being visualized under the imageof man the created. From this it follows that the limbs of the humanbody are nothing but images of a certain spiritual mode of existencewhich manifests itself in the symbolic figure of Adam Kadmon, theprimordial man.” (1974, 215)As I have mentioned, the cabala is not only cosmology and anthro-pology; primarily it is teaching, a key to understanding and illumination.As opposed to the interpretation of the Torah, the recorded and publicteaching, the cabala was an esoteric knowledge, reserved only for a selectfew.15 By the Middle Ages we see the development of patterns of ecstatic-prophetic and meditative illumination that became highly individual"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"95Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magictechniques, sometimes involving only the mystical relationship of a masterand a disciple.Another, very important feature of the cabala was, however, that itmore strictly attached itself to the codified text than any other form ofmysticism. In the Bible creation happens through words and the truthfultestimony of God is also handed down in writing. Thus the cabala hascloser ties with the structures of verbal expression than to mystical orsymbolic imagery, and its system in a way becomes a whole philosophyof language.16 The three most important manipulative techniques of thecabala—in fact, adapted from earlier procedures of Hasidism—weregematria,notarikon, and temurah, all of which combined theology, lan-guage philosophy, and number symbolism. The first associated numericalvalues with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, thus allowing certainassociations on the basis of equal numerical meanings. Therefore thename of Adam could be equated with that of the Tetragrammaton.Notarikon was the interpretation of the letters of a word as abbreviationsof whole sentences, while temurah meant the interchanging of lettersaccording to certain systematic rules.The ultimate goal of all these practices was to reach illumination, orexaltatio. The cabalist—through various exercises and meditation—pre-pared for an inner journey by the end of which he was supposed to reachthe unification of the split, dualist universe. The earthly man, thetahutonim, that is, one of those “who live below,” was to have a glimpseof the elionim, the world of those “who live above.” Alongside other,platonically oriented philosophies, the cabala also professed the dignity ofman, capable of encompassing both lower and upper worlds. The caba-listic techniques promised the acquisition of external and internal sensa-tion, reaching downward and upward alike, even bridging different worlds,if necessary. This faculty is especially useful when divine emanation hasto be steered to areas where further development is needed or chaos rulesand where, due to this, the community lacks a mystical encouragement.I hope, even this sketchy outline of the cabala shows those areaswhere Christian humanists, already engaged in Platonic and hermeticmysticism, could take interest. Those were the concepts of emanationand ascension, the man-centered creation myth, the interpretation ofAdam as a demigod or demiurge, and, above all, the efforts to unite manwith his creator.Because of the above parallels, it is not surprising that from time totime syncretizing efforts took place between the Jewish, the Christian,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"96JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMand the Arabic-Muslim philosophies. Philo of Alexandria, the scholarwho developed the Jewish religion into a highly conceptual philosophyin the first century A.D. applied neoplatonism to systematize the descrip-tion of the religious experience. Philo used Greek philosophy to corrobo-rate monotheism, for himself a sacred doctrine. By bringing together theLaw of Jahve and the Law of the Logos, he tried to modernize the Rab-binic tradition. His notions of emanation and divine radiation later be-came incorporated in the works of the medieval Jewish philosophers,with the modification that the work of creation and government was notthe work of God directly, but rather required the help of mediators, suchas angels. As the Platonic ideas became angels in Christianity, a similardevelopment took place in Jewish theology, too. This is why the Zoharspeaks of “mediators” and the ten ranks of angels (as opposed to the nineangelic hierarchies in Pseudo-Dionysius).Pico’s “Oration,” Cabalistic Magic, and ExaltatioConsidering the historical circumstances, Pico almost seems predestined todiscover Jewish cabala for the purposes of Christian neoplatonism and totry to integrate its magic into the expanding system of Renaissance occult-ism. During the Middle Ages not only was the cabala basically hidden fromgentile scholars, but so were traditional rabbinic teaching, and even, by andlarge, the Hebrew language. This happened partly because Christians didnot trust the Jews, even suspecting that they consciously forged thosepassages of the Old Testament that were suitable for Christological expla-nations and Christian typological symbolism. Because of this atmosphere,those who became interested in the Hebrew language could not expectmuch support from Church institutions or the universities. Although in1311 Pope Clement V encouraged the study of Hebrew, Arabic, and Sirianlanguages, even at the time of the Synod of Basel in 1432, Hebrew depart-ments were not present within strongholds of Christian learning such asthe universities of Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca (Lloyd Jones1983, iv ff.). Another cause hindering the development of Hebrew studiesin Europe was the attitude of the Jews themselves who considered it to besacrilegious to share sacred knowledge with gentiles.The spread of humanism and the new ideas of the Renaissance finallychanged this situation. The humanist slogan “Back to the Sources” gen-erated efforts to research Hebrew and all the available texts surviving inthis language. The study of the Bible was continued on the basis of new,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"97Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicphilological methods with the aim of cleaning the Holy Writ of thedistortions of the previous centuries. From this time on the “three sacredtongues” (Latin, Greek and Hebrew) were of equal importance.Two Renaissance popes, Nicholas V and Sixtus IV, accumulatedsignificant collections of Hebrew manuscripts and encouraged translationsfrom Hebrew to Latin. The Florentine neoplatonists rejoiced concerningthis incentive since it fully coincided with their efforts to widen syncreticallythe theological and philosophical background of Christianity.17In summing up the motivations behind the heightened interest inHebrew studies, the following reasons ought to be taken into consider-ation: primarily there was a Christian-humanist motivation to incorpo-rate the third sacred language in the humanistically enlarged Christiantradition. Another important aspect was that until the Reformation frozethe boundaries of religious thinking, many humanists had hopes abouta new universal religion in which Christianity, Islam, and Judaism couldbe merged. I shall soon discuss the questions of these heterodox ideas,which strongly characterized the works of Christian cabalists from Picothrough Reuchlin to Postel, since traces of them can be found amongDee’s angelic prophecies, too. Last but not least, the attention of theFlorentine neoplatonists and their followers were turned toward Jewishculture because of certain similarities between the cabala and the her-metic doctrines of exaltatio.18We should remember that Renaissance humanists thought the her-metic writings were as old as the books of Moses. While calling theCorpus hermeticum “a book about the power and wisdom of God,” Ficinobecame interested in certain rabbinical texts for the sake of comparison.But he did not know Hebrew and was unaware of the full system of thecabala. Pico, on the other hand, took the decisive step of bridging theseparate traditions. In 1485, during a journey in Germany, Rudolf Agricolapraised him as a “man who is well versed in all languages, in Latin,Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, Arabic, and furthermore he is a theologian, aphilosopher, a poet and in all excellent” (quoted by Secret 1985, 25).Although modern scholarship has doubts about the perfection of Pico’sknowledge of Hebrew (for example, Lloyd-Jones 1983), his familiaritywith the cabala enabled him to develop hermetic-neoplatonic magic byinfusing a cabalistic cosmogony into the hermetic mythology. From aparallel analysis of the two, he concluded that according to Trismegistusas well as the cabala God created the world by means of words.In 1486 Pico went to Rome and advertized his nine hundred theses,in which he called for a public scholarly discussion of the possibility of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"98JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcreating a syncretic theory that could accommodate all religions and philo-sophical schools in order to make the Christian doctrines even more per-fect. The theses were not unanimously approved, and a year later Pico hadto defend himself from charges of dangerous heterodoxy. This polemicalmaterial nevertheless shows the twenty-three-year-old philosopher to havebeen a broad-minded humanist, interested in a wide range of topics, in-cluding mathematics, geography, medicine, and other sciences.19The theses, or theorems, were divided into larger sections, the first fewof which dealt with Christian, Arabic, Aristotelian, and Platonic philoso-phers: “Conclusiones secundum doctrines latinorum philosophorum ettheologorum,” “Conclusiones secundum doctrinam Arabum,” “Conclusionessecundum grecos, qui peripateticam sectam profitentur,” “Conclusionessecundum doctrinam philosophorum, qui Platonici dicuntur.” In the nextsection Pico offered his own arguments for the reconcilability of Aristotelismand Platonism (“Conclusiones numero quingentae secundum opinionempropriam”). Most startling was the last section—“Questiones ad quaspollicetur se per numeros responsurum”—in which he included subsec-tions dealing with the mysticism of Zoroaster and the Chaldeans, magic ingeneral, the mystical hymns of Orpheus, and, finally, seventy-one theses onthe Hebrew cabala: “Conclusiones cabalisticae numero 71, secundumopinionem propriam, ex ipsis Hebreorum sapientium fundamentisChristianam Religionem maxime confirmantes.”Pico advertised twenty-six theses on magic, which scholarship refersto as the Conclusiones magicae. In the first thesis Pico employs the ma-neuver of his mentor, Ficino, separating himself from the outset fromblack, diabolic magic. “Magia naturalis licita est, et non prohibita . . .”states the second thesis (Pico 1973, 78), and in the third he claims thatmagic is part of science. The following theses deal with questions ofmagic and the cabala, and claim that there are no more suitable meansfor proving the divinity of Christ than these: “Nulla est scientia que nosmagis certificet de divinitate Christi, quam Magia et Cabala”(Conclusionesmagicae 9, in Pico 1973, 79).The nine hundred theses were to be introduced by a preface, anoration on the dignity of man. Although the theses were never published,theOratio . .. was permitted to appear in 1487. This pamphlet is thepeak of Pico’s early career, perhaps his whole scholarly output. The viewsexpressed in it became emblematic images of Renaissance ideology.20According to the Oratio . .. there are two kinds of magic: one isharmful and is the work of demons, while the other is pure naturalphilosophy. The latter helps man to extend and exploit his potential to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"99Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicthe ultimate limits. The treatise starts with the famous saying of HermesTrismegistus, “Magnum, o Asclepi, miraculum est homo,” and this is themaxim that urged Pico to venture into his philosophical investigationconcerning the divine nature of man:When I weighed the reason for these maxims, the many grounds forthe excellence of human nature reported by many men failed to satisfyme—that man is the intermediary between creatures, the intimate ofthe gods, the king of the lower beings, the interpreter of nature, butlittle lower than the angels. [. . .] Admittedly great though these reasonsbe, they are not the principal grounds, that is, those which may right-fully claim for themselves the privilege of the highest admiration. Forwhy should we not admire more the angels themselves and the blessedchoirs of heaven? At last it seems to me I have come to understand whyman is the most fortunate of creatures and consequently worthy of alladmiration and what precisely is that rank which is his lot in theuniversal chain of Being—a rank to be envied not only by brutes buteven by the stars and by minds beyond this world. (Section 1; Pico1948, 223)In the following sections he argues that the divine nature of man hasroots in God’s desire to have a creature of universal potential who canfully appreciate the work of creation:When the work was finished, the Craftsman kept wishing that therewere someone to ponder the plan of so great a work, to love its beauty,and to wonder at its vastness. Therefore, when everything was done (asMoses and Timaeus bear witness), He finally took thought concerningthe creation of man. [. . .] He therefore took man as a creature ofindeterminate nature and, assigning him a place in the middle of theworld, addressed him thus: “Neither a fixed abode nor a form that isthine alone nor any function peculiar to thyself have we given thee,Adam, to the end that according to thy longing and according to thyjudgement thou mayest have and possess what abode, what form, andwhat function thou thyself shalt desire.” (Sections 2–3, 224)This special status, the concentration of potential and possibilities,then ordain man to shape his fate with full freedom and even elevatehimself directly to God:We have made thee neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal norimmortal, so that with freedom of choice and with honor, as though"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"100JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe maker and molder of thyself, thou mayest fashion thyself in what-ever shape thou shalt prefer. Thou shalt have the power to degenerateinto the lower forms of life, which are brutish. Thou shalt have thepower, out of thy soul’s judgement, to be reborn into the higher forms,which are divine. (section 3, 225)From this statement Cassirer postulated the novelty of the Renaissanceworld picture in comparison with that of the Middle Ages: the so-calledman-centered ideology is nothing but the idea of man capable of exaltatio,of moving upward along the Great Chain of Being and becoming thepartner of the Creator. Pico himself must have felt rapture from his ownthoughts because the following passages reach an exalted poetical intensity:O supreme generosity of god the Father, O highest and most marvelousfelicity of man! To him it is granted to have whatever he chooses, tobe whatever he wills. [. . .] And if, happy in the lot of no created thing,he withdraws into the center of his own unity, his spirit, made one withGod, in the solitary darkness of God, who is set above all things, shallsurpass them all. (section 4, 225)After corroborating his thesis about the privileged place of man byciting the Bible and classical authors, he poses the question: “what oughtwe to do to achieve ascension?” Following the Apostle Paul and Dionysiusthe Areopagite he suggests that the first step is purification (cf. Völker1958, passim). This will lead to illumination and perfection. Pico’s argu-mentation is quite eclectic: the variety of his sources indicates that thenew theology will have to be an amalgamation of the great world reli-gions and that Christianity will have to be renewed with the help ofclassical philosophy. He refers to Jacob’s ladder and the example of Jobfrom the Old Testament, then he mentions the Egyptian mythology ofOsiris to which he adds a few thoughts from Empedocles.Then he outlines the hierarchy of human learning, setting up thefollowing triad: moral philosophy—natural philosophy and dialectics—theology. This threefold division corresponds to the neoplatonic conceptof sensual, rational, and intuitive knowledge. On the highest level onefinds the Peace that springs from the understanding of the One andPrimordial Truth, no matter whether it is the result of Christian,Pythagorean, or cabalistical meditation:This is that peace which God creates in his heavens, which the angelsdescending to earth proclaimed to men of good will, that through it"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"101Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian Magicmen might ascend to heaven and become angels. Let us wish this peacefor our friends, for our century. (section 14, 232)Pico draws a parallel between the process of initiation in Moses andin the Greek mysteries before he comes to a conclusion by restating theprogram of ultimate sacred exaltatio:Who would not long to be initiated into such sacred rites? Who wouldnot desire, by neglecting all human concerns, by despising the goodsof fortune, and by disregarding those of the body, to become the guestof the gods while yet living on earth, and, made drunk by the nectarof eternity, to be endowed with the gifts of immortality though still amortal being? (section 16, 233)The second part of the Oratio . . ., after having introduced the stateof rapture through sacred illumination, is devoted to a detailed method-ology of achieving the desired ascension to God. Here Pico supportsApollo’s precepts derived from the oracle of Delphoi (“Nothing too much,”“Know thyself,” “Thou art” [i.e., the theological greeting, \b_]); then heoffers an imposing outline of various philosophical schools, beginningwith the teachings of Pythagoras, Socrates, Chaldean magic, and Zoroaster,continuing with Christian philosophers (Augustinus, John Scotus Erigena,Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus), the Arabs (Averroes, Alfarabi,Avicenna), and finishing with the Greek platonists (Theophrastus,Ammonius, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Plotinus, Proclus, and others). At thispoint he openly attests syncretism:I have so prepared myself that, pledged to the doctrines of no man, Ihave ranged through all the masters of philosophy, investigated allbooks, and come to know all schools. Therefore, I had to speak of themall. (section 26, 242)[. . .] This has been my reason for wishing to bring before thepublic the opinions not of a single school alone but rather of everyschool. (section 28, 244)After this methodological introduction, Pico discusses in a detailed wayhis sources belonging to heterodox or apocryphal philosophical trends,such as the hermetic writings, Pythagorean mysticism, and the Jewishcabala. Finally he adds his own conclusions:I have not been content to add to the tenets held in common manyteachings taken from the ancient theology of Hermes Trismegistus,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"102JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMmany from the doctrines of the Chaldeans and of Pythagoras, andmany from the occult mysteries of the Hebrews. I have proposed alsoas subjects for discussion several theses in natural philosophy and indivinity, discovered and studied by me. (section 29, 245)Hereafter Pico summarizes his nine hundred theses which he orders in sixgroups: the first group covers the correspondences between Plato andAristotle whom Pico does not see as irreconcilable as many of his contem-poraries thought (section 29). The second group offers seventy-two newpropositions concerning natural philosophy and metaphysics derived fromthe parallel study of both Plato and Aristotle (section 30). The third greattopic is Pythagorean number mysticism (section 31); the fourth is the areaof magic (sections 32–33); the fifth touches upon the cabala (sections 34–37); and, finally, in the sixth group Pico explains his own ideas concerningthe prophetic verses of Orpheus and Zoroaster (section 37).For our present concern, we should concentrate on the propositionsrelating to magic and the cabala. He continually emphasizes the differencebetween white and black magic, that is mageisandgoétia.Here he citesPorphyry to assert that the word magus in Persian means the interpreter ofthe gods. From the history of white magic he mentions the ancients(Zalmoxis, Zoroaster, Plato, Apollonius, Hostanes, and Dardanus), the ArabAl-Kindi, and medieval authorities (Roger Bacon and Villiam of Auvergne).All of them practiced a magic that “rouses [the magus] to the admirationof God’s works which is the most certain condition of a willing faith, hope,and love” (section 33, 249). Pico uses a metaphor that reminds one ofFicino: “As the farmer weds his elms to vines, even so does the magus wedearth to heaven, that is, he weds lower things to the endowments andpowers of higher things” (ibid.). Pico’s image suggests an ambition to jointhe sypathetic magic of the Middle Ages with the new, hermetic theology.But how to avoid the mixing of the two magics, white and black? Howcan the magus preserve his purity during the concrete operations? This is tobe achieved with the help of the mystical lore of the Jews, the cabala.I come now to the things I have elicited from the ancient mysteries ofthe Hebrews and have cited for the confirmation of the inviolableCatholic faith. [. . .] Not only the famous doctors of the Hebrews, butalso from among men of our opinion Esdras, Hilary, and Origen writethat Moses on the mount received from God not only the Law, whichhe left to posterity written down in five books, but also a true and moreoccult explanation of the Law. (section 34, 250)[In it t]here is the mystery of the Trinity, there the Incarnation ofthe Word, there the divinity of the Messiah. . . . (section 36, 252)"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"103Florentine Neoplatonism and Christian MagicAlthough the Oratio . .. does not say more about the connection ofmagic and the cabala, from the Conclusiones magicae one can see that forPico it was the cabala that could ensure the safe handling of magic. Thereason for this was that the cabala dealt only with the sacred names ofGod and the angels, with the sacred letters of the “holy tongue,” and sobecause of its medium could not turn in any dangerous direction.As we know, John Dee had an 1532 edition of Pico’s nine hundredtheses (R&W 974, B121). What could he have found crucial in themand in the introductory Oratio . . .? To begin with, certainly the boldand daring spirit advocating philosophical and theological syncretism andat the same time fervently rejecting the charges that his experimentscould be termed as black magic. Dee also might have been attracted bythe lofty, sometimes nearly poetical diction of the introduction in de-scribing the exaltatio—a style toward which he himself often tended. Asfor the theses, they were written in Dee’s favorite scientific genre, a seriesof theorems such as he used to express his ideas in the Propaedeumataaphoristica and the Monas hieroglyphica. Furthermore, in Pico’s work hecould find references to a mix of classical, Arabic, and Christian authors,and he also could gain inspiration to look into the hermetic writings aswell as the cabala. Last, but not least, in the Oratio . .. one finds someof Dee’s crucial iconographical-ideological motifs, like the mention ofJacob’s ladder and several references to Enoch’s translation from earth tothe throne of God and his conversations with angels.kTo summarize, in the magical ideology of the Florentine neoplatonists,we can see that the texts I have reread as Dee’s possible sources were richin theoretical observations and programmatic recommendations, althoughthey provided little in the way of technological advice in practical direc-tions. This could follow because of several reasons, including the naturalcaution of theologians and the fact that natural science in fifteenth-century Italy was not in the forefront of investigations. Thirdly, theneoplatonist orientation, in fact, worked against the pursuit of systematicexperimentation, since Platonism always favored theoretical speculationsand metaphoric expression as opposed to more rationalistic Aristotelianism.In this respect even Pico, who tried to reconcile Plato and Aristotle, ismore a Platonist than an Aristotelian, at least in this early period of hiscareer. Later, when he started criticizing judicial astrology, for example,his argumentation became more critical and analytical (Disputationesadversus astrologiam divinatricem, 1496).21"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThe sixteenth century brought significant changes in the status as wellas in the practice of Renaissance magic. For a while the Scientific Revolutionfound it inspiring to incorporate magical ideas: this transitional period fromthe organic to the new mechanical world picture can be dated from the1510s to Newton’s synthesis at the end of the seventeenth century.Beside the Scientific Revolution, other cultural-historical factors, suchas the revolution in Renaissance art and esthetics, the great religious Ref-ormation, the period of eschatological-chiliastic prophecies, and the infor-mation explosion resulting from printing, all contributed to the spreadingand changing of magical concepts. In the next chapter I shall look at thesymbolical-metaphorical systems of a few sixteenth-century magical think-ers—Trithemius, Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Postel—who belonged to thegeneration immediately preceding Dee and whose works seem directly tohave influenced the intellectual development of the English Doctor."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"5Occult Philosophy, Symbolism,and ScienceDuring the sixteenth century the pious and speculative magic that char-acterized the works of the earlier Renaissance humanists, such as theFlorentine philosophers, radically changed from the enthusiastic study ofthe ancient texts containing the prisca theologia to an ambition to influenceand manipulate the supernatural powers.When recognizing this, one has to be careful not to jump to earlyconclusions. The changes did not occur as a line or development fromFlorentine hermeticism to Agrippan magic, as Frances Yates tried to makeus believe. While undoubtedly appreciating the neoplatonist magi, the nextgeneration also capitalized on dark medieval practices that were quiteunimaginable to their humanist mentors. Later I shall propose a hypothesisas to why these changes took place, but first let us see some of the detailsof this new magical pattern in early modern European thinking.TRITHEMIUS AND ANGEL MAGICJohn Dee admittedly found Trithemius’ Steganographia to be the greatestinspiration in his own recourse to magical philosophy and theology. In1562 he visited Leuven, one of his favorite cities, a center of learningwhich he had already visited several times before. Perhaps it is here thathe wrote the unpublished “Cabbalae Hebraicae compendiosa tabella”(Roberts and Watson 1990, 76), which shows his rising interest in thecabala and angel theology. At that time he purchased manuscripts of105"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMastronomical and astrological interest (R&W M119, M120), some bookson Hebrew grammar (R&W 1600, 1612), and Jacques Gohory’s deeplyhermeticalDe usu & mysteriis liber (Paris 1550), which dealt with num-ber symbolism and preserves Dee’s annotations on the Monad. Probablythis is the intellectual context from which the idea of the Monashieroglyphica sprang and it must have been catalyzed by his acquaintancewith the work of Trithemius, as we learn from Dee’s letter written to hispatron, Sir William Cecil, dated from Antwerp in February of the follow-ing year.1This letter is an excellent specimen of Dee’s humanist style wherepersonal information, scholarly speculations, and passages consideringthe politics of patronage are melded together:Briefly to place before your eyes the chief of my requests, thus standethmy case. [. . .] Wherein our country hath no man hable to set furth hisfote, or shew his hand: as in the science De numeris formalibus, thescienceDe ponderibus mysticis, and the science De mensuris divinis:(by which three the huge frame of this world is fashioned) [. . .] aftermy long serche and study, great cost and travaile have fallen under myperseverance and understanding. (Dee 1854, 6–7)The quoted passage clearly shows the directions of Dee’s scholarly interestat that time: formal mathematics, occult mysticism, and the question ofdivine measures—all aspects that feature in the Monas hieroglyphica. Inthe following section Dee speaks about his own plans: he prepares topublish a work of his own but is still in search of a suitable printer. Afterpolitely asking for further sponsorship from Cecil, he comes to the mostimportant piece of information:Already I have purchased one boke, for which a thowsand crownes haveben by others offred, and yet could not be obteyned; a boke whose useis greater than the fame thereof is spread; the name thereof to you isnot unknowne. The title is on this wise, Steganographia Trithemij....(9–10)We learn furthermore that he employed a Hungarian nobleman to copythis book, which ultimately would become a present to his patron: “Igive unto your Honor, as the most precyous juell that I have yet of othermens travailes recovered” (11).Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516), the Abbot of Sponheim, is one ofthe most important Renaissance thinkers who devoted himself consciously"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"107Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Scienceto the study of angelology, seeking to syncretize the medieval traditionswith that of the new neoplatonist philosophy.2 At first sight hisSteganographia (written in 1499 but published only in 1606) looks to bea work on writing systems and cyphers; in fact, is an interesting exampleof applied magic.3 In Trithemius’ system, alchemy, cabalistical numbersymbolism, and magic are united and magic is interpreted as the meansofexaltatio, the theologically justifiable mystical elevation to God.This clearly seems to be connected with Pico’s theory of magical illu-mination, but Noel Brann in his new monograph on Trithemius’ magicdifferentiates among his sources according to Patristic and medieval de-monology on the one hand and medieval and early modern defensesof magic on the other (1999, 13–33). Brann discusses Trithemius’demonological vision and occult vision in separate chapters, suggesting thathis angelology had stronger ties to the medieval monastic heritage, whilehis complex occult philosophy was more the product of the Renaissance.In a letter addressed to his humanist friend, Arnold Bostius, Trithemiushimself heralded his Steganographia as follows:[it will] teach very profound, marvelous, and incredible things to all whoare ignorant of them, things which have never been heard of by this age.[. . .] If ever published, will be marveled at by the entire world. . .4As he informed Bostius, the first book would deal with a hundred waysof secret writing, the second with ways of sending messages through greatdistances “without words, without writing, even without signs”; the thirdbook would demonstrate a new and extremely fast way of teaching Latin;while the last book would be devoted to the transmission of thoughts fromone person to another, totally secretly, even in the company of others.The author had considerable misfortune with his letter to Bostius:because of the death of the adressee it was misdirected and became public,appalling many conservative church authorities, even humanists. A fur-ther blow was the visit of the famous French humanist and philosopherof the Great Chain of Being, Bovillus (Charles de Bouelles), to Sponheim,where Trithemius tried to convince him about his magical ideas. Bovillus,although not insensitive to the hermetic philosophy,5 seems to have dis-approved totally of what was presented by Trithemius. As he wrote totheir mutual friend, Germaine de Ganay, another humanist interested inmagic, the unaccustomed names of spirits and the demonological proce-dures described in the Steganographia terrified him, and his overall con-clusion was that Trithemius was “a magician who is not in the least"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"108JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMdegree distinguished in philosophy.”6 In this letter he also went intodetails concerning the Abbot’s angelic magic, which consisted of desig-nating the names of spirits for conjurations according to various ranks(emperors, dukes, counts, and servants) and associating them with thetwelve regions of the world as well as the forty winds of the universe. Atthis point Bouelles remarked that Trithemius seemed to him to be betterrepresenting the ancient demon-conjuring Zoroaster than the demon-shunning Christian saints.Although Bouelles’ critique was quite devastating to the reputationof Trithemius, one can imagine to what extent Dee, who possessed tenbooks by Bovillus including De intellectu in the 1510 edition (R&W311), became interested in the author of the Steganographia. In fact, hishierarchies of angels in the 48 claves angelicae (Dee 1584) and his invo-cations in the Tabula bonorum angelorum; Fundamenta invocationum (Dee1588) had close kinship with the system of Trithemius.Abbot Trithemius was not deterred from his devotion to angelicmagic by the criticisms. Just the opposite, in his last years he went ondefending, expanding, and explicating his magic in his autobiographicaltract,Nepiachus, his appendix to his main work, Clavis steganographiae,and in various letters written to patrons and fellow scholars. Brann sum-marizes this last phase of Trithemius’ career as follows: “The apologeticstrategy adopted by Trithemius went beyond arguing for a mere tolera-tion of magic by Christians, after removing magic from the exclusivedomain of the demons, of putting it in the service of Christian theology.[. . .] In this more sublime sense, Trithemius determined, the essentialaffiliation of magic is not with the secular arts and sciences, but with thereligious quest for God” (1999, 90).In Trithemius’ magical system, alchemy, magic, and cabalistical num-ber symbolism are intermingled, and—similar to Pico’s strategy—hedefends magic by relegating it to the sphere of the highest intellectualactivities. As he describes exaltatio:The alchemists make promises with reference to compoud bodies, butthey err; they are deceived, and they deceive everyone who willinglylistens to them. They want to imitate nature and to divide what isexclusively a whole, since they do not understand the basis of virtue andnature. [. . .] Our philosophy is not earthly but rather celestial so that wemight perceive that highest principle, which we call God. [. . .] The mindis free; it does not follow motion, but rather a supercelestial principle bywhich it was created and by which it communicates so much. (Epistolarumfamiliarum, 1536, 90–93; quoted by Baron 1978, 95)"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"109Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceTrithemius had a discordant personality, similar to the other protago-nists of my book who contributed to the development of Renaissancemagic. On the one hand, he was a widely read and highly culturedhumanist who also had a visionary, perhaps somewhat frantic mind, forwhom the ultimate evidence could only be supernatural revelation. Thisdilemma could be associated with what Deborah Harkness calls the “cri-sis of the Book of Nature” (1999, 64–71). However, for Ficino, Pico, andalso for Trithemius, this revelation did not result from sacred simplicity,but rather from the cognitive faculties of the human intellect. Accordingto the train of logic of the following quotation, Trithemius appears asalmost a forerunner of the rationalism of Hobbes and Locke, except, ofcourse, for his clinging to the final revelation:Study generates knowledge; knowledge bears love; love, likeness; like-ness, communion; communion, virtue; virtue, dignity; dignity, power;and power performs the miracle. This is the unique path to the goal ofmagic perfection, divine as well as natural. (Epistolarum familiarum,92; Thorndike’s translation, 1923–1958, 6:439)The quotation embraces knowledge, exaltatio, and power, constituting a“holy trinity” of the magi. The scholarly way of illumination for Trithemiusleads through mathematics and Pythagorean number symbolism, enrichedby the numerology of the cabala. In this respect his main sources werePico and the greatest Hebraist of the Renaissance, Reuchlin, who devotedtwo books to the occult mysteries of the cabala7 and to whom Trithemiusreferred as his mentor.The speculative theology of Trithemius was built on a paradigm thataimed at developing the variety embedded in the duality of the worldthrough the trinity into a sacred unity. The soul, aspiring toward thissacred sphere, could elevate itself to the metaphysical world only bycomprehending the mysteries of nature, especially of numbers. Although,according to his letter to Ganay, quoted above, Trithemius seemed not toapprove of practical alchemy, he extensively referred to the Tabulasmaragdina, which he interpreted not simply as an alchemical recipe, butas a concise mystical cosmology. In this context he repeatedly used thetermreformatio magica, “referring to a passage of the soul, on the modelof alchemy, through a series of purgative stages to a state of godlikesanctity and ‘enlightenment’ ” (Brann 1999, 116). As we shall see, Dee,in the middle period of his career, employed similar syncretism in con-structing the hieroglyphic monad, fusing mathematics and alchemy inorder to achieve spiritual exaltatio."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"110JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMOne of Trithemius’ last works could have influenced the later Dee inconstructing his own vision of the angelic world. In 1508 the Abbot ofSponheim addressed a treatise to Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg8 inwhich explained the seven secondary gods or demons moving the sevenplanets and also offered prophecies concerning world history up to thetwentieth century.9 Although Trithemius maintained that the human mindwas free from the influence of the stars, in his scheme of planetary history(partly borrowed from the thirteenth-century Paduan alchemist Pietrod’Abano) each of the seven planetary spheres is governed by an angel whois also responsible over a historical period, lasting 354 solar years and fourlunar months. The angels of the planetary spheres are as follows: Orifielfor Saturn, Anael for Venus, Zachariel for Jupiter, Raphael for Mercury,Samael for Mars, Gabriel for the Moon, and Michael for the Sun (Brann1999, 134; Thorndike 1923–1958, 6:441). This scheme again may re-mind us of Dee’s De heptarchia mystica. Although the Doctor employeddifferent angel names, he also divided his angels into ranks of Kings,Princes, Subjects, and Servants, and one of his admitted aims was to learnabout the future history of mankind.Right after the time of writing his De septem secundeis in 1509,Trithemius received yet another visitor with whom he discoursed aboutmagic and the occult sciences. The visitor was the still young Germanhumanist Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, who a year laterdedicated the first edition of his main work, De occulta philosophia (1510),to the aging master.10AGRIPPA’S TRIPARTITE MAGICIf Trithemius’ magical experiements pointed much beyond the humblebeginnings of Florentine Renaissance magic, Agrippa (1486–1535) couldbe termed as the Renaissance magus par excellence. He also relied inmany respects on the achievments of his predecessors—ancient philoso-phers, medieval scholars, and contemporary humanists alike. Neverthe-less he was able to create a unique system distinguishing him from ev-eryone else dabbling in magic and cabalistical mysticism.His main works show a curious chronological mismatch: the Deocculta philosophica was written in 1510, but its definitive edition waspublished only in 1533, not much before Agrippa’s death. His othermajor work, De incertitudine et vanitate omnium scientiarum et artiumatque excellentia verbi dei declamatio, on the other hand, was published"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"111Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencetwice before that and the paradoxical fact is that while De occultaphilosophia was meant to be a huge primer in magic, the much slimmerand highly ironic De incertitudine . .. in many respects refuted and dis-avowed his other work published only two years later. Since the twobooks are almost exact opposites of each other, cultural historians havepondered why the author allowed the publication of his enthusiasticaffirmation of magic to happen after he had expressed his scepticismabout the topic (Keefer 1988, 618). Before examining this question, Iwould like to set myself to a general survey of De occulta philosophia,naturally concentrating on the theme of exaltatio.De occulta philosophiaFollowing Dionysius the Areopagite, Agrippa maintained that theuniversum consists of three worlds: the elemental, celestial, and spirit-worlds. Agrippa classified magical operations according to these spheres,too. His system of magic, however, as Keith Thomas emphasized, needednot only the cosmos of the medieval magia naturalis, but also the empha-ses of Renaissance neoplatonism, such as the doctrine of the dignity ofman and the classical notion that the spirit world and the elementalworld could melt into each other: “The potentialities open to humaningenuity were greatly enhanced by the tide of Neoplatonism whichswept through Renaissance Europe” (Thomas 1971, 265).The first book of De occulta philosophia dealt with elemental, ornatural magic, and mostly concerned itself with the sympathies inherentin the organic world model. Next to the questions of magia naturalis,however, already on the first pages of the book are references to magicalexaltatio. Agrippa refers explicitely to magic in a more direct way thanFicino or Pico:Seeing there is a threefold world, elementary, celestial, and intellectual,and every inferior is governed by its superior, and receiveth the influenceof the virtues thereof, so that the very original, and chief Worker of alldoth by angels, the heavens, stars, elements, animals, plants, metals,and stones convey from itself the virtues of his omnipotency upon us,for whose service he made, and created all these things: wise men [i.e.magi] conceive it no way irrational that it should be possible for us toascend by the same degrees through each world, to the same veryoriginal world itself, the Maker of all things, and First Cause, fromwhence all things are, and proceed; and also to enjoy not only these"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"112JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMvirtues, which are already in the more excellent kind of things, but alsobesides these, to draw new virtues from above. Hence it is that theyseek after the virtues of the elementary world, through the help ofphysic, and natural philosophy in the various mixtions of natural things,then of the celestial world in the rays, and influences thereof, accordingto the rules of astrologers, and the doctrines of mathematicians, joiningthe celestial vertues to the former: moreover, they ratify and confirm allthese with the powers of divers intelligencies, through the sacred cer-emonies of religion. (1.1; Agrippa 1997, 3)11When discussing the connections of natural sympathies and the spiritworld, Agrippa arrives at the question of talismanic magic already treatedby Ficino. For example, if you want to capture the power of the Sun, seekthose things that are solar:amongs vegetables, plants, metals, stones, and animals, these things areto be used, and taken chiefly, which in a solary order are higher. Sothou shalt draw a singular gift from the Sun through the beams thereof,being seasonably received together, and through the Spirit of the World.(1.34, 105)Chapter 37 summarizes the system of the Great Chain of Being, givingat the same time an exact definition of magic. Citing the Platonists,Hermes Trismegistus, and Jarchas the Brahmin,12 he states that every-thing existing in the elementary world has a counterpart in the celestialsphere, too. The middle nature, or quintessence that keeps togetherthe Chain of Being, is generated in turn by the ultimately superiorhighest Archetype:Now the first image of God is the world; of the world, man; of man,beasts; of beasts, the zeophyton i.e. half-animal and half-plant; of plants,metals; of metals, stones. And again in things spiritual, the plant agreeswith a brute in vegetation, a brute with a man in sense, man with anangel in understanding, an angel with God in immortality. Divinity isannexed to the mind, the mind to the intellect, the intellect to theintention, the intention to the imagination, the imagination tothe senses, the senses at last to things. (1.37, 110)This chapter also emphasizes the bi-directional nature of this organiccommunication, which suggests the understanding of the entire cosmosas a homogeneous whole. This homogeneity is exploited by magic:"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"113Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceHence everything may be aptly reduced from these inferiors to thestars, from the stars to their intelligences, and from thence to the Firstcause itself; from the series, and order whereof whole magic, and alloccult philosophy flows. (ibid.)As we shall see, John Dee spoke about the cosmos as a well-tuned lyreon which the magus can play. His thought might go back to Agrippa,who also states in Chapter 37 thatFor so inferiors are succesively joined to their superiors, that thereproceedes an influence from their head, the First Cause, as a certainstring stretched out [. . .] of which string if one end be touched, thewhole doth presently shake, and such a touch doth sound to the otherend, and at the motion of the inferior, the superior also is moved, towhich the other does answer, as strings in a lute well tuned. (1.37, 111)Based on the doctrine of sympathies, then, natural magic can manipulatepowers from this world as well as from the world of demons (1.39).Witchcraft using magical power, the wearing of magic rings and amulets,even the some practices of raising the dead are treated under this field ofoccultism (1.42–48).After discussing the general features of the tiers of the cosmos, Agrippacomes to treating of the microcosm, man. Here he speaks of those hu-man faculties that are capable of magical operations. Among others, hementions the power of dreams that arise either from the memories of realexperiences or can be sent by spiritual agencies. As a consequence, ouremotions may greatly intensify even to the extent of changing our physi-cal shape, transposing our body to faraway places or influencing magi-cally other human beings. He underscores here the communicative powerof language:It being showed that there is a great power in the affections of the soul,you must know moreover, that there is no less virtue in words, and inthe names of things, but greatest of all in speeches. (1.69, 211)Uttered words have magic power, especially proper names: “That propernames are very necessary in magical operations, almost all men testify”(1.70, 213). Stronger than proper names are “sentences,” such as en-chantments, invocations, orations, conjurations, and the like (1.71). BookOne closes with a review of these, which are treated again under ceremo-nial magic in Book Three."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMBook Two starts with a discussion of mathematical magic, and dis-cusses the power of numbers:Severinus Boethius saith, that all things which were first made by thenature of things in its first age, seem to be formed by the proportionof numbers, for this was the principal pattern in the mind of theCreator. Hence is borrowed the number of the elements, hence thecourses of times, hence the motion of the stars, and the revolution ofthe heaven, and the state of all things subsist by the uniting togetherof numbers. Numbers therefore are endowed with great and sublimevirtues. (2.2, 237)13Mechanics and optics are based on abstract mathematical science andare capable of creating wonders. Such were the automata of Dedalus, thespeaking statues of Hermes Trismegistus,14 the flying wooden dove of Arthita,and all the optical miracles reported by classical and medieval authorities(2.1). This enthusiasm for mechanics and optics would be very importantin forming John Dee’s Mathematical preface, too. Dee himself created sucha “mechanical wonder,” a flying scarabeus that was used at a school dramaperformance in Cambridge and earned for its creator the fame of “conju-ror,” as Dee often complained (e.g., Dee 1851, 5).This Agrippan magia naturalis is the territory that links theologicalmagic with the new, rising, natural sciences. This is the terrain in whichthe occult fantasies of Roger Bacon through to Leonardo da Vinci, dellaPorta, and Francis Bacon were almost freely mixing with surprisinglyrational propositions. Take, for example, Agrippa’s sober remark:Therefore [people] seeing any wonderful sight, do impute it to theDevil, as his work, or think it is a miracle, which indeed is a work ofnatural, or mathematical philosophy. [. . .] But here it is convenientthat you know, that as by natural virtues we collect natural virtues, soby abstracted, mathematical, and celestial, we receive celestial virtues,as motion, life, sense, speech, soothsaying, and divination, even inmatter less disposed, as that which is not made by nature, but onlyby art. (2.1, 234)The second part of the quotation also shows that rationally approachablenatural science only partially excites Agrippa. His main concern is themanipulation of natural and supernatural forces by magical means, whichin this chapter he identifies with abstract, mathematical formulas. Andsince the most divine kind of numerology is the cabala, Book Two exten-"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"115Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencesively deals with the possibilities of synthetizing Christian philosophyand Jewish number symbolism. Chapter 2.27 offers a memorable imageof the microcosm, based on mathematical-poetical iconography:Seeing Man is the most beautiful and perfectest work of God, and hisimage, and also the lesser world; therefore he by a more perfect com-position, and sweet harmony, and more sublime dignity doth containand maintain in himself all numbers, measures, weights, motions, el-ements, and all other things which are of composition. [. . .] Fromhence all the ancients in time past did number by their fingers, andshowed all numbers by them; and they seem to prove that from thevery joints of man’s body all numbers, measures, proportions, andharmonies were invented; hence according to this measure of the body,they framed, and contrived their temples, palaces, houses, theaters; alsotheir ships, engines, and every kind of artifice. [. . .] Moreover Godhimself [. . .] made the whole fabric of the world proportionableto man’s body; from hence it is called the great world, man’s body theless. (2.27, 345)Book Three of ceremonial magic begins with passages emphasizingthe importance, power, and usefulness of religion. Interestingly, Agrippadoes not classify magic within the larger system of religion, just theopposite: “The religious operation obtains no less efficacy which oft-times of itself alone is sufficiently powerful for us to obtain this deifyingvirtue . . .” (3.3, 449). And, of course, needless to say, magic in associa-tion with religious rites has no other purpose than to achieve the exaltatio:Now we will declare a mystical and secret manner, necessary for every-one who desireth to practice this art, which is both the beginning,perfection, and key of all magical operations, and it is the dignifying ofmen to this so sublime virtue and power, for this faculty requireth inman a wonderful dignification. (3.3, 448; emphasis mine)Since a true magus needs to know God as much as possible, lengthytheological discussion is inserted here on the nature of God, on his namesand their power (3.12), about the heavenly spirits (3.15), then of aboutthree types of intelligences and daemons (undoubtedly based on Iamblichusand Proclus, cf. 3.16) and the types of malevolent demons (3.18). Indiscussing Dee’s angel magic, it will be useful to return to these chaptersfor further scrutiny. Another chapter on the language of angels also pointstoward Dee’s occultism. This language, according to the ancients, could"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"116JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMbe nothing but Hebrew, since “that was the first of all, and came fromheaven, and was before the confusion of languages in Babylon [. . .] andseeing all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corrup-tions, this alone doth always continue inviolated” (3.23, 530). As op-posed to the above view, Agrippa speaks about the angelic language withouttrying to tie it to any existing human idiom: “that instrument, whatso-ever the virtue be, by which one spirit makes known to another spiritwhat things are in his mind, is called by the apostle Paul the tongue ofangels” (ibid.).As for concrete magical operations, the magus needs to be in contactmostly with inferior spiritual orders. Agrippa, just like Faustus in thelegend, was most interested in the possibility of regulating natural forcesby occult means:I have seen and known some, writing on virgin parchment the nameand seal of some spirit in the hour of the Moon: which when afterwardhe gave to be devoured by a water frog, and had muttered over someverse, the frog being let go in the water, rains and showers presentlyfollowed. I saw also the same man15 inscribing the name of anotherspirit whith the seal thereof in the hour of Mars, which was given toa crow, who being let go, after a verse muttered over, there followedhorrible thunders with thick clouds. Neither were those names of spir-its of an unknown tongue, neither did they signify anything else buttheir offices. Of this kind are the names of those angels, Raziel, Gabriel,Michael, Raphael, Haniel. . . . (3.24, 532)Since Agrippa devoted all three of his books to the overlappingsystems of the macro- and the microcosms, Book Three also has chap-ters relating directly to man. While Book One discussed the elementalcomposition of the body and Book Two pondered the mystical numer-ology of its proportions, Book Three concentrates on the act of cre-ations and on the power of the human intellect. The ideology of thispart follows quite closely Pico’s Oration, adding to it the description ofconcrete magical procedures.The creation of man is presented more on the basis of the Corpushermeticum than on the Bible. Agrippa’s man is strong and determined,before everything he needs to know himself (as if following the ancientPlatonic advice: know thyself!)—but this knowledge should lead to theperfect knowledge of God, too: “Whosoever therefore shall know him-self, shall know all things in himself; especially he shall know God,according to whose image he was made” (3.36, 580). The process of"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"117Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencedeification, or exaltatio, is compared here to spiritual alchemy, the kindof transmutation already mentioned by the Arabic philosopher, Geber:And Geber in his Sum of Alchemy16 teacheth, that no man can cometo the perfection of this art, who shall not know the principles of it inhimself; but how much the more everyone shall know himself, by somuch operateth greater and more wonderful things, and will ascend toso great a perfection, that he is made the son of God, and is transformedinto the image which is God, and is united with him, which is not grantedto angels, the world, or any creature, but to man only. (3.36, 580;emphasis mine)The hermetic exaltatio of Ficino and Pico here is explained with theprecision of a scientist:Man being united to God, all things which are in man, are united,especially his mind, then the spirits and animal powers, and vegetativefaculty, and the elements are to the matter, drawing with itself even thebody [. . .] even until it be glorified into immortality. (3.36, 580)From this special status of man it follows that it is difficult to learnabout the nature of the two components of his existence: the immortal souland the mortal body. It is especially difficult to find out what happens tothese after death. Agrippa devotes a number of chapters to the theoriesconcerning the immortality of the soul and he touches upon those in-stances when dead souls cannot rest and return to this world. The magicalaspect of this problem, according to Agrippa the highest degree of ceremo-nial magic, is the calling of these spirits by magicians for help in variousworldly matters: “By what ways the magicians and necromancers do thinkthey can call forth the souls of the dead” (3.42). It was especially becauseof this part of De occulta philosophia that Agrippa was known in the Re-naissance as a sorcerer and a dangerous heretic. This must be the reasonwhy he became Faustus’ teacher in Marlowe drama and why a notorioussixteenth-century compendium of black magic was published as “The FourthBook of Cornelius Agrippa.” This book came out sometime after Agrippa’sdeath, and scholars have ruled out that he could have written it. JohannWeyer, the “doctor of witches,” also rejected this possibility. “The FourthBook” nevertheless relies on Agrippa’s genuine work and this similaritymust have contributed to the bad reputation of the German humanist.17John Dee’s library catalogue proves that he possessed the 1550 Baseledition (R&W 742) which contained the spurious “Fourth Book” as well as"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"118JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMother important treatises on ceremonial magic, such as Peter of Abano’sHeptameron, “Ratio compendiaria Magiae naturalis ex Plinio,” “Disputatiode Fascinationibus,” “De incantatione et Adiuratione, Epistola incerti authoris,”Trithemius’ Apologetical Letter from the preface of his Steganographia as wellas his Octo questionum, and, finally, “Diversa divinationum genera.” To putit simply, quite a primer in magical and divinatory practices.18According to the literature of magic, necromantia, or the calling ofdead spirits, belongs without dispute to the terrain of black, diabolicalpractices. Agrippa himself wrote so in De occulta philosophia, yet in spiteof this, he treats the subject at suspicious length. He classifies necro-mancy into two categories: nekyomantia, which raises the dead body andemploys the blood of the deceased, and skiomantia, in which case onlythe shadow of the spirit is invoked.To conclude, it worketh all its experiements by the carcasses of theslain, and their bones and members, and what is from them, becausethere is in these things a spiritual power friendly to them. Thereforethey easily allure the flowing down of wicked spirits, being by reasonof the similitude and propriety very familiar: by whom the necroman-cer strengthened by their help can do very much in human and terres-trial things, and kindle unlawful lusts, cause dreams, diseases, hatredand such like passions. (3.42, 606)Witches, says Agrippa, can easily use these unfortunate souls “for theeffecting of their witchcrafts, alluring these unhappy souls by the appo-sition of their body or by the taking of some part thereof, and compellingthem by their devilish charms” (ibid.).After having plunged into the appalling details of black magic, Agrippathen returns to sacred theurgy and tries to include even the act of raisingthe dead within the highest level of white, ceremonial magic:He which would restore the souls truly to their bodies, must first knowwhat is the proper nature of the soul from whence it went forth, withhow many and how great degrees of perfection it is replenished. [. . .]To conclude, by what influences the body may be knit together againfor the raising of the dead, requireth all these things which belong notto man but to God only, and to whom he will communicate them, asto Elishai who raised up the son of the Shunamite; so also Alcestis isreported to have been raised by Hercules; and Apollonius Tyanensisrestored a dead maid to life. (3.42, 606)"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"119Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceThe general conclusion of the monumental work restates the sacredand dignified nature of magic, which aims at using the secrets of naturefor the glory of the Creator. On the one hand, Agrippa mentions magicas a kind of natural science, requiring systematic research:Some of these things are written in order, some without order, somethings are delivered by fragments, some things are even hid, and left forthe search of the intelligent, who are more acutely contemplating thesethings which are written, and diligently searching, may obtain thecomplete rudiments of the magical art. (3.65, 677)On the other, however, he emphasizes the need for purity because thesecrets of the art coded in special symbols cannot be comprehendedotherwise. Those who are deserving will be rewarded with incrediblegifts: “those virtues will appear to you, which in times past Hermes,Zoroaster, Apollonius, the others, who wrought miracles, obtained” (ibid.).Although, according to some scholars, Agrippa’s work lacks original-ity and is in many places confused and fragmentary, one can consider itthe most comprehensive, encyclopedic summa written in the Renaissance.In it the author tried to present whatever he could gather from a greatmany different traditions of magic: classical sympathetic magic and de-monology, late Hellenistic hermeticism, Arabic magic, medieval magianaturalis, and ceremonial magic framed by the ideology of FlorentineNeoplatonism, especially its doctrine of exaltatio and the dignity of man.Like most humanists, Agrippa included a great many examples in hiswork which are rather surprising for the modern reader. It seems that,like other humanists, the author had no scruples about the tales andanecdotes of the classical authorities. The stories of Pliny and otherunreliable sources make a sharp contrast to Agrippa’s own serenity andlofty enthusiasm.Agrippa’s magic is perhaps more a theology than natural science; nev-ertheless, it shows a great deal of rationality and analytical faculty in dis-cussing many questions (see the chapters on mechanics and optics and onlanguage and the psyche). Intellectual historians belonging to the Warburgschool tried to approximate Agrippa’s magic to science and discuss it as asubchapter in the history of Renaissance natural philosophy, a groundingof the Scientific Revolution (cf. Yates 1964, and 1979, 37–49; Debus1978, 13, 19; Webster 1982, 27), but one should note that by the 1980sthis opinion became greatly refined.19 During the hermeticism debate, sciencehistorians argued that the occult philosophy played only a marginal role in"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"120JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe development of the Scientific Revolution. Though it may be true froma strictly scientific viewpoint, the general intellectual historian still feelsbemused by Agrippa’s occasional efforts to draft hypotheses in a clear andconcise language. On these occasions he also shows his irony which gleamslike that of the greatest humanists:According to the opinion of Synesius, seeing there are the same acci-dents to things, and like befall like; so he which hath often fallen uponthe same visible thing, hath assigned to himself the same opinion,passion, fortune, action, event, and as Aristotle saith, the memory isconfirmed by sense, and by keeping in memory the same thing knowl-edge is obtained, as also by the knowledge of many experiences, bylittle and little, arts and sciences are obtained. After the same accountyou must conceive dreams. [. . .] By this means shall a diviner be ableby little, and little to interpret his dreams, if so be nothing slip out ofhis memory. (1.59 “Of divination by dreams,” 186)This humanist irony occasionally appears in the chapters of De occultaphilosophia, but its real feat can be observed in his other famous work,De incertitudine et vanitate omnium scientiarum. Although the latter doesnot appear in Dee’s library catalogues as a separate item, it is difficult toimagine that—with several copies of De occulta philosophia—he wouldnot have known about it, especially since many chapters of Deincertitudine . .. were attached as appendix to De occulta . .. (under thetitle: “The censure or retraction of Henry Cornelius Agrippa, concerningmagic, after his declamation of the vanity of sciences, and the excellencyof the word of God,” Agrippa 1997, 689).20 Since De incertitudine . .. alsoexcercised great influence on the imagination of the sixteenth century, Ishall discuss it, too.De incertitudine et vanitate omnium scientiarumCharles Nauert devoted a voluminous study to the philosophy of Agrippaand developed the following thesis as the backbone of his argument: theappearance of magical themes in Renaissance philosophy displayed thecrisis of early modern thought and the very same crisis can be detectedin the fact that Agrippa’s two main works were so much the opposites ofeach other (cf. Nauert 1965). Nauert’s monograph was written at theheight of the so-called mannerism debate that characterized the 1960s"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"121Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Scienceand early 1970s.21 At one point in this debate even the whole Reforma-tion was interpreted as a crisis phenomenon of the Renaissance. I do notthink that the entirety of Agrippa’s magic could be interpreted as a prod-uct of crisis; rather, De occulta philosophia represents one of the peaks ofthe occult philosophy as developed by the sixteenth century. If we speakabout crisis, I see it in one specific area, indeed. Although Agrippa andothers tried to meticulously separate white from black magic, that provedto be a futile effort and subsequently led to a feeling of uncertainty anddiscomfort. Combined with other aspects of the growing intellectualcrisis toward the end of the sixteenth century, these opinions can natu-rally be interpreted as characteristic features of mannerism.In any case, when trying to find clues for the contradictions inAgrippa’s work we must proceed to a more refined micro-analysis ofDe incertitudine. . .22The general tone of the work, which consists of over one-hundredshort chapters, is sarcastic irony, found first in the preface where theauthor compares himself to Hercules, brave enough to attack the sci-ences. And he is aware of the expected consequences:I well perceive what a bloody battle I have to fight with them hand tohand, and how dangerous this fight will be, seeing that I am beset onevery side with an army of so mighty enemies. O with how manyengines will they assail me, and with how many shames and villainieswill they load me? [. . .] The obstinate Logicianers will cast against meinfinite darts of syllogisms; the long-tongued Sophisters, which wrest toevery part their talk, with intricate snares of words, like a bridle, willstop my mouth.

The black Necromancer will persecute me with spir-its and devils; [. . .] the circumcised Cabalists will wish me their fore-skin; [. . .] the almighty Bishops will reserve my sins for everlasting fire.[. . .] The obstinate Divine Sophistical Doctors will call me heretic, orcompel me to worship their idols; our grim masters will enforce me torecant. . . . (Agrippa 1575, Av–iAiiv)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"122JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMIn the second half of the preface Agrippa reveals his motivation in attack-ing all the human sciences:Now, Reader, thou perceivest through how many dangers I shall pass.Yet I hope easily to escape these assaults if you, supporting the truth,and setting envy apart, shalt come with a gentle mind to the readingof these things. Beside this, I have the Word of God wherewith todefend myself. [. . .] Furthermore, in many, and almost in all places ofstudy, a perverse custom and damnable use is grown, in that they bindwith an oath the scholars which they receive to teach, never to speakagainst Aristotle, Boethius, Thomas, Albert, or against any other oftheir scholars, being accounted as a god, from whom if a man differ afinger breadth in thought immediately they will call him heretic, asinful person. [. . .] These then so unadvised giants and enemies of theholy scriptures are to be assaulted, and their fortresses and castles ran-sacked; and to declare how great a rashness and presumptuous arro-gance it is to prefer the schools of philosophers before the Churchof Christ. (Aiv)After this strictly orthodox introduction, he rejects scientific research ingeneral. Referring to the doctrines of deification that several authors asso-ciate with the advancement of learning, Agrippa states that learning playsno part in salvation and in fact hinders it. He provides two arguments:since all sciences are based on certain basic principles, without those knowl-edge collapses, meaning that finite investigation cannot grasp the infinitetruth. Furthermore, all scientists are tyrants, who enforce their opinion onmen rather than offering honest and convincing reasoning.In a similar style, the following chapters condemn logic, naturalphilosophy, politics, church government, medicine, law, even theology:Lastly it resteth to speak of divinity. [. . .] But let us speak first ofscholastical divinity, which doctrine was first made by the Sorbonistesof Paris, with a certain mixture of God’s worde and philosophical rea-sons, fashioned like two bodies, as if were of the Centaurs kind. [. . .]Hereof it is come to pass that the high science of school divinity is notfree from error and naughtiness, so many sects, so many heresies havethe wicked hypocrites and hair-brained sophisters brought up. (chapter97, 168v–171v)In the middle of the work several chapters are devoted to the magicalarts. These (chapters 41 through 48) were also appended to the 1533edition of De occulta philosophia, perhaps to camouflage the radicalism of"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"123Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencethat work. Interestingly, although he criticizes the practices dealing withmagic, he finds little condemnable in the principles of the occult arts.“Of Magic in general” Agrippa says:Magic therefore comprehending all philosophy, natural and mathemati-cal, joins the powers of religions to them. Hence also they contain inthem goetia, and theurgia, for which cause many divide magic into twoparts, viz. natural and ceremonial. (chapter 41, quoted from Agrippa1997, 689)The greatest danger of magic, he says furthermore, is that even if itis practiced without the intention of goetia or necromancy, wicked spiritsmay arise instead of the invoked angels. As we shall see, Casaubon arguedsimilarily when condemning John Dee’s angel magic. Although Agrippais more permissive concerning theurgy, he finally calls it futile: “Nowmany think that theurgia is not unlawful, as if this be governed by goodangels” (chapter 46, Agrippa 1997, 699). Interestingly, he cites Porphyryto deny the possibility of magical exaltatio:Of this theurgia, or magic of divine things, Porphyry disputing atlarge, at length concludes that by theurgical consecrations the soul ofman may be fitted to receive spirits, and angels, and to see God: buthe altogether denies that we can by this art return to God. (ibid.)Here he mentions his own De occulta philosophia which he interprets ina new light: “Here is great need of caution, as we have lately discoursedat large in our books of Occult Philosophy” (ibid.). In fact, as I havequoted, in De occulta . .. he spoke about magical deification—and thecabala—in the loftiest tone. Here he calls it “pernicious superstition, bythe which they gather at their pleasure, defaming the Scriptures, theycalumniate the Law of God, and by the supputations of words, syllables,letters, numbers impudently extorted, they assay to bring violent andblasphemous proofs for their unbelief ” (chapter 47, Agrippa 1997, 701–02). Let us remember that in the second book of De occulta . .. Agrippadid his best to fuse Christian number symbolism and the cabala, devel-oping complicated tables of the principal sacred numbers, always givingthe corresponding Hebrew letters, too (“The name of Jehovah with tenletters collected; The name of Jehovah with ten letters extended . . . ”2.12, Agrippa 1997, 288).The title of chapter 100 in De incertitudine . .. is “De verbo Dei”and admits only the Scripture as the receptacle of truth. However, as"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"124JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMKeefer observes, Agrippa does not speak merely about the truth of theWord (that is, Christ, the Logos), he also introduces here the concept ofa type of illumination which the occult sciences can substitute. To beprecise, this illumination can fulfill what magic is incapable of:[This faith] truly is much higher and more stable than all the credulityof human sciences by as much as God himself is more exalted andmore truthful than men. Nay rather God alone is truthful, and everyman a liar. [. . .] Indeed God alone contains the fountain of truth, fromwhich he must drink who desires true doctrines: since there is not, norcan be had, any science of the secrets of nature, of the separate sub-stances, much less of God their author, unless it is revealed by divineinspiration. (chapter 100, Agrippa 1575, 177v)The quotation suggests that faith is not the ultimate goal, rather a meansthat opens the gates of sacred illumination and allows man to peepthrough this entrance into the supernatural world. A passage from chap-ter 98 seems to confirm this reading. Here Agrippa writes of interpretivetheology, acknowledging that he himself does not belong to those electwho have this divine gift. He can only interpret the prophecies, thustrying to get nearer to God. There are, however, more ways than one tointerpret prophecies. Agrippa rejects “defining, dividing, and compound-ing” Aristotelians because God “cannot be defined, or divided or com-pounded” (quoted by Keefer 1988, 634). The more acceptable way liesmidway between this and the prophetic vision, which is the agreementof the truth with our purged intellect, like a key with a lock. As ourintellect is most desirous of all truths, so it is perceptive of all intelligibles,and therefore it is termed the passive intellect [intellectus passibilis] bywhich even if we do not perceive in a full light the things which theprophets set forth, nonetheless the gate is opened to us, [. . .] and it isgranted us to read and understand, not with outward eyes and ears, butto perceive with better senses, and with the veil taken away. . . . (Chapter98, Agrippa 1575 71v-172)23The allusions to the New Testament are obvious here,24 but thereader well versed in hermetic literature can immediately add a comple-mentary text from chapter 13 of the Corpus hermeticum, the so-calledhymn of light:Powers within me, sing a hymn to the one and the universe. Singtogether, all you powers within me, for I wish it. Holy knowledge, you"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"125Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Scienceenlightened me. [. . .] I thank you, god, power of my energies; throughme your word hymns you; through me, O universe, accept a speechoffering, by my word. (13.18; Copenhaver 1992, 53)Chapter 102 of De incertitudine . .. is a perplexing digression on thepraise of asses (Ad encomium asini digressio). Here Agrippa praises thesimple ass on which Jesus rode into Jerusalem. Knowledge is the inven-tion of the Serpent, so it is reasonable that Christ invited no rabbis andlearned priests as his apostles, rather simple working men who themselveswere “asses.”The conclusion of the work also refers to the asses, and Agrippa callsthe pious reader thus:Wherefore O ye asses, [. . .] be you loosed from the darkness of fleshand blood. If ye desire to attain to this divine and true wisdom, not ofthe tree of the knowledge of good and ill, but of the tree of life, castaside the sciences of man. Now entering not into the schools of phi-losophers and sophisters, but into your own selves, ye shall know allthings: for the knowledge of all things is compact in you. . . . (Peroratio,Agrippa 1575, 186)After putting on this tone of the propagator of holy simplicity and naiveillumination, in the last paragraph Agrippa takes yet another turn. Byalluding to the wisdom of Solomon and the apocryphal Book of Wis-dom, he echoes the hermetic teachings once more:It is he that hath given me the true knowledge of those things whichare, that I might know the disposition of the compass of the earth, thevirtue of the elements, the beginning, consummation, middle, andrevolutions of times, the course of the year, the disposition of the stars,the natures of living creatures, the anger of beasts, the force of thewinds, the thoughts of men, the difference of plants, the virtue ofroots, and finally I have learned all things which be hidden or un-known, for the Artificer of all things hath taught me wisdom. (Peroratio,Agrippa 1575, 187v)25What is this if not a reminiscence of the exaltatio of the magus? Thisbiblical locus, not entirely fitting in with the general tone of Deincertitudine . .. , makes us aware of Agrippa’s possible multiple inten-tions, showing the work to be much more complex than it looks at firstsight. This becomes even clearer if we discover with Keefer Agrippa’sconscious misquoting: “In the Vulgate the last words of this passage are"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"126JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM‘omnium enim artifex docuit me sapientia.’ Agrippa, adding one letter,writes ‘sapientiam’—and wisdom becomes, not his teacher, but the con-tent of what he is taught, not an aspect of God, but an instrument of hisown desire for power over nature” (Keefer 1988, 640).After this one could ask if Agrippa really became a sceptic, or ratherhad he something to hide on the pages of De incertitudine . . .? Ponder-ing this question, Frances Yates noticed some interesting textual parallels(1979, 42–44). She mentioned The Golden Ass of Apuleius where thehero has to turn into an ass to rid himself of earthly drag before enteringmystical initiation. Similarly, Agrippa leaves behind secular sciences be-fore the sacred illumination. Yates entertained the thought that Agrippa’sambivalent attitude in De incertitudine . .. could be interpreted as covertsubversion. There were too many attacks against him with charges ofblack magic, so with a witty humanist treatise he discredited the branchesof scholasticism unappreciated by the new learning. With this he testifiedto his Christian faith and othodoxy.26 The rejection of traditional sciencesby no means guaranteed pious orthodoxy. Faustus, in Marlowe’s drama,does something similar and his arguments in his first soliloquy are quiteclose relatives of Agrippa’s sarcastic criticism. Still, out of desperation,Faustus ends up making a pact with Satan. In the light of this possibleoutcome of the disillusionment with the human sciences, Agrippa’s sub-version gains unresolved significance.27Agrippa’s scepticism could be rooted in, at least partly, the humanistliterary traditions, too. In this respect two possible parallels can be men-tioned. The first is Cusanus’ De docta ignorantia (Of learned ignorance,written in 1440), which explains in a quasi-naive manner that learnedignorance “is a practice and style of mystical contemplation that dependsupon a prior committment to rational knowledge and to the investiga-tion of nature” (Koenigsberger 1979, 125). The second parallel is thePraise of Folly (Encomium moriae, 1511), written by Agrippa’s contempo-rary and fellow-humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam. In the Praise of FollyErasmus mocked monastic life as well as scholastic sciences in a mannerquite similar to De incertitudine. . .. The allegorical woman personifyingFolly discredits not only the corruption of the church and the stupidityof the monks, but she also rejects sciences from grammar through math-ematics to magic. The conclusion of the work is again similar to that ofAgrippa: the only firm truth can be found in the Gospels. Erasmus alsoentertains thoughts on sacred illumination; here he speaks of the“madnesses” of Plato and his concept of illumination is not far from theconcepts of Ficino and Pico discussed earlier.28"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"127Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceOne can also see interesting biographical connections between Erasmusand Agrippa. While the former was working on the Praise of Folly in thehouse of Thomas More near London, Agrippa also traveled in England(1510). There is no evidence that the two humanists met at that time butlater they corresponded on various occasions. In 1530 Erasmus recom-mended to Agrippa a student who wished to pursue studies in the occultphilosophy. In this letter Erasmus also mentioned that he had heard ofDe incertitudine . .. as a “bold work.” Agrippa quickly answered, callinghimself an Erasmian and a faithful Christian, and asked for Erasmus’opinion about his work. The scholar of Rotterdam replied only threeyears later, already after the publication of De occulta philosophia. Erasmuspolitely praised Agrippa’s scholarship, but made his intention clear thathe would not be involved in the debate concerning the German’s magicalwork.29 In this correspondence we see an Erasmus different from thatyounger and more enthusiastic scholar who had passionately defendedthe Christian-cabalist Reuchlin a few decades ago—at about the timewhen he himself had alluded to neoplatonic exaltatio in the Praise of Folly.By the 1530s he had become distrustful of number symbolism and othermagical and mystical practices.30We have come closer to the ideological context and the literary modelsofDe incertitudine . . . , but so far we have not been able to explain Agrippa’sstrategy in publishing his two works in the described manner. His argu-mentation quite certainly rules out that his purpose with De incertitudine . ..was merely to open an ideological safety valve, although the 1533 editionofDe occulta . . ., especially its paratext, the various prefaces and dedica-tions, definitely reveal some ironic and subversive gestures. In the generalpreface, “To the Reader,” Agrippa emphasizes that De occulta . .. was aproduct of his foolish youth: “I wrote this being scarce a young man, thatI may excuse myself, and say, whilst I was a child, I spake as a child, Iunderstood as a child” (Agrippa 1997, lii). Realizing what logical questionwould arise from this remark, he immediately puts it up himself: “You mayblame me again, saying, behold though being a youth didst write and nowbeing old hast retracted it; what therefore hast thou set forth?” (ibid.).Then he tries to convince the reader that his only purpose with the latepublication was to eliminate the danger resulting from the circulation ofcorrupted manuscripts and prints.As opposed to this, in his next preface, dedicated to Prince Hermann,Archbishop of Cologne, Agrippa presents his work as a valuable gift tothe patron, which has been amended: “You have therefore the work, notonly of my youth, but of my present age, for I have corrected many"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"128JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMerrata, I have inserted many things in many places, and have added manythings to many chapters” (Agrippa 1997, lx).Swinging in the opposite direction, in the first chapter, Agrippahumbly says, again:I know not whether it be an unpardonable presumption in me, that I,a man of so little judgement and learning should in my very youth soconfidently set upon a business so difficult, so hard, and intricate asthis is. (1.1; Agrippa 1997, 3)And, as we already know, in the ensuing several hundred pages of thebook the author provides an elaborate and lofty encomium of the magi-cal arts concluding with the appendix, which is his retraction of magic,using the chapters from De incertitudine. . ..I think that among scholars dealing with this problem Michael Keeferhas come nearest to a solution. He has introduced an ingredient in theexamination of intellectual magic that has not been much discussed previ-ously, but which I myself find central for the understanding of the occultphilosophy, including John Dee’s seemingly paradoxical thoughts.The first element in Keefer’s argument is that both of Agrippa’s worksconcentrate on the same notion: the mystical rebirth and the revelatory,illuminative understanding that leads man in his earthly life to compre-hend God. To put it simply, the question of exaltatio. In this respectAgrippa found a corresponding harmony between the Gospels and thehermetic treatises: for him Matthew, Saint Paul, the fourth and thirteenthtracts of the Corpus hermeticum, Plato and Plotinus, and also some me-dieval mystics spoke of the same thing. As Keefer propounds, in respectto the exaltatio, the two works of Agrippa show only a seeming contra-diction. The real dilemma for Agrippa must have come, Keefer contin-ues, when he discovered yet another source aspiring for revelatory rebirth,but this source was terrifying and detestable for the devout philosopher.This line of magic pointed toward the Faust legend and its archetype, thestory of Simon Magus.Simon is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as somebody whotries to purchase for money the knowledge bestowed by Jesus upon theApostles. Peter, however, calls him a charlatan and chases him away (Acts8:9–25). Here we also learn that Simon “used sorcery, and bewitched thepeople of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great man” (Acts8:10). The people, entirely taken with him, believed that “this man is thegreat power of God.”"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"129Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceIn early gnostic literature the character of Simon became inflated,and the tradition of the early church considered him to be the firstgnostic.31 According to the legend he was touring Palestine with thirtydisciples and a woman called Helena. Finally he turned up in Rome andcontested Saint Peter in magical power. First he was defeated in raisingthe dead, then he tried to fly over the city, but after Peter’s fervent prayershe fell. Simon also called his lover, Helena, an incarnation of the DivineWisdom (Ennoia) who had been captured by her creatures and impris-oned in matter. She had various reincarnations, including Helen of Troy,and, finally, Simon freed her from the body of a harlot of Tyrus. LászlóKákosy, the Hungarian Egyptologist, points out that this bizarre creationmyth interestingly echoes the mystical program of gnosticism, that is, theliberation of the spirit from crude matter (1984, 21).Patristic sources unanimously stated that Simon’s power derived fromSatan. All this would not deter the notorious sixteenth-century rebel,Doctor Faustus from expressing his committment to magic in a terminol-ogy deriving from Simon.32 As Keefer has noticed, Agrippa also usedSimon’s terminology, although not on purpose, and perhaps this was thereason why he became so horrified when recognizing Simon’s teachingsin his own argumentation, which he intended to follow the Corpushermeticum. As we read in chapter 44 of his book on ceremonial magic,There is no work in this whole world so admirable, so excellent, sowonderful, which the soul of man, being associated to his image ofdivinity, which the magicians call a soul standing and not falling, can-not accomplish by its own power without any external help. Thereforethe form of all magical power is from the soul of man standing and notfalling. (3.44; Agrippa 1997, 614; also quoted by Keefer 1988, 648)The whole of this chapter is close to tracts 4 and 13 of the Corpushermeticum, but the expression “soul standing and not falling” can onlybe found in relation to Simon Magus. As Pseudo-Clementine wrote,By nation [Simon] is a Samaritan; by profession a magician, yet exceed-ingly well trained in Greek literature; desirous of glory, and boastingabove all the human race, so that he wishes himself to be believed tobe an exalted power, which is above God the Creator, and to be thoughtto be Christ, and to be called the Standing One. (Recognitiones II.7;quoted by Keefer 1988, 646)"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"130JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMAt some point Agrippa had to realize that his work inescapably impliedan affiliation between the sacred and the demonic quite contrary to hislengthy effort to clearly separate the two. He was looking for the divine andin successive stages he created a syncretic vision of magical hermeticism andthe Holy Writ, scientific investigation and faith, pagan rituals and Chris-tianity, finally to end up with the conceited demonology of Simon. AsKeefer concludes: “If Hermetic rebirth and the ideas of Simon Magus areindistinguishable, then the whole effort is compromised: the breaking downof oppositions has been allowed to go too far” (Keefer 1988, 650). Recog-nizing this, Agrippa may have written the following sentences on jugglersin chapter 48 of De incertitudine. . .. These words, significantly, constitutethe last sentences of the 1533 edition of De occulta philosophia, too:But let us return to that magic, part of which is an art of juggling, i.e.delusions, which are made according to appearance only, by whichmagicians show phantasms, and play many miracles by circulatory frauds.[. . .] And now there is by magicians raised a great company of hereticsin the Church, who as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, do in the likemanner resist the apostolical truth. The chief of these was Simon theSamaritan . . . [. . .] But of magic I wrote whilst I was very young threelarge books, which I called Of Occult Philosophy, in which what wasthen through the curiosity of my youth erroneous, I now being moreadvised, am willing to have retracted, by this recantation. [. . .] Forwhosoever do not in the truth, nor in the power of God, but in thedeceits of devils, according to the operation of wicked spirits persume todivine and prophesy, and practising through magical vanities, exorcisms,incantations and other demoniacal works, brag that they can do miracles,I say all these shall with Jannes and Jambres, and Simon Magus, bedestinated to the torments of eternal fire. (Agrippa 1997, 706)The abominations of Simon Magus were, of course, well known andpublicized also in contemporary popular, moralizing literature. GeorgeWhetstone in his The English Myrror summarized Simon’s overweeningpride as follows:Simon, enuying the miracles the Apostle did by grace, he continu-ally studied to doe the like by magicke, and in the ende he grew sofamous, as in the time of the Emperour Nero, he was so reuerenced inRome, as between the two bridges over Tiber, his Images were set upwith this superscription, To Simon the holy God: Simon being drunkenwith this admiration of the people, arrogantly offred to contend withS. Peter in doing of myracles. . . . (Whetstone 1586, 60–61)"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"131Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceFrom a pure moralistic viewpoint Simon’s machinations were heresyand damnable pride, but seen with the ambitions of a Renaissance magus,this archetypal narrative embraced the dangerous borderline between holyexaltatio and arrogant conceit.Agrippa’s work, then, subverted itself, and in this respect we mayaccept Nauert’s proposition to see in it a product of crisis. This was not,however, the crisis of Renaissance thought, rather, an inherent, built-incontradiction of the doctrine of magical exaltatio that Agrippa finallyrecognized. Although he naturally could not resolve the contraditction,the very fact that he was able to articulate it clearly marked an importantstep in the history of Western magic. The intellectual dynamism of manyof his followers—such as Paracelsus and John Dee—can be seen to havederived from the ambivalence between the sacred and the demonic. Andthis incertitude catalyzed the birth of such great literary characters asDoctor Faustus and Prospero.In the title of this chapter I proposed the investigation of magic inrelation to the natural sciences. As may be seen, my concern was not thatof the traditional historian of science, but I hope to have shown thatneither were Agrippa’s concerns for traditional scientific experiments ortheories. For him magic meant a sacred science of the supernatural inwhich the highest form of knowledge was revelatory illumination. Thisscience was not the analytical approach of the scholastic natural philoso-phers; however it did not entirely exclude certain scientific approaches,such as the inclusion of mathematics and astronomy. But even thesesubjects were filled with symbolic imagery which substituted for induc-tion and deduction.33John Dee’s natural philosophy was of a similar approach to the physicalworld. Before I examine it in detail, we shall have to become acquaintedwith two more topics crucial to the formation of his occult worldview:on the one hand the philosophy and ideology of Paracelsus and on theother the ideas of apocalyptic prophesying that made Enoch a centralcharacter in sixteenth-century intellectual discourse.PARACELSUS, ALCHEMY, THEOSOPHYIn the previous chapter I tried to show how Agrippa’s synthetic magiccombined the comprehension of the world with a theological approach,unitingmagia naturalis and ceremonial magic. In the fifteenth century—under the influence of neoplatonism with its theological concerns for the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"132JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMsupreme beauty and the supreme good—the figure of the magus wasoften associated with artistic creation. “Divine” painters or sculptors,even poets, were thought to be able to create something out of nothingjust like a god. By the sixteenth century the image of the creative manwas extended to natural scientists, too, and the word magus became atleast partly synonymous with the word scientist. As Paracelsus wrote, “asGod created the heaven and the earth, so also the physician must form,separate, and prepare a medicinal world” (Archidoxa 10.8; quoted fromParacelsus 1894, 90).This new type of magus emerged with Trithemius, in whose thoughtmystical operations such as the conjuration of angels mixed with verypractical technical purposes, like telecommunication and distance learn-ing, which also needed the consideration of contemporary scientific ideas.Agrippa in his tripartite magic designated a branch of science for theinvestigation of each world. The lowest, physical world was to be re-searched by physics and medicine. Mechanics, for example, had alwaysbeen intriguing for those who dabbled in magic since man-made ma-chines reminded one of the act of divine creation and coincided with thesuperhuman ambitions of Renaissance man. I have already mentionedthe living statues of Hermes Trismegistus and the automata of Heron(page 53 ff ), which were seen as magical wonders just as much as theproduction of gold in alchemy. There were especially three branches ofscience that became tinted with occult ideas—astrology, alchemy, andmagia naturalis—and it seems that all important scientific fields had theirmystical extension. Applied astronomy could be either navigation or occultastrology; applied chemistry could be metallurgy or occult alchemy; appliedmathematics could be algebra or occult numerology. In the backgroundof great scientific discoveries, such as Copernicus’ heliocentric world modelor Miguel Servet’s theory of the circulation of the blood, we find inspi-ration from magical and hermetic theories.34The most spectacular intertwining of hermeticism, magic, and sci-ence can be seen in the natural philosophy of Philippus AureolusTheophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, commonly known as Paracelsus(1493–1541), whose works constituted one of the most important sec-tions in John Dee’s magical library.Since Paracelsus primarily practiced medicine, it is quite understand-able that his magic was nearest to natural science; however, one shouldalso note that his works abound with theological and speculative argu-ments. He exercised strong and manifold influence on the intellectualdiscourse of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in spite of the fact"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"133Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencethat his violent temper and arrogant style made him largely unacceptableto his contemporaries. The following generations, however, discovered inhim a prophetic master, and “Paracelsianism” became one of the catch-words during the time of the Scientific Revolution.35It has been a relatively recent finding of Dee scholarship to discoverthe great impression that Paracelsus exercised on the English Doctor.Frances Yates almost entirely neglected this aspect; Peter French brieflymentioned it but did not go into details (1972, 60–61, 76–78, 127–28);and, most amazingly, Nicholas Clulee had only one mention of theGerman mystic (1988, 141). Dee’s interest in Paracelsus has been broughtto light only by the publication of his library catalogues and the editors,Roberts and Watson, devoted considerable attention to this (1990, 11,36). From the inspection of the catalogues it has turned out that between1562 and 1582 Dee purchased 92 editions of Paracelsus in 157 copies,in both Latin and German. The only dated survivor among these is aGerman edition (R&W 1476) that is heavily annotated by Dee. He, infact, set up separate subsections for his Paracelsica in the library cata-logues, such as “Paracelsici libri compacti” (R&W 1461 ff.) and“Paracelsici libri latinè compacti” (R&W 1502 ff.). As a result of thisdiscovery, Deborah Harkness makes more mention of Paracelsus in hernew study on Dee’s cabala and alchemy (1999, 63, 147, 199–203,217–25) but even her review is far from being complete. A full com-parison of Paracelsus and Dee would also exceed my present study, soin the followings I shall concentrate on Paracelsus’ occult natural phi-losophy and his views on exaltatio.36Although I have not intended to elaborate on Paracelsus’ compli-cated and legend-ridden biography, it may be instructive to note that hiscareer seems to have emblematized his disparate and contradictorythoughts. Academia and exile, professorial chair and homelessness, appre-ciation and poverty in his life; philosophical depth and cheap vulgarity,intellectual subtlety and arrogant mocking, religious enthusiasm and blas-phemy in his works. He reached the zenith of his professional career inthe mid-1520s when he became a professor as well as a town physicianin Basel and for a while could enjoy the peaceful company of fellowscholars and disciples, such as Johannes Oporinus, his assistant in theBasel years and the later editor of Vesalius’ anatomy (1543). This waswhen he wrote his most important medical works. After he had publicallyburned the books of Avicenna in Basel, he again had to set out on theroad, and changes in his fortune steered his interest from medicine to-ward hermetic philosophy and esoteric theology. In the last years of his"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"134JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMlife, he returned to practical medicine (the Grossen Wundarznei, hismonumental work on surgery was published in 1536) while he was alsoworking on his mystical synthesis, represented by Astronomia magna andPhilosophia magna, two treatises exceeding 700 pages (1536/1537). Hedied in 1541, his last three years remaining very obscure. He must havepossessed titanic energies: the Sudhoff and Matthiessen critical editionamounts to over eight-thousand pages and his theological writings arestill partly unpublished.Let us examine several of Paracelsus’ works, beginning with thenine books of Archidoxa, which date from his early creative years (about1526) and present his medical philosophy without some later charac-teristic developments. For example, the mention of the three primarysubstances, salt, mercury and sulphur, is entirely lacking from it. Itnevertheless contains the germs of Paracelsus’ basic ideology and sinceDee had seven editions of this work, it is worth examining.37 Anotherwork under a similar title is the Archidoxis magica. Although Sudhofftreats it as of spurious origin, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesthis work was one of the most popular among those attributed toParacelsus. Huser also accepted it as authentic and included it in hisedition of 1589–1591. The work is a compendium of alchemy, talis-manic magic, and ceremonial magic in popular Paracelsian rhetoric. In1656 it was translated into English by Robert Turner, who a year earlierhad also translated and published Agrippa’s Fourth Book of Occult Phi-losophy. Turner, in his preface, advertised the work to the English readeras follows: “This little Treatise presents you with the rare secrets ofAlchymy, and the miraculous cures of diseases by Sigils and Lamens,made in their proper seasons, and attributed to the nature of CelestialBodies” (A3r).38 He also noted:[A]s this author will tell you, and woful experience daily shews: howfrequently, and familiarly did those blessed Angels visibly communicatewith the holy men and Magicians of Old! though now such is thewickedness of our age, that they have almost quite forsaken us.(Paracelsus 1975, A5v)No doubt, Dee would have appreciated this remark since he must haveread the treatise with great interest specifically for its concern with theoccult philosophy. And indeed, he had several copies of this text.39 Thethird book to be looked at is Paracelsus’ monumental philosophical-magical-theosophical synthesis, the Astronomia magna, or “Die gantze"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"135Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and SciencePhilosophia Sagax der Grossen und Kleinen Welt” (the whole philosophyof the macro- and microcosms).40 Dee had a copy of this work, too(Frankfurt 1571; R&W 289), which interestingly appears at an earliersection in the catalogue instead of together with the other “Paracelsica.”If we single out just the aforementioned three books, it already indicatesthat Dee was in possession of a substantial package of works containingParacelsus’ mystical natural philosophy and system of magic.As I have mentioned, the Archidoxa is an early work, but it alreadycontains those leitmotifs that explain Paracelsus’ expectations about theideal doctor, as advertised in his later great works, the Opus Paramirumand the Paragranum. To begin with, for him the true physician must nesthis practical knowledge in a higher, theosophical theory, and needs toknow not only about man’s body but about the whole created universeof which the microcosm is only a miniature model:It is to learn the mysteries of Nature, by which we can discover whatGod is and what man is, and what avails a knowledge of heavenlyeternity and earthly weakness. [. . .] For although many things are gainedin medicine, and many more in the mysteries of Nature, neverthelessafter this life the Eternal Mystery remains, and what it is we have nofoundation for asserting, save that which has been revealed to us byChrist. (Paracelsus 1894, 4)Along with contextualizing medicine in theology and theosophy, Paracelsusalso emphasized from the outset the importance of experience, which isto be gained from the study of nature rather than from the study ofancient authorities. He never tired of mocking and scolding Galen andAvicenna; however, we must be aware that his concept of experience—just as in the case of Dee—was nearer to Roger Bacon’s experientia thanto Francis Bacon’s deductive reasoning: “We have drawn our medicine byexperiment, wherein it is made clear to the eye that things are so” (5);“and let no one wonder at the school of our learning. Though it becontrary to the courses and methods of the ancients, still it is firmlybased on experience, which is mistress to all things, and by which all artsshould be proved” (9).These quotations warn us that the two traditional standpoints ofscience historians will not work in the case of Paracelsus: those whocalled him a confused charlatan were certainly wrong, but those whotried to purge him of his magical concepts and mystical philosophy and,thus, include him in the pantheon of science history as a venerable"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMpharmacist were equally mistaken. Marie Boas noticed this problem inthe 1960s, describing Paracelsus’ thought as “combined iconoclasm withappeal to ‘experience,’ primarily mystic experience. He attacked reasonbecause it was opposed to magic, and magic was to him the best key toexperience” (1962, 177). For these reasons he despised the ancient au-thorities but found a perfect synthesis between science and mystical illu-mination among biblical characters: Adam, the forefather, and his de-scendant, Enoch. As we shall see, these two became extremely importantfor Dee, too. And among Paracelsus’ works it is the Archidoxa which forthe first time raises the questions of primordial knowledge:As long as we have the power and knowledge, we possess the capacityof sustaining our life. For Adam attained to such an advanced periodof life not from the nature or condition of his own properties, butsimply from this reason, that he was so learned and wise a physician,who knew all things in Nature herself. . . . (Paracelsus 1894, 70)Adam’s knowledge was emblematized by his mystical language, whichprovided him with a direct means of communication with God andwith the angels. And it was Enoch who was the last man privileged tobe able to learn the lingua adamica, the key to perfect knowledge somuch sought by Renaissance philosophers who all aspired to be amongthe new elect of the pansophia. Many of them, with Paracelsus in theforefront, indeed became convinced that they had come into the pos-session of universal wisdom:The celestial treasure, in these last days of grace, has been freely re-vealed to me from on high, which, indeed, make a true Adam andparadoxic physician, according to the days of Enoch, in the intellectsof a new generation. [. . .] There is no doubt, that in that very greatmultitude of men, mentioned in the fourth book of Esdras, the LordGod will reserve for Himself a small number of certain elect persons,who will desire faithfully to pursue my Theophrastic doctrine, to lovethe truth, and help their neighbours in their destitution and diseases,for pure love of God. . . . (83)Antirationalism, magic, and experience are also mixed together in theArchidoxis magica. Paracelsus advises even theologians to study magicinstead of stupid reasoning, but not to practice it, however just “to knowthe virtues and effects thereof ”:"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"137Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceThose things which are impossible to be searched out by humanereasons, by this Art, to wit, Magick, it may be found out and known:wherefore it is the most occult and secret wisdom; and reasoning againstit is nothing else but extreme folly. It were therefore very necessary thatthe Divines would learn to know something of this Art, and be expe-rienced in Magick what it is. (Paracelsus 1975, 81)TheArchidoxis divides into three main parts. The first is a study inapplied alchemy, explaining how to use it for medical purposes such asproducing the perfect healing tincture. It deals with the variety of metals,their astrological spirits, and also with the circumstances of the transmu-tation, the fire, the furnace, and the glass. The third part is appliedtalismanic magic: Paracelsus gives detailed illustrations regarding how toconstruct magical images that would cure specific illnesses, such as lep-rosy, gout, contractures, or discomforts like menstruation. These magicseals recall Ficino’s talismanic magic, or even more that of the Picatrix,in which the underlying theory presupposes a sympathetic correspon-dence between earthly living organisms and the macrocosm, governed bythe houses of the zodiac. The middle section addresses topics of ceremo-nial magic, conjurations, enchanting, enthusiastic imagination, spirits anddevils, possessions, and also such practical questions as how to find hid-den treasures.The work is not without contradictions. While in the third part heapproves the use of magic seals and characters, in a chapter of the middlesection called “Of occult philosophy,” Paracelsus speaks against all thegreat Renaissance magi: “we will write therefore in most briefe and plainwords, the most occult and secret things, which neither Cornelius Agrippa,nor Peter de Abano, much less Tritemius, never understood or wrote of ”(Paracelsus 1975, 31). Here he seems to follow Agrippa’s strategy in Deincertitudine . . .: he does not deny mystical exaltation but tries to sepa-rate it from all earthly imperfections. As he states, the only source of truemagic is the Scriptures:We do intend to treat of the greatest and most occult secrets of Phi-losophy, and of all those things which do appertain to Magicke. Clearlyand fully demonstrating and setting forth every thing that may beinvestigated, effected and brought to pass thereby: this Philosophy inthe practice thereof is much abused, by Ceremonies and other abuses,and hitherto the foundation thereof hath been built falsely upon thesand. [. . .] It is therefore necessary that the foundation of these and of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"138JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMall other Arts be laid in the holy Scriptures, upon the doctrine and faithof Christ; which is the most firme and sure foundation. (29–30)Reading all this, one can agree with Andrew Weeks’ repeatedly stressedargument: “Most of the medical-theoretical work is as much religious asscientific” (1997, 41). Although a deep religiousness definitely distin-guishes the natural philosophy of Paracelsus, his theology was by nomeans orthodox; rather it was as iconoclastic, noncomformist, and het-erodox as any of the great occult thinkers. He approximated the Refor-mation in his antipathy to ceremonies and rituals, but his thinking wastoo idiosyncratic to shift from Catholic orthodoxy to Lutheran dogmat-ics. His religious individualism can be compared to that of Miguel Servet,Giordano Bruno, Guillaume Postel, or John Dee.41 His Astronomia ma-gna is the clearest manifesto of his esoteric philosophy.Like Agrippa, Paracelsus approached and explained the dignity ofman from two directions: the viewpoint of the Scriptures and the view-point of hermetic rebirth. As for the biblical message,From Holy Scripture comes the beginning and guidance of all philoso-phy and natural science, and it must be taken into account beforeanything else; without this fundament all philosophy would be ex-pounded and applied in vain. Consequently, if a philosopher is notborn out of theology, he has no cornerstone upon which to build hisphilosophy. For truth springs from religion, and cannot be discoveredwithout its help. (Astronomia magna, I,12:32;42 Paraclesus 1951, 196)And similarly, later on:Let man not be surprised that God is with him, and that he canperform miracles on earth by virtue of His power, for man is of divinenature. “All of you are gods and sons of the Most High,” says HolyWrit. (I, 12:328; Paracelsus 1951, 195)For to become “gods,” man also needs hermetic knowledge, which givesthe key to the secrets of the universe by the help of personalized Wisdom.Man, just like in Hermes Trismegistus or in Pico’s Oratio . .. appears asthe greatest miracle, the book of all mysteries: “Man is the book in whichall the mysteries are recorded; but this book is interpreted by God” (LiberAzoth43 sive de ligno et linea vitae, I,14:547–48; Paracelsus 1951, 44).“How marvellously man is made and formed if one penetrates into histrue nature.

And, indeed, it is the presence of God in themicrocosm that permits man to become himself a creator of miracles:Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source ofenergy, from which new arts flow. [. . .] When a man undertakes tocreate something, he establishes a new heaven, as it were, and from itthe work that he desires to create flows into him. [. . .] For such is theimmensity of man that he is greater than heaven and earth. (Astronomiamagna, I,12:183; Paracelsus 1951, 45)When man undertakes to create something miraculous, it happens bythe help of magic: “After all, God has permitted magic, and this is asign that we may use it; it is also a sign of what we are” (Die Büchervon den unsichtbaren Krankheiten, I,9:271; Paracelsus 1951, 138), andin Paracelsus’ works we also come across with magic, corresponding toall three worlds of Agrippa, from magia naturalis up to gnostic spiritualrebirth. In the Archidoxis magica he states that the physician needs toknow the original cause of all diseases, which may result from threeareas: material things (“evil meat or drink”), celestial or heavenlyinfluences, and supernatural causes (“inchantment or some MagicalSorceries”).44 These three areas demand corresponding medical prac-tices: material magic needs “to know the secrets of Herbs and Roots,etc.,” celestial influences are treated with medical astrology, and sorcerycan be fought only by magical remedies (ibid.).Physicians with magical power are comparable to the Saints of Godwho also worked miracles:As God awakens the dead to new life, so the ‘natural saints’ who arecalled magi, are given power over the energies and faculties of nature.For there are holy men in God who serve the beatific life; they arecalled saints. But there are also holy men in God who serve the forcesof nature, and they are called magi. God shows his miracles throughHis holy men, both through those of beatific life and through those ofnature. . . . (Astronomia magna, I,12:130; Paracelsus 1951, 139)A characteristic of celestial magic is that it makes man a ruler overthe stars. It is all the more important because in Paracelsus’ medicineastrological influences and corresponding cures are of central importance.At this point astrological power, Wisdom, and the deification of man are"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"140JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMintertwined: “The wise man is the man who live by divine wisdom andis an image of Him in whose likeness he was created. [. . .] He whoimitates the image of God will conquer the stars” (Astronomia magnaI,12: 41–42; Paracelsus 1951, 155–56).Celestial magic is crowned by angelic magic. Paracelsus here is morecautious than Agrippa was; nevertheless he clearly professed the magicalpotential of man:He who inherits God’s wisdom walks on water without wetting hisfeet; for in the true art inherited from God, man is like an angel. Butwhat will wet an angel? Nothing. Similarly, nothing will wet the wiseman. God is powerful and He wills it that His power be revealed tomen and to angels in the wisdoms of the arts. He wills it that the worldand the earth be like Heaven: (De fundamento scientiarum sapientiaeque,I,13:306; Paracelsus 1951, 163)One notices another parallel with Agrippa here: the ultimate end of truemagic is Christian exaltation, which is also signified by the steps ofspiritual alchemy. Paracelsus uses the term rebirth just like his colleaguefrom Nettesheim. Paracelsus’ most elevated thoughts on exaltatio can befound again in the Astronomia magna:But if the whole heart is to be filled with love of God, all oppositionto God must withdraw from the soul, and that which is not divinemust go, to the end that it may be all pure, untainted by any otherthing, separated from all the rest, perfectly clean and pure itself. (I,12:299; Paracelsus 1951, 199)Our Father in Heaven teaches us in the reborn body, and notin the old body, and in this reborn man he teaches us heavenlywisdom . . . (316–17)Man is born of the earth, therefore he also has in him the natureof the earth. But later, in his new birth, he is of God and in this formreceives divine nature. Just as man in nature is illuminated by thesidereal light45 that he may know nature, so he is illuminated by theHoly Ghost that he may know God in his essence. For no one canknow God unless he is of divine nature. (326)As I have pointed out, in Agrippa’s work the phenomenon of exaltatioreceived an almost scien tifically precise analysis. Paracelsus did likewise,and this is the subject-area where anthropocentric, Christian-esotericnatural philosophy can be best understood. The reborn man of Paracelsusis called in the alchemical treatises corpus glorificationis, and this is noth-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"141Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Scienceing else but the primordial man of prisca theologia, and the Adam Kadmonof the cabala.46 Paracelsus’ views on spirits and the soul also point backto the prisca theologia. According to him, “as man is built, so is built Godafter whose image he was created.”47For Paracelsus astronomia means not only cosmology, but primarilythe description of man who is built in harmony with the macrocosm.Consequently, he presupposes close connections between the spirits popu-lating the outer skies and the ones living in man’s inner heaven.48 And asman has two bodies (the elemental and the sidereal), so has he also twospirits in which rebirth takes place. These souls are bathed in the mysticalLight of Nature (lumen naturae), which is identified with the Wisdom ofNature, corresponding loosely to Ficino’s anima mundi (see Kämmerer1971, 29; Müller-Jahncke 1985, 72). The seat of spirits in the body isthe soul, thus Paracelsus does not divert from the traditional Platonictriad: body—soul—spirit, but he completes it with the elements of the“alchemical trinity,” sal, mercurius, sulphur.Using this triad, Elizabeth Ann Ambrose (1992) describes Paracelsianontology and gnoseology with the terms Cosmos—Anthropos—Theos. Thesethree stages mean not only the three paradigms of existence (world—man—God) but also include the steps man uses to know the world and God. Theprocess starts with a phase of submerging in the material, then concludeswith a spiritual ascension. Man is born in a structured cosmos and has tosuffer separation (the alchemical separatio is one of Paracelsus’ favorite terms),then, due to Theos, he can again build up his primordial homogeneity.49Cosmos is the incarnation of the divine, the corpus of God which is theself-expression of the Supreme Being (Paracelsus calls it Yliaster) through theLogos, by the help of thought and will. Such a complicated process involvingenormous creative energy is not without dangers and the possibilities offlaws, the German Doctor realized. He mentioned that the mysterium mag-num might result in deformed incarnations. A good example for that is man,and especially, woman.50 The dualism of spiritual and physical existence canbest be seen in the context of Anthropos: this is a necessary but hazardousseparation from which reintegration by the help of lumen naturae is chancy,not guaranteed. This reintegration is of course nothing else but the mysticalrebirth, the exaltatio, provided the self is able to achieve it.At this point it is instructive to look at Paracelsus’ concept of evil. Hesuggests that without the stage of the purely material, and the experienceof godlessness, one cannot recognize the Creator, the Supreme Being.51Among scholars it has become a commonplace to speak about theinterconnectedness of Reformation theology, gnosticism, the prisca"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"142JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMtheologia, and the cabala. According to Jung, all these whirl around theidea of the primordial man, whose once existing perfectness and powershould be reestablished by the reborn mystic ([1942] 1983, 129–32). ForParacelsus the road to this idea led through mystical medicine and al-chemy, which was framed by a theological synthesis, and influenced byFicino, Pico, Reuchlin, and Agrippa. In his theological works one findsample evidence for this:[R]emember that you must take unto yourselves the teachings of thecabala. For the cabala builds on a true foundation. Pray and it will begiven you, knock and you will be heard, the gate will be opened to you.[. . .] Everything you desire will flow and be granted to you. You willsee into the lowest depths of the earth, into the depths of hell, into thethird heaven. You will gain more wisdom than Solomon, you will havegreater communion with God than Moses and Aaron.52This quotation indicates Paracelsus’ indebtedness to the hermeticmagicians and Christian cabalists of the Renaissance, but also pointstoward various schools rising up from his legacy, ranging from John Dee’sscientific application in his hieroglyphic monad to a purely spiritual al-chemical theosophy in Jakob Boehme.Paracelsus not only synthetized Renaissance occultism, but he alsosuffered from the inherent contradiction of the magical worldview, justas we have seen in the case of Agrippa. It was again Jung who firstnoticed this: “Paracelsus was, perhaps most deeply of all, an ‘alchemicalphilosopher’ whose religious views involved him in an unconscious conflictwith the Christian beliefs of his age in a way that seems inextricablyconfused. Nevertheless, in this confusion are to be found the beginningsof philosophical, psychological, and religious problems which are takingclearer shape in our own epoch” (1983, 110). As Keefer (1988) discov-ered the contradictions in Agrippa’s ideology of rebirth, Jung in 1941pinpointed the contradictions of exaltatio as the main problem of thehermetic magus. And as Keefer associated the dark side of exaltatio withthe heresy of Simon Magus, Jung compared Paracelsus’ arrogance withthat of an other archetypal heretic, Doctor Faustus.Paracelsus never questioned the power of magic and alchemy becauseaccording to him these were agents of the lumen naturae, which in turn wasnothing but revelative illumination about God’s rationally incomprehen-sible truths. Achieving this revelation meant the deification of man: “Godhas given us the eternal body to the end that we mortal men on earth may"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"143Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and Sciencebecome immortal” (De honestis utriusque divitiis, II,1:249; Paracelsus 1951,203). The true physician should become such an immortal man. Speakingof the office of such divine practicioners, Paracelsus cried out: “I under theLord, the Lord under me, I under him outside my office, and he under meoutside his office” (De caducis, I,8: 267; Jung 1983, 117).The outspokenness of this statement is breathtaking and remindsJung of the later Angelus Silesius:I am as great as God,And he is small like me;He cannot be above,Nor I below him be.(Jung 1983, 117)This is the kind of attitude that many scholars identified with the man-centered spirit of the Renaissance, which endowed humankind with di-vine dignity. And this spirit manifested itself most dramatically in magicand alchemy. “Deus et Homo in a new and unprecedented sense!” con-cluded Jung in rapture. But he also saw the traps on the road of themagus who had said “I under the Lord,” but really thought “the Lordunder me”: “Man takes the place of the Creator. Medieval alchemy pre-pared the way for the greatest intervention in the divine world order thatman has ever attempted: alchemy was the dawn of the scientific age,when the daemon of the scientific spirit compelled the forces of natureto serve man to an extent that had never been known before. It was fromthe spirit of alchemy that Goethe created the figure of the ‘superman’Faust, and this superman led Nietzsche’s Zarathustra to declare that Godwas dead” (Jung 1983, 128).Jung also speaks of Agrippa’s crisis, manifesting itself in Deincertitudine. . .. In its preface, the magus of Nettesheim wrote withgreatest outburst of intensity:This Agrippa spareth none, he condemneth, knows, is ignorant, weeps,laughs, is angry, pursueth, carps at all things being himself a philoso-pher, demon, a hero, a god,—and all things.53According to Jung, Paracelsus was not a split character to such an extent,but his arrogance and extremist diction derived from the unresolvedtension between his Christian piety and his Agrippan attitude of “phi-losopher, demon, hero, and god.” According to Jung “the Christian and"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"144JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe primitive pagan lived together in [Paracelsus] in a strange and mar-vellous way to form a conflicting whole. [. . .] His spirit was heroic,because creative, and as such was doomed to Promethean guilt” (1983,189). This guilt resulted from Paracelsus’ conceited hubris which gener-ated discomfort: although subjectively he thought of himself as a faithfulChristian, even a good man since his whole life was spent helping thephysically wretched, he could never overcome his bad consciousness andan inferiority complex.To what extent can we find Jung’s insights helpful today, when tryingto comprehend Paracelsus’ concept of exaltatio and enter into a dialoguewith the work of this enigmatic philosopher? Jung’s opinion of coursereveals his own preoccupations and his own personal characteristics. Thathe started dealing with alchemy after a serious private crisis and that hewrote his Paracelsus essay in 1941, at the height of the great demonicwar, should throw a special light on his cultural historical paradigmembracing Paracelsus, Faust, Goethe, and Nietzsche.In our analysis today we can hardly appreciate Jung’s opinion thatthe history of alchemy is more or less identical with an age-old case studyin psychiatry. Consequently, we do not need to look for signs of mentaldistractions in the works of the Renaissance magi. On the other hand,Jung also juxtaposed the outlook of Christianity and rational scientificinvestigation and interpreted alchemy as something that first tried tobridge the two, yet later indeed contributed to their separation.Furthermore, Jung’s reading of Paracelsus offers one more lesson to beobserved in our postmodern age. Namely, he highlighted the unnervingambiguity that not only characterized Paracelsus himself, but can also beseen in the whole history of Western magic and occult philsophy. How canwe account for the fact that an ancient and venerable, basically stable andconservative tradition could produce such representatives whose synthetizingworks prove to be trampled by contradictions, paradoxes, and discrepan-cies? The Platonist philosopher would say only that this is the consequenceof the Fall. The human spirit besieges infinity, but it is unattainable. Nowand again it approaches only to fall back again, ad infinitum.The modern cultural historian must be more cautious in drawingconclusions but may venture to suggest that this striving, this self-destroying subversion, has been responsible over centuries for the dyna-mism of European culture. Paracelsus’ endeavors for synthesis clearlyshow that traditions are never homogeneous or clear-cut or isolated.Subversion, antagonisms, and variety on the one hand and lasting tradi-tion on the other are equally important segments of culture."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"145Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceENOCH, SCIENCE, APOCALYPTIC PROPHECYWe have come to the last theme among the intellectual impacts thatcontributed to the formation of John Dee’s doctrine of exaltatio. This wasan idiosyncratic attitude of certain sixteenth-century intellectuals whogained inspiration from the hermetic Renaissance of the Florentineneoplatonists and who themselves contributed to various chiliastic andapocalyptic tendencies of the Reformation and to the general religiousclimate of early modern Europe.As attitudes are often shaped by role models embedded in mytholo-gies or ancient wisdom, in this case we also find such elements, includingfables, images, and characteristic iconography. Let us start from Paracelsus’already quoted remarks concerning the wisdom and magic power ofAdam and his descendant Enoch (see above, p. 136). The latter wasrelatvely little discussed until the Renaissance, however in the sixteenthcentury he was made into a sensational biblical figure, and Dee himselffelt much obsessed with his character.In the Old and New Testaments Enoch is rather briefly mentioned.We learn that there were two Enochs, the first was Cain’s son (Gen. 4:17)who thus belonged to the third generation of humankind. The second,“real” Enoch derived from Adam’s son Seth; his father was Jared whobeget Enoch in the year 622 after the Creation (Gen. 5:18–19). Enochlived 365 years; at the age of 65 he beget Methuselah, then he “walkedwith God: and he was not; for God took him” (Gen. 5:24). Saint Paulin his epistle to the Hebrews remembered that “by faith [Enoch] wastranslated that he should not see death” (Heb. 11:5). Finally the epistleof Jude briefly mentions that “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, proph-esied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of hissaints” (Jude 14).There is much more apocryphal and pseudepigraphical54 material onEnoch in the Judeo- and the Christian traditions alike. The historiographyof this literature is interesting and complicated. Though the text of the so-called Book of Enoch was in fact not known to Europeans until the eigh-teenth century, there was a great interest in Enoch from the sixteenthcentury on, as we can see in various mystical trends of humanist literature.It is important then to examine Dee’s sources for the Enochian legends.At present there are three known collections associated with the nameof Enoch. 1Enoch is the so-called Ethiopic Apocalypse of Enoch, the fulltext of which survived only in the Ethiopic language and was brought toEurope in 1773 by the Scottish Africa traveler J. Bruce. The original"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"146JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMbook might have been written either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. Somefragments have survived in Aramaic (among the Qumran scrolls), inGreek (an eighth-century manuscript found in a Christian grave in Egypt,plus some quotations in the Chronographia of Georgius Syncellus), andin Latin, found also in an eighth-century manuscript.551Enoch consists of the following themes: after the introduction,Chapters 6–36 relate the story of the fallen angels, how they intercoursedwith women and corrupted all men, and how Enoch tried to interveneon the angels’ behalf before God. The second part contains apocalypticvisions concerning the final judgement of the righteous and the wicked,while the third part (Chapters 72–82) is an astrological treatise thatundoubtedly inspired the medieval astrological tracts to be discussed below.The fourth part contains dream visions about the future of Israel and tellsthe history of mankind from Adam to the Flood. The fifth part is Enoch’stestament. From the viewpoint of Dee’s mystical writings, the first partof the work, also known as the Book of the Watchers, is particularlyinteresting, because it is a kind of angelology (Charlesworth 1983, 5).2Enoch is the so-called Slavonic Enoch. It survived in old churchSlavonic manuscripts, but the origin and history of those even nowadaysis totally obscure (cf. F. I. Andersen’s summary in Charlesworth 1983,91–100).3Enoch is a fascinating Hebrew text, belonging to the body ofMerkabah mystical literature (fifth through tenth centuries, A.D.) thatsurvived in various fourteenth- to sixteenth-century manuscripts, andone of its chapters (48BCD) was also printed in Cracow, in a Hebrewpublication of 1579 (information on 3Enoch by P. Alexander inCharlesworth 1983, 223–53).Since Dee had no interest in orthodox Christian texts and theSlavonic book of Enoch was not known to Western Europe in the timeof the Renaissance, this text can be neglected in our investigation. Moreinteresting is the case with the other two versions. Although we haveno evidence of Dee’s relationship with Jewish scholars or rabbis, oneshould not forget that a few years after some parts of 3Enoch had beenprinted in Cracow, Dee spent several months there and might have hadaccess to this publication, in which he could read in Chapter 48Aabout the right hand of God that rewards the rightous; in 48B aboutthe seventy names of God (the list wrapped in a literary imagery notdissimilar from Dee’s own visionary writings); and, finally in 48C abouta short account of the elevation of Enoch, the story arranged cabalisticallyalong the Hebrew alphabet:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"147Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceLamed: “I took him”—Enoch the son of Jared, from their midst, andbrought him up with the sound of the trumpet and with shouting tothe height, to be my witness. . . .

I set him as a prince over all the princes, and made him aminister of the throne of glory, to deck and arrange it. . . . (48C:3–4;in Charlesworth 1983, 311)The above passage, as well as 1Enoch, contains all those motifs—Enoch being chosen to see God face to face; being entrusted with theknowledge of all sciences and a clavis universalis; and, finally, being electedto be the minister of “the throne of Glory to deck and arrange it”—which truly corresponded to Dee’s burning desires to obtain universalknowledge and attain exaltatio, that is, to converse with angels and per-haps see the Creator face-to-face. Although it is most unlikely that hewould have had access to the full text of the Book of Enoch, he certainlymust have been aware of the long medieval tradition as well as the newRenaissance attraction to Enoch, who became one of the emblematicfigures of the omniscient magi.References to Enoch’s exaltation abounded in Christian literaturethroughout the centuries. He featured in the writings of the Churchfathers and the early theologians and then in some medieval treatises,although his fame was eclipsed during the Middle Ages. According toThorndike (1923–1958, 1:342–45), Alexander Neckam in the twelfthcentury spoke as if Christendom had some acquaintance with the Enochliterature. He also pointed out that Hildegard of Bingen’s visions hadinteresting parallels with that of Enoch. In his Speculum naturale, Vincentof Beauvais (thirteenth century) also referred to the Book of Enoch withreverence, but perhaps even more important is that corpus of pseudo-Enochian literature that in the Middle Ages attributed to him the privi-lege of being the inventor of astrology and alchemy. In these treatisesEnoch was also identified with Hermes Trismegistus, or called “one of thethree holy Hermeses.” This is the claim in the “Treatise on fifteen stars,”which survives in many medieval manuscripts (Thorndike, 1:340), andit is repeated by Robert of Chester’s Liber de compositione alchemiae (pub-lished in Dee’s lifetime in Paris, 1564); and by the thirteenth-centurymanuscript “Hermes Mercurius Triplex on the six principles of things.”Enoch’s lore on angels was echoed in the whole of spurious medievalmanuscript literature of ceremonial magic, including the “Book of Venus,”"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"148JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMtheLiber Juratus, the Liber lunae, and the various versions of the “Bookof Toz” (Thorndike, 2:220–27). It also appears, that Roger Bacon (whomDee unconditionally admired for his engagement in the magical-mechanical arts), highly regarded Enoch and mentioned him in his Secre-tum secretorum as equal being to Hermes (Clulee 1989, 209).These occasional and more or less illicit mentions gained a newdimension during the late fifteenth century—undoubtedly due to theFlorentine neoplatonists’ enthusiasm for hermeticism. Enoch and HermesTrismegistus became role models for magically oriented humanists whowere obsessed with the practical methods for achieving exaltatio, even tothe extent that they claimed themselves to be the reincarnation of thoseancient sages.56 A notable example was Giovanni Mercurio, the wander-ing hermetic magus who around 1501 visited France and had his sensa-tional appearance recorded by Trithemius. Mercurio left no writings ofhis own, but accounts of his activities reported that he had declaredhimself to be the heir of Apollonius of Tyana, the ancient magician. AfterMercurius Trismegistus he also called himself Mercurius Secundus and,according to Trithemius, promised “great, strange, and exceedingly mar-velous things.”57 Although Trithemius claimed similar magical power forhimself, he was ready to see in Mercurio a charlatan, a fraud, at best aconvenor of evil spirits. He exploited the example of the Italian in orderto show how narrow and uncertain was the dividing line between real,pious magic and necromancy (Brann 1999, 66). Not everybody, however,was so critical of Mercurio. In 1505 Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples, the her-metically oriented humanist, published a work in Paris by the Italianmystic, Lodovico Lazzarelli titled Crater hermetis, together with thePimander and the Asclepius, that is, the basic texts of hermetism.58 Lazzarelli(1450–1500) belonged to the humanist circle of Ficino and Pontano andlater turned into an apostle of the hermetic tradition. This conversionwas greatly influenced by Giovanni Mercurio, who in 1484 appeared inRome and roamed the streets with a crown of thorns and preached amystical renovation of Christianity. Lazzarelli remembered this encounterin a work assuming the form of a letter by Enoch, in which he calledhimself “Lodovicus Enoch Lazarellus Septempedanus, once a poet butnow by new rebirth the son of true wisdom” (Thorndike 1923–1958,5:438). Thus, it seems, Lazzarelli considered himself to be a reincarnationof Enoch and his ideas of hermetic rebirth can be compared to those ofAgrippa and Paracelsus, as mentioned above.59Another sixteenth-century humanist who became involved with thequestions of Enoch and hermetic rebirth was Guillaume Postel, one of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"149Occult Philosophy, Symbolism, and ScienceJohn Dee’s personal acquaintances. They met in early 1551 in Paris,where Dee had been staying since July 1550 and where in September hehad lectured on Euclid. The title of his talk was “Prolegomena et didactaParisiensa in Euclidis Elementorum Geometricorum librum primum etsecundum” (Dee 1851, 25). According to his recollections from 1592,I did undertake to read freely and publiquely Euclide’s ElementsGeometricall, Mathematicè, Physicè, et Pythagoricè; a thing never donepubliquely in any University of Christendome....(Dee 1851, 7)Here Dee also gives a long list of eminent scholars whom he met during hisstay in Paris. Among the names of Pierre Mondoré (the king’s librarian),Oronce Finé (a famous mathematician), and Pierre de la Ramée (the re-former of logic), one also finds Guillaume Postel, who in many ways can beconsidered as one of the closest intellectual relatives of the English Doctor.60Postel (1510–1581) had a career similar to that of Dee.61 Comingfrom a poor family, on attending school he was characterized by anextreme thirst for knowledge, often even forgetting to stop reading forthe sake of eating.62 As we also know from about Dee, “I was so vehe-mently bent to studie, that for those yeares I did inviolably keepe thisorder; only to sleepe four houres every night; to allow to meate and drinktwo houres every day; and of the other eighteen houres all was spent inmy studies and learning” (Dee 1851, 5). Postel quickly learned Greekand Hebrew and later, during a trip to Constantinople, Siriac and Arabic.Like Dee, he also became a devoted collector of books although his evenless stable life did not allow him to gather such a large collection as Dee’s.The first sentences of William Bouwsma’s monograph on Postel give agood introduction to his significance in the history of Renaissance hu-manism: “Postel is at once one of the most interesting and one of themost puzzling figures of the sixteenth century. His spectacular career andthe wide range of his interests and activities have frequently attracted theattention of historians, and his name appears in the most various connec-tions. He was the most learned Christian cabalist of his day, one of theearliest systematic Arabists in western Europe, a pioneer in the compara-tive study of language, and a humanist of distinction” (1957, v).These thoughts have been repeated almost verbatim about John Dee,too. The two men had not only their humanist and scholarly interests incommon. Both were deeply interested in the occult and the cabala, andboth of them had a particular mystical conversion or illumination thatconcluded in a radical turn in their careers."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"150JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMParallel with his humanistic and philological interests, Postel’s chiefconcern was the religious reformation of the world. He hoped that throughrational reasoning non-Christians could be convinced of the superiortruths of Christ. He was also looking for a human instrument to be themissionary of his project and he thought of the Jesuits. In 1544 he wentto Rome, met Ignatius Loyola, and asked for admittance. Although Postelhad only a brief encounter with the Society of Jesus (a year later Ignatiusfelt compelled to set up a committee to examine the religious heterodoxyof the Frenchman), Rome proved to be of crucial importance. In 1546he met an Ethiopian priest who described for him the Book of Enoch,which existed only in that language. Postel became quite enthusiasticabout apocryphal literature in general—he translated James’ Proto-evangelium and proposed that the Pope adopt the Zohar and the Book ofEnoch as the keys to the Scriptures—and also often cited Enoch, since“its esoteric character and messianic emphasis were exactly the sort ofthing to appeal to Postel” (Bouwsma 1957, 36).His interest in Enoch may have led him to a preoccupation withreincarnation (cf. Secret 1990), which manifested itself in 1547 in Venice.There he met an almost illiterate elderly lady serving in the Hospital ofSaints John and Paul, in whom Postel recognized the incarnation of theanima mundi or the divine radiation, the Shekhinah of the cabala. Hecalled her “mater mundi” and the “New Eve” (Bouwsma 1957, 15 ff.,155–60; Kuntz 1981, 73 ff.) and he was fixated on her until his deathin 1581. Mother Joana (or Zuana) died in 1549, and two years later aneven more dramatic event occurred in Postel’s life. He was celebratingChristmas, when he suddenly fell ill, suffered terrible awe and tremoruntil Mother Joana appeared to him, announcing that she would occupyhis body as she had promised at their last meeting:I shall send you two beautiful gifts in our garments, and you shall beour first born son, who shall cause to be understood by Intellect andReason the truth of our mysteries. (Le prime novo del altro mondo,Venice, 1555; quoted by Bouwsma 1957, 157)Postel recorded the incarnation of the “Venetian Vergin” in his bodyas follows:Two years after her ascension into heaven, her spiritual body and sub-stance sensibly descended into me and sensibly extended throughoutmy body, so that it is she and not I who live in me.

As Bouwsmaexplains, Postel in fact saw himself as the incarnation of a “lower Messiah,”a new Elias, the governor of the feminine sphere. As he himself wrote, “Itis entirely necessary that there should be a lower Messiah, the image of theWife, subordinate to her husband, and of the body subordinate to itssoul . . .” (Restitutio rerum omnium, Paris, 1552; Bouwsma 1957, 163).Postel in fact called himself a reborn, or restituted, man, a herald of the lastepoch when all things would be renewed to their primal perfection andSatan would be defeated for all before the final apocalypse.Giovanni Mercurio, Lodovico Lazzarelli, and Guillaume Postel seemto have accomplished—at least in their subjective reality—all that towhich Agrippa and Paracelsus were only aspiring, and which John Deestubbornly tried to achieve during his decades-long “angelic conferences.”The latter will be the subject of the next part of this book."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Part 3Output“Glyms or Beame of Radicall Truthes”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"6The Ideology and Occult Symbolism ofDee’s Natural PhilosophyI have devoted the previous part of this book to the examination ofmagicalexaltatio as it appeared and reappeared in Western thought fromclassical Antiquity through the Middle Ages up to the sixteenth cen-tury—undertaking this by looking at books that were in the personallibrary of John Dee. To a certain extent I have revisited the Yates thesisand thus laid a special emphasis on the great magi of the fifteenth andearly sixteenth centuries, whose activity strongly contributed to the riseof the much-discussed “man-centered” world picture of the Renaissance.Their texts demonstrate that that “man-centeredness” by no means meantreligious scepticism, let alone atheism.1 Instead, we could rather speak ofa new type of religiosity, some individual and idiosyncratic versions ofwhich are clearly distinguishable from the official branches of the Refor-mation. Historians often call these religious attitudes heterodoxy, orinterconfessionalism.As I have shown, the idea that man had a special role in creation andhad been endowed with godlike faculties directly relating him to theSupreme Being had been emphasized since earliest times. And as is alsoclear, these thoughts have always been associated with mysticism, gnos-ticism, and symbolic magic. I am aware that it is impossible to explaina very complex cultural phenomenon, such as the Renaissance, by reduc-ing it to a product of a single intellectual impulse (that was the specialweakness of Frances Yates and her uncritical followers); still, I am nev-ertheless quite convinced that the magical vogue started and made ac-ceptable by the Florentine neoplatonists became a particularly important155"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"156JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcatalyzer in helping Western humankind break out of its medieval intel-lectual framework. Later, in the early modern period, this interest inmagicalexaltatio spread widely, became differentiated and popularized,influencing the Scientific Revolution on the one hand while on the otherincorporating itself into the discourse of various religious denominations.Thus it became the property of much larger communities than it hadbeen in the time of humanism and its patronage system. Another impor-tant contribution to this popularization was the expansion of book pub-lishing. This meant not only more and cheaper books, but the technicaldevelopment fostered a fascinating trend in magical illustrations thatfilled the works of Heinrich Khunrath, Michael Maier, Robert Fludd,Athanasius Kircher, and the later editions of Jakob Boehme.With my references to Simon Magus and the appearance of the Faustianarchetype, I argued that the doctrine of exaltatio had inherent subversivecontradictions that may have led to total or partial self-destruction, too. I amconvinced that the dynamism of the reborn European culture followed fromthese contradictions: from the tension between affirmation and negation,construction and demolition, tradition and subversion. Renaissance magicclearly shows this dichotomy. Because of this I can hardly believe early modernmagicians who confidently asserted the possibility of separating white fromblack magic. It was only self-defense and propaganda in claiming that theywere entirely free from all dark temptations. But why should we want toexpel the examination of those murky experiments from the study of ourcultural heritage? Cultural history is not to be purged; rather it should beinterpreted and comprehended. As I suggested in connection with Paracelsus,Christian magic—and the doctrine of exaltatio—is more like a heroic torso,a gallery of broken dreams; still, it exercised an admirable influence onmodern Western mentality.I want to argue that John Dee fully integrated with this tradition,in fact that he was a prominent representative of it from the latersixteenth century. So much has been written about his career and worksthat I can do without the obligatory sketch of his biography and ageneral review of his writings. Let us plunge into the texts, a selectionof his “output” that has pertinence for the notion of exaltatio. I amgoing to look at his Propaedeumata aphoristica, the Monas hieroglyphica,The Mathematicall Praeface, and the spiritual diaries as representingrepeated efforts, successive stages, and sometimes different underlyingtheories in order to attain that pristine knowledge which leads manduring his earthly life to the full comprehension of the universe, themanifestation of God’s infinite intellect."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"157The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyASTROLOGY:PROPAEDEUMATA APHORISTICAAccording to recent analyses, especially Nicholas Clulee’s definitive inter-pretation, Dee’s early career was dominated by his fascination with math-ematics and medieval magia naturalis (Clulee 1988, 19–75; Heilbronn1978, 50–105). As for geometry, his continental trip to the Low Countriesand to Paris in 1550 and 1551 was spent under the sign of Euclid, thoughhis account of the successful Paris lecture betrays an interest in mysticaloccult lore, too. He described Euclid as “Mathematicè, Physicè, etPythagoricè,” and even if at this point he was not yet aware of neoplatonichermetism, he could refer to Proclus and the contemporary Jacques Lefèvred’Étaples as representatives of a Pythagorean frame of thought. The evi-dence we have indicates that Dee from the earliest years of his scholarlycareer was occupied by an ambition to seek and acquire perfect knowledge,which necessarily made him aware of esoteric concerns.Given his early interests, it should not be surprising that his firstmajor work, the Propaedeumata aphoristica (“An aphoristic introduction[. . .] concerning certain virtues of nature, dedicated to Gerard Mercator,distinguished mathematician,” London, 1558, 1568; modern edition:Dee 1978), dealt with the connections of geometry and astrology. It isnot clear from where Dee acquired his expertise in traditional astrology,but as we know, in the same year of the publication of the Propaedeumata,he was invited to determine the astrologically most suitable day for thecoronation of Elizabeth I.2 His interest in astrology may have been rootedin the studies he had pursued in Louvain during the years 1547 and1548. He met there scholars—Gemma Frisius, Gerard Mercator, Casparà Mirica, and Antonio Gogava—who were eminent representatives of asyncretic Renaissance science tinted with occultism and alchemical-astrological studies.3 He came home with valuable astronomical instru-ments, made by Mercator. Still earlier, however, “First, from Lovayne didthe favourable fame of my skill in good literature spread, that thereupondivers noblemen came from the Emperour Charles the Vth, his court atBruxelles to visit me at Lovayne . . .” (Dee 1851, 6).ThePropaedeumata shows that Dee tried to approach prognostica-tion on a strictly scientific ground, astrology being treated here as appliedmathematics. While the neoplatonist magi of the early Renaissance triedto control the influence of the stars through talismanic magic and ritualincantations, Dee thought to accomplish this task by the help of math-ematically constructed optical mirrors. In this scientific program his pre-decessors were Ptolemy himself and the medieval authorities on optics:"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"158JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe Arab al-Kindi (De radiis stellarum), Urso Salernitanus, RobertGrosseteste, and Roger Bacon (cf. Clulee 1988, 52–69; Harkness 1999,71–77; Szulakowska 2000, 37–43).The nature of my present investigation does not require a digressioninto Dee’s mathematical reasoning. The point is that for the improve-ment of astrology he needed the exact number of stellar constellations.While traditional astrologers usually differentiated between 120 constel-lations, Dee in his book consisting of 120 aphorisms, determined a numberof 25,341. Dee tried to derive astrology from nature alone, avoidingdemonic intelligences that haunted even his learned contemporaryGiordano Bruno. According to Clulee, the early natural philosophy ofDee was built on a naturalistic concept of the world and man, in whichthe dualism of natural and supernatural was not particularly emphasized.ThePropaedeumata represents an eclectic synthesis, argues Clulee, thatcannot be directly linked with neoplatonic hermetism as the representa-tives of the Warburg school and Yates saw it. He is undoubtedly rightthat Renaissance occultism was not a homogeneous and monolithic sub-ject and that it was rooted in many medieval sources, too. But as Harknessrecently noticed, by 1550, “during his visit to Paris [Dee] became moreacutely aware of the enormous potential, and the enormous difficulties,associated with the study of the natural world” (1999, 82). And in myopinion, from the time of his earliest writings this awareness pushed himin a more and more mystical direction as the only means of promisingtrue exaltatio. I can see this attitude among the aphorisms of thePropaedeutama, as well.The title page itself is characterized by iconographical elements of eso-teric symbolism summarizing the occult correspondences of the universe.The frontispiece shows an architectural construct with the four elements atits four corners; at the centre of the columns the two main characters of thealchemical process can be seen (Sol and Luna); the central icon is a modifiedastrological-alchemical sign of Mercury that can represent all the planetarymetals. This is stated by the motto written in the ribbon: “STILBON, acuminepraeditus est instar omnium planetarum” (MERCURY, endowed with a sting,is like all the planets). This combination of Mercury seems to be Dee’sinvention; it appears here for the first time and later becomes the centralmotif of his major work, the hieroglyphic monad. The lower motto refers toconnections between Christianity and occult philosophy: “And there shall besigns in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars” (Luke 21:25). The uppermotto offers one of Dee’s favorite maxims: “Let him who does not under-stand either be silent or learn” (cf. Figure 6.1)."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"159The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyThe book is dedicated to Mercator and mentions that the catalyzerof the work was his friend’s recent letter in which he asked about hisprojects. Remembering their philosophical studies ten years earlier inLouvain, he decided to comment on the problems they were discussingat that time. Admittedly, thus, the Propaedeumata is the synthesis of thestudies of the past ten years, including his intellectual encounters inLouvain and Paris. The treatise clearly demonstrates Dee’s working meth-ods and the characteristic structure of his works (at least before thespiritual diaries). All of his surviving scholarly works were written inhaste and in a short time, usually after a long period of gestation. Heliked the concise, aphoristical expression; thus, his writings look likedrafts or outlines for larger—but never written—works.4The first aphorism is a general thesis of ontology, asserting Dee’smonistic, nature-oriented interest:As God created all things from nothing against the laws of reason andnature, so anything created can never be reduced to nothing unless thisis done through the supernatural power of God and against the laws ofreason and nature.

Although Dee avoids speaking about Man theMagus, his program implicitly involves the prospect of exaltatio:The entire universe is like a lyre tuned by some excellent artificer,whose strings are separate species of the universal whole. Anyone whoknew how to touch these and make them vibrate would draw forthmarvellous harmonies. In himself, man is wholly analogous to theuniversal lyre. (XI, 126–27)This thesis refers to the analogy between the macro and microcosms, andalthough one cannot say that the correspondences of the Great Chain ofBeing were the intellectual property of neoplatonism and hermetism, Dee’swords evoke their atmosphere. Clulee is right to emphasize that Dee’sscientific reasoning shows no relationship to the Florentine synthesis; how-ever, in my opinion, his contextual aphorisms nevertheless point in thatdirection. He mentions, for example, the cabala (XVIII). Like Ficino, hepraises the healing power of music (XXIII), and even speaks about talis-mans (XXVI). He also treats alchemy as astrologia inferior (LII), not unlikeParacelsus, and praises the mystic monad, constructed by himself.Furthermore, in Aphorism LXXIII he speaks about “the assidiousmage” who can discover the great harmony of the world. He illustratesthe correspondences by the paradigm of Sun—gold—and human heartand here he speaks of anatomical magic. In LXXVII he again uses par-allels from alchemy and the cabala: “What is seven times properly sepa-rated is prepared also to be seven times joined for the making of thatmost famous philosopher’s stone.”5The concluding aphorisms again show openness toward hermeticneoplatonism. Although according to Clulee the reference to HermesTrismegistus in CXIX comes not from Ficino but from the late HellenisticIatromathematica, which was used throughout the Middle Ages (1988, 45),he also accepts that by the time of writing the Propaedeumata Dee alreadyhad the basic primers of hermeticism: Ficino’s edition of the Corpushermeticum, Giorgi’s De harmonia mundi totius, Reuchlin’s De verbo mirifico,and Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia. One should take Clylee’s caveat seri-ously, namely that the acquisition of a book does not immediately meanits appropriation; still, while re-reading the aphorisms, I am inclined tofind in them the natural philosopher who is just about ready to abandonscientific humanism for the sake of hermetic mysticism."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"161The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyDuring the six years between writing the Propaedeumata and theMonas, Dee’s intellectual arsenal became enriched with important ele-ments. This is the time when he started establishing his collection ofParacelsica and his occult studies were also boosted by his long travel onthe continent in 1563 and 1564.6 The next subchapter will look at theMonas hieroglyphica, considering its sources and its importance as Dee’sfull-fledged manifesto for the study of magic exaltatio.ALCHEMY:MONAS HIEROGLYPHICAOn September 8, 1563, one of the many bemused observers of thecoronation of Maximilian II as King of Hungary was Doctor John Dee,the English mathematician, promotor of ascending British imperialism,and later notorious visitor of East-Central European courts with a strange,mystical-chiliastic message based on his conversations with angels. TheHungarian coronation city, Pozsony or Pressburg, present-day Bratislavain Slovakia, was just one stop on Dee’s long European journey, whichincluded visits to Zurich, Padova, Venice, and Urbino. The Englishhumanist’s main purpose was to meet leading intellectuals on the conti-nent, such as Conrad Gessner and Frederico Commandino; he consultedwith the former and with the latter he prepared a joint publication.7From Pozsony, through Germany, he moved back to Antwerp where hespent the whole of January 1564 finishing his major work, the Monashieroglyphica, which was published in March by the well-known printerWillem Silvius. The spectacular pageant of the Hungarian coronation somuch impressed the Doctor that he decided to dedicate the whole workto “Maximilian, by the grace of God the most wise King of the Romans,of Bohemia and of Hungary” (title page, Dee 1964, 113). A passingreference in Dee’s memoirs, almost thirty years later, from 1592, suggeststhat after the publication he returned to Vienna with the intention ofpersonally presenting his work to the Emperor:[15]64. Junij 14, after my return from the emperors court, her Maiestievery gratiously vouchsafed to account her self my scholar, in my bokewritten to the Emperor Maximilian, entitled Monas Hieroglyphica....8As Robert Evans (1973, 52–3) has noted, Maximilian seems to have beeninterested in esoteric subjects while his religious views were ambiguous."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"162JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMDee’s work itself is a slim volume, introducing and explaining amagic diagram, which is supposed to demonstrate all visible and meta-physical aspects of the universe in the form of a geometrical-alchemical-philosophical image. We have good reason to say that it was to functionas a revelatory mandala in order to propel the soul’s flight, that is, tobring the viewer into the state of exaltatio, an intuitive understanding ofthe cosmos and a unification with the wisdom of God.Dee himself explained the layers of his mystical meaning in thelengthy introduction addressed to Maximilian. As he wrote, his monadis explained “mathematically, magically, cabalistically, and anagogically”(Dee 1964, 155), but these four layers of meaning ought to be completedwith two more: the alchemical and the linguistic aspects that seem to linkintricately with the others.The text of the Monas hieroglyphica is nothing else than twenty-four theorems explaining the diagram. This explanation constitutes twoplanes of argumentation: the first acquaints the reader with the geo-metrical elements and the mystical-mathematical-cabalistic meanings ofthe diagram; the second outlines the potential capabilities of Man theMagus, in relation to his privilege to recreate the lost unity in the split,dualist existence.The title page in a comely manner incorporates the full diagram,surrounded by an architectural composition and several emblematic andphilosophical phrases. As I have shown, Dee had already used the monadon the frontispiece of his previous work, the Propaedeumata aphoristica,and there are similarities between the two title pages. However, it shouldbe noted that while in the Propaedeumata the hieroglyphic monad servedonly as emblematic decoration and the text did not provide its interpre-tation, this new book was entirely devoted to the explication of thismystical device. There is also a great difference between the two versionsof the diagram, the later being much more refined and placed in an egg-shaped oval—this is what Dee used for the second edition of thePropaedeumata, too (cf. Figure 6.2). Although Dee retained one of themottos—“Qui non intelligit, aut taceat, aut discat” (He who does notunderstand should either be silent or learn)—he replaced the key biblicalquotation from Luke 21-25, which referred to astrology, with Genesis 27:“May God give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fat of the earth.”This promise may have seemed to prefigure the kind of mystical synthesisof heavenly, occult knowledge, and earthly well-being the hermetic magusso much craved (see Figure 6.3)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"163The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyFIGURE 6.2 Frontispiece of the 2nd edition of Dee’s Propaedeumata . . .

Khunrath, Fludd, Maier, Kircher, andothers, in fact, often used and further elaborated Dee’s monad.9The first serious scholarly commentator of the hieroglyphic monad(after Tymme’s pioneering interpretation of the 1610s), C. H. Josten,admitted his uncertainty about the sources:It has not been possible to identify any ancient author as the princi-pal source of Dee’s ideas on the monas and on numbers.

One suchvolume was his copy of Alberti’s De architectura libri decem (1523 edi-tion, R&W 607) in which he could have read:[The Egyptians’] reason for expressing their sense by these symbols was,that words were understood only by the respective nations that talkedthat language, and, therefore, inscriptions in common characters mustin short time be lost. [. . .] The manner of expressing their sense bysymbols, they thought must always be understood by learned men ofall nations, whom alone they were of the opinion that things of mo-ment were fit to be communicated.” (quoted in Daly 1998, 22)"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"165The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyIn his article on the monas Michael T. Walton cited Meric Casaubon’sopinion that Dee was “a Cabalistical man, up to the ears”11 and appliedcabalist writers—Pico, Agrippa, and Postel—to extract the precise mean-ing of the cosmogram. His view—“Dee’s treatment of the Monad’s inter-pretation as an art of writing which revealed all astronomical knowledge,both the greater astronomy of the heavens and the lesser astronomy oralchemy”—is corroborated by Dee’s text in the preface addressed toMaximilian, according to which[T]his our holy language, which I have called the real cabbala, [. . .] whichwas born to us by the law of the creation, is also a more divine [gift], sinceit invents new arts and explains the most abstruse arts very faithfully.

(Dee 1964, 135)One cannot help noticing, though, that neither Dee nor his interpreter,Walton gave any indication of the exact origin of the monad’s graphic design.Nicholas Clulee has analyzed the Monas hieroglyphica at perhaps thegreatest length, but even he has not been able to identify sources or reallyclose parallel texts among Dee’s readings. He noticed the concept of themetamorphosis from the “horizon temporis” to the “horizon aeternitatis”in Dee’s thought, which is nothing but the exaltatio, although he did notcall it so. He cited Pliny, Trithemius, and Pico among those who voicedsimilar notions and finally concluded: “I believe that it is from RogerBacon that Dee derived the basic inspiration to seek an integral knowl-edge of nature” (Clulee 1988, 121). To strengthen his argument, herecalled Dee’s lost treatise from 1557 titled Speculum unitatis, written indefense of Roger Bacon. Relying on Bacon’s Tractatus brevis et utilis,Clulee argued that Dee had been able to receive information about an-cient theology and hermeticism through purely medieval sources. Butthen he also added that Dee himself had interpreted his cosmogram inevolving turns from a diagram of natural magic in the 1550s to a sum-mary of a universal grammar by the 1560s. In this context the monadshould be seen as a pythagorean or cabalistical formula generating thespiritual transformation of the soul and its mystical ascent from thematerial to the supercelestial realm.12 At this point Clulee turns to Re-naissance sources that could reveal concepts of magic for Dee, “far lessnatural than that he encountered in Roger Bacon” Clulee 1988, 128).These sources primarily meant the neoplatonic philosophers—Ficino, Pico,and Agrippa—whom Frances Yates called “the hermetic magi.”"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"166JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMHere I would like to argue that Dee, possessing and heavily annotat-ing Ficino’s Index eorum . .. (R&W 256), had a compact primer inneoplatonic hermetism at hand that could provide him with a widespectrum of that philosophy in a single textbook. As I have stated above,merely by looking at the contents of this compendium (reprinted andexpanded in his Opera of 1576 which Dee also possessed), one canconclude that Ficino’s ideal of magic must have been a synthesis betweenthe hermetic lore and the so-called Platonici.13 The collection unites thetwo kinds of corpus in the following order: “Dionysii Areopagitae translatiocum suis argumentis” (Ficino 1576, 2:1–1128); “In divinum Platonemepitomae” (1129–1533); “In Plotinum Philosophum ex Platonici familianati” (1534–1800); “Expositio Prisciavi & Marsilii Theophrastum defenso,ac phantasia, & intellectu” (1801–1835); “Mercurii Trismegisti Pymander,de potestate ac sapientia Dei item Asclepius de voluntate dei” (1836–1870); “Iamblichus de mysteriis Aegyptiorum, Caldeorum, atqueAssiriorum” (1873–1907); “Proclus de anima & daemonum [commentariisin Alcibiadem Platonis primum]” (1908–28); “Proclus de sacrificio &magia” (1928–29); “Porphyrius de occasionibus sive causis ad intelligibilianos ducensibus” (1929–32); “Porphyrius de abstinentia animalium [deanimi ascenta & descenta]” (1932–38); “Psellus de daemonibus” (1939–44); “Pythagore aurea verba & symbola” (1978–79).Here one finds those late neoplatonists (Iamblichus, Proclus, Por-phyry, Psellus) whom Brian Copenhaver (1988 and 1990) identified asFicino’s main inspirations—together with the tracts of the Corpushermeticum, or, as Ficino translated, “Mercurii Trismegisti Pymander, depotestate ac sapientia Dei item Asclepius de voluntate dei.” And if we arelooking for John Dee’s possible sources of hermetism, it is enough to lookat this collection, in which Chapter 4 of the Corpus hermeticum in its titlementioned a monad: “Mercurii ad Tatium Crater, sive Monas.” The veryfirst sentence of the text refers to that magical language/grammar thatWalton, Clulee, myself, and now Harkness have considered as the mainidea behind Dee’s monas:14Since the craftsman made the whole cosmos by reasoned speech, not byhand, you should conceive of him as present, as always existing, as havingmade all things as the one and only and as having crafted by his own willthe things that are. (4.1; quoted from Copenhaver 1992, 15)The passage then speaks about man’s exaltation: “The man became aspectator of god’s work. He looked at it in astonishement and recognized"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"167The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural Philosophyits maker” (4.2). And “God shared reason among all people” (4.3). In theconclusion of the chapter, Hermes explains the mystery of the unit ofoneness, the monad:The monad, because it is the beginning and root of all things, is in them allas root and beginning. Because it is a beginning, then, the monad containsevery number, is contained by none, and generates every number withoutbeing generated by any other number. (4.10; Copenhaver 1992, 17)This is exactly how Dee’s monad works: it represents oneness but one canderive from it all numbers, all letters, in fact all (alphanumeric) systemsof information. Ficino’s commentary to this locus emphasizes the exaltatioof man catalyzed by numbers: “Mox unitatis, & numerorum analogia, adveram monadem cogitandam, verosque naturæ numeros nos elevat. HaecCrater” (Ficino 1576, 2:1842–43).Recently Håkan Håkansson has studied Dee’s annotations in theGreek Corpus hermeticum and emphasized that it was the gnostic themesof these texts towards which Dee directed his attention in his marginalnotes. Håkansson corroborates my view that in Chapter 4 the “Cratersive Monas” image could represent for Dee that kind of divine illumina-tion he associated with the magus-adept in the Monas hieroglyphica.15Ficino’s compendium included the editor’s most radical esoteric work:De vita triplici. Although Dee did not annotate this part of the book, thismay result from the fact that he possessed De vita in two other editions(R&W 779, 896) which have not survived.16 If we compare John Dee’sspeculations and the third part of the work, that is, De vita coelitus comparanda,which contains the author’s boldest occult deliberations, we notice first of alla great deal of similarity between them concerning the general aims of magicaloperations. A program drawn up in one of Ficino’s chapters strikingly re-sembles the English Doctor’s ultimate goal with his monad:But why, then, should we neglect a universal image, an image of thevery universe itself? Through it, they seem to hope for a benefit fromthe universe. The adherent of these things, if he can do it, should sculptan archetypal form of the whole world. (3.19; Ficino 1989, 343–45)Although mostly concerned with talismanic images representing theclassical deities of the planets, Ficino also thought highly of mathematicaland geometric entities that could serve as a sign repertoire for the con-struction of the universal image:"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"168JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMTo keep you from distrusting figures too much, astrologers will orderyou to remember that [. . .] numbers and figures, to obtain celestialgifts, they are very powerful. For in the heavens, lights, numbers, andfigures are practically the most powerful of all. [. . .] For thus figures,numbers, and rays, since they are sustained by no other material, thendeservedly they claim the most dignity in the primary—that is thecelestial—levels of the cosmos. (3.17; Ficino 1989, 329)Then he arrived at concrete geometrical elements, praising their power toexpress universal harmony: “Proportions constituted out of numbers arealmost figures of a sort, made, as it were, out of points and lines” (3.17,331). And finally, he offered geometrical shapes for his talismans in a waythat might have inspired Dee to construct his monad out of circle andstraight lines forming a cross:The recent authorities on images have accepted as the general form forthese a round shape in imitation of the heavens. The more ancientauthorities, however, as we have read in a certain Arabic miscellany,used to prefer above all other figures that of a cross for the followingreason. [. . .] Above all a cross, like a plane, possesses length and breadth.This figure of the cross is primary; also, of all the figures, it is rectilinearin the highest degree, and it has four right angles. (3.18, 335)As we know, Dee also added a geometric form (two semicircles) to thediagram, which was to represent the element of fire, corresponding tothe fiery zodiacal sign of Aries. Referring to the appropriate time of theoperation, Ficino also pointed out the importance of Aries:But when exactly should he imprint it? When the Sun has reached thefirst minute of Aries [. . .] because a particular Lot of the world beingreborn, so to speak, is revolved through the same position in every year.At this time, therefore, he should construct the figure of the world.(3.19, 343–45)These textual parallels not only include the very geometrical base, butalso Dee’s intention to offer the monad as a mystical object for revelativecontemplation. A similar goal is designated by Ficino for his talismanicimages: “Nor should one simply look at it but reflect upon it in the mind”(3.19, 347). And since he renders “reflection” into seven steps—in har-mony with the number of the planets—it is interesting to see that afterfour elementary stages or functions, the three higher ones relate to different"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"169The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural Philosophyhuman intellectual activities. The fifth is the sphere of imagination (“Fifthare the strong concepts of the imagination—forms, motions, passions”—Mars), the sixth is discursive logic (“the sequential arguments and delibera-tions of the human reason”—Jupiter), while the seventh could be calledintuition (“the more remote and simple operations of the understanding,almost now disjoined from motion and conjoined to the divine”—Sat-urn).17 This is the concept that Thomas Hoby in his translation ofCastiglione’s The Courtier also named “understanding”:In our soul there be three manner ways to know, namely, by sense,reason, and understanding: of sense ariseth appetite or longing, whichis common to us with brute beasts; of reason ariseth election or choice,which is proper to man; of understanding, by the which man may bepartner with angels, ariseth will.18The idea of the reborn world comes up often in Dee’s later mysticalwritings, the private diaries. The importance of this idea for Ficino hasrecently been demonstrated by Michael Allen. In Nuptial Arithmetic heexamined Ficino’s commentary on the famous “Fatal Number” section inPlato’s Republic (Book VIII). In the complex analysis of Ficino’s numbersymbolism, Allen points out that “Ficino was in no position to follow hisbrother Platonist Pico della Mirandola into the arcana of cabalistic gematriawith its substitutions, [. . .] still such intellectual consequences were thenext logical steps” (Allen 1994, 144).Drawing a conclusion from the above remark, I am suggesting thatFicino’s cited passages of De vita coelitus comparanda can be treated asDee’s main and immediate textual source for constructing the monad,and if Pico’s cabala was the next logical step deriving from Ficino’s magic,then Dee took the following two logical steps: first, constructing ageometrical-cabalistical-magical cosmogram, then abandoning the wholeenterprise and turning directly to angel magic.kThe theorems of the Monas hieroglyphica explain the cosmic image ontwo planes: the geometrical, cabalistical, and anagogical interpretations—including astrological, alchemical and linguistic insights—highlight howthe elements and proportions can give a mystical but strictly scientificexpression of the ultimate cause of the World, the Oneness.

In the theorems,Dee mostly concentrates on the mathematical aspects and adds explana-tory charts to show how the combination of simple forms (straight line,circle, point, crossing lines at right angles) can symbolize the generalprinciples of the natural cosmos. As he explains in Theorem VI,We see Sun and Moon here resting upon a rectilinear cross which, byway of hieroglyphic interpretation, may rather fittingly signify the ter-nary as well as the quaternary: the ternary [in so far as it consists] oftwo straight lines and one point which they have in common andwhich, as it were, connects them; the quaternary of four straight linesincluding four right angles [. . .]. And so here the octonary offers itselfin a most secret manner, of which I doubt whether our predecessorsamong the magi ever beheld it, and which you will especially note. Themagical ternary of the first [of our] forefathers and wise men consistedof body, spirit, and soul. Thence we see here manifested a remarkableseptenary, to be sure of two straight lines and a point which they havein common, and of four straight lines separating themselves from onepoint.

(Tymme 1963,27–28)Dee himself refers to the alchemical importance of the monadwhen he identifies the double semicircles at the bottom of the diagramwith the astrological sign of Aries: this is nothing other than the signof fire providing heat for the transmutation (X–XI; Dee 1964, 161).The egg-shaped frame of the diagram furthermore refers to alchemy,as it may stand for the alembic of the adept, also called the egg of thephilosophers. Here Dee again calls attention to the interrelatedness ofastrology and alchemy (astronomia inferior, XVIII).In Charles Nicholl’s interpretation, mystical geometry, number sym-bolism, and alchemy make the monad “a cosmogram of astrological import,[and on the other hand it] works as a talismanic synopsis of the alchemi-cal process” (1980, 45). The alchemical plane of reference incorporatesthe doctrine of exaltatio or deification of man in Dee’s natural philoso-phy. As Nicholl suggests, the creation of the alchemists’ Mercury—thatis, the quintessential, perfect Mercury in the final phase of the Work—leads to the liberation of the spirit, too, because the process of (spiritual)alchemy entails two transformations: while it captures the celestial ener-gies and channels them into the material, it also elevates the soul andleads it back to the supernatural spheres from the prison of the material"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"172JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMsubstance. Elaborating on this process, in the preface written to Maxi-milian, Dee interprets his “magic parable” as follows:This, our hieroglyphic monad possesses, hidden away in its innermostcentre, a terrestrial body. [The monad] teaches without words, by whatdivine force that [terrestrial body] should be actuated. When it hasbeen actuated it is to be united (in a perpetual marriage) to a generativeinfluence which is lunar and solar. [. . .] When this Gamaaea has (byGod’s will) been concluded, the monad can no longer be fed or wateredon its native soil, until the fourth, great, and truly metaphysical revo-lution be completed. When that advance has been made, he who fed[the monad] will first himself go away into a metamorphosis and willafterwards very rarely be held by mortal eye. This, O very good King,is the true invisibility of the magi, which has so often been spokenof. . . . (Dee 1964, 135–37).In developing a philosophy of the alchemical exaltatio of man, Dee’smasters were undoubtedly the hermetist magi Ficino, Agrippa, and Para-celsus. Agrippa in De occulta philosophia (1533) claimed thatmagicians affirm, that not only by the mixture and application ofnatural things, but also of images, seals, rings, glasses, and some otherinstruments, being opportunely framed under a certain constellation,some celestiall illustration may be taken, and some wonderful thingmay be received; for the beams of the celestiall bodies being animated,living, sensuall, and bringing along with them admirable gifts and amost violent power, do, even in a moment, and at the first touch,imprint wonderful powers in the images, though their matter be lesscapable. (2.35; Agrippa 1997, 373)Similarly, Paracelsus in his Astronomia magna wrote,The Magus can transport many meadows of heaven into a small pebble,which we call ‘Gemaheu,’ or ‘Imago,’ or ‘Character.’ For these arecontainers in which the magus keeps sidereal forces and virtues as in abox. (Paracelsus 1589–1591, 10:376)19All the Renaissance magi tried to clarify through natural-philosophicalspeculations the nature of that transcendental material, or radiation, oragent that transferred the energy of the anima mundi to the talismans.These philosophers also strongly asserted the bidirectional nature of this"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"173The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural Philosophyprocess: if the magus can draw the power of the World Soul to basematter, so can he elevate himself above the material world.In the alchemical process the catalyzer is the pure mercury, “thecelestial messenger” (Dee 1964, 177). The transmutation means themeeting of two worlds, represented as a marriage, where the “terrestrialbody” is the material of the Gamaaea or talisman by the help of whichthe magus can boost its elevation. The talisman—because of its inscrip-tion—is also a character or sign of the heavenly language, the explorationof which is the ultimate goal of the magus. This aspect of metaphysicallinguistics has only recently been explored: following Clulee’s train ofthought, Umberto Eco in his book on The Search for the Perfect Languageconnected Dee’s interest in the reconstruction of a mystical and universallanguage to Postel’s similar objectives (1995, 185–90). As he pointed out,the view that the three sacred languages (Hebrew, Greek, Latin) devel-oped from a common geometrical-numerological base was put forwardby Postel in his De originibus (1553). The Frenchman there claimed that“every demonstration of the world” came from point, line, and triangle,and that sounds themselves—following the principles of Pythagoras—could be reduced to geometry.20In the theorems Dee, who of course had De originibus in his library,21exercised various manipulations on the monad (rotation, dismantling,combination and permutation of its elements), not unlike cabalistic,numerology works on and with the Hebrew characters. The preface toEmperor Maximilian clearly refers to this “science”:The science of the alphabet contains great mysteries, since He, who is theonly Author of all mysteries, has compared Himself to the first and lastletter (which is to be understood not only for the Greek language, butalso for the Hebrew and Latin ones). How great, then, must be themysteries of the intermediate letters? [. . .] We have demonstrated thatthe shape of all letters are derived from points, straight lines and thecircumferences of circles. [. . .] By the same process we discover clearlyenough that the first humans could not have established out of suchmystical principles that very stupendous fabric of the Hebrew letter andthe Nekudoth had not the afflation of the divine power been most[effectively] present. (Dee 1964, 125–27)From this it would follow that his intention in the construction of theMonad was not only the creation of a mystical emblem for contemplation,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"174JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMa mandala, but also a “geometrical automaton” that could generate thealphabet of all languages and thus would represent the universal principleof language.Theorem XXII of the Monas hieroglyphica wonderfully unites in a con-cise maxim the interconnectedness of metaphysical semiotics and exaltatio:The Logos of the creative universe works by rules so that man, godly-minded and born of God, may learn straightforward work and bytheological and mystical language. (Dee 1964, 201)This mystical language, then, like the inscription on a talisman, cantransmit the energy of the World Soul and, conversely, can illuminate themagus with intuitive understanding. Does not this, again, remind us ofFicino’s aphorism from De vita: “Nor should one simply look at it butreflect upon it in the mind?”22 And if one moves from “looking” to“reflecting,” the meditation over the revelatory cosmogram-mandala canaccomplish the magical exaltatio spoken of in the Tabula smaragdina: “Itascendeth from the Earth into Heaven, and againe it descendeth into theEarth, and receiveth the power of the superiours and inferiours. So shaltthou have the glorie of the whole world.”23By no means exhausting all the possible magical connotations of theMonas hieroglyphica, I would conclude by comparing the first two greatworks of John Dee. One can clearly see the continuity between them aswell as the innovation Dee added to the Monas. When writing thePropaedeumata, Dee was primarily still a scholar only superficially inter-ested in the occult philosophy. By the time of the Monas Dee had turnedinto a hermetic magus, albeit one who had not entirely abandoned hisearlier scholarly objectives and who still had the ambition of uniting the“old science” (Roger Bacon) with the “new philosophy” (Ficino, Agrippa,and Paracelsus) and “linguistics” (Postel). The connecting link betweenthe two works was his ever present desire to acquire a superior knowledgethat could lead him to the comprehension of the nature and intentionsof the Logos. In this sense the Monas represents the ultimate step towardpure theology, the term meaning, of course, not orthodox dogma but ahighly intriguing and idiosyncratic interconfessionalist vision.MAGIC:THE MATHEMATICALL PRAEFACEAs I have already emphasized, Dee’s career was characterized throughout bythe pursuit of perfect knowledge and this crystallized in the search for thelingua adamica from the time of his constructing the hieroglyphic monad."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"175The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyFrom this point on, Dee became more and more imbued with aspiritual-cosmic vision and this concern can clearly be felt even in his mostpractical work, the lengthy Preface to the English translation of Euclid’sElements (1570).24 This introduction was to serve the popularization ofmathematics in the vernacular and show how it could support the arts andcrafts. Dee in fact created a whole new scientific terminology, at the sametime giving a retrospective summary of his previous scientific studies. To asuperficial reading, it seems that the Preface is nearer to the old, scholarlyDee of the Propaedeumata than to the magus of the Monas. Evidence ofthis is that while he mentions his work of 1558, he neglects to refer to his“hieroglyphics” (Clulee 1988, 146–48). Because of this, Roberts and Watsoncall this work a “retrospective” endeavor (1990, 9–10), also noticing thatwhile the Monas was secretive, speaking to a small number of elect, thePreface is much more open, ecumenical, programmatic, and didactic. In-terestingly, the literature Dee cites is relatively outdated, mentioning fromamong his books only those he had bought before 1560.In this respect, the beautifully executed emblematic frontispiece canalso be considered conservative; it has no esoteric motives, only scientificelements and figures. The ten-fold division contains six portraits of clas-sical philosophers and scientists, and four emblematic pictures represent-ing the subjects of the quadrivium (cf. Figure 6.5).FIGURE 6.5 Frontispiece of Euclid’s Elements with Dee’s Mathematicall Praeface (London, 1570).University of Chicago, Department of Special Collections, reproduced from Dee 1975, 35."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"176JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMIt should also be noticed, however, that by that time his mind wasalready fixed on the “Otherworld,” and Clulee suggests that the Doctor’snew preoccupation can definitely be felt as a subtext of his main dis-course. On the frontispiece, this subtext is indicated by the emblems ofthe Sun and the Moon, while at the bottom of the page one sees Mercuriuscarrying his winged staff with two serpents twined around it.In the text itself, according to his new orientation, Dee develops adiction occasionally using phrases recalling the neoplatonists. He praisesharmony, mathematics, and proportions in passages that at times soar uplike prayer, like in the chapter explaining the laws of Archimedes:Thou onely, knowest all things precisely (O God) who hast madeweight and Balance, thy Judgement: who hast created all thinges inNumber, Waight, and Measure. [. . .] And for as much as, of Numberand Measure, the two Artes (auncient, famous, and to humaine usesmost necessary) are, all ready, sufficiently knowen and extant: this thirdkey [the weight], we beseech thee that it may come to the nedefull andsufficient knowledge, of such thy Servantes, as in thy workmanship,would gladly finde, thy true occasions whereby we should glorify thyname, and shew forth thy wondrous wisdom and Goodness. Amen.(Dee 1975, b.iiijv)Such passages indicate that Dee by no means wanted to write a simpleengineers’ handbook; rather, he considered the mathematician a magus,capable of exaltatio. According to Knoespel (1987), this highly rhetoricaldiction identifies Dee’s writing as premodern scientific discourse, since—as opposed to the language of the Scientific Revolution—it still heavilyrelied on images, allegories, and analogy, and the mixing of mathematicalformulas with biblical quotations and religious eulogies.25 In this vision theapplied mathematician was not yet liberated from logocentrism and heappeared as the priest of science, even of culture:All thinges (which from the very first originall being of thinges, havebene framed and made) do appeare to be formed by the reason ofNumbers. For this was the principall example or patterne in the mindeof the Creator. O comfortable allurement, O ravishing perswasion, todeale with a Science, whose subject is so auncient, so pure, so excellent,so surmounting all creatures, so used of the Almighty and incompre-hensible wisdome of the Creator, in the distinct creation of all creatures[. . .] by order, and most absolute number, brought, from Nothing tothe Formalitie of their being and State. (Dee 1975, *j)"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"177The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyFrom such an ideological platform Dee wanted not only to educatehis readers but to offer a kind of mystical initiation into science. His deepveneration of the mathematical arts resulted from his conviction that theproportions and balances as well as the cabalistical numerologicalcorrespondences taught the secrets of God’s creative mind. Because ofthis logic, he emphasized the importance of the vernacular translation ina peculiar way. Although he never spoke against the official seats oflearning, the universities, he also suggested that initiation into mysticalknowledge was not a sole privilege of the higher schools of education.The adept must learn, but university position could not guarantee theproper intuition also needed by the scientist.In the Mathematicall Praeface . .. Dee created a hierarchy of sciencesthat culminated in Archemastrie, a discipline he characterized as follows:This Arte, teacheth to bryng to actuall experience sensible, all worthyconclusions by all the Artes Mathematicall purposed, & by true NaturallPhilosophie concluded. [. . .] And bycause it procedeth by Experiences,and searcheth forth the causes of Conclusions, by Experiences: and alsoputteth the Conclusions them selves, in Experiences, it is named ofsome,Scientia Experimentalis. [. . .] But wordes, and Argumentes, areno sensible certifying: nor the full and finall frute of Sciences practisable.(Dee 1975, A.iijv)Historians of science have often interpreted the above passage as evidencethat Dee professed the experimental and practical disciplines and, what ismore, advocated science in the vernacular, so in this respect he could beregarded as an important forerunner of the Scientific Revolution. But at thispoint one should remember Allen Debus’ caveat from the 1970s: “In realitysixteenth-century natural magic was a new attempt to unify nature andreligion” (1978, 13). And, indeed, by putting Dee’s “Scientia Experimentalis”in the wider context of the work, we must be cautious about this carefreededuction. Immediately after the above passage Dee introduces the chiefauxiliary sciences of Archemastrie, which according to him aretheScience Alnirangiat, great Service. Under this, commeth Ars Sintrillia,by Artephius, briefly written. But the chief Science, of the Archemaster, asyet knowen, is an other OPTICAL Science: whereof, the name shall be toldwhen I shall have some (more just) occasion, thereof, to Discourse. (Dee1975, A.iijv)Although Dee apparently had no more occasion to expand on thesesciences and never gave a clear definition of optics as he understood it,"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"178JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMin the next chapter—following Clulee’s investigations—I shall suggestthat these sciences were more magical activities than experimental naturalsciences. Under optics, in fact, we can find scrying, crystal gazing, whichby 1570 was definitely on the horizon of his interest (see Harkness 1999,63–78). And Dee’s purpose with this kind of optical magic, no doubt,was to attain to great, superhuman knowledge. Clulee tried to deriveDee’s interest in mystical intuition from Roger Bacon’s works and hisfrequent use of the words experience and experiment.By the time he waswriting the Preface, Dee had accumulated so much literature of modernRenaissance magic that we ought to look for the genesis of such ideas inthe works of, say, Paracelsus, too. In his treatise on syphilis, the GermanDoctor wrote,The right path does not consist in speculation, but leads deep intoexperience. From experience the physician receives help, and upon itrests all his skill. He must have rich knowledge based on experience, forhe is born blind, and book knowledge has never made a single physi-cian. For this purpose he needs not human, but divine things, andtherefore he should not treat truth light-headedly. He does not act forhimself, but for God, and God bestows His grace upon him so that hemay come to the assistance of his fellow men in their needs.26Dee’s definition of archemastrie is in harmony with Paracelsus’ views:“There, then the Archemaster steppeth in, and leadeth forth on, theExperiences, by order of his doctrine Experimentall, to the chief andfinall power of Naturall and Mathematical Artes” (Dee 1975, Aiiijv).External evidence of Dee’s admiration for Paracelsus can be found inthealbum amicorum of the famous Swiss natural scientist Conrad Gesner,whom Dee visited in Zurich in April 1563. In the album, next to Dee’ssignature, Gesner commemorated his English guest’s great knowledge ofand interest in Paracelsus (cf. Durling 1965, 134 ff ).But what was behind his burning desire to have a glimpse of themysteries of Creation? His motivation was the same as that of theFlorentine neoplatonists, and later on of Trithemius, Agrippa, andParacelsus, that is, the new self-consciousness of Renaissance man whoconsidered himself God’s almost equal partner and asked for his sharefrom the secrets of nature. Its logic was driven by a confidence that Godcould not be pleased with the praises of the simply humble, will-less, andboring creatures; rather, he would require the adoration of ennobled andall-powerful humans, suited to the label “the image of God.”"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"179The Ideology and Occult Symbolism of Dee’s Natural PhilosophyWith this in mind it is difficult to enroll Dee among the forerunnersof the seventeenth century epistemological reform; rather, he seems torepresent a return to occult universalism, which was one of the productsof the ideological crisis on the eve of the Renaissance. An examination ofhis last intellectual period, that is, the full bloom of his angel magic,shows that he finally arrived at a conviction according to which—becauseof internal contradictions—rational scientific progress was not feasiblefor the purposes of humankind. From this dilemma he managed to createan almost perfectly consistent theory of meta-science or anti-science,whichever term one wishes to use."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"7Illuminaton and Angel MagicEarlier Dee studies tended to separate the Doctor’s “scholarly phase” fromthe twenty-five-year long period of “angel conferences.” In fact, tradi-tional science historians were not able to handle this phenomenon withinthe sphere of their subject field. Apart from two exceptional accounts ofprofessional historians (Evans 1973; Firpo 1952), it was only in the1980s that new efforts were made to look at the entirety of Dee’s outputfrom a unified perspective. The first decisive steps in this direction weretaken by Christopher Whitby (1981/1988, 1985)1 and Wayne Shumaker(1982, 15–53). Following these pioneers, Clulee’s analysis “from scienceto religion” produced the first extensive and widely contextualized study,embracing Dee “the scholar” as well as “the mystical and supermetaphysicalphilosopher” (1988, 203–31). Clulee’s example was emulated by Harknessto that extreme that she speaks about Dee’s earlier scientific works as “thegenesis of the angel conversations,” (1999, 60–98). I would be cautiousto follow her to that point, since such an approach might repeat theearlier blunder of the Yates school by explaining all and everything fromone single vantage point. In this respect I would rather side with Clulee,who was careful enough to show the variety and the inconsistencies inDee’s intellectual development. As I see now, Dee must have been hauntedby the same idée fixé during his long life, which pushed him throughschools and books and acquaintances pursuing knowledge, power, andprestige. But at various stages of his career this single drive manifesteditself in various forms, leading him to various subject fields and variousideological positions. Looking backward, one can say that his recourse to181"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"182JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMangel magic was a logical conclusion of his earlier efforts, but at the timeof his other attempts that outcome was not at all inevitable. While pur-suing results by means of the natural sciences, the Doctor’s final goalswere nevertheless very similar to what we identify as being supernaturaland magical today. On the other hand, while becoming engaged entirelyin angel magic, Dee still considered himself a scientist looking for theultimate truths of nature.Dee’s angel—or Enochian—magic can be examined from severalaspects. In the following subchapters I shall look at some of these, tryingto answer the questions:—what was the scholar’s motivation in turning away from scienceand pursuing angel magic?—what was the philosophy behind angel magic and the connectedidea of the lingua adamica?—what was the nature of Dee’s practical methodology, that is, scrying,and how was it related to the program of conversing with angels?—what were the contents of the angelic conferences, and how maya typology be established concerning these?—what can we say about Dee’s theology and religion in view of hisangel magic?Finally, in the next chapter I am going to touch upon one more,equally important aspect—the historical anthropology and sociology ofDee’s occultism, which includes his relation to his scryers as well as MericCasaubon’s early explanation of Dee’s spiritual magic.ANGEL MAGIC AND THE SEARCHFOR THE PERFECT LANGUAGEFrom the perspective of a positivistic model of science history, Dee’sturning from humanism to magic was described by John E. Bailey, editorof his diary, as follows: “[Dee had] long forsaken the exact sciences,having exhausted their study; and had devoted himself to the blightinginfluence of occult investigations, intermingling with them in creduloussimplicity what remained in him of the Christian faith” (Dee 1880, 2).One of Dee’s remarks of a confessional quality helps to explain thischange. When he was finally given an audience by Rudolf II in Prague,he explained his life-long ambition in and his disillusionment with sci-ence as follows:"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"183Illumination and Angel MagicHereupon I began to declare that All my life time I had spent in learning:but for this forty years continually, in sundry manners, and in diversCountries, with great pain, care, and cost, I had from degree to degreesought to come by the best knowledge that man might attain unto in theworld: and I found (at length) that neither any man living, nor any BookI could yet meet withal, was able to teach me those truths I desired andlonged for: And therefore I concluded with my self, to make intercessionand prayer to the giver of wisdom and all good things, to send me suchwisdom, as I might know the natures of his creatures; and also enjoymeans to use them to his honour and glory. (Dee 1659, 231)The quotation certainly displays scepticism and disappointment withscience but also, in fact, that his transition from science to magic was notas abrupt as it seemed until recently. Based on analysis of the unpub-lished spiritual diaries, Yewbrey (1981) and Whitby (1981/1988, 1985)called attention to the fact that Dee started his angel magic before 1581,the usual date accepted by scholars. According to his first, previouslyunstudied angelic diary, he had already employed a scryer in 1579 and,commenting on this, he even added: “Ab anno 1579. hoc ferè modo:Latinè vel Anglicè (ast circa annum 1569 alio et peculiari . . . , ”12 that is:From the year 1579 usually in this manner: in Latin, or English; (butaround the year 1569 in another and special way: sometimes on behalfof Raphael, sometimes of behalf of Michael it has been most pleasingto me to pour out prayers to God: God works his wonderful mercy inme. (Yewbrey 1981, 167)The reference to 1569 is very important because just at that time, during1569 and 1570, Dee was also working on one of his most ambitiousscientific works, the Mathematicall Praeface, in which he attempted asynthetical survey of all the mathematical sciences. The question thusbecomes even more relevant: what was the relationship, if any, betweenDee’s scholarly thinking and the angelic conversations? I have alreadyemphasized to what extent the ambition to gain omniscience motivatedDee’s investigations in natural philosophy. His radical turn from scienceto magic, in my view, must have been in close connection with thisambition. Dee’s preface to the above quoted spiritual diary started witha confession similar to the one he delivered before Rudolf:I have from my youth up, desyred & prayed unto thee [i.e. God] for pure& sound wisdome, and understanding of some of thy truthes naturall"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"184JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMand artificiall, such as by which, thy goodnes & powre bestowed in theframe of the word might be brought, in some bountiful measure underthe talent of my capacitie, to thy honor & glory, & the benefit of thyServants, my brethren & sistern. (MS Sloane 3188; Dee 1996, 1.4)This burning desire for inspired knowledge led him to various fields ofthe natural sciences, including mathematics, geometry, astronomy, andphilosophy, but we would not miss the fact that a strong theologicalframework was present in his thought from the very beginning of hiscareer. His admiration for the work of creation led him to a hymniceulogy in the Propaedeumata:The revolution of the stars has been established for the sake of thattotal and unceasing celestial harmony—which is a kind of first form ofeverything. [. . .] The most beneficient and wise Maker of the wholehaving ordained things in this way. (LXXV; Dee 1978, 163)No wonder that he concluded his work with these words: SOLI DEO HONORET GLORIA (198). The same deep religious enthusiasm can be found in hislater works, too. He offered the Monas hieroglyphica to Emperor Maximilianwith the following advice:For all things, visible and invisible, manifest and most occult things,emanating (through nature or art) from God Himself, are to be mostdiligently explored in our wanderings, so that thereby we may pro-claim and celebrate HIS GOODNESS, HIS WISDOM, & HIS POWER. (Dee1964, 125)TheMathematicall Praeface, too, abounds in such passages:The Heavens declare the Glorie of God: who made the Heavens in hiswisedome: who made the Sonne, for to have dominion of the day: theMone and Sterres to have dominion of the nyght: whereby, day to dayuttereth talke: to night declareth knowledge. Prayse him, all ye Sterresand Light. Amen. (Dee 1975, biiij)Although the theological texture of the above three quotations is ho-mogeneous, the three works from which they were cited represent Dee’sstations along his journey from science to magic. At the beginning of hiscareer he strongly believed in the potential of the natural sciences andperhaps it was his “discovery,” explained in the Propaedeumata, that anastrologer should calculate using over twenty-five thousand constellationsfor a single nativity chart, that disturbed his trust in quantitative science."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"185Illumination and Angel MagicThe disappointment led Dee to another trend of natural philosophy,Renaissance hermeticism, which combined neoplatonism, Ficino’s talis-manic magic, and Paracelsus’ spiritual alchemy. This train of thought wasstretched to its ultimate limits in the Mathematicall Praeface, where Deelaid the theoretical foundations of archemastrie, a universal science (Dee1975, Aiii).By the early 1580s he must have become disillusioned with thisuniversal science, too, as we may see in the confession written in hisspiritual diary in 1581 and later reconfirmed before Emperor Rudolf in1584. He must have come to the conclusion that no human disciplinecould lead to the desired omniscience. His situation thus became quitesimilar to that of Doctor Faustus—we remember how Marlowe’s herocried out with great dismay about the uselessness of human sciences:Settle thy studies, Faustus, and beginTo sound the depth of that thou wilt;Having commenced, be a divine in show,Yet level at the end of every art. . . .(A text 1.1.1–3)Philosophy is odious and obscure,Both law and physic are for petty wits;Divinity is basest of the three.Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible and vile. . . .(A text 1.1.138–41; quoted from Marlowe 1991)Although the English Doctor did not make a covenant with theDevil, he arrived at a method of trying to gain superhuman knowledgethat he himself had abhorred earlier. In general, he rejected the use ofdemonic magic and always passionately complained of being called asorcerer or conjuror.3 On the other hand, he always believed in a strongsymbiosis of science and deep religious faith, which necessarily affectedhis scholarly work, too. In 1592, in an apology, Dee summed up hisprogram of a combined scientific and spiritual exaltatio as follows:By the true philosophical method and harmony proceeding and as-cending, (as it were) gradatim, from things visible, to consider of thingsinvisible from things bodily, to conceive of things spirituall: by thingsmortall to have some perseverance of immortality. And to conclude: bythe most mervailous frame of the whole World, philosophically viewed,and circumspectly weighed, numbered, and measured, most faithfullyto love, honor, and glorifie alwais the Framer and Creator thereof.

In fact, this solution is remarkably logical from the Doctor’s sub-jective vantage point. He came to the conclusion that if the humanendeavor is insufficient to reveal the secrets of nature, man should turndirectly to supernatural beings and gain information from them. This ishow angel magic evolved as the ultimate solution to help Dee out of thefailure of his scientific projects, and this is how the ex-humanist becamemore and more absorbed in the questions of the lingua adamica.kAs I have pointed out in the introductory chapters, Dee, as an attentivereader of the Bible, was, naturally, well aware of those pieces of informa-tion in the sacred book that asserted the dignity of Adam in Paradise anddealt with the omniscient intellectual capacity given to Man prior to hisfall.4 A beautiful visualization of the glory of our forefather can be foundin Schedel’s Weltchronik, depicting the creation of Adam on the sixth day.While being moulded from clay, Adam is holding the hand of God,surrounded by animals as if waiting for him to give names to all thebeings of the world (Figure 7.1).FIGURE 7.1 The sixth day of Creation: Adam names the beings of the world.

They received the use of the five operationsof the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding,and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, and a heart, gave he them to under-stand. Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding. . . .(Sirach 17:3–7)The above passage suggests that one of the most important gifts of Godto Man was the sacred language, through which communication with thegodhead as well as understanding of the work of creation was possible.From this passage alone, the early modern thinker could infer that byrecovering this lost sacred language all his ambitions and desires concern-ingexaltatio could be fulfilled. This train of thought is the key to JohnDee’s later scientific and philosophical investigations.I have already shown how he suggested a way of recovering theperfect language in the Monas hieroglyphica. As it seems today, themonad was equally meant to serve as a mystical emblem for contem-plation and also as a “geometrical automaton,” which could generatethe alphabet of all languages, thus contribute to the restoration of thelost universal language.Realizing the failure of this project, Dee finally must have come tothe obvious conclusion, namely, that he could not find any other way butturning to God directly:I have sought [. . .] to fynde or get some ynckling, glyms, or beameof such the foresaid radicall truthes: But after all my foresaid endevorI could fynde no other way, to such true wisdom atteyning, but bythy Extraordinary Gift. . . .

According to Old Testamentpseudepigraphica, it was Enoch who invented the human crafts and cre-ated writing for his descendants. Dee, on the basis of his readings onEnoch,5 associated the learning of Jared’s son with the use of a “shew-stone,” a crystal ball that could be used as the connecting device incommunication with angels:I have read in thy bokes & records, how Enoch enjoyed thy favour andconversation, with Moyses thou wast familier: and also that to Abraham,Isaac, and Jacob, Josua, Gedeon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias, and sundryother, thy good Angels were sent, by thy disposition to instruct them,informe them, help them, yea in wordly and domesticall affaires, yea,and sometimes to satisfy theyr desyres, doutes & questions of thy Se-crets. And furdermore considering the Shew stone which the high preistsdid use, by thy owne ordering. (ibid.)Dee thus finally arrived at a radical method in order to gain supernaturalknowledge: he employed a kind of magical divination to contact angelsin order to learn directly from them the primordial perfect language,which had once been summarized for mankind by Enoch but was ulti-mately lost with the destruction of humankind at the time of the Flood.As Dee claimed, since Enoch he was the first human being who—by thehelp of angels—could have some insight into this language.The fact is that Enoch caused quite a lot of excitement among earlymodern humanists and chiliasts. His portrait could be found even insuch general encyclopedias, as Schedel’s Weltchronik (Figure 7.2). Dee’sdirect source must have been Guillaume Postel’s De originibus (Basel,1553) in which the French enthusiast related his meeting with an Ethio-pian priest in Rome in 1547 who described for him the Book of Enochin detail (cf. Bouwsma 1957, 13–14). As I have mentioned in anothercontext, Dee possessed this book, and his surviving copy in the RoyalCollege of Physicians testifies to his fascination with it: all the passagesreferring to Enoch are marked and underlined (R&W 868; cf. Clulee1988, 297n. 25).We cannot know if Postel and Dee discussed the question of Enochat their meeting in France in 1551 but obviously Postel’s mystical andapocalyptic writings with their speculations on the origin of languages"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"189Illumination and Angel Magicattracted the English Doctor into a similar circle of thought. Postel mighthave also drawn Dee’s attention to the Hebrew 3Enoch. He was deeplyinterested in Jewish scholarship, including the cabala, and translated sev-eral important works of the Judaic tradition. Already before their meetinghe had published Candelabri typici in Mosis tabernaculo jussu divino (Venice,1548) in which he—following Johannes Reuchlin—advertised the Zohar,theBahir, and the cabala as Jewish treasures leading to the final verificationof the evangelical truths. He also translated and edited the Sefer Yetsirah.Its title page claimed that it was Postel who had recovered the text fromBabylon and now decided to restitute it for the edification of mankind(Abrahami patriarchae liber Jezirah sive formationis mundi . .. Paris, 1552).In the same year he published one more exciting text, Restitutio rerumomnium conditarum, per manum Eliae profetae terribilis, which suggestedthat the horrifying prophecies of Elijah, deriving from the language of“Saint Adam,” would contribute to “the restitution” of the whole worldthe first example of which was his own “translation” by the VenetianVirgin (Bouwsma 1957, 276 ff.; Secret 1985, 178–86). There is no proofthat Dee was aware of Postel’s personal “restitution” as the first-born ofFIGURE 7.2The portrait of Enoch from Schedel’s Das Buch der Chroniken (Nürnberg, 1493), fol.10v. Somogyi Library, Szeged [Inc 10]."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"190JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe new epoch, but his rhetoric in the spiritual diaries sometimes suggestssomething of a similar conviction about himself.Although Dee could not have read the Book of Enoch, he and manyother enthusiasts were eagerly awaiting the return of its manuscript. Even inthe seventeenth century, several codices brought from Ethiopia stirred excite-ment in regard to the long awaited discovery. For example, a learned Capu-chin monk retrieved a manuscript that he brought to Europe and believedto be the hunted text, but in 1683 Ludolfus Hiob clarified that it was anunknown Ethiopian work called “The Book of the Mysteries of Heaven andEarth”—nevertheless a close relative of the Book of Enoch. In this atmo-sphere, especially considering the passages in Postel’s works of which Deemust have been well aware, one cannot be surprised that even without beingdirectly familiar with the core of Enochian literature, the English Doctorchose this biblical-apocryphal character as his role model. And it was indeedlogical that Dee, who could not have had access to the sacred text of theBook of Enoch, finally turned to the angels for information. And they seemto have been good informants because Enoch’s appearance in Dee’s privatemythology embedded in his angelic conversations shows interesting conver-gence with the since-discovered original Enochian literature.For example, the first part of 1Enoch relates the story of the fallenangels, how they intercoursed with women and corrupted all men, andhow Enoch tried to intervene on their behalf before God. This book isusually referred to as the “Book of the Watchers” (Charlesworth 1983, 5).As we shall see, Dee in one of his visions called a mighty angel “the chiefWatchman” and his dwelling place a “Watch-Tower”6—all this may havebeen accidental but nevertheless suggests that the Doctor’s train of thoughtran parallel with that of the imagery of the Book of Enoch.Let us now examine how the Enochian mythology unfolded in hisspiritual diaries through the communication of Archangel Gabriel. OnSaturday, April 21, 1584, at a scrying session, Gabriel himself revealedthe mythical story of the lingua adamica to the bemused Doctor:GABRIEL: Man in his Creation, being made an Innocent, was alsoauthorised and made partaker of the Power and Spirit of God: wherebyhe not onely did know all things under his Creation and spoke of themproperly, naming them as they were: but also was partaker of our [i.e.the angels’] presence and society, yea a speaker of the mysteries of God;yea, with God himself: so that in innocency the power of his partakerswith God, and us his good Angels, was exalted and so became holy inthe sight of God until that Coronzon (for so is the true name of that"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"191Illumination and Angel Magicmighty Devil) envying his felicity, began to assail him. [. . .] And [Man]was driven forth (as your Scriptures record) unto the Earth: wherebeing dumb and not able to speak, he began to learn of necessity theLanguage in the which he uttered and delivered to his posterity, thenearest knowledge he had of God his Creatures. (Dee 1659, 92)According to this piece of information, the prelapsarian Adam waspartaker of the perfect divine knowledge and he could be set as themodel and measure the magus wanted to achieve. The key to thisknowledge seemed to be the reconstruction of the lost angelic languagethat would provide the way of return to the world of transcendentalsuperexistence. Dee’s solution was remarkably simple: according to hisfinally crystallized opinion, neither mathematics nor poetry could teachthe language of angels. One should rather contact them and learn itfrom themselves.The Archangel indeed assured the pious magus of the goodwill of thespirit world in sharing their knowledge with him:With this that we deliver, which Adam verily spake in innocency, andnever uttered nor disclosed to man since till now, wherein the powerof God must work, and wisdom in her true kind be delivered: whichare not to be spoken of in any other thing, neither to be talked of withmans imaginations; for as this Work and Gift is of God, which is allpower, so doth he open it in a toungue of power. (ibid.)So Doctor Dee devoted the last twenty some years of his life to this goaland, surprisingly, the scholar who was perfectly intimate with the mostsubtle intellectual procedures of his time chose the crudest way of con-tacting angels: scrying.THE THEORY AND TECHNOLOGY OF ANGEL MAGICTheory and SourcesWhen we discuss the nature and procedures of scrying, we also cannothelp noticing the connecting links between medieval science, naturalmagic, and this kind of uncultivated divination. So far these links havebeen largely neglected by science historians, but I hope to demonstratethat although Dee’s recourse to the practice of crystal gazing may seemat first sight quite surprising, his decision was not at all a sudden and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"192JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMwhimsical resolution, but just the opposite; it followed from his previousambitions and investigations.Although there seems to be an enormous difference between opticsand scrying, I agree with Clulee and Harkness that the roots of Dee’scrystal magic should be looked for in his early interest in medieval optics.In connection with optics, one should remember that this term refers toat least two strands of exploration: first, the practical study of light rays intheir effect on the human eye and in their reflective and refractive behaviorin relation to objects, such as glass, crystal prisms, and water; and, second,mystical concepts concerning the occult operations of light, a potent forcein activating inert matter.7 This double nature of optics can be comparedto the Janus face of alchemy, which included practical procedures withchemical matter on the one hand and on the other spiritual transforma-tion, that is, soaring up from base existence to supernatural understanding.8Again similar to alchemy in which the two orientations did notseparate, but rather overlapped, medieval optics was also a mixture ofmystical concepts and practical observations. Thus in one of the mostfamous medieval Arabic treatises on optics, al-Kindi’s De radiis stellarum,we find a concoction of theorizing from light rays to astrology (Clulee1988, 52–69; Garin 1983). Even late medieval experimental optics—as in the works of Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon—was heavilyinfluenced by neoplatonic mysticism, ideas related to the Plotinian ema-nations, and light imagery often borrowed from Jewish mysticism, pri-marily the Zohar. Dee was deeply influenced by these medieval opti-cians and his library catalogues testify what an amount of manuscriptsand printed materials he collected in this field. In the following para-graphs I am going to demonstrate that each of Dee’s major scientificworks had some themes related to optics and that all these led towarda theory of magic.Let us begin with the Mathematicall Praeface because this elaborationcontained an interesting hierarchy of scientific disciplines. Dee made itclear that the ultimate end of any science should be the understandingof God’s creative genius. In relation to this, Dee emphasized the cosmicsignificance of mathematics and suggested that the mathematical practi-tioner had the power to become a magus, capable of exaltatio, the emu-lation of God:By Numbers [. . .] we may both winde and draw our selves into theinward and deepe search of all creatures distinct vertues, natures, prop-erties, and Formes: And also, farder, arise, clime, ascend, and mount up"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"193Illumination and Angel Magic(with Speculative winges) in spirit, to behold in the Glas of Creation, theForme of Formes, the Exemplar Number of all thinges Numerable: bothvisible and invisible, mortall and immortall, Corporall andSpirituall. . . . (Dee 1975, *j-*jv)When mapping the hierarchy of sciences, Dee put on top a disciplinecalledarchemastrie. “So that, this Art, is no fantasticall Imagination: assome Sophister might [. . .] dash your honest desire and Courage, frombeleving these thinges, so unheard of, so mervaylous, & of such Impor-tance” (1975 A.iiiv). As I have quoted earlier, here Dee also listed theauxiliary sciences helping the work of the Archemaster: alnirangiat,arssintrillia, and optical science (see above, p. 177).Nicholas Clulee has identified all three above mentioned sciences asmagical practices. The expression alnirangiat derives from Arabic sources:the term nı ̄rang ̆iya ̄t meant a certain magical procedure; in the Arabicversion of the Picatrix the term nı ̄rang ̆ referred to magical incantationsthat were used to invoke heavenly powers. It was also used in suchcontexts when pictures or talismans were involved. As Clulee explains,Dee’s source for this term was Avicenna’s De divisionibus scientiarum, inwhich “scientia alnirangiat” is listed among the subordinate branches ofnatural science. Here it is a form of natural magic, for the manipulationof the hidden virtues of things (1988, 167). Dee possessed this work inhis library and from the surviving copy we know that he underlined theword alnirangiat and glossed on the margin: “magicae” (R&W 395).The next science mentioned by Dee is ars sintrillia, which has beenconnected with the name of a medieval author, Artephius, who is oftenreferred to in a great many treatises though his identity is unclear. Ac-cording to Dee’s catalogue, in 1556 he possessed a manuscript that con-tained Artephius’ Ars sintrillia but this treatise is no longer extant. Theonly clue scholars have been able to track down is a remark of Guillaumed’Auvergne who mentions a certain Artesius known for his ability toconjure up visions by placing a glossy sword over a water basin so thatthe glittering of the two caused the viewer to see strange sights (Clulee1988, 168). The context of Dee’s note makes this conjecture plausiblesince he subsequently lists “opticall science,” which—also according toClulee—is not only physics but rather crystallomancy, or as commonlyknown, scrying. As we have seen, Dee started his scrying experimentsaround the writing of the Mathematicall Praeface and his scientific treatisesuggests that, at least at that point, he saw no fundamental contradictionbetween natural science and occult spirit lore."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"194JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMAlthough Artephius’ ars sintrillia has not been recovered, it should beremembered that Artephius, the legendary twelfth-century alchemist, wassaid to have lived over a thousand years due to the magic elixir hemanaged to distill. His story became a paradigmatic point of reference insixteenth-century humanist mythologies and his name was occasionallyassociated with Enoch as well. François Secret in his studies (1979, 1990)brought together these motifs and many of our main heroes in an in-triguing combination set in mid-century Paris. There is Postel, who inthe 1540s worked in the Collège Royal founded by Francis I. His col-league there, Oronce Finé, the famous mathematician, extensively dealtwith alchemical experiments, too, and introduced Postel to the art of“inferior astronomy.” There are many references concerning alchemy inhis early masterpiece De orbis terrae concordia (Basel, 1544), where, amongothers, he mentioned Arthepius, who, thanks to his alchemical studies,succeeded in living 1020 years.9 According to the Secret Book of Artephius:I, Artephius, after I became an adept, and had attained to the true andcomplete wisdom, by studying the books of the most faithful Hermes,the speaker of truth, [. . .] when I had the space of a thousand years,or thereabouts, which has now passed over my head [. . .] by the useof this wonderful quintessence. (Artephius 1999, paragraph 30)Postel’s source for this legend was Roger Bacon, of whom he couldhave learned from Finé’s recent edition of Bacon’s De mirabili potestateartis et naturae. A few years later Dee visited Paris and met Finé, withwhom he could discuss not only Euclid but also his own beloved author,Roger Bacon, while he also met Postel, who was interested in Enoch andArtephius like himself. Soon after, Postel had his “restitution” by thereincarnation of his “Venetian Virgin,” and from this time on he claimedthat he was reborn and endowed with the gift of extremely long life. Thelegend, according to which he lived over 120 years, was still rememberedin the seventeenth century. It was repeated by many distinguished schol-ars, such as the philosopher Francis Bacon (1560–1626) and GabrielNaudé (1600–1653), Mazarin’s librarian and the historiographer of theRosicrucians (Secret 1979, 85).Perhaps it was his conversations in Paris that set Dee to studying thecritical edition of Roger Bacon’s Epistolae de secretis operibus et naturae. Topropel his enthusiasm, he could also consult Finé’s earlier publication(Paris, 1542). Dee’s text appeared only posthumously in Germany,10 butits English translation published half a century later still recalled theDoctor’s editorial efforts: Discovery of the Miracles of Art, Nature, and"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"195Illumination and Angel MagicMagick.

His story was con-voluted with that of Nicholas Flamel (1330–1418), the legendary Frenchadept who was said to have discovered the elixir of long life himself andhis followers believed that he was still alive though retired from theworld, and would live for six centuries (Seligmann 1971, 123–24; Spence1960, 162). A publication of 1624 finally introduced both Flamel andArtephius to the English readers: Nicolas Flamel, His exposition of thehieroglyphicall figures which he caused to bee painted upon an Arch in St.Innocent’s Church-yard in Paris [. . .] Together with the secret booke ofArtephius [. . .] concerning both the theoricke and the practicke of the Phi-losophers Stone. Faithfully done into English out of the french and latinecopies by Eirenaeus Orandus.12Before returning to the career of crystallomancy in the Renaissance,I would like to mention one more aspect of “opticall science” that is alsopertinent to Dee’s works. Already in 1558, in his first synthetizing work(Propaedeumata aphoristica), he mentioned “catoptrics” of which he wrote:If you were skilled in “catoptrics,” you would be able, by art, to imprintthe rays of any star much more strongly upon any matter subjected toit than nature itself does. [. . .] And this secret is not of much lessdignity than the very August astronomy of the philosophers, calledinferior [i.e. alchemy], whose symbols, enclosed in a certain Monadand taken from my theories, I send to you along with this treatise. (Dee1978, 149)Catoptrics in classical natural science meant the study of the radiationand reflection of light, and Roger Bacon in the Middle Ages devotedmuch work to this field. Not only in his great scholarly works did hediscuss “burning mirrors” and the like, optical devices were also men-tioned in his programmatic Epistle (Bacon 1923, 28–29). As we know,Dee was most interested in Bacon’s work, and it was partly this influencethat encouraged him to try to catch the power of the stars by the helpof mirrors, which activity he interpreted as the scientific version of an-cient talismanic magic."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"196JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMTalismans, which had been much discussed in medieval Arabic andLatin sources, were reinvented by the Florentine neoplatonists, and theirscientific application was proposed by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa andParacelsus.13 Of these magical images, or “sigils” Agrippa noted:So great is the extent, power and efficacy of the celestial bodies, thatnot only natural things, but also artificial when they are rightly exposedto those above, do presently suffer by that most potent agent, andobtain a wonderful life which oftentimes gives them an admirablecelestial virtue.

One of his notableexamples describes the power of planetary amulets:FIGURE 7.3 Magical sigils from Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia (Basel, 1550), 286, 394.

The names ofhis good angels, Anchorus, Anachor, and Anilos, inscribed in the samebook, indicate the interrelatedness of Paracelsus and angel magic in oldDee’s interests (Roberts and Watson 1990, 101; note to item 1476).Paracelsus wrote about images and defined Gamaaea as follows:OF IMAGES [IMAGINUM].

They render persons invisible, and display otherqualities which, without this science, Nature of herself cannot exhibit.(Erklärung der Gantzen Astronomey; Paracelsus 1894, 2:295)Let us compare this to Dee’s thesis in the Propaedeumata:The stars and celestial powers are like seals whose characters are im-printed differently by reason of differences in the elemental matter.[. . .] You will therefore consider talismans rather attentively, and otherstill greater things. (Dee 1978, 135)And to the already quoted passage of the Monas, written in 1564:This our hieroglyphic monad possesses, hidden away in its innermostcentre, a terrestrial body. It [the monad] teaches without words, by"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"198JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMwhat divine force that [terrestrial body] should be actuated. [. . .] Whenthis Gamaaea has (by God’s will) been concluded, [. . .] he who fed[the monad] will first himself go away into a metamorphosis and willafterwards very rarely be held by mortal eye. (Dee 1964, 135)As I have pointed out, in the Propaedeumata he only passingly mentionedtalismans and instead concentrated on a scientific method that was tosubstitute the use of magical images. As opposed to this, the Monas isnothing but a magical image, a talisman that here has a double function:as earthly material it participates in the process of transmutation, and asa heavenly esoteric sign it helps the magus to soar up to the higherspheres of reality.The above quotations from Dee redirect us to Paracelsian contexts,since in his synthetizing Astronomia magna the German Doctor made itclear thatMan is born of the earth, therefore he also has in him the nature of theearth. But later, in his new birth, he is of God and in this form receivesdivine nature. Just as man in nature is illuminated by the sidereal lightthat he may know nature, so he is illuminated by the Holy Ghost thathe may know God in his essence. For no one can know God unless heis of divine nature. (I, 12: 326; Paracelsus 1951, 44)And indeed, it is this similarity to God that enables man to become acreator of things, even more powerful than the upper and lower firmaments:Now, it is no matter for astonishment that man accomplishes suchthings, for if it be true, as the scripture says, that ye are gods, we shallcertainly be superior to the stars. [. . .] The wise man rules Nature, notNature the wise man. For the same reason we can accomplish morethan the stars. [. . .] The will of man extends over the depth of the seaand the height of the firmament. (Erklärung der Gantzen Astronomey;Paracelsus 1894, 2:300)Creation, the establishment of wondrous things, happens through magicand Paracelsus in his writings introduced magic according to the three tiersof the Agrippian model, from magia naturalis through planetary, astrologi-cal magic up to mystical rebirth: “He who imitates the image of God willconquer the stars” (Astronomia magna, I,12:41–42; Paracelsus 1951, 155–56). This is simply the doctrine of Man’s deification through white magic,as proposed by Agrippa in his most beautiful passage on exaltatio:"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"199Illumination and Angel MagicTherefore our mind being pure and divine, inflamed with a religiouslove, adorned with hope, directly by faith, placed in the height and topof the human soul, doth attract the truth and suddenly comprehend it,and beholdeth all the stations, grounds, causes and sciences of things[. . .] as it were in a certain glass of eternity. (3.6; Agrippa 1997, 455)Previously, I have pointed out that for Agrippa the idea of deification wasconnected with alchemy in the form of spiritual transmutation (cf. Deocculta 3.36). In the above passage, the phrase “glass of eternity” seemsto refer to other magical arts: if it meant a mirror, then one can associateit with “catoptrics,” Artephius’ ars sintrillia; if it meant a crystal, one canthink of Paracelsus’ “beryl,” or Dee’s “shew-stone.”The main significance of the use of beryls or crystals was, of course,that by their help one could contact the spirit world, could practice angelmagic, which for both Agrippa and Paracelsus was the highest kind ofoccult art. The former wrote of divine angelic names:Therefore sacred words [i.e. names] have not their power in magicaloperations, from themselves, but from the occult divine powers work-ing in them in the minds of those who by faith adhere to them; [. . .]who have ears purged by faith, and by most pure conversation andinvocation of the divine names are made the habitation of God, andcapable of the divine influences. Whosoever therefore useth rightlythese words or names of God with that purity of mind, shall bothobtain and do many wonderful things. (3.11; Agrippa 1997, 476)To which Paracelsus added with his usual lofty imagery:He who inherits God’s wisdom walks on water without wetting his feet;for in the true art inherited from God, man is like an angel. But whatwill wet an angel? Nothing. Similarly, nothing will wet the wise man.God is powerful and He wills it that His power be revealed to men andto angels in the wisdom of the arts. He wills it that the world and theearth be like Heaven. (De fundamento scientiarum sapientiaeque, I,13:306;Paracelsus 1951, 163)Once again we have arrived at Dee’s most ambitious magical pro-gram: he aspired for this state of exaltatio in order to understand fully thework of creation and become God’s partner. His whole scientific programwas subordinated to this goal, and this is why he was experimenting withastrological catoptrics as well as with the monad, extracted and trans-muted from talismanic magic into sacred geometry and alchemy."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"200JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMIt would be a mistake, however, to limit Dee’s magic to sources ofhermetic neoplatonism such as Ficino, Agrippa, or Paracelsus. What makeshis esoteric experiments fascinating is the ease of syncretism with whichhe freely exploited quite distinct traditions from medieval Baconian magicthrough Old Testament traditions to some semi-scientific, semi-popularpractices of dubious origin.A good point of departure is the technique of Artephius (ars sintrillia),which operated with glittering mirrors in order to bring the viewer intoa trance where logic became suspended. The ancient and venerable na-ture of this practice was proved in the Bible, where we read about Josephhiding a silver chalice in Benjamin’s pouch saying, “Is not this it in whichmy lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?” (Genesis 44:5). Itshould be noted, however, that such divination in the Bible is usuallyboth condemnable and condemned: “And he made his son pass throughthe fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt withfamiliar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight ofthe Lord . . .” (2 Kings 20:21).Dee seems to have tendentiously overlooked such warnings, both inthe Bible and in his much admired Paracelsus, where he could read in theAstronomia magna: “Spirits often teach those persons who deal with themto perform certain ceremonies, to speak certain words and names inwhich there is no meaning. [. . .] On the whole, all these spirits surpasseach other in deception and lies” (quoted by Hartman 1891, 149).In the second book of Moses we learn that the priestly garment madefor Aaron contained a golden breastplate with twelve shining jewels, sym-bolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. This shining breastplate could also beused for purposes of divination (helping the gazing prophet to fall into atrance) and it is in this sense that medieval lapidaries refer to this locus.14Paracelsus also spoke about a particular way of divination by using shiningsurfaces. He calls it ars beryllistica, which aims at gaining visions fromdiamonds, mirrors and other glossy materials, such as black coal:VISIONS. This species sees in crystals, mirrors, polished surfaces, and thelike, things that are hidden, secret, present or future, which are presentjust as though they appeared in bodily presence. (Paracelsus 1894, 2:296;also 1:171)The most important difference between catoptromantia and crystallo-mantia was that in the former the operator—after proper preparationsand sufficient fasting—did not want to conjure spirits in the mirror;"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"201Illumination and Angel Magicrather he expected visions relating to the future. In scrying, the magusdefinitely aimed at calling spiritual beings (angels or the spirits of alreadydead persons), hoping to gain information, not necessarily about thefuture. In both cases the use of mediums was common.15It seems that Dee possessed instruments for both kinds of magic: ashining black obsidian mirror may have been used to practice ars sintrilliaorcatoptromantia, that is, divination from mirrors (this mirror presentlyis in the British Museum, donated by the eighteenth-century eccentricaristocrat Horace Walpole), while his much exploited crystal ball servedthe purposes of scrying.16 What becomes perplexing for the cultural his-torian is that Dee, acquainted with the most complex magical theoriesand techniques, finally ended up practicing this crudest form of divina-tion and, having pursued it till the last days of his life, lost no faith init at all.Crystallomantia, or scrying, was relatively neglected in the works ofRenaissance humanists, although some mentions can be found in the worksof Trithemius and others, usually in contexts reciting the anti-magicalcondemnations of medieval authorities and encyclopedias, as in John ofSalisbury’s Policraticus or Gregorius Reisch’s Margarita philosophica nova.17It seems that by the sixteenth century, crystallomantia became most wide-spread in popular culture as a common form of magic. We have two groupsof sources to document such practices. Humanist literature, on the onehand, relates us anecdotes of such magical habits. Nearest to Dee’s scryingpractice is, for example, Cardano’s story about the conjuration of a scryerboy who saw angels in the crystal by the help of Saint Helena.18 Anothertype of source material for the popular usage of the crystal ball (or beryl,orsphera) is the protocols of witchcraft trials and ecclesiastical visitations.In such processes a routine question of the interrogation was “Have youtold anything from crystal, glass, or mirror to people?”19Needless to say, scrying was strictly damned by both secular and eccle-siastical law. In England law court processes took place in 1467, 1534, and1549, and the 1541 statute against conjuration and witchcraft definitelyprohibited it (Whitby 1985, 29–30). Since scrying was mostly used forfinding lost or stolen property, the temptation to overlook the law wasconsiderate. Although such practices were strictly private, almost all as-trologers and alchemists can be suspected of having exercised it. AnotherElizabethan astrologer and magus, Simon Forman, kept a journal not unlikeDee’s, and he noted about the year 1584: “a reasonable, good, and quietyere; but I had certain braulles and sclaunders fell out against me aboutedetecting of one that had stollen certain thinges, whereby I was like to have"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"202JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMbin spoiled.” Although it appears he was dissociating himself from scryingat this point, by 1588 he openly admitted that he “began to practisenecromancy and to call angells and spirits” (Forman 1849, 17).It is worth noting that sixteenth- and seventeenth-century manu-script literature abounds in secret diaries, notes, and copies of “grimoires”revealing the widespread magical practices of the day—most of whichwere rooted in the medieval Solomonic art. Journals of actual divinationare nevertheless more of a rarity: interested amateurs seemingly did notget much beyond collecting and copying magical materials, prayers, in-cantations, and books of rituals that, at least theoretically, provided equip-ment to lead the readers to success in contacting the spirit world.20 Thisbody of literature has recently been much discussed among historians,21and it was Stephen Clucas who has undertaken most work in recoveringpossible source materials of this kind for Dee’s angel magic. In his (un-fortunately still forthcoming) essay on “John Dee’s angelic conversationsand the ars notoria,” he examines the relationship of Renaissance magicand medieval theurgy and comes to the conclusion that medieval ceremo-nial magic influenced more strongly the actual practices of Renaissancedivination than hitherto imagined. Concentrating on Dee’s spiritual dia-ries, he has convincingly shown that the rituals described in the variousbooks of ars notoria,ars Solomonis, and liber juratus closely correspond toDee’s actual practices as described below. What is decisive in his propo-sition is that although this medieval literature was strictly illicit and thosewho had such books would not have spoken about them publicly, one ofthese collections crops up in Dee’s library catalogue. Dee possessed afourteenth-century copy of the Liber Juratus, and the surviving copy haspreserved his handwriting (R&W DM70).22Although Clucas has meticulously verified the influence of medievaltheurgy on Dee, he has somewhat tendentiously neglected the impact ofRenaissance publications of “high magic” that Dee also carefully studied.He himself cites Dee’s glosses from the spiritual diaries among whichthere are fewer references to spurious, medieval theurgic works than ci-tations of distinguished humanists such as Ficino, Reuchlin, and Agrippa.23One should note that in one of his copies of Agrippa’s De occulta philosophiaDee could read Pietro d’Abano’s treatise on the elements of magic inwhich the picture of a magic seal (see Figure 7.4) has striking visualsimilarity to Dee’s Golden Talisman.24This fact should be a reminder to us not to try to explain Dee’smagic, yet again, from one single type of source material. It is obviousthat his, too, was a syncretic mind and had enough venerable examples"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"203Illumination and Angel Magicbefore him not to be afraid of amalgamating various traditions. No doubt,by the time of the angelic conversations he had become disappointedwith most of the sciences for which he had had such an enthusiasmearlier. His former studies of the hermetic magi, however, clearly manifestthemselves in his late writings, too.FIGURE 7.4Pietro d’ Abano’s magic seal from Agrippa’s 1550 edition of De occulta philosophia(Basel, 1550), 568. Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel [Na 146]."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"204JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThis will become even more plausible if we consider the long overlapduring which Dee was equally occupied with scholarly pursuits (producingtheMathematicall Praeface and the General and Rare Memorials) and mysticalrevelations (he started praying to God for illumination in 1569). He definitelyundertook extensive and practical use of the crystal, making it a habitualaction, from 1579. Already before that, on March 10, 1575, he had a chanceto demonstrate “his glass” to the Queen’s Majesty (Dee 1851, 17).The first well-documented scrying session with the help of a me-dium, Barnabas Saul, took place on December 22, 1581 (MS Sloane3188, fol. 8; Dee 1996, 1.6). Prior to this, Dee may have increased hisinterest in this area of magic during his continental journey in 1578,when he visited some German courts with the purpose of consultingmedical doctors about the queen’s condition. During this journey he metLeonhard Thurneysser, the famous physician, alchemist, and interpreterof Paracelsus, in Frankfurt on the Oder (Dee 1998, 4). He might havetaken the meeting as an omen, since in exactly those years the learneddoctor came under attack of accusations of conjuration and crystal-magic.A year later Franz Joel, a doctor from Greifswald, published a book aboutwitches and black magic in which he openly attacked Thurneysser as astubborn sorcerer whose source of knowledge—especially foreign lan-guages, including Chaldeus, Hebrew, and Sanskrit—was his daemon,appearing in his “shewstone” (Kopp 1886, 1:117). Thurneysser had towrite a passionate apology, very much in the manner of Dee’s own“Digression Apologeticall” of the Mathematicall Praeface in which Deecompared the accusations against him to the attacks against his predeces-sors in the occult and mechanical sciences from Socrates and Apuleius,to Pico della Mirandola and Trithemius (Dee 1975, Aijv).As previously mentioned, Dee pursued angel magic until his death.During these years he had three steady scryers. He worked longest withEdward Kelly, whom he took on his journey to the East-Central Euro-pean courts. Over the long years of common magical practice they de-veloped a rather elaborate ritual with special circumstances and requisitesthat is now called Enochian magic. In the following subchapter I shallbriefly summarize the practice of the “Enochian evocations.”The Choreography of the Scrying SessionsAlthough there are no coherent descriptions of the scrying rituals in Dee’sdiaries, it is nevertheless possible to reconstruct the choreography theyused. First, Christopher Whitby devoted the larger part of his Ph.D."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"205Illumination and Angel Magicdissertation to the reconstruction and analysis of the “actions” (Whitby1988/1981, 1:116–57). Later on, Geoffrey James published a selection ofDee’s magical diaries in which he thematically rearranged the entries (cf.Dee 1994, 1–13, 179–91), then recently Stephen Clucas comparedDee’s practices to the rituals of medieval theurgy (200?), while DeborahHarkness has also reconstructed the sessions, referring to the setting,the requisites, the angels, and Dee’s audience (1999, 9–60). On thebasis of the above studies one can summarize the rituals of Dee’s cer-emonial magic as follows.The sessions needed two basic actors: the magus and the scryer. Themagus performed the conjurations, chants and prayers which preparedthe evocation of angels and spirits from the shew-stone. It was the scryerwho gazed at the ball, and the apparitions spoke via his tongue. The mostimportant requisite, thus, was the crystal ball. There are various accountsabout the Doctor’s different scrying instruments, and some of them haveeven been preserved in distinguished collections. Nicholas Clulee repro-duces two items preserved in the British Museum, Dee’s crystal ball andhis obsidian speculum (1988, illustrations 8.1 and 8.2). The story of thedescent of these magical instruments is complicated and their provenancein fact is dubious. Theodore Besterman summed up their origin in hisbook on crystal gazing as follows: on November 21, 1582, in his diaryDee himself refers to his great crystal ball as something that had beenbrought to him by his angels and looked “as big as an egg: most bryght,clere, and glorious” (cf. Dee 1581–1583, f59v). Throughout his writings,the Doctor referred to this crystal as “the shew-stone,” or simply “thestone,” but he also called it the “diaphanous globe” (58r), the “firstsanctified stone” and the “holy stone” (see Casaubon’s summary in Dee1659, #47). From his writings it is difficult to decide how many stonesDee had. The two items now in the British Museum certainly passedfrom hand to hand as belonging to the Doctor. The crystal ball had beenincluded in the Cottonian Collection and was acquired by the Museumin 1700. It was described as a globe “of solid pink tinted glass, size andform of a full-grown orange” or as “a polished crystal” or as “a smokyball” and has generally been considered as Dee’s principal crystal ball.25The obsidian mirror turned up in the collection of the writer, aris-tocrat, and father of the Gothic horror novel Horace Walpole. At hisneogothic castle, Strawberry Hill, he collected all kinds of paraphernaliafrom the Middle Ages that belonged to mysterious magical practices.Thus, with delight he acquired a black obsidian mirror, probably ofMexican origin, which again was believed to have belonged to Doctor"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"206JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMDee. Walpole described the item as follows: “Among other odd things he[the Lord Frederick Campbell] produced a round piece of shining blackmarble in leathern case, as big as the crown of a hat, and asked me whatthat could possibly be; I screamed out, ‘Oh, Lord, I am the only man inEngland that can tell you! it is Dr. Dee’s black stone.’ ” Later on, in1842,the item was put up at the Strawberry Hill sale with the followingdescription: “A singularly interesting and curious relic of the superstitionsof our ancestors—the celebrated speculum of kennel coal, highly polished,in a leathern case. It is remarkable for having been used to deceive the mob,by the celebrated Dr. Dee, the conjuror, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth”(Walpole’s letter and the auction catalogue quoted by Besterman 1965, 21).Although Dee in his own writings never specifies the obsidian mirror, heindeed may have had such a piece, since his most appreciated Paracelsusspoke at length about visions that could be gained by methods of“beryllistica” from shining black pieces of coal or other similar materials.26In case of the tandem of Doctor Dee and Edward Kelly, the magusacted also as a scribe, meticulously recording the actions. Here followsthe description of preparations preceding their very first common session:He [Kelly] then settled him self to the Action: and on his knees at mydesk (setting the Stone before him) fell to prayer and entreaty, &c. Inthe mean space, I in my Oratory did pray, and make motion to godand his good Creatures for the furthering of this Action. And withinone quarter of an hour (or less) he had sight of one in the stone.(Mortlake, March 10, 1582—Dee 1996, 1.8; 1998, 28)And here is an example of the preliminary prayers:PRAYER. O beginning and fountain of all wisdom, gird up thy loines inmercy, and shadow our weaknesse; be merciful unto us, and forgive usour trespasses: for those that rise up saying there is no God, have risenup against us, saying, Let us confound them: Our strength is not,neither are our bones full of marrow. Help therefore O eternal God ofmercy. . . . (Cracow, April 14, 1584; Dee 1659, 82)Another very important prayer is included in the collection titledFundamenta invocationum (Dee 1588), called “The Fundamental Obesance.”Its tone and vocabulary are characteristic for Dee’s magical diction:O, IEHOVAH ZEBAOTH, I John Dee (your unworthy servant) mostearnestly invoke and call upon your divine power, wisdom and goodness.I humbly and faithfully seek your favour and assistance to me in all my"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"207Illumination and Angel Magicdeeds, words, and thoughts, and in the promoting, procuring, and min-gling of your praise, honour, and glory. Through these, your twelve mys-tical Names: ORO, IBAH, AOZPI, MOR, DIAL, HCTGA, OIP, TEAA, PDOCE,MPH, ARSI, GAIOL, I conjure and pray most zealously to your divine andomnipotent majesty, that all your angelic spirits (whose mystical names arecontained in this book, and whose offices are herein briefly noted) mightbe called from any and all parts of the universe, or at any time in my life,through the special domination and controlling power of your holy names(which are also in this book). Let them come most quickly to me. Let themappear visibly, friendly, and peacefully to me. Let them remain visibleaccording to my will. Let them vanish from me and from my sight whenI so request. Let them give reverence and obedience before you and your12 mystical Names. I command that they happily satisfy me in all thingsand at all times in my life, by accomplishing each and every one of mypetitions. [. . .] According to your united ministry and office O God.AMEN. Through You, Jesu Christe, AMEN. (Dee 1994, 120)Not only the prayers, but the chaste life of the magicians, fasting, andconcentrated piety were to ensure the success of the magical operations. AsUriel warned them, “There must be Conjunction of myndes in prayer, betwyxtyou two, to God contynually” (March 10, 1582; Dee 1996, 1.9; 1998, 29).Although magical primers often suggest special requisites, such as theMagus wearing a crown and a sword or a wand, there is no trace of suchtools in Dee’s records. On the other hand, they needed other instru-ments, the exact form and nature of which were dictated by the angels.The primary tool, naturally, was the crystal ball, but already during theearly sessions Dee and his scryer received instructions to create a tabletas well as the special sigil of God, called Æmeth (Whitby 1988, 1: 118–24; cf. Figure 7.5).FIGURE 7.5 Dee’s Sigillum dei, or AEMETH.

(March 10, 1582; Dee 1996, 1.19; 1998, 30)From the context it becomes clear, that the phrase “a book of thine” meanta certain book, called Soyga, probably a manuscript of such theurgic divi-nation that has been identified as one of Dee’s sources in developing hisEnochian magic. Uriel claimed that the book of Soyga “was revealed toAdam in Paradise by the good angels of God” (Dee 1998, 28) and obvi-ously Dee’s ambition was to receive the same privilege through his actions.Uriel’s further directions included conditions, such as thatThe seal is to be made of perfect wax. We have no respect of cullours.This seal must be nine ynches in diameter: the roundness must be 27ynches, and somewhat more. The Thicknes of it must be of an ynch andhalf a quarter, and a figure of a crosse must be on the back side of it. [. . .]The Table is to be made of sweet wood: and to be of two cubits highwith 4 feete: with four feet of the former seals under the four feet. [. . .]Under the Table did seme likewise red sylk to lye foursquare: somewhatbroader than the Table, hanging down. [. . .] Uppon this uppermost silk,did seme to be set the stone with the frame: right over and uppon theprincipal seal. (Dee 1996, 1.10; 1998, 30)Not only were the instructions very detailed, but Dee also commemo-rated the exact circumstances of the actions:Note, all the tables before were by E.T. [Edward Talbot, alias E. Kelly]letter for letter noted out of the stone standing before him all the while:and the 7 Tables following wer[e] written by me as he repeated themorderly out of the stone. (April 28, 1582; Dee 1996, 3.10; 1998, 40)We furthermore learn that twelve banners or flags were also needed, eachembroidered with a name of God, and, then, all this furniture was ar-ranged in the form of “a temple” where Enochian evocation could bepracticed. Geoffrey James suggests that the sessions may have been out-doors (Dee 1994, 181) but from the spiritual diaries one can identify infact a variety of locations, most of them in the studies of their variousdwelling places. The temple was constructed in the following manner:the place of working was enclosed by a magical circle, which was called“Terra”; the banners were propped at the circle’s edge; a red silk rug wasplaced in the centre of the circle; four small waxen tablets were arranged"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"209Illumination and Angel Magicin a square pattern in the centre of the silk rug; the table was balancedupon the wax tablets; the large wax tablet was placed on the center of thetable. Then a silk tablecloth was draped over the table, covering the largewax tablet; the crystal was laid on the top of the tablecloth, balanced onthe wax tablet (cf. Figure 7.6).An extremely important part of the actions was the magus’ obligationto record all the happenings, including the prayers, the conjurations, anda detailed description of the apparitions as well as the conversations withthe spirits.Performed upon the prayers, the conjurations were of several types,such as the “heptarchic conjurations,” which consisted of the attributesof Kings and Princes; in fact, Dee devoted a whole book to describingand identifying the names of these angelic hierarchies (De heptarchiamystica, cf. Dee 1588). Another type of conjuration was the “AngelicKeys,” which were dictated in the Enochian language and were latertranslated by Dee into English. His book 48 claves angelicae (cf. Dee1584) contained these sacred and powerful texts.At this point it is necessary to examine the nature of the angeliclanguage. In the 1970s an Australian linguist, Donald Laycock subjectedit to the most thorough examination and distinguished two layers in it.The specimen of the lingua adamica that was communicated throughFIGURE 7.6The “Holy Table” and its arrangement. Based on Casaubon’s edition of Dee 1659, *77and Dee 1581–1583 [Sloane 3188]; see <www.dnai.com/~cholden>."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"210JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMKelly during the first scrying sessions (known as the Liber Logaeth) is richin repetition, rhyme, alliteration and other patterns characteristic of poetryand magical charms. From this Laycock has concluded that Kelly musthave been in trance, “speaking in tongues,” when receiving these mes-sages. As opposed to this, the Enochian language received later (48 clavesangelicae) appears more like a real language, generated from set elements.In Dee’s diaries there is a translation provided for these texts, whichwould allow speculation about its grammar. We also know that thesetexts were dictated to Kelly letter by letter, as opposed to the earliertrance-like flow of speech. As Laycock suggests, ‘this is exactly the typeof text produced if one generates a string of letters on some randompattern’ (op. cit., 40). Although the Enochian language appears to bevery strange, it is not entirely impossible to reconstruct its morphologyand syntax. Interestingly, according to Laycock, there is nothing strik-ingly un-English about the grammar, and he was able to compile anextensive dictionary of more than 2400 words, together with phonologyand alphabet.As for the latter, Laycock has noted that the script may have had acommon origin with Pantheus’ Enochian alphabet published in his al-chemical handbook, Voarchadumia (1530, 14–15). As is well known, theBritish Library copy of this book belonged to Dee and preserves hisextensive marginal notes. In spite of this, Laycock has reasoned that Dee’sEnochian alphabet bears no relation to that in Pantheus’ book althoughthe latter may have provided the idea.27 About the transcendental validityof the angelic language, he sceptically suggested that the angels’ ‘limita-tions are those of Kelly; their occasional sublimities, those of Dee. If thetrue voice of God comes through the shewstone at all, it is certainly asthrough a glass darkly’ (Laycock 1994, 64).The highest type of conjurations consisted of the “Invitations to theAngels of the Four Quarters” (cf. the Tabula bonorum angelorum and theFundamenta invocationum in Dee 1588). These rituals were given by thespirit world during the sessions in Prague and Trebona, and these bookscontain detailed invocations to all classes of angels. The book starts with“the Great Table” from which the angels of this book have been de-rived—this is a table of alphabetical characters from which the namescould be generated through various cabalistical permutations (cf. Figure7.7). This table was reformed by the Archangel Raphael on April 20,1587. The book also contains “the great circle of the quarters,” the circleconsisting of four triads with the twelve names of God. These nameswere extracted “from the four lines of the holy spirit, which govern all"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"211Illumination and Angel Magiccreatures on the earth (both visible and invisible).

The collection ofconjurations is preceded by a special prayer, “The Fundamental Obesance,”as quoted above.I think that nothing shows more emblematically the dramatic changesin Dee’s intellectual career than his attitude toward the mechanical arts.He had always been deeply preoccupied with magia naturalis, that is, thecreating of machines and instruments. As we remember, in his youth hehimself constructed a movable toy, a “scarab,” which was used in a schooldrama performance in Cambridge (Dee 1851, 6). Later, he became apassionate collector of mechanical, astronomical, and maritime instru-ments. He devoted almost poetically elevated passages to this art in hisMathematicall Praeface, including an eager rejection of those who calledthese mechanical experiments sorcery:And for these, and such like marveilous Actes and Feates, Naturally,Mathematically, and Mechanically, wrought and contriued: ought anyFIGURE 7.7 The “Great Table” from Tabula bonorum angelorum.

(Dee 1975, Aiv)It is ironic to see that at the age of sixty-five he was still craving foraccomplishments in mechanics, but he hoped for success only from theangels of the mechanical arts by means of conjuration. He invoked theangels as follows:This is the invitation to the four good angels of the East,who are skilled and powerful in the Mechanical Arts:OYOU FOUR HOLY & TRUTHFUL MINISTERS of omnipotent God, ourCreator, CNBR,NBRC,BRCN, and RCNB, who are in the Eastern part of theworld, and who hast by our God been charged and committed withHis ministry to practice, impart, teach, and communicate perfect skillin all arts mechanical, to the praise, honour, and glory of our God. I,John Dee, the baptized and maked slave of our Creator, faithfully,prudently, and powerfully desiring to be devout, do humbly requireand vehemently petition from all of you, named above, through theomnipotent wisdom of the same, our God and Creator, and throughthis holy and mystical Name, HCNBR, that at whatever time in thefuture of my entire life, that I would call you by name or invoke any,each, or all of you through this name of God, HCNBR, that you imme-diately come to me and appear to me, benignly, peacefully, personally,and visibly, and that you be friendly and favourable to me, and thatyou discharge, implement, and make perfect immediately, truly, plen-tifully, manifestly, and perfectly any and all of my petitions concerningthe Arts Mechanical as well as other mechanical conclusions and ex-periments. Through this mystical name of God, HCNBR, AMEN. (Dee1994, 168)From the above prayer it can also be clearly seen that the angelic nameswere generated through simple permutations of groups of letters.In order to proceed with the account of Dee’s ritual magic, mentionneeds to be made of the orders of angels, who were the most importantagencies of this type of theurgy. The question of angelology, as it devel-oped from the speculations of Pseudo-Dionysius through the scholasticphilosophers to the Renaissance theologians and white or black magi-cians, is an extremely difficult subject.28 Apart from the writings of medievaltheologians on angelology—with which he was also familiar29—Dee couldrely on a number of Renaissance authors whose works he kept in hislibrary. Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia was a primary source, where inchapter 3.24 he would find the names of spirits and that how they related"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"213Illumination and Angel Magicto the planets and the zodiac, and the ranks of good and evil spirits.Similarly, in Trithemius’ treatise De septem secundeis he found informa-tion about the planetary angels governing history. The Doctor had nofewer than three copies of this work and there is no doubt that heconsulted it thoroughly.30 Paracelsus, then, provided another tradition ofinterpreting angels, associating them with elemental spirits. All these couldsupport the ambitions of the scholar concerning the feasibility and safeChristian framework of contacting the spirit world. And, beyond theselearned sources, there was also the secret medieval lore, the Solomonic arsnotoria, which heavily relied on angel magic composed of rituals andcabalistic manipulations with the Hebrew angelic names.31It is also true that innumerable sources warned against the dangersof angel magic, especially that evil spirits could take the form of benevo-lent daemons and thus deceive even the pious practitioner. It is also true,that such passages could be found even in the writings of Agrippa andParacelsus, but, as I have already mentioned, Dee seems to have not beenbothered by these caveats. His confidence and trust in his angels couldnever be shaken.32James set up the following typology of the angelic hierarchies (Dee1994, 183–87). The evocations were used to summon three interrelatedhierarchies of angels. First was “the Heptarchical Royalty” which werebelieved to govern “all earthly actions, & disperse of the will of theCreator.” These angels were related to the seven planets and the sevendays of the week. In second rank there were “the Angels of the Aires”which ruled the various countries of the world. One conjured them “tosubvert whole countries without armies, to get the favour of all thehuman princes, & to know the secret treasure of the waters, and theunknown caves of the earth.” These angels were primarily related to thetwelve houses of the zodiac. The third rank of angels were “of the FourQuarters.” They were believed to have been “put onto the earth so thatthe Devil’s envious will might be bridled, the determinations of Godfulfilled, and his creatures kept and preserved.” Conjuring them wasexpected to result in obtaining various semi-divine powers. They wererelated to the four elements and the four compass points. As James notes,this complex angelic society covered all planetary, zodiacal, and elementaloperations and aimed at controlling hundreds of named and thousandsof unnamed angelic creatures (in Dee 1994, 183).Although compared with other types Dee’s magic was of rather pu-ritanical character and used very sparingly incantations, fumigations,candles, and such elaborate rituals (Clulee 1988, 206), the importance of"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"214JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMtalismans, which also were to secure the success of the actions, should notbe underestimated. Dee’s great wax seal, the Sigillum Dei, has alreadybeen mentioned; next to this, the most important talisman was based ona vision that Edward Kelly saw in Cracow, on June 20, 1584:\t. It is first to be noted, that this morning (early) to E.K. lying in hisbed, and awake, appeared a Vision, in manner as followeth: One stand-ing by his beds head, who patted him on the head gently, to make himthe more vigilant. He seemed to be cloathed with feathers, strangelywreathed about him all over, &c.There appeared to him [E.K.] four very fair Castles, standing in thefour parts of the world: out of which he heard the sound of a Trumpet.[. . .] Out of every Gate then issued one Trumpeter, whose Trumpetswere of strange form, wreathed, and growing bigger and bigger towardthe end. [. . .] After the Trumpeter followed three Ensign bearers. Afterthem six ancient men, with white beards and staves in their hands. [. . .]The four houses are the 4 Angels of the Earth, which are the 4 Overseers,and Watch-towers, that the eternal God in his providence hath placedagainst the usurping blasphemy, misuse, and stealth of the wicked andgreat enemy, the Devil. [. . .] In each of these Houses, the Chief Watch-man, is a mighty Prince, a mighty Angel of the Lord: which hath underhim 5 Princes. The seals and authorities of these Houses, are confirmedin the beginning of the Wold. Unto every one of them, be 4 characters,(Tokens of the presence of the Son of God: by whom all things weremade in creation). (Dee 1659, 168–70)The vision had an interesting aftermath: Kelly had another visitation, thistime by a spirit which identified himself as Ave, and who helped them tointerpret the vision of the four castles. For example, he called their atten-tion to the number of creatures that passed out of the four gates: “ ‘Thenumber 16 is a perfect number, consisting of 1.3.6.1 and 5.’ He saidfurthermore, ‘God the father is a standing pillar’ ” (168). The result of theinterpretation was the creation of a complex talisman (see Figure 7.8), agolden disc version of which survives in the British Museum today.One should not forget about the fact that the spiritual diaries are notonly philosophical and mystical papers abounding in visions, prophecies,and theoretical speculations about the Enochian language, but they arealso rich and vivid historical documents revealing events as well as thegeneral way of life of wandering humanists who in great number tried tosecure noble patronage for themselves, all over the courts of the conti-nent.

Quite obviously, this is the framework inwhich one can attempt a general evaluation of Dee’s angel magic, assess-ing what was realized of the Doctor’s original goals during the twenty-year-long project, and paying particular attention to how the practice ofscrying became integrated into Dee’s ideology.DEE’S RELIGION AND THEOLOGYThe Theological Framework of His VisionThus we see, that the heavenly contemplacion in this Science is nocommon ascending, nor for every mans pitch, neither is it to be gottenof them whiche are carried upward with one winge only, but is familierto very few, namely to them whiche have seriously reduced them selvesto Unitie.

(Tymme 1963, 25–26)The above passage is from Thomas Tymme’s preface to his plannedEnglish translation of Dee’s Monas, which, unfortunately, he never com-pleted. The quotation refers to the science of alchemy and it is clearthat Tymme believes it should be discussed within a theological setting.For Tymme, as for many Renaissance scholars the ultimate purpose ofalchemy was to purify the soul and, by liberating it from base matter,to transmute it to higher intellectual reality. This theological interpre-tation was in perfect harmony with Dee’s own doctrines, which, as wehave seen, strived for a synthesis between the dignified ambition ofman to learn all the secrets of Nature on the one hand, and on theother a concurrent and humble attitude in which he continued regard-ing himself as part of a divine plan and hierarchy. As Tymme asked withdeep conviction: “do not all things flow from Unity through the good-ness of One?” (17).Because of this faith, it is impossible to interpret Dee’s natural phi-losophy without taking into consideration a whole wide framework ofmetaphysics, theology, and occult symbolism. Furthermore, we also haveto realize that in the end this theological and ideological constitution infact wholly absorbed the scientific foundations.Dee’s ideology can be examined from two angles. One is the natureof his general doctrinal opinion. In this respect a comparison between hisscholarly works and his spiritual diaries may be helpful. Second are hisdenominational attitudes, that is, his association with the religious strugglesof the Reformation. The latter problem is particularly interesting, sincesome historians have emphasized his strong Protestantism, while othershave spoken of his universalist, interconfessionalist religion. A peculiarcase is that of Frances Yates, who in her Astreae (1975) presented Dee asa Protestant patriot, while in The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (1972) sheestablished the image of the universalist, Rosicrucian Dee. Finally, in TheOccult Philosophy (1979) we find both arguments amalgamated.In relation to the present investigation of exaltatio, the first questionis more essential. However, in respect to Dee’s management of theunresolvable tensions and paradoxes of magical ambitions that inevitablyseem to have accompanied the aspiration for exaltatio, the second aspect"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"217Illumination and Angel Magicis equally significant, not simply for the purpose of examining the indi-vidual conscience, but because this provides a way to examine the socialstrategies by which the magus tried to accomplish his self-fashioning,seek patronage, and justify himself in the eyes of the other members ofhis community.I believe that previous analyses of Dee’s major works have alreadyrevealed the seemingly constant, hardly altering contours of Dee’s theol-ogy. It centered on his deep admiration for the work of Creation and itsMaker, and he never seems to have been shaken in his belief that manwas privileged to become finally a partner of God, sharing his knowledgeand his creative energies.Within this constant, general theological frame, Dee’s concrete pro-grams and projects working towards the realization of exaltatio changedfrom time to time, in evolving from scientific investigations to magic andhermeticism to the practice of scrying, as I have shown above. Thinkingabout Dee’s theology underlying the angelic conversations, one cannot failto recall his speculations related to language philosophy and the questionsof the lingua adamica. Thomas Tymme, in his preface to the Monashieroglyphica, also referred to the angelic tongue in a theological context:Adam, before his fall, was by God endowed with such excellent knowl-edge in naturall philosophie, that is to say, with the understanding ofthe secrets of nature & the naturall reasons of all things, that he gaveto all the Creatures of God their proper names. [. . .] And albeit theperfecion of that knowledge was much weakened by his fall, yet had heso much light thereof, that he was the first founder and inventor ofArte. (1963, 11)The passage continues with references to Adam’s posterity and the heri-tage of knowledge bequethed by the primordial ancestor:For his posterity building upon that first foundacion & by experienceand advantage of his Invencion, & perfecting that which was but rudein the beginning, erected two Tables of Stone, wherein they engravedtheir naturall Philosophie not in letters (which were not then known)but in Hieroglyphicall characters, to the end that the presage, concern-ing the general Deluge to come [. . .] that if it were possible they mightprevent the perill. (12)The iconography of this pseudepigraphical myth shows parallelswith that of the Bible (for example, the two stones, such as the ones"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"218JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMcontaining the Laws of Moses), but as though Adam here were not theBiblical father, more like the demiurge of the Corpus hermeticum whosearchetypal knowledge is thought to have been preserved in a hieroglyphicalur-writing. No doubt, Dee felt himself entitled to acquire this hiero-glyphical language; at the time of the Monas he thought that it could begenerated through his magic diagram, while later on he put the stress ona more direct learning method, the angelic conversations. For him, likefor Tymme, Adam was the perfect model and measure whom the maguswanted to emulate, and the key to making man the partner of God wasthe angelic language.Dee’s past as a humanist scholar and a bibliophile is underscored bythe fact, that, even in this later mystical period, he was thinking in termsof books, texts, and writing. These traditional media remained for himequally as important as the new type of medium, the human scryer.There was a period during the time of the angelic conversations whenDee would call only one type of writing books, namely his own journalsof the scrying séances. The most fascinating episode in this respect is theone discovered by C. H. Josten in a portion of the spiritual diaries notpublished by Casaubon.33 Dee and Kelly, while staying in Prague, at ascrying session of April 10, 1586, were met by a spirit who identifiedhimself as follows: “I am the Spirit of Wisdom. I have instructed you inthe knowledge of Christ, which is the science of all things” (Dee 1965,248). Then he commanded the Englishmen to burn all the books so fardictated to them by the angels, and to throw into the fireplace Kelly’ssmall box in which he kept his lapis philosophorum. Here follows Dee’slist of the journals to be eliminated:I sundered the books, or rather those folio-volumes which were eitherbound or decently sewn together [. . .] so they were 28 in all (namelyfour times seven). And they contained (as in a continued narrative)all the things which, from the first hour of our (namely EK’s andJD’s) conjunctions until the present hour, had been revealed andshown to us by God’s faithful angels and by God Himself. And in oneof those 28 volumes there were 48 individual books, most mysticaland more valuable than the value of all things in the whole worldmight be accounted. For in them the admirable divine wisdom andpower were contained which, at a time determined by God, we mustuse to His honour and glory. There was another volume which wasancillary to those 48 individual books; its title was ‘48 Claves Angelicae’and it was written entirely in the angelic language. [. . .] Anothervolume contained that wisdom and science, with which Enoch (by"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"219Illumination and Angel MagicGod’s will) was imbued; where there was also something agreeingwith the testimony of the Apostle Judas. In that book there werecontained all sacred books, full and perfect, all those books, I say,which, after and before the incarnation of Christ, had been writtenby the Spirit of Truth. (Dee 1965, 249–50)Most of the books mentioned by Dee are in fact identifiable among thesurviving spiritual diaries.34 They contained either the rules, grammar,and vocabulary of the angelic language, or the magic invocations tocontact the angels, or specific pieces of information provided by theangels, some of them already translated into English, some still to bedeciphered. It is obvious that the Doctor had not the slightest doubtabout their authenticity. More surprising is that the Englishmen werewilling to obey the spiritual command and indeed burned these mostvaluable texts. The session was witnessed by Francesco Pucci, too, whocould see how Dee cited the sacrifice of Abraham and, taking spiritualconsolation from the Biblical story, threw the folios into the fire (Dee1965, 251). The climax of the situation was Kelly’s obligation to anni-hilate his magic powder and Dee gave a very dramatic account of thesufferings of his companion. The session was brought to an end by thefollowing promise of “The Voice”:Later on make a prayer before Me, invoking the name of the Father inthe name of Jesus, his Son. And be aware that, as these things were putin the fire, in the same way you will receive them again. (254)This magic episode and the promise thereof may have reminded Deeof the wondrous rebirth of Guillaume Postel, because he noted on themagrin: “A restitution of the things burned and committed to the fireis promised” (ibid.).This is where the journal fragment found by Josten ends and wecannot help but agree with the editor that from a twentieth-centuryviewpoint it is very difficult to judge either Dee’s seeming credulity, orKelly’s possible motivations in interpreting the strict commands. On theother hand, the fragment enlightens a hitherto obscure part of theCasaubon edition, from which we learn that on April 29, Dee and Kellybecame aware of a gardener-like figure in the yard of their house inPrague. The small gardener lit a fire resembling a strange pillar. Theyboth hurried into the garden, but the mysterious character by that timewas gone. The fire was also extinguished but under an almond tree theyfound three of the previously consumed books. The person then returned"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"220JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMagain and brought back all the perished books (Dee 1659, 418–19). Thejournal does not mention the restitution of Kelly’s powder, but duringthe séance of April 18, 1587, he held it in his hand, so the black bagmust have been returned, too (Dee 1659, *9).35The miracle of the books, performed by God and the Spirit of Wis-dom, appears to be the climax of Dee’s religious experience. Next to thishis explorations of the lingua adamica and the prophetic visions commu-nicated by the angels should be mentioned. The most important layer ofthe angelic conversations consists of those pieces of information that weremeant as direct instructions for learning the primordial language. Thesemessages communicated names of angels as well as ritualistic expressions inthe Enochian language, all being of cabalistic nature, each letter havingnumeric equivalents, too. Dee’s idée fixeé was that the comprehension ofthese numerical relations would lead to the ultimate enlightenment. Inter-estingly, the mathematician did not entirely disappear from the obsessedenthusiast as seen when he caught the angels in an arithmetic miscalcula-tion. Kelly was certainly a far less able mathematician than his master, buthis (or the angel’s) wit was more than a match for Dee’s suspicion:NALVAGE ANGEL:...Pray...\t. We prayed. There is an error in the last, not in the Number, but inthe Letter. I will first go through the Letters, and after come to theNumbers. How many words have you received this day?\t.

(Dee 1659, 80)After this somewhat humorous quotation it is worth returning to a pas-sage that sums up more theoretical information about the strength ofnumbers and the cabalistical ur-language. At the session held in Cracowon April 21, 1584, it was Archangel Gabriel himself who joined Nalvageto deliver the teachings to Dee and his scryer:GABRIEL: . . . Every Letter signifieth the member of the substance whereofit speaketh. Every word signifieth the quiddity of the substance. TheLetters are separated, and in confusion: and therefore, are by numbersgathered together [. . .].E.K. Whether is this Language known in any part of the World or no? ifit be, where and to whom? (Dee 1659, 92).This introduction is followed by what I have already quoted about Adam’sprivilege in his innocence as being able to speak a common language withGod. The angelic diction here really reaches the poetical elevation ofPico’s De hominis dignitate. Then we learn about the corruption of thewicked demon, Coronzon, who caused man to lose his honorific status.Being expelled from Paradise, man had to reinvent a new language thatstill contained fragments of the original angelic tongue: “he began tolearn of necessity the Language in which he uttered and delivered to hisposterity, the nearest knowledge he had of God his Creatures” (ibid.).The following linguistic explications are really amazing:GABRIEL: And from his own self divided his speech into three parts,twelve, three, and seven: the number whereof remaineth, but the trueforms and pronounciations want; and therefore is not of that force thatit was in his own dignity, much lesse to be compared with this that wedeliver which Adam verily spake in innocency, and was never utterednor disclosed to man since till now. (Dee 1659, 92)Step by step, a complex myth unfolds concerning the history of the angeliclanguage. After the Fall Adam spoke a degenerated form of it, which became"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"222JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMur-Hebrew. One of Adam’s descendants, Enoch, however, was selected by theLord to become a seer, who was given the knowledge of the old Adamiclanguage. As Dee noted, “Let us show unto Enoch the use of the earth. Andlo, Enoch was wise and full of the spirit of wisdom” (1659, 174).The angels then told Dee about Enoch’s prayer to God in which theRenaissance philosopher could recognize the archetype of his own desirefor exaltation up to God:Oh Lord, is there any who is mortal that can measure the heavens?How, therefore can the heavens enter into man’s Imagination? [. . .]Behold, Lord, how shall I ascend into the heavens? The air will notcarry me, but resisteth my folly. I fall down, for I am of the earth.(1659, 196–97)This difficulty could be overcome by the help of angel magic, which wasto be performed through the holy tables, donated by God. The operationwas expected to achieve even quasi-immortality:Behold, I offer these Tables unto thee. I require nothing but thee,through thee, and for thy honour and glory. Yet I hope that I shall besatisfied and shall not die (as thou hast promised) until thou gather theclouds together, and judge all things. When in a moment I shall bechanged and dwell with thee for ever. (1659, 197; emphasis mine)According to the Enochian mythology in Dee’s interpretation, afterfifty days of enragement “the Lord appeared unto Enoch and wasmercifull unto him, opened his eyes, that he might see and judge theearth” (Dee 1659, 174). And Enoch then decided to put down hisexperiences in a sacred book that he titled: LET THOSE THAT FEAR GODAND ARE WORTHY—READ.Unfortunately Enoch’s teachings became corrupted as the holy lan-guage was distorted and forged by the devil. The memory of Enochwashed away and the mystical figures and their use—the gift of Goddelivered unto Enoch and unto the faithful—became replaced by thesigns and tokens of the devil. “These signs they call Characters [and] asthe painter imitates the gestures of man, so doth the Devil imitate thesubstance and things created and made by God” (ibid.). As a result ofSatan’s machinations and the unfaithfulness of mankind, this Enochianmagic was entirely forgotten and replaced by black magic. But the arch-angel Raphael, sent by God, now assured Dee and Kelly that they hadbeen selected to be the recipients of this restitute knowledge:"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"223Illumination and Angel MagicAnd so Raphael descended, and he was full of the power and spirit ofGod. And he delivered a Doctrine, but simple, plain, full of strengthand the power of the holy Ghost. [. . .] It is this self-same Art whichis delivered unto you as an infallible doctrine. For now it hath pleasedGod to deliver this Doctrine again out of darkness and to fulfill hispromise with thee for the Books of Enoch. (Dee 1659, 77)No wonder that taking Enoch’s mythology seriously as a supernaturalparallel of all human sciences, Dee became obsessed by the wish to learnand practice the Enochian language, that “toungue of power.” The fruitsthat were bestowed upon Enoch were now offered to him. At least thisis what he must have understood from the promises of the Lord, trans-mitted to him through the angels and interpreted by his scryer, EdwardKelly. What he hoped to achieve was access to the mysteries of creation;as the angel promised, “I give you the understanding of many thousandsecrets, wherein you are yet but children” and the ultimate guaranteeconjured up the possibility of true exaltatio: “therefore you may do any-thing” (Dee 1994, 11).I firmly believe that a plausible interpretation of Dee’s angel magicmust approach this curious phenomenon from the direction of the linguaadmica, the search for the perfect language. Furthermore, when placingDee’s “scientific” program in a wider context, we see how Dee’s visionsconjure up a symbolic “world empire,” consisting of knowledge (embod-ied by his library), wisdom (as communicated to him by the angels), andfaith (represented by a reformed Christianity, a universalist and inter-confessionalist religion).The majority of visions included in the diaries appear to be verbal-ized versions of large scale images related to the divine cosmic order andthe world of angels sustaining it. The following quotation is of particularimportance because it contains a conceptual explanation about the natureof visions:There are two kind of visions, the one by infusion of will and descend-ing, the other by infusion by permission and ascending. The first is ofthe image of the Will of God descending into the body, and adjoynedto the soul of man, whose nature is to distinguish things of his ownlikenesse, but shut up in prison in the body, wanteth that power; andtherefore being illuminated by spiritual presence, inwardly, seeth nowin part, as he shall hereafter do in the whole. But note, that every visionis according to the soul of man in power: and so is received of him thatseeth. (Dee 1659, 88)"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"224JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThe above description also connects the idea of visions to the idea ofexaltation, the ultimate end of every form of magic. As I have alreadyquoted, on June 20, 1584, they received perhaps the most elaborate visionin Cracow, the one that became the basis for the Golden Talisman. Nextto this visual semiotic compound, one also finds in the diaries a verbalinterpretation of this revelation where Dee offers angelological explanations:I expound the Vision. The 4 houses are the 4 Angels of the Earth, whichare the 4 Overseers, and Watch-Towers, that the eternal God in hisprovidence hath placed, against the usurping blasphemy, misuse, andstealth of the wicked and great enemy, the Devil.

[. . .] Ensignes, upon the Imagewhereof, is death: whereon the Redemption of mankind is established,and with the which he shall come to judge the Earth. (1659, 170)In fact most of their sessions contained elements of visions, since theangels usually contacted them in the form of visual apparitions. On April15, 1587, during their stay in Trebona, Arthur became the communica-tor of a notable set of visions:My first begotten son (namely Arthur) was assigned to the Ministry ofseeing and hearing. [. . .] Whereupon, Wednesday morning I brought theChilde to the holy Table, and set before him the Stone in the frame (myfirst sanctified Stone) and caused him on his knees, to say the foresaidPrayer. [. . .] There appeared to him (as he judged) divers little squarefigures, with pricks, and divers other figures and lines, which caused himwith his own hand to imitate upon a paper with pen and ink.ARTHUR: “Two old men with black beards, and with golden crownsupon their heads, do appear. One is now gone: this holdeth his handbefore him like a Maid. Now in the place of those square marks I seetwo lions, the one very exactly, and gaping. About the upper brim ofthe Stone they appear: and the lions’ feet be waxing greater andgreater. . . . (Dee 1659, *4–5)From the diaries it also becomes clear that Dee embedded the visions ina perfectly balanced rhetorical framework. He was aware that the imagescommunicated by the spirits were to be taken as parables and enigmasand he repeatedly asked the spirits for their interpretation. For example,on April 17, 1584, in Cracow they received a very complicated visionfeaturing a great whale, a naked man, a cave of lions, and cedar trees. TheDoctor’s inquiry concerning the meanings of the vision resulted in thefollowing allegorical explanation:"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"225Illumination and Angel MagicGABRIEL: The naked man is Dee, the Childe is Kelly, the Prince is theDevil, the Hill is the World, the waters are the bosom of God, the 4beasts are the 4 Elements, the 12 Trees are the 12 parts of the Heavens,&c. The rest are not to be spoken. . . . (Dee 1659, 104)A considerable portion of the angelic communications offers obscurehistorical prognostications in the Enochian style of prophecy. The predic-tions foretell the coming of a new age in which Dee and Kelly wouldhave an important role since they had been chosen by God to performcertain rituals in connection with the shift to the new epoch. Dee couldhardly have been more explicit than when terrifying Emperor Rudolphwith God’s message about the Turks: “If you will hear me and believe me,you shall triumph. If you will not hear me, the Lord, the God that madeHeaven and Earth putteth his foot against your breast, and will throwyou headlong down from your seat” (1659, 231). Other strange proph-ecies related to the fate of England as well as to the future of Christianityin Europe:After dinner, as E.K. was alone, there appeared unto him little creaturesof a cubit high: and they came to the Still where he had the spirit ofWine distilling over out of a Retorto: And one of them (whose namethey expressed Ben) said that it was in vain so to hope for the best spiritof the Wine.

And that thispresent Pope at his Mass should be deprived of life before two yearscome to an end. And that another Pope, who should be Decimus quintusof his name; And that he would begin to reform things, but thatshortly he should of the Cardinals be stoned to death. . . . (April 18,1587; 1659, *12)Prophecies were usually combined with visions, since the informationderived from angels or spirits who appeared in the stone under specialcircumstances. The following excerpt shows general historical propheciesmixed with personal promises directed this time to Prince L-aski:May 22, 1585, Niepolonicze.E.K.: “I see a great Hill of fire, a very great Mountain, and it is as ifit did hang in the aire: for I see the aire under it, and I see the Sunshine on it.

(1659, 402)A particularly complex set of visions can be found in the PraefatioLatina (Dee 1965), Dee’s Latin translations of some of their actions inPrague during which the Holy Spirit in sessions divided into four actsrevealed a variety of forecasts as well as commandments.36 Dee intro-duced the revelations with the following words: “When the three of uswere seated (I ready to write, Edward Kelly sitting opposite at the sametable; Francesco Pucci sitting on a bench along the wall of the oratory),there descended from on high, with some sort of spiritual sound, a voice,near to the face of E.K. [. . .] Let us now lend then our ear to the wordsof the Holy Spirit which are very full of the highest consolation” (Dee1965, 241). The voice then proceeded with consolation and warnings:Lo and behold, raise yourselves and consider: Thus speaks He who isthe Comforter, Whose candle is always there to delight His people,Who has covered the sons of Sion and their garments with joy.

But I shall preach penitence to you.

Hisambivalence seems to be connected with his self-fashioning and his secularambitions, too.37 His early career was characterized by a deeply religious,but denominationally neutral, interconfessionalist attitude, a hallmark ofmany humanists. To understand better Dee’s “scholarly religiousness,” oneneeds to address some general questions of Renaissance heterodoxy.If one examines the particular doctrinal beliefs of the humanists, onecan see neither uniformity nor a consequent attachment to one set ofreligious dogmas. One reason for this flexibility may be found in theirscholarly self-assuredness, according to which they were inclined to thinkthat narrowly defined rules and beliefs were for the general populace butnot for the select few of intellectuals. One should not forget, however,about the special social standing of the humanists, namely that theirideological experimentations were in close connection with their self-fashioning, secular ambitions, as they maneuvred among the unpredict-able circumstances of the patronage system.Another motivation behind their syncretism could be an effort tomerge pagan philosophy with Christian theology. These two aspects re-sulted in a general, nondenominational religiousness, which has beencalled interconfessionalism by modern historians. The use of the termgoes back as far as Jakob Burckhardt. He observed how Renaissanceindividualism led to a total aesthetization of morals and even life itself:These intellectual giants, these representatives of the Renaissance, show,in respect to religion, a quality which is common in youthful natures.Distinguishing keenly between good and evil, yet they are conscious ofno sin. Every disturbance of their inward harmony they feel themselvesable to make good out of the plastic resouces of their own nature, andtherefore they feel no repentance. The need of salvation thus becomesfelt more and more dimly, while the ambitions and the intellectualactivity of the present either shut out altogether every thought of aworld to come, or else caused it to assume a poetic instead of a dog-matic form.38Burckhardt’s uncompromising classification—either a pagan scepticor a Platonist poet—was refined by Paul Oskar Kristeller’s pioneeringexaminations of humanism. As he wrote:"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"229Illumination and Angel MagicThe view that the humanist movement was essentially pagan or anti-Christian cannot be sustained. [. . .] The opposite view, namely thatRenaissance humanism was in its origin a religious movement, or evena religious reaction against certain antireligious tendencies in the MiddleAges, seems to me equally wrong and exaggerated. I am convinced thathumanism was in its core neither religious nor anti-religious, but aliterary and scholarly orientation, that could be and, in many cases, waspursued without any explicit discourse on religious topics by individu-als who otherwise might be fervent or nominal members of one of theChristian churches. (Kristeller 1961, 74–75)In this context it becomes understandable that the keen and wittyhumanists preferred the philological authenticity of an ancient text to itsconformity to the dogmas of one or another denomination. This is whyit becomes difficult to determine the denominational affiliations of manysixteenth-century scholars; even if we know that, their writings oftenreflect a more general, supra- or interconfessional character. It cannot beby chance that in the time of the early Reformation it was the humanistswho pioneered manufacturing bold and often fantastic plans to reunitethe split Christian world; they also proposed plans for universal, andunified religions that would reconcile Christians, Jews, and Muslims.Some of these plans were fabricated on the basis of intellectual rational-ism, such as Thomas More’s Utopia; others thought of religion as apragmatically necessary ingredient of a well-working society—likeMachiavelli in the Discorsi; and others were dreaming of a magical reli-gion bringing about the universal harmony of the world.Among these enthusiasts one can mention Francesco Giorgi, aMinorite Franciscan monk (1460–1540), who wrote the De harmoniamundi totius in 1525 and proposed the ultimate final concordance of thevarious “true dogmas.” In this work he brought together the biblicalprophets, Hermes Trismegistus, Plato, Aristotle, Saint John, Saint Paul,and the Church Fathers in order to assemble a mystical and pantheisticworld picture. His last work, In Sacram Scripturam problemata (1536),employed cabalistic methods in Christian exegesis.39Another such enthusiast was the already discussed Guillaume Postelwho in 1547 met Mother Johanna in the Venetian Ospedaletto di SantoGiovanni e Paolo and he identified her as the Venetian Virgin and theAngelic Pope “in whose body the spirit of God had descended and theliving Christ lived within her person.” From his communion with MotherJohanna, whose “little son” he became, Postel developed the doctrine of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"230JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe “Restitution of All Things,” supposing that “God willed that allReasonable Creatures be united into one sheepfold; that there be a Gen-eral Pardon for all with no exceptions.”40 These religious ideas becameinterestingly mixed with magical concepts in Postel’s thought, especiallythose derived from Jewish cabala and Judaism.It seems that at least in the second half of his life, Dee also becamesuch a universalist enthusiast, a conviction which pulled him very farfrom the Henrician Protestantism of his early years. Interestingly, al-though his career as a tutor at the court of Edward VI cannot be imag-ined without a clear reformed standpoint, his denomination cannot bedetermined from the existing historical sources (Clulee 1988, 34). Nev-ertheless, it is improbable that in 1553 he would have received the rec-tory at Upton without being a faithful Protestant (Roberts and Watson1990, 75). In spite of all this, and the fact that his patron, the Earl ofNorthumberland, was sent to the scaffold, he survived the shift to Ca-tholicism under Bloody Mary. Even in 1555 when he was arrested underthe charge of witchcraft, the Privy Council released him and entrusted himto the care of Bishop Bonner. Soon he addressed the bishop as his “singularisamicus,” and was in the position to turn to the queen with a propositionto collect the stock of the dissolved monastic libraries and set up a newroyal collection (Supplication to Queen Mary, 155641). As Roberts and Watsonsuggested, his own ambition to establish a large private library may havebeen rooted in the fact that his plea to Mary was not appreciated.The accession of Elizabeth in 1558 facilitated Dee’s return to hisoriginal denomination and this began the period when he seemed to havebeen emotionally drawn to Protestantism. This attachment, however, hadmore of a patriotic character than a theological one. Frances Yates gavea detailed analysis of the protestant imperial ideology that characterizedthe rising empire of Elizabeth (cf. Yates’s Astrea, 1975) in whose creationDee enthusiastically cooperated. This imperial ideology was motivatednot only by the drive for territorial expansion, but was also fuelled by areligious ambition to counterbalance the European Catholic powers by aProtestant league gathered under the Tudor banner. The Virgin Queenthus became a quasi-religious symbol, signifying imperial reform and apurified religion, in fact embodying a new national mythology that reachedback to the legendary King Arthur.42 The literary creators of this mythol-ogy were (among others) Philip Sidney and Edmund Spenser, while itshistorical documentation was fabricated by William Camden, but JohnDee also contributed to the geographical and historical expansionistprojects (Yates 1979, 95–109; Sherman 1995, 148–201). His outstand-"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"231Illumination and Angel Magicing work in this field was the General and Rare Memorials Pertayning tothe Perfect Art of Navigation (1577), in which he delineated those terri-tories which Elizabeth could claim because of her descendance fromArthur. The monumental title page of the book, designed by Dee, showedthe Queen sailing on a ship called “Europa,” suggesting that she couldbe the ideal navigator of international Protestantism (Figure 7.9; cf. Yates1979, 85). A Greek phrase in the middle of the page—\u000b\u0003\f\u0007\r\u0003\u000e\u0005\r\u000f\b\u000b\u0005\u0010\u0004\u0011\u0002\u0003\u000e\u0005\r—intertextually referred to Dee’s magical opus, the Monashieroglyphica, too, suggesting that his political message in this work wouldnot be entirely different from his general, scientific-religious vision. Thelinks between the two works are emphasized by other iconographical ele-ments: the alchemical symbols of Sun and Moon on the General and RareMemorials, as well as the inclusion of the tetragrammaton, JHVH.While in the 1570s Dee seems to have been under the influenceof Protestant ideology and nationalistic politics, at the same time, hisimagination was more and more taken by a contrary intellectual trend:FIGURE 7.9Frontispiece of Dee’s General and Rare Memorials . . .

As I have suggested, the rise ofthis permissive religious attitude can be associated with those philologicalinvestigations of the humanists which recognized the (proto)types ofChristianity in some of the pagan religions. Thus they concluded that—as opposed to the denominational differences—the really important thingamong the religions was their common roots, the general intuitions.Concerning the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of course, we cannotyet speak of tolerance in the modern sense nor an abstract Deism thatwould freely take off from Christianity. Nevertheless, from the time ofthe Florentine neoplatonists onward it became customary to mix differentreligious ideas in a syncretic manner. Humanist syncretism was fostered bythe scholarly attitude, and its methods of using historical and literary in-vestigations. In the following I shall look at some specific features of thishumanist interconfessionalism in relation to magic, as described by CharlesZika and Paola Zambelli.43In his essay “Reuchlin and Erasmus: Humanism and Occult Philoso-phy” (1976–1977) Zika has developed a model of intellectual evolutionthat helps us to understand the above demonstrated “mystical mutations”of humanist thought.44 In order to show the different intellectual avenuesalong which the humanists could proceed, Zika analyzed Erasmus’ am-biguous attitude toward Johannes Reuchlin.As is well known, Reuchlin employed humanist methods to enlightencertain Old Testament loci by also studying Judaic theology. This methodcan be compared to Ficino’s strategy of explaining Christian theologyusing Plato and other pagan Platonici. Neither of these methods wasentirely safe: Ficino had to face the accusations of practicing pagan magic;Reuchlin was charged with practicing Judaism. From this general situa-tion developed the notorious Reuchlin affair that lasted from 1507 al-most until Reuchlin’s death in 1522, concluding with a papal condem-nation of Reuchlin in Rome, 1520.In 1507, Johannes Pfefferkorn, a convert, aided by the Dominicansof Cologne, initiated a confiscation and burning of all Jewish booksbecause they were false, written to oppose Christians, and were offensiveto Jesus, Maria, and the Apostles. He also claimed that these books keptthe Jews ignorant of the truth, hindering their conversion to Christianity.Prompted by complaints from influential Jewish circles, EmperorMaximilian I halted the confiscations and ordered his high chancellor,the Archbishop of Mainz, to appoint a committee to make recommen-dations. The two persons appointed were Jakob Hoogstraeten, grandinquisitor of Cologne, and Johannes Reuchlin, humanist, renowned"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"233Illumination and Angel MagicHebraist and professor of law. Hoogstraeten reaffirmed Pfefferkorn’sopinion, while Ruchlin opposed it, expessing his position in a legally andtheologically brilliant essay Recommendation whether to Confiscate, Destroyand Burn all Jewish Books. Since Hoogstraeten’s expert opinion was sodifferent from his own,45 Reuchlin decided to seek the support of thehumanist community through publicity and developed his report into asarcastic pamphlet.46In this, now called Augenspiegel, Reuchlin firmly defended the valu-able achievements of Hebrew culture, and as a learned humanist andjurist he pointed out the legal background that granted Jews a free prac-tice of their religion and the use of their sacred books. He classifiedJewish books in four categories out of which he condemned to fire onlyone, those abusing the figure of Christ. The Talmud as well as the booksof the cabala were among the ones to be preserved. He suggested thatcabalistic books should be translated into Latin and Hebrew exegesisshould be studied by Christian theologians.47Reuchlin’s answer did not pacify those who sought the dawnfall ofJewish culture, and the debate continued after 1510. This “Kulturkampf ”culminated in the 1517 Epistolarum virorum obscurorum, which is re-membered by scholars as a battle between modern humanists and con-servative, retrograde Dominicans.48 Careful research, however, showsthat the frontlines were not entirely between humanists and monks. Itwas not a unified group of humanists who sided with Reuchlin, butrather a marginalized trend of heterodox theologian-philosophers, whowere following Pico della Mirandola in his enthusiasm for the Jewishcabala. Defenders of Reuchlin included Pietro Galatino, a Franciscantheologian and Hebraist, and Giorgio Bensigno, a monk from Florence,student of Ficino then Savonarola. As J. Overfield suggested, this de-bate was not so much about humanism as it was about anti-Semitism.This conclusion, however, is also problematic. By today, historiansfeel compelled to speak about anti-Judaism, the ground of whichwas religious-theological discrimination, not racism, as in the caseof anti-Semitism.49If we return to the model of Zika, we also see a more complex andcomplicated set of likes and dislikes.50 Let us take Erasmus, whose opinionsuffered certain alterations during the long years of the “causa Reuchlini.”It was Reuchlin who first contacted Erasmus, sending him a copyof the Augenspiegel, and asking for solidarity.51 Erasmus enthusiasticallyanswered and indeed made repeated efforts to promote the case ofReuchlin.52 When they finally met in person, Erasmus sent the following"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"234JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMreport to Jakob Wimpfeling: “I had the chance of an affectionate meetingwith Reuchlin, a man whom I not only respect as a scholar of distinc-tion but like quite particularly for a rare kind of courtesy and personalcharm.”53In the meantime Reuchlin became more and more absorbed in Hebrewstudies and finally he published his major work on the Jewish (andChristianized) cabala. In 1517 he sent a few copies of his De arte cabalisticato Erasmus, authorizing him to distribute them among his English friends.While it is not clear what Erasmus personally thought of this study of thecabala, from his correspondence we can learn about an enthusiastic re-ception in England. It turns out that Erasmus left a copy—meant forJohn Fisher, Bishop of Rochester—with Thomas More, asking him toforward it. But More became so interested that first he wanted to readit. Then he passed it to John Colet, the famous humanist, who summa-rized his opinion in a letter to Erasmus as follows:My dear Erasmus, of books and knowledge there is no end. Nothingcan be better, in view of this brief life of ours, than we should live aholy and pure life and use our best endeavours every day to becomepure and enlightened and perfect. Those things are promised us byReuchlin’s Pythagorical and Cabalistic philosophy.54Two months later Erasmus wrote an enthusiastic letter to Reuchlin,in which—although not mentioning De arte cabalistica—he addressedhis friend with great reverence and on the other hand used rather vulgarexpressions about Pfefferkorn, who still had not stopped his crusadeagainst the Hebraist scholar.55And then things suddenly started changing. Pfefferkorn continuedwith his attacks, fully aided by Hoogstraeten and the Dominicans.Reuchlin’s case was proceeded to Rome for further inquisitorial investi-gation. Worst of all, the case seemed to have been contaminated withthat of Luther who was just about to upset the whole Christian world.Erasmus found himself implied in both cases, especially because someletters he had written to Reuchlin (including the one mentioned above,in which he had called Pfefferkorn a ghetto criminal and an ape Chris-tian) were printed in a pirate edition and the Rotterdam humanist hadto apologize. From that time on, he started dissociating himself fromReuchlin. First he wrote to Prince Albert of Brandenburg:The first point I must make is this: that I have never had any connec-tion either with Reuchlin’s business or with the case of Luther. Cabbala"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"235Illumination and Angel Magicand Talmud, whatever they may be, have never appealed to me. Thevenomous conflicts between Reuchlin and the supporters of JakobHoogstraten I have always found extremely offensive.56Then he added some wry remarks about Reuchlin in the foreword to theauthorized collection of his correspondence:I am no ‘Reuchlinist.’ I belong to no man’s party, and detest thesefactious labels. I am a Christian, and I know what ‘Christian’ means.I will not tolerate ‘Erasmists,’ and ‘Reuchlinists’ is not a word I know.Between me and Reuchlin nothing has passed but the civilities of or-dinary friendship, and to become his champion is a thing I have neverundertaken, nor does he feel the need of it.57Zika argues that Erasmus showed no anti-Semitism by this opinion,rather that he saw in the cabala and the other secret sciences dangerousJudaizing tendencies that would contradict and subvert the clear, ratio-nalist standpoint of his own humanism. He promoted a reform of Chris-tianity that would see the religious rituals purified, freed of obscure ges-tures and speculations, and he saw in the hermeticist-cabalist fashion justsuch a muddled, murky practice and thought.58The ceremoniality increasingly present in his religious attitude broughthim into the company of other magical hermetists of the early 1500s,such as Lodovico Lazzarelli, Trithemius, and Agrippa. It was not onlyspiritual kinship, since these people also had various personal relations,forming almost a coherent group of intellectuals. Agrippa even lecturedon Reuchlin’s De verbo mirifico at the University of Dole in 1509.59Zika’s conclusion is that hermetic magic, although it started its careerusing a methodology borrowed from humanism, soon diverted from it,already in the works of Ficino. The magical renaissance of the earlysixteenth century proved to be undigestable for a philologist-humanistsof northern Christianity, such as Erasmus. Paola Zambelli’s thorougharticle on early sixteenth-century humanism, theology, and magic (1970)unintentionally corroborates this view. Although Zambelli has meticu-lously proved the parallels and interconnectedness between the works ofErasmus and Agrippa, not mentioning here the fact that their intellectualcircle of friends largely overlapped, it remains that while Agrippa openlyadmired Erasmus and his achievment, this admiration was not reciprocal:the name of the younger magus-hermetist does not feature in the worksor correspondence of the old humanist."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"236JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMReuchlin attached a preface to his famous book on the cabala (Dearte cabalistica, 1517), addressing Pope Leo X who was the son of Lorenzode’ Medici, il Magnifico. He praised in it the importance of the FlorentineAcademy and pointed out the differences between the philosophy repre-sented by the academicians as opposed to other trends of classical hu-manism, represented, for example, by Petrarch:[Lorenzo de’ Medici’s] birth seems heaven-sent. Petrarch, Philelph, andAretino brought the arts of oratory and fine speech to the “youth ofFlorence,” so that there could be no disputing that her people wrotemore lucidly and more accurately than any other nation. But it wasyour father who added to Florence’s store of learning—wisdom thatprobes into the past, wisdom that lay hidden until his day in books andmemorials of past times. (Reuchlin 1983, 37)These mysteries, according to Reuchlin, had been hidden in theworks of Apollonius of Tyana, Plato, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Orpheus, and,above all, Pythagoras and the Jewish cabala. Reuchlin also acknowledgedthe formative influence of the Florentine neoplatonist circle on his ownintellectual development:So I set out for Italy with the first Duke of Swabia, whose privatesecretary I was. I spoke enthusiastically to my Duke about theMedicis . . . Your father sowed the seeds of ancient philosophy in hischildren. With his son they will grow to reach the roof tops; in yourreign we shall reap the harvest in every language—Greek, Latin, He-brew, Arabic, Chaldaic, and Chaldean. (ibid., 39)This inventory makes it clear that the more he came under the influenceof these works and Eastern languages, the more he defined himself lessas a humanist and more as a hermetist. As Zika said, “the rhetorician-scholar gave way to a mystical philosopher, the eloquent humanist to thetraditionalist representative of preclassical religion and magic” (1976–1977, 245).kA similar tendency can clearly be seen in the intellectual evolution ofJohn Dee, too. But this pattern has to be completed by one more aspect,namely the comparison between the early modern mystical enthusiastsand the representatives of the Reformation. The common ground was"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"237Illumination and Angel Magicthat both groups grew from the humanists with the intention of reform-ing and revitalizing Christianity. But while the reformers from Lutherand Calvin to the radical anti-Trinitarians were attached by very strongties to their own communities and they always acted as their spokesmenopposing other well-defined groups, the enthusiasts awaited the elimina-tion of all doctrinal differences and sought a universal syncretic religion.This project also involved plans for mystical societies but their creatorswere true heirs of the humanists in that they never seriously thought ofturning their fantastic plans into practice. We may find the germs ofsecret societies—such as the infamous Rosicrucians—in their works, butwe never find a mass movement nor highly organized groups associatedwith them as we do with the more established trends of the Reformation.It is interesing to notice, however, that these individualistic enthusi-asts were always irritating those who were in possession of the powertechnologies. This is why they could not find peace either in their owncommunity or among their rivals. Each large denomination produced itsown enthusiasts. Postel and Bruno among the Catholics, Weigel andKhunrath among the Lutherans, Servet among the Unitarians—many ofthem converted and reconverted several times like Francesco Pucci, andalmost as many of them finished on the stake like Servet or Bruno.Why did they provoke so much hostility? More than one argumentcan be given in explanation. The individualism radiating from the enthu-siastic magical-esoteric thoughts, and especially their universalism, vio-lated the particular interests of various groups and communities. Further-more, the secrecy and their discourse veiled in dark allegories and mys-teries evoked a danger of secret conspiracy. These people could not findtemporary shelter anywhere but in the secluded courts of aristocraticpatrons, in the circles of extravagant intellectuals or hopeful sponsorswho could be convinced of the benefits of such plans and who eventuallycould finance the publication of the fantastic projects.60Dee, being totally engaged in his angel magic, became one of thoseenthusiasts who wandered in various parts of the Continent and preachedtheir mystical-occult message, never becoming exhausted in seeking thepatronage of attentive and sensitive benefactors. It should be stressed,though, that their camp can hardly be defined as having a homogeneousand shared ideological platform.Interestingly, while Dee had personal contacts with many of thosecontemporary enthusiasts—Postel, Bruno, Pucci, Khunrath—and in hislibrary accumulated heterodox works, in his own writings one finds veryfew references to these intellectual challenges. A possible explanation is"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"238JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthat all enthusiasts thought of themselves as elect, thus they did not needeither sources or proofs for illumination. The truth was revealed to themin a direct way. Dee seemingly developed such a conviction, since hisspiritual diaries contain significantly fewer citations, references, and glossesthan do his earlier, scholarly works. He wanted to become a prophet, animportant herald of the great and general reformation in the context ofwhich denominational differences appeared petty and insignificant. Dee’sangels seemed very tolerant in this respect. A characteristic episode oc-curred when one of the spirits burst out against the Jesuit friars who inPrague were not willing to absolve the Protestant Kelly:Whosoever wishes to be wise may look neither to the right nor to theleft; neither towards this man who is called a catholic, nor towards thatone who is called a heretic; but may he look up to the God of heavenand earth and to his Son, Jesus Christ. Behold, the courtesan will bejustified! But the hypocrite will be cast off and trodden under foot.(Dee 1965, 245)After this apocalyptic treat (the iconography of which abounds inEnochian images such as “being trodden under foot”), the session con-cludes with an explicit elaboration of exaltatio which is drawn in a dra-matic choreography by Kelly, Dee, Pucci, and The Voice:K[elly]: The seer may then foretell when the time is to come that willbe after the harvest and the harvesters. [Dee’s gloss in the margin:‘Apocalypse, chapter 14D’]\t: ‘He who writes down and records the words of the Highest,may he in the fulness of time, show forth their strength, through thestrength and support of Him Who has exalted him.’Fr[ancesco] P[ucci]: ‘May he who has been called as a speakerabound in good works, so that he may be distinguished before hishearers and exalted in Him Who sent him.’[The Voice]: ‘So then, whoever neglects his vocation may be ejected,and his place may be occupied by another. But to him who does thewill of Him Who is teaching (which is the will of the Creator of allthings) abundant grace will be granted.’ (1965, 247)A possible motivation behind interconfessionalism was the influenceof the pagan-hellenistic Platonist philosophy, which the enthusiasts triedto amalgamate with the doctrines of Christianity. These neoplatonistsand crypto-hermetists were often condemned by the radical reformers,"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"239Illumination and Angel Magicsuch as we can see in the writings of the anti-Trinitarian Johann Sommer,who condemned Platonists as follows:For them the views of Plato seemed similar to that of Christians; so itis no wonder that deceived by the likeness of notions they did so manyhorrible things, although originally they did not want more than tograsp everything in rational categories and to describe the way of in-carnation, the birth of Christ, his genealogy from the Father, etc.(Refutatio scripti Petri Carolii, 18, quoted by Szczucki 1980, 101)This quotation clearly shows how far a professional theologian—even if belonging to the most radical branch of the Reformation—and auniversalist enthusiast for whom the denominationally codified dogmaswere of little importance could be from each other. But even this ideo-logical division was not clear and stable in the Renaissance. Let us thinkof John Dee, who, when returning to England, sent Sommer’s work tothe Archbishop of Canterbury for refutation, because he found its anti-Trinitarianism a wicked and harmful doctrine:I exhibited to the Archbishop of Canterb. two books of blasphemy againstChrist and the Holy Ghost &c., desiring him to cause them to beconfuted. One was Christian Franken, printed anno 1585, in Poland.The other was of one Somerus against one Carolius printed in Ingolstadtanno 1582 in octavo. (October 13, 1592; cf. Dee 1998, 257)61From this we can conclude that the tolerance of the humanists and theradical reformers were manifest in rather divergent areas and the patiencefor each other could be seen only in exceptional cases among the earlymodern intellectuals (such as Servet, Sebastian Franck, or Valentin Weigel).The role of interconfessionalism and its relation to humanism on theone hand and to the Reformation on the other was an interesting chapterin the history of early modern culture, but one should also rememberthat by the seventeenth century this situation had changed. Therevolutionarized information exchange through the general use of inex-pensively printed books, changes in the university curricula, and suchprojects as Alsted’s monumental Encyclopaedia made possible at least atemporary coexistence of nonaristocratic, middle-class, patrician commu-nities or even church officials on the one hand and universalist enthusi-asts on the other. Some of them could well coordinate their esotericinterests with sober activities such as church administration or regular"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"240JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMteaching. Good examples are the Protestant Johann Valentin Andreae,occult adviser of the Princes of Wolfenbüttel and respected leader of thelocal Lutheran community, or the Catholic Athanasius Kircher, who wasa Jesuit, taught all over Europe, and organized schools and museums,while living in his own fantastic transcendental dreamworld.It is a fascinating story through which alternative humanism unfoldsfrom the time of Ficino to the late seventeenth century, the world of vanHelmonts, Kirchers, Jerome Drexels, Thomas Vaughans. And somewhere inthe middle of this process we find Dee, emerging in the camp of Renaissanceenthusiasts, wholly occupied with his angelic conversations. It seems that hischiliasm and his Enochian prophecy and magic tied him to those visionarieswho, growing out from the humanist tradition, did not join the officialcamps of the Reformation but rather started preaching a more mystical,alternative reform. The eastern fringes of Central Europe—Poland, Silesia,Hungary, and Transylvania—played an important role in these projects. Manyof the enthusiasts found temporary shelter in the courts far away from thecenters of the European great powers. At the same time, these states—in aconstant political and ideological flux—seemed to be stimulating missionarytargets. Robert Evans has called attention to the missionary character of Dee’sCentral European journeys and he has pointed out the similarities betweenElizabeth and Rudolf II, which—in Dee’s eyes—predestined both of them tobe the recipients of his mystical message:An important item on the agenda was provided by the mystical andoccult aspects of sovereignity. The apotheosis of the ruling families wasaccomplished in verse and image, ceremonial masque and heroic por-trait. [. . .] The seriousness of the preoccupation can be seen not onlyin Rudolfine Prague, but in Elizabethan England, where the queen wassurrounded by a similar mass of allegorical apostrophizing from schol-ars like Dee and poets like Spenser. Both the unmarried Emperor andthe Virgin Queen were widely regarded as figures prophetic of significantchange in their own day, as symbols of a lost equilibrium when theywere dead. (1973, 275)It is this lure of East-Central Europe that leads us to the question ofthe social context of Dee’s intellectual activities, that is, the examinationof the interpretive community of his messages. In my last chapter I shallinvestigate this aspect through the filter of Dee’s Central European expe-rience, then through the editorial strategy Meric Casaubon exercised whensixty years later he decided to publish the Doctor’s spiritual diaries con-ceived mostly in those faraway parts of the Continent."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"8Dee and the Interpretive CommunityThe previous chapter approached Dee’s intellectual output as an indi-vidual effort seeking the unattainable, as a lifelong series of recurrentattempts to reach out from the mundane and material world and pen-etrate the sphere of the mysterious Other. As we have seen, his lastinitiative was to the world of angels.This whole enterprise, however, has a hitherto largely unexploredsocial aspect. Namely, that those who strived for intimacy with theOther were not confining their activity to individual philosophical-theological-scientific speculations and experiments; on the contrary, theyinevitably fell into the focus of public attention. Partly because theythemselves had missionary messages that they wanted to share withtheir community and this public role became a corner stone of theirself-fashioning strategy, and partly because they became increasinglyalien and irritating to those who were less able to reach out for bridgesbetween this and the transcendental world. Thus the seeker of theOtherbecame the threatening Other for the community whose mem-bers and especially whose ideological leaders felt compelled to handlethe problem by working out power technologies to contain the alienelements in their social microcosms.While I will examine these power technologies in the second sub-chapter, in the first subchapter I shall look at Dee’s career in CentralEurope, which became for him a region of inspiration as well as a pos-sible testing ground in which to pour out the mystical lesson gainedthrough his intimation with angels.241"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"242JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM“EASTWARD HO!” DEE, PATRONAGE,AND CENTRAL EUROPEThe Lure of East-Central EuropeAs we have seen, among Dee’s readings one of his first strongly decisivemystical inspirations, Trithemius’ Steganographia, is associated with Cen-tral Europe. A young Hungarian nobleman helped the penniless Doctorcopy the work, and what is more, he even invited Dee to Hungary toinstruct him in the occult arts: “Now I stand at the curtesye of a nobleman of Hungarie who hath promised me leave thereto, after he shallperceyve that I may remayne by him longer (with the leave of my Prince)to pleasure him also with such pointes of science, as at my handes herequireth.”1 Who this Hungarian nobleman was, extending the first in-vitation for Dee to visit East-Central Europe, we do not know for sure.But it is interesting to speculate on a plausible identity, especially sincealthough the Doctor apparently did not accept his offer, it would becomea longstanding inspiration. It might have propelled him to visitMaximilian’s coronation in Pozsony (Pressburg, today’s Bratislava inSlovakia) in the fall of 1563, and he may have remembered this encoun-ter twenty years later when he decided to follow the Count Albert Laskito his Polish estates, thus choosing East-Central Europe as the principalsetting of his angelic conversations.One of the possible candidates would be Johannes Sambucus (JánosZsámboky), the famous Hungarian humanist, bibliophile, and emblematistwho had an impressive international network of acquaintances and—justlike Dee—possessed an outstandingly large and valuable private library.2In 1563 he visited his publisher, Plantin, in Antwerp and there or some-where else coinciding with Dee’s continental journey in 1562 and 1563they could have met. He was also present at the coronation in Pozsony,which occasion may have offered a chance for reunion. In spite of thepossibilities, we have no evidence that the two scholars ever met, al-though Dee possessed some of Sambucus’ books in his collection (R&W720, 793, 964, 1170). Sambucus’ candidacy for Dee’s “Hungarian noble-man” is nevertheless weak for the following obvious reason: Sambucuswas a renowned scholar but not a nobleman. Dee, sensitive to socialhierarchy, would probably not have made such a mistake in his corre-spondence to Cecil; furthermore, it is unlikely that Sambucus wouldhave wanted to study the occult arts from anyone."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"243Dee and the Interpretive CommunityAnother more likely candidate might be Boldizsár Batthyány (BalthasarBatthyany), whom Robert Evans rediscovered for English readers (1973,120; 1975, 35–37). A brief introduction to his career provides aninteresting Central European parallel to the activities of Dee or thatof some noblemen of alternative thinking such as the “Wizard” Earl ofNorthumberland in England.Batthyány (1530–1590) developed one of the most brilliant noblecourts in the vicinity of the Hungarian capital, Pozsony, in West Hun-gary. His career started in the Habsburg court of Vienna, then, in the1560s, he spent a few years in Italy and France, finally becoming a pageto King Francis and Mary Stuart. From a letter written to his parents weknow that in 1560 he witnessed the outbreak of the first Huguenot warin Amboise.3 According to historical sources he spent over two years inFrance and he seems to have made acquaintances among local Protestantfamilies as well as refugees from the Low Countries. Among those onecan mention the printer-publisher family, the Wechels, and the famousbotanist Carolus Clusius (Charles de l’Ecluse) who escaped from Flandersin 1561. Wechel’s son-in-law, Jean Aubri, became Batthyány’s booksellerfor many subsequent years and Clusius spent an important period of hiscareer at Batthyány’s Hungarian court working on his opus on the floraof Hungary.4Although there is no historical proof, it is not impossible that in1562 and 1563 the Hungarian magnate made a journey from Paris to theNetherlands and in the circle of Willem Silvius he could have easily comeacross the English Doctor. His later patronage of Clusius makes it plau-sible that he would also have invited Dee to Hungary. This possibility iseven more plausible if we think of Batthyány’s notable interest in al-chemy and the occult arts.Batthyány’s humanist circle at his court in Németújvár (today’s Güssingin Eastern Austria) developed in the 1570s and was centered around hissignificant library. Unfortunately this collection has dispersed, and unlikeDee’s library, we do not have even its catalogue. The only documentationconcerning Batthyány’s books are the valuable set of receipts issued by themagnate’s bookseller, Jean Aubri, which also contain detailed lists of thepurchased items. From these it becomes clear that Batthyány’s interest wasnot of the usual humanist-theological sort but, similar to Dee’s, was morecentered on natural philosophy, the esoteric lore, history, and literature.Next to Hermes Trismegistus, Raymundus Lullus, and Paracelsus we findcontemporary editions of Rabelais, Machiavelli, Castiglione, and Jean Bodin.5"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"244JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMBatthyány also patronized a number of humanists, Hungarians andforeigners alike. One of his main advisors was Elias Corvinus, a humanistfrom Pozsony and Vienna whose sixty-one letters to his patron survivefrom the years between 1557 and 1587. It is obvious that Corvinus actedas a go-between connecting the court of Németújvár with the humanistsof Pozsony, as well as the Imperial Court in Vienna. From this correspon-dence the following names attract the attention of the Dee scholar: HugoBlotius, the chief librarian of the Habsburgs; Paul Fabritius, royal as-tronomer in Vienna; Crato von Kraftheim, imperial physician; and anumber of local and wandering alchemists. From Corvinus’ letters welearn that in the 1570s Batthyány ordered more and more books onalchemy and occult philosophy. Representative titles include “Theatrumdiabolorum,” “Coelum philosophorum,” “Dialogi de alchimia,” andGerhard Dorn’s Lapis metaphysicae,Chimicum artificiae. The most expen-sive book commissioned by the Hungarian was Paracelsus’ Disputatio demedicina nova. In 1574 Batthyány entrusted Corvinus with finding somemore Paracelsica. In 1577 he bought the hermetic Pimander and TomásJordán’s book on the plague. Interestingly, Jordán of Transylvania, aHungarian wandering humanist and medical doctor, had met ConradGessner, the Swiss polymath, just a few months before Dee visited theprofessor in Zurich. Their inscriptions in Gessner’s album amicorum al-most follow each other.6 Other occult items in Batthyány’s book ordersare Martin Ruland’s alchemical lexicon, Porta’s Magia naturalis, andChasseneux’s Catalogus gloriae mundi, the same work that Albert Laskiexchanged with Dee for a Bible in Poland (R&W 226).We also learn from the correspondence that from 1572 there was analchemical laboratory in Németújvár. While at that time Corvinus lived inVienna, the magnate was experimenting by himself and regularly reportedhis progress to his advisor (Barlay 1986, 209–11). This happened at thesame time as another Englishman, and what is more, Dee’s own disciple,turned up in Pozsony. The famous visitor was young Philip Sidney who,together with Edward Dyer, had studied chemistry with Dee around 1570.7The promising nineteen-year-old aristocrat and poet came to Hun-gary in 1573 as part of a three-year-long grand tour sponsored by hispatron, Sir Francis Walsingham. Since Walsingham was the father of theBritish secret service, he also entrusted Sidney to write reports to him onwhat he experienced in the various European countries. As historianshave verified, Sidney indeed was to observe the Turkish wars and the stateof the Hungarian fortifications.8 However, we should not forget the poet’smemorable remark about Hungarian heroic poetry in his Defence of Poesy:"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"245Dee and the Interpretive CommunityIn Hungary I have seen in the manner at all feasts, and other suchmeetings, to have songs of their ancestors’ valour, which that rightsoldierlike nation think one of the chiefest kindlers of brave courage.(quoted from Abrams 1986, 516)This is yet another mysterious reference to Hungary and the Hun-garians, but again there is no exact proof as to where Sidney might haveseen such feasts and meetings embellished with the performance of heroicsongs. One strong possibility is Batthyány’s court in Németújvár, whichwas just a short ride from either Vienna or from Pozsony. Sidney’s hostin Pozsony was the town physician, Georg Purkircher, a prominent memberof Batthyány’s humanist circle.9 In Vienna a number of humanists couldcall the Englishman’s attention to Batthyány, but we should not forgetthat earlier in Frankfurt Sidney had lodged in the house of AndreasWechel, a close acquaintance of the Hungarian nobleman. And, finally,we cannot exclude the possibility that Batthyány’s name turned up in theconversations between Sidney and Dee when the young traveler wasbeing prepared by his older tutor for the continental grand tour.It is interesting to follow the story of Sidney’s European journeys sinceseveral of his meetings and episodes look forward to John Dee’s later mis-sion. After having traveled in Italy for almost a year, the poet turned up inVienna again in August 1574 and stayed in the house of MichaelLingelsheim, imperial councillor. During the fall, from there he took ajourney to Cracow, wanting to visit the Valois king, Henry, but by the timehe got there, Henry had already resigned and returned to Paris. Sidney leftthe Polish capital disappointed by the political anarchy. On the other hand,he spent a few pleasant days in Silesian Wroc¬aw (Breslau) where he visitedAndreas Dudith, the Hungarian-born humanist and politician who in afew years time would sceptically comment on Dee’s performances at thePolish and imperial courts. In Dudith’s house Sidney met another protago-nist of Dee’s future stay in Prague: Crato von Kraftheim, the imperialphysician (Gömöri 1991, 30). On his way back to Vienna Sidney alsostopped in Brno where he enjoyed the hospitality of Tomás Jordán, thedoctor who had visited Conrad Gessner in Zurich a few months beforeDee and who later became imperial physician to Rudolf II.Three years later Sidney came to Central Europe for the second time.In March 1577, Queen Elizabeth sent him to the Palatinate and toPrague, officially to express her sympathies in regard to the deaths of theElector Palatine and Emperor Maximilian, but he also had a clandestineassignment: to tap the opinion of Central European princes concerning"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"246JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMa Protestant league.10 Traveling via Brussels, Heidelberg, and Nurnberg,Sidney and his escort arrived in Prague for Easter Week and during his stayhe had two audiences with Rudolf II. Beside political activities he also hadtime to visit the ancient city and its surroundings: the star-shaped huntinglodge, the Hvezda, even found its way into the New Arcadia.11Perhaps the most interesting episode was Sidney’s meeting with theEnglish Catholic exile, Edmund Campion, who at that time had a resi-dence in the Prague convent of the Jesuits. Campion had been Sidney’sinstructor in rhetoric during his studies at Oxford, but in the meantimehad become an arch-enemy in the eyes of Puritan English politicians.Now the Protestant youth decided to visit his old master secretly. Sidneyhad to be cautious in undertaking such a visit, since several members of hisdelegation were spying on him. Thus we learn about the meeting onlyfrom Campion’s correspondence. This suggests that Sidney was seriouslytempted to convert to Catholicism. Although the English poet is remem-bered as an ardent Protestant and a patriot, in the tolerant and cosmopoli-tan atmosphere of Rudolphine Prague he may have come into the lure ofthe old religion. His crypto-Catholic attitude becomes the more interestingif we recall John Dee—another Protestant-patriot—and his similar en-chantment a decade later, when, in spite of his Protestantism, he attendedconfession and took the holy communion both in Cracow and Prague.12The last episode of Sidney’s East-Central European travels relating toDee’s upcoming mission is his probable meeting with Count Albert Laski.According to Anthony Wood’s Athenae Oxoniensis, in 1577 while stayingin Frankfurt, Sidney received two letters from Poland containing invita-tions for him to take the Polish throne. Zantuan (1968, 6–7) suggeststhat the only person in the position to put forward such a fantastic planwas Albert Laski. Whether this story is true or not, it is a fact that in thefall of 1573 Sidney had met Laski in Venice and when the Polish Palatinecame to London in May 1583, he was not only well received at the courtof Elizabeth, but Sidney was nominated to be his personal escort.There is no doubt that young Philip Sidney consulted John Dee onthe circumstances of Vienna and Pozsony before his first trip to Central-Europe in 1572 and 1573. Later on, it was Sidney who had a lot to tellhis old master about his experiences there and it is also most probablethat Sidney was the mastermind behind Laski’s getting acquainted withDee. They first met on the thirteenth day of Laski’s stay in England, inLeicester’s house in Greenwich (May 13, 1583; Dee 1842, 20). Five dayslater Laski visited Dee’s Mortlake home and, as we know, he soon becamea participant of the angelic conversations."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"247Dee and the Interpretive CommunityIn what way was their meeting a congenial affiliation? Each of themrepresented for the other an aspect of the mysterious Other, an embodi-ment of their secret desires. For Dee, Laski meant a piece of East-CentralEurope, a kind of Promised Land from where Hungarian noblemenpopped up to help him learn the arcane teaching of the Steganographiaand where splendid royal courts, such as that at the coronation ofMaximilian II, might have guaranteed secure patronage, fame, high socialstatus, as well as attentive ears to his most sacred angelic messages. ForLaski, Dee was the embodiment of the hermetic magus, somebody whocould personally experience and testify about the magical exaltatio, ascientifically-basedunio mystica with the deity, the Platonic Other wherethe souls crave to return from the material world. Nor should one forgetthat Dee and Kelly were practicing alchemists whose experiments mighteventually yield the amount of gold frighteningly absent from Laski’sbankrupt treasury.Who was this extravagant Pole, whom the monographs on Dee de-scribe as a fairy-tale personality rather than a real historical character andwhom even Robert Evans’ book treats rather passingly? Laski (sometimescalled Alasco but his original Polish name was Olbracht L-aski, 1530–1605) came from a leading aristocratic family; one of his uncles wasCardinal Jan L-aski, an outstanding politician and patron in the time ofthe Polish Renaissance. His father, Hieronim L-aski, Palatine of Sieradz,visited England in 1527 as a Polish envoy and made a very good impres-sion on Henry VIII and on Cardinal Wolsey (Zins 1974, 55). Yet anotherJan L-aski (1499–1560), younger brother of Hieronim, became one of theinstrumental supporters of the Reformation in England, previously hav-ing started his career as a humanist and a personal acquaintance andfollower of Erasmus. This Jan had met several Englishmen during hisstudies in Italy and followed the invitation of Leonard Coxe to the Brit-ish Isles, soon claiming that his family’s descent was in fact from theEnglish nobility. From 1548 he lived permanently in England and earnedthe appreciation of the leaders of the English Reformation, such as Arch-bishop Thomas Cranmer.13Albert Laski recalled the stature of his father, Hieronim, and was oneof the most colorful specimens of Polish Renaissance personalities: amagnate, a mercenary, a learned humanist, a patron of writers, and apublisher of books, at the same time a ruthless politician. In many wayshe can be compared to Dee’s possible “Hungarian nobleman,” BoldizsárBatthyány, or to the Doctor’s later Czech patron, Vilém Roz ̆mberk.14Laski was in fact born in Upper Hungary, in the city of Késmárk, which"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"248JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMat that time was a family dominion. This town is several time mentionedin Dee’s Central-European diaries, and this is where Laski was runningan alchemical laboratory and where one of his alchemists, the Silesian-German Adam Schröter, translated Paracelsus’ Archidoxae magica. Thework was published in Cracow in 1569 and was dedicated “Illustri acMagnifico Domino Alberto a Lasko, Palatino Siradiensi etc.” The lengthyintroductory essay by Schröter not only paid tribute to Laski as patron(also eloquently praising his father, Hieronimus), it further testified tothe magnate’s genuine interest in the occult arts.It would be interesting to know if Dee ever received a copy of thisCracow Archidoxae edition, but since he lived in Laski’s household, onecan hardly imagine he did not at least see it. Although the EnglishDoctor had known the text from the editions he had possessed since the1570s, he must have been pleased to read Schröter’s introduction inwhich Hermes Trismegistus was mentioned as someone who had learnedmedicine directly from the angels and Enoch was remembered for hisparticularly long life gifted by God. Schröter called Paracelsus a directdescendant of Trismegistus and Enoch, and finally directly referred tomagicalexaltatio: “The essence of the whole work is to teach in generalhow it is possible to prepare an appropriate medicine against any kind ofillness and finally to reach exaltatio; by the help of which the humanbody miraculously and from all illnesses and future accidents for a longtime can be liberated and immunely preserved.”15The exact nature of Laski’s mission is not known. Polish historianssuggest that as a notorious “king-maker,” he might have had in mind theestablishment of an alliance against the Catholic king, Stephen Bathory.16As we know, nothing significant came out of this obscure political com-mission; on the other hand, he witnessed in Oxford the debate of GiordanoBruno with the local professors and had many other interesting culturalencounters. Finally, he returned to Poland with two Englishmen in hisretinue, both parties having exalted hopes about the alchemical and magicalexperiments to come.The Lure of Dee and Kelly for Eastern EuropeAmong intellectuals traveling in the late-Renaissance in East-CentralEurope—such as Carolus Clusius, Francesco Pucci, Jacobus Palaeologus,Christian Francken, and others—John Dee and Edward Kelly have al-ways aroused a great deal of interest in the eyes of Eastern European"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"249Dee and the Interpretive Communityhistorians of humanism and science. There is more than one reason forthis. First of all, one should think of the high prestige of Dee in Englishscience historical scholarship.17 Furthermore, one should remember theamazingly voluminous autobiographical documents, especially the intrigu-ing spiritual diaries of Dee, that document his Eastern European so-journs. Until the early 1980s Eastern European scholars interpreted Dee’svisits as a major impetus from the West facilitating the development ofnatural science in the east-central part of the continent18 and they foundconfirmation for this in the works of their western colleagues.19 As I havedescribed earlier, since the 1980s John Dee’s image as an Elizabethanintellectual has undergone several phases of metamorphosis. Debatesconcerning the Yates thesis have also eroded his reputation as an out-standing natural scientist and the previously established link betweenhermeticism, magic, and the advancement of learning. In this context,when we reevaluate Dee’s Eastern European mission, we have to put thefollowing questions for consideration: What brought the English travelersto such remote places of Europe? What message or mission did theyconvey to their hosts? In what way did this influence Eastern Europeanintellectual life? Did they get anything in return from Eastern Europe?There are three groups of sources relating to Dee’s eventful East-Central European journeys. First, there are external references (hearsay,humanist correspondence, and reports of agents) that are quite scarce.Secondly, we have Dee’s “public” private diaries that show a busy human-ist with a tight itinerary, traveling constantly and meeting a great numberof people; however, little is revealed about the exact nature of his contactsand the contents of his conversations. (No doubt, he was fully occupiedwith continual efforts to secure patronage for himself and his family.)Third, most exhaustive are his spiritual diaries, the journals of the angelicconferences, which, of course, are the most intimate of all the documentsand deal not only with the séances and Dee’s prophetic visions but alsoprovide complex insights into the everyday life of the two wanderingprophets and their relatives.Since recent biographical writings20 throw ample light on these domesticaspects, I shall only briefly refer to some characteristic features and episodeswhich are specifically connected to the questions I have posed above.I think in the previous subchapter I have given a detailed enoughassessment of Dee’s possible motivations in accepting Count Laski’s in-vitation and trying his fortunes at the courts of East-Central Europe. Heclearly felt dissatisfied in regard to his advancement in England; he clearlyhad an urge to share his angelic messages with attentive and at the same"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"250JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMtime powerful persons; he clearly had idealistic hopes about the statusand prestige of the occult arts at the Central European courts; and hemust have had enough self-confidence to think that a scholar-prophetlike himself would be warmly welcomed in those courts.In spite of the contrary opinion of some historians, I shall argue thathe was not entirely mistaken in his expectations and that his five yearsspent in Central Europe should not be considered a complete failure. Atfirst sight, though, the diaries seem to prove that the adventures on thefar side of the Continent again failed to yield the desired results. On thedebit side can be mentioned that Laski’s support soon dried up and Deewas no more successful in Prague. Rudolf did not take to him and he wasnot the least inclined to give Dee the title of “Royal Mathematicien.”Back in Cracow, Dee met King Bathory three times, but the ruler re-mained suspicious of his mission. The worst events followed only afterthat: as a result of the machinations of the papal nuncio, Dee was tem-porarily expelled from the Habsburg lands, but fortunately the Czechmagnate, Count Roz ̆mberk, provided shelter for him and his kin.On the credit side one should take into consideration that in spiteof all their eccentricity the Englishmen were nowhere kicked out orsimply chased away. On the contrary, they enjoyed royal and aristocraticpatronage and most of their expenses were covered for half a decade.When Dee returned to England, he traveled like a prince. He had threecoaches with twelve Hungarian horses. In the Habsburg territories twenty-four soldiers escorted him with the passport of the Emperor, and inGerman lands they also had three or four bodyguards. It is true that mostof these expenses were covered by loans, but back in England, Dee dulycashed them with his queen. According to the Compendious Rehearsal(Dee 1851, 34), the Doctor requested Elizabeth to compensate him forexpenses and losses to the value of 2306 pound sterlings!During their continental sojourn, the Englishmen enjoyed the twoquietest years in Trebona (Tr ̆ebon ̆), on the Roz ̆mberk estate. However,neither financial success nor an intellectual environment comparable toDee’s former private academy in Mortlake, England, can be documentedthere. Was the little cultivated Eastern European society too unsophisti-cated to sympathize with Dee’s mission or were the Englishmen simply tooeccentric? If we look at the independent documents on the intellectualatmosphere of Rudolfine Prague, or even the local aristocratic center ofTrebona, we cannot help feeling that the second explanation is more likely.It also appears that Dee’s strategy to attract his potential patronsmisfired. What is more, his apocalyptic and highly idiosyncratic message"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"251Dee and the Interpretive Communitywas frightening. On introducing himself he promised to reveal, on thebasis of the angelic conversations, the greatest secrets of the world but thecontents of his séances did not in fact radically differ from the propheciesof widespread contemporary apocalyptic literature. No doubt, he knewwell about the Book of Enoch and he had an effective choreography toperform the updated version of the prophecies. However, a pathetic aswell as ironic feature of his argument was that while he communicatedthe angelic messages to king and emperor, he bluntly threatened them inthe name of the celestial powers unless they followed his directions.Because of this, each audition involved high dramatic suspense, com-bined with the atmosphere of tragicomedy. Nevertheless, their detaileddescriptions in Dee’s spiritual journals reveal important information tothe psychoanalyst as well as to the historian of mentalities, revealing notonly Dee’s excentric personality, but also the characteristics of the inter-pretive community to whom the messages were directed.The English Doctor had his first important royal audience in Cen-tral Europe at the Prague court of Rudolf II. He appeared before theEmperor on September 3, 1584, after elaborate preparations, and theaudition lasted a full hour (Dee 1659, 230–31). At the beginning ofthe conversation Dee reviewed his major work, the Monas hieroglyphica,and pointed out that it had been dedicated to Rudolf ’s father, MaximilianII. After Dee’s introductory remarks the emperor admitted that he haddifficulties in following the Doctor’s train of thought. Changing thetopic, Dee then explained how he had became disappointed in earthlysciences and how he had turned to angelic metaphysics. The openlymagical program, already quoted above (Dee 1659, 321), definitelyhorrified the emperor. On top of this, Dee poured out to him hismissionary program:It pleased God to send me his Light; and his holy Angels, for these twoyears and a half, have used to inform me: yea, they have brought mea Stone of that value that no earthly Kingdom is of that worthinesseas to be compared to the vertue and dignity thereof, etc.The Angel of the Lord hath appeared to me, and rebuketh you foryour sins. If you will hear me, and believe me, you shall Triumph: ifyou will not hear me, The Lord, the God that made Heaven and Earth,putteth his foot against your breast, and will throw you headlong downfrom your seat.Moreover, the Lord hath made his Covenant with me:[. . .] Ifyou will forsake your wickednesse, and turn unto him, your Seat shallbe the greatest that ever was: and the Devil shall become your prisoner:"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"252JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMWhich Devil, I did conjecture, to be the Great Turk.

Dee, in spite of all his efforts, could never again obtain anaudience with the emperor, which fact contributed to his decision tomove to Cracow and try his fortune with King Stephen Bathory.Albert Laski introduced him to the king on April 17, 1585, Wednes-day. The first meeting was short and formal; Bathory postponed thedetailed discussion until after Easter (Dee 1659, 397). From this time on,the spirits inserted pronouncements concerning Bathory in their mes-sages. For example on April 24: “Stephen, lift up thy head amongst thestars of Heaven; for the spirit of God is with thee, [. . .] but the Lord willreprehend thee for thy sins” (Dee 1659, 398). Then, on May 20,I greatly thirst after Steven, for the course of things are at hand,Behold, I will bless him, that he may leave blessing unto thee,Behold, I will place thee unto him, as his right leg, and he shallstand.[. . .]Therefore and with speed go before Steven. (401)A curious episode took place on May 22. Kelly was conversing with aspirit called Puer, and the demon asked in what language to scold Bathory.Laski, present at the séance, requested Hungarian. Puer/Kelly, however,skilfully avoided the task:Hungarian is hateful unto me; For it is full of iniquity; Neither will Ispeak unto him my self that he shall (yet) hear me. I will open mymouth in Latin for thy sake: and if he become obedient, I will alsoappear unto him my self and unto you all, [. . .] but to overcome himby Miracles it needeth not, for by him the people are not edified, butby my words he shall understand, that I touch him, although Satanstand by him.But go thou [Albert Laski] unto him, and speak unto him liberally,when he hath heard me, if he receive me, my blessing is upon him ofnecessity. (402)21A day later (May 23) Bathory sent for Dee and Laski. He receivedthem in the dining hall; he was sitting next to the southern windowopening to the new garden, and addressed them in Latin:"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"253Dee and the Interpretive CommunityEgit mecum Dominus Palatinus, ut vos audirem de rebus istis magnis& raris loquente . . . — The Palatine has told me that I should listen[to] what you have to say about great and rare things. (402)22Dee answered with a lengthy theological explication in which he arguedthat prophecies did not become invalid in the time of the New Testamentand quoted the Scriptures to prove the validity of divine revelation. At theend of his speech he repeated to Stephen the offer he had made to Rudolf:Et paeteritarum nostrorum Actionum libros 24, paratus sum videndosexhibere—I am ready to exhibit at your Majesty’s request the 24 booksof our former actions; some of those have been written in Latin andGreek, the others in English. (Dee 1659, 404)The king’s answer is not incorporated in the diary; instead, Dee’s thanks-giving is included for having been led to the Polish court. A few dayslater, on May 27, another audience was granted in the king’s privatechamber. During this the Englishmen set up a session of angelic confer-ence and a spirit through Kelly’s mouth spoke to the king as follows:Listen carefully, Stephen. Who nurtured you from the cradle? Is it notthat King of Glory. By whose grace all power is subjected in heaven andearth? Did he not raise you with his powerful arm, from an ordinarysoldier to a greater one, and so to the greatest kingdom? Why, then, didyou introduce such a dark cloud, full of so much fog and ingratitude,between your God and your soul? (Dee 1659, 405; Dee 1998, 181)It is interesting to ponder how the king felt at such speeches. As a devoutCatholic he probably deeply believed in the existence of spirits and musthave appreciated that he was chosen as a recipient of a sacred message.On the other hand, he must have also been perplexed at how littleinformed the supernatural being was in calling him an ordinary soldier.It is true that he did not inherit the Polish throne but was elected to it;however, prior to that he had been the Prince of Transylvania and hadcame from one of the most distinguished Hungarian aristocratic families.A day later, at a private session a “Green Man,” called Ilimese, strictlycommanded Dee to scold the king severely at their upcoming meeting:Thus saith the Lord: thou must answer Stephen according to the hard-ness of his hart: Answer him thus, “Lo, King, the God of Heaven andEarth hath placed me before thee, and hath shewed unto thee his will."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"254JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM[. . .] Behold (O King), I can make the Philosophers Stone. Bear thoutherefore the charge, and give me a name within thy court that I mayhave access unto thee! and yearly maintainance of thee for us both.(Dee 1659, 407)Whether the spirits were indeed worrying about Dee’s material needs orwhether that Kelly just wanted to make sure that patronage would notbe forgotten is hard to tell. But it is even more puzzling as to why Deeavoided these formulas referring to their possible settlement in Cracow attheir next—and last—audition with King Stephen. That happened onJune 4, and the diary-entry relating the meeting is extremely short. Welearn only that the king, Laski, and Dee participated in it, there was nospiritual conference, and the Doctor plainly reconfirmed his honesty indelivering the divine message to Bathory:Ecce (O Rex) Deus Coeli & Terrae, me ante oculos Vestros posuit: theKing of Heaven & Earth has led me in front of your eyes and hasrevealed his will. As for me, [God] has brought me up from my youthin his fear and led me to desire true Wisdom. By the help of which Ihave arrived at the comprehension of the secrets of Nature, (ecce) innomine Dei. (Dee 1659, 408)In fact, Dee repeated nothing of the message of Ilimese, the Green Man.Needless to say, the outcome of the final audience was similar to thatof the Prague scenario, and since Bathory offered no position to theEnglishmen, Dee and Kelly returned to Prague.Two more episodes in the spiritual diaries describe Dee’s search forpatronage. One is an interlude in Prague when Dee learned that at theimperial court he had been exposed to wicked gossips, even plotting,which aimed at driving him out of the capital. The charge at the tableof the apostolic Nuncio inter alia was that Dee did not hesitateto offer to the Emperor [. . .] an apparition of blessed spirits (whichthey, however, call and believe to be evil ones) with the aid of certainmagical characters. [. . .] Also [it was said] that the Imperial Majestyhad purposely recoiled from that [offer] lest he should burden hisconscience with scruples or cause some danger to his soul. [. . .] Theybelieve in fact that the dealings [of Mr. Dee] with the Emperor mightrather have originated from another, more important matter. I amindeed of the opinion [comments the secretary who prepared this memofor the Emperor] that they prefer one philosophers’ stone to ten visionsof angels.23"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"255Dee and the Interpretive CommunityThis quotation may explain why at other times Dee desperately tried toconvince both Rudolf and King Bathory that he was able to produce thephilosophers’ stone (Dee 1659, 243, and also as quoted from 407). Therewas evidently a fatal discrepancy between the Doctor’s intention and hisclients’ expectations. In spite of all this, the continental mission cannotbe considered altogether a failure.From this time on Dee and his scryer did not have access to royalcircles. On the other hand, they developed a strong association withFrancesco Pucci, the heretic and apostate who also took part in many oftheir séances.24 It is noteworthy that after their first meeting in Cracow,Pucci seems to have followed Dee to Prague; later on they met in Erfurtduring Dee’s temporary exile, and, finally, the Italian forced himself onthem as company in Trebona. His presence is associated with the mostmystically significant episode of Dee’s years on the Continent: the miracleof the books in Prague (see above, pp. 219–20).In Dee’s opinion Pucci was a mean character whose intrigues contrib-uted to the expulsion of Dee and his associates from the territory of theHabsburg empire in May 1586 (cf. Dee 1569, 428). The Italian neverthe-less must have been a very strong character because the Doctor could noteasily free himself from his influence. As is well known, Pucci convertedseveral times to and from Catholicism and tried various Reformed denomi-nations, including a brief encounter with anti-Trinitarianism. At the timeof his meeting with Dee and Kelly, he was taking one of his swings backto the Popish religion and was seeking protection from the papal nuncios.The new administrator, Bishop Filippo Sega, who arrived in Prague inApril 1586, probably through Pucci’s information, soon became alarmedby the obscure revelations of the Englishmen and thought that their con-tent should be examined by the Catholic authorities in Rome. AlthoughPucci recommended the journey to Italy, Dee in time realized that nosuccess and appreciation would be waiting for him at the seat of the HolyInquisition. His position worsened enough in Prague since he had to leavethe Habsburg lands at short notice.The Doctor then temporarily moved to Germany until his new patron,Count Roz ̆mberk, secured for him permission to return and stay in Trebona.The company spent two years there and the last Eastern European chaptersof the spiritual diary contain magical sessions held in the Roz ̆mberk castle.During the Trebona period the angels suggested important corrections to thesystem of evocations (cf. Dee 1994, Appendices A–C), and it was there thatthe Englishmen got supernatural instruction to carry out the infamous wife-swapping project (Dee 1659, *19–21 [new numbering])."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"256JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMAfter a few years of break, Dee continued writing his private diary.These entries show the Doctor increasingly socializing from 1586 on.Traveling envoys, merchants, and scholars; English, French, and Germanvisitors; and a few local characters are mentioned.When contrasting the spiritual and the private diaries, we see twosides of Dee emerging. The latter was an active, versatile, prestigioushumanist on the move while the former was an isolated monomaniacwho had lost contact with reality and turned toward some obscure,inner dreamworld. This double nature, in fact, can be detected in thespiritual diaries themselves. It is surprising to see how few charactersare mentioned on the several hundred pages of the angelic records:Dee, Kelly, Laski, and the two rulers; next to them a few royal admin-istrators (like Dr. Jacob Kurtz), Ambassador de San Clemente, andthe heretic Pucci are named; in addition, Dee meticulously registeredthe names of their landlords and pages. This illustrates that even theseobscure and emotional journals can be occasionally used as enlight-ening social documents.We learn, for example, that their journey from England to Polandlasted several months, beginning on September 21, 1583 and endingonly on February 3, 1584, in Lasko Town where they were lodged “in theProvost his fair house by the Church” (Dee 1659, 62).The description of their quarters in Prague, in the house of TadeásˇHájek, the famous astronomer and alchemist, is even more dramatic:August 1–9, 1584. On Wednesday the first day of August, at afternoon(hora 3) we entered on our journey toward Prague, in the Kingdom ofBeame [sic!], whither we came on Thursday seven-night after, by 3 ofthe clock, that is exactly in eight days. We came by coach. I, E.K. andhis brother, and Edmond Hilton, so that we came to Prague Augusti9 by the new calendar.August 15. Wednesday. We began on the day of the Assumptionof the blessed Virgin Mary: in the excellent little stove or study of Dr.Hageck his house lent me, by Bethlehem in old Prague: which studyseemed in times past (anno 1518) to have been the study of somestudent or skilful of the Holy Stone. A name was in divers places of thestudy, noted in letters of gold and silver, Simon Baccalaureus Pragensis.And among other things manifold written very fairly in the study (andvery many hieroglyphical notes philosophical, in birds, fishes, fruits,leaves and six vessels, as for the philosopher’s works), these verses wereover the door:"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"257Dee and the Interpretive CommunityImmortal honour, and equal glory, are owed to the oneBy whose wit this wall is adorned with colour.And of the philosopher’s work (on the south side of the study) in threelines uppermost was this written:This art is precious, delicate and rare.Our learning is a boy’s game and the toil of women.All you sons of this art, understand that none may reap the fruitsof our elixir except by the introduction of the elementall stone,and if he seeks another path he will never find the waynor attain the goal.(Dee 1659, 212; Dee 1998, 134–35)From many of the entries one can reconstruct the structure ofhouseholds, even learn the names of some of the servants (cf. Harkness1997). This is how a certain Emericus, probably a Hungarian, becameeternalized, having came from Laski’s estate of Késmárk (then Hun-gary, today in Slovakia) with some errands (Dee 1659, 91). The follow-ing lively account reveals the semiotics of the display of power in earlymodern Poland:Remember that on Saturday, after noon, the Chancelour came to Cracow,with 60 coaches in his company and train: he bringing in a close Coach(covered with red) the Lord Samuel S. Boroskie Prisoner, whom hetook Friday night before, at his sisters house, being separated from hisSouldiers and servants, &c. (May 7, 1584; Dee 1659, 118)We also learn that, in spite of his Protestant denomination, Deeattended Catholic services in Cracow and even took communion at Easter.Preceding this, he was convinced by the angels that “The Bread that wasministered by Christ unto his Disciples, was not a figure of his body, buthis true body. So the Minister using the office and person of Christ inoffice, pronouncing the words, doth also give unto the people not Bread,but the true body” (Dee 1659, 372). It led him to accept, at least tem-porarily, the Catholic doctrine and he decided on admitting his sinsbefore a confessor who was none other than the famous neoplatonicphilosopher and commentator of the hermetic texts Hannibal Rosselli:25April 19, 1585. I took ghostly counsel of Dr. Hannibal, the greatdivine, that had now set out some of his commentaries upon Pymander,Hermetis Trismegisti."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"258JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMApril 20, 1585. Saturday. I received the Communion at theBernardines, where that Doctor is a Professor. (Dee 1659, 397; Dee1998, 178)The mention of Doctor Rosselli reminds us that he is practically theonly humanist scholar who is named in the spiritual diaries, and theItalian’s commentaries on Hermes Trismegistus’ Pymander is almostthe only book that Dee mentions by title beyond his own wiritings.26 Allthis is surprising from a man who possessed the largest private library incontemporary England and who was carrying an impressive five-hundred-volume traveling library with him. To this Roberts and Watson ironicallyremark: “there is little reference to books in the conversations with an-gels—no doubt because one does not question angels about matters whichare already dealt with in print” (1990, 54).Roberts and Watson (1990, 53–54) have clarified that in the hastilyselected but still huge traveling library Dee had unevenly selected worksfrom his comprehensive collection. He preferred his hermetic books andbeloved Paracelsica, and works on alchemy (perhaps at Kelly’s sugges-tion), and he also took a sizable part of his Hebrew collection, whichmight indicate his growing or ongoing interest in the cabala.27Compared with his previous continental journeys the Doctor indeedseems to have bothered much less with acquiring books and manuscripts.It is still notable, however, that even in the most difficult moments of hislife he could never be entirely dispassionate about precious textual pieces.For example, during his travels in Central Europe he often asked hisspirits whether to take his books or not on a certain leg of the journey(e.g., Dee 1659, 243).The bibliophile Dee is shown by his generous present of a fifteenth-century Greek manuscript of Boëtius’ De consolatione philosophiae in whichhe inscribed a laborious dedication addressing the rector of the JagellonianUniversity, Martin of Silesia.28 Sometime in Poland he also presentedKelly with an 1555 Estienne Bible (R&W 1099) and in exchange re-ceived from Laski a 1564 Venice folio of “Catalogus gloriae mundiChassenei” (R&W 226).Dee also bought two manuscripts. He acquired a medieval library listin Erfurt, during his most desperate weeks of exile—he probably plannedto identify his own manuscripts at home by the help of this manual (R&WDM24). On his way back to England, he bought another manuscript inLübeck. This is a connoisseur’s piece: George Ripley’s magnificently illus-trated alchemical scroll.29"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"259Dee and the Interpretive CommunityDee also recorded his most important moves to gain or enhancepatronage. He included in the spiritual diaries his letters to EmperorRudolf as well as his writings to his queen:May 11, 1586. Sunday. I came to Leipzig, and was at Peter HansSwartz his house lodged. I found Laurence Overton, an English mer-chant. [. . .] There I also found a corteous gentleman called Mr. FrancisEvers, the Lord Evers his son of the north. [. . .] I cannot omit to passwithout memory the copy of one letter which I wrote to the Queen ofEngland, her Secretary, the Right Honourable Sir Francis Walsingham,as followeth: “Right Honourable Sir, I am forced to be brief. Thatwhich England suspected was also here, for these two years, almost(secretly) in doubt, in question, in consultation Imperial and Royal, byhonourable espies, fawning about me, and by other discoursed upon,pried and peered into. The Apostolic Nuncio, after his year’s suit untome to be acquainted with me [. . .] is gone to Rome with a flea in hisear, that disquieteth him, and terrifieth the whole state Romish andJesuitical. Secretly they threaten us violent death . . . Sir, I trust I shallhave justice for my house, library, goods and revenues, &c. [. . .] Nohuman reason can limit or determine God his marvellous means ofproceeding with us. He hath made of Saul (E.K.) a Paul. The Almightybless her Majesty, both in this world and eternally: John Dee.” (Dee1998, 196)The excited and not too coherent diction of his letter can be explainedby his desperation: his trip to Leipzig was during a time of exile whenhis and his family’s fate was most uncertain. Obviously, the Doctormobilized all his energy to consolidate their state, political and financialalike. But the above letter also indicates that as opposed to Deacon’ssuspicion (1968), it was not he who was spying, but rather he whobecame the prey of the spies of Rome.Two years prior to this letter Dee had given a totally different ac-count of his audience with Rudolf. At that time he had still been opti-mistic about his future career as “Imperial Mathematicien” and gave avery vivid description of the choreography of auditions in the Emperor’sprivate chamber:September 3, 1584. Hereupon I went straight up to the Castle: and inthe Ritter-Stove or guard-chamber I stayed a little. In the mean spaceI sent Emericus to see what was of the clock: and the Chamberlain(Octavius Spinola) spied him out of the Emperor’s chamber window,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"260JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMand called him, who came up to me, and by that time was the Cham-berlain come out to me; and by Emericus he understood that I was theman the Emperor waited for.He came to me very courteously, hora tertia exacte a meridie, toldme of the Emperor’s desire to see me and to speak with me. So hereturned to the Emperor into the privy chamber, and came out againfor me, and led me by the skirt of the gown through the dining-chamber, into the privy-chamber, where the Emperor sat at a table,with a great chest and standish of silver before him, my Monas andletters by him, &c. I came toward him with due reverence of threecursies, who showed me a gracious and cheerful countenance. (Dee1998, 142)As we know, the audience brought rather bleak results; however, the lackof imperial grace was not enough to curb the Doctor’s ambitions.These, almost randomly selected examples corroborate my feelingthat Dee lived an almost schizophrenic double life in East-CentralEurope. The psychotic and visionary loner on the one hand can becontrasted with the vivid and exuberant scholar-magus who maintainedhis contacts and sought new acquaintances. One must be careful thenwhen trying to answer the previously posed questions: did East-CentralEurope gain anything from the Dee mission and did Dee and Kelly getanything in return?The balance is actually more even that it looks at first sight. Whileat home Dee collected books, organized a private academy, managedgeographical expeditions, and suggested a reform of the calendar, hedid little of this sort in Eastern Europe. He did not even practice theoccult art in that complex, esoteric-humanist form as he had previouslyat home. His message for Eastern Europe was a mystical, religiouslesson, but without the innovative dogmatics of the radical reformerswho temporarily camped in Poland or in Hungary (the Sozzinis,Palaeologus, or Francken). In fact, Dee was abhorred by the vistas ofsceptical anti-Trinitarianism.The Eastern European historian becomes most intrigued by learningabout Dee’s contacts with Christian Francken, the infamous heretic who,probably for the first time in European intellectual history, reached as faras systematic philosophical atheism.30 In July 1587, probably in Trebona,Dee received two books from Francken. He took them back to England(being probably one of the first intellectuals to import anti-Trinitarianismto Britain), but as we have seen, he sent them to the archbishop ofCanterbury to be theologically refuted (see above, p. 239)."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"261Dee and the Interpretive CommunityOne might say that Dee’s religious eclecticism converged with thedenomination of his patrons: at the Elizabethan court he appeared as anationalist Anglican, near the Catholic Stephen Bathory he confessed andtook the holy communion, in Habsburg Prague he also professed Ca-tholicism, writing that “Luther, Calvin wilfully, obstinately erring; thePope is not Antichrist; and Ecclesia nostra Mater” (Dee 1659, 411–12).On top of this interconfessionalist heterodoxy he developed a strongchiliasm, an inclination for Enochian prophecy with an apocalypticimagery. While John Dee of England had been a follower of Roger Baconand Trithemius, the wandering prophet of Eastern Europe is more anintellectual relative of the late Guillaume Postel, the similarly universalistFrancesco Pucci, or Bruno and Campanella, the enthusiasts. All this,however, had relatively little effect on the Polish or Hungarian intelligen-tsia who had more affinity for religious controversies than for philosophi-cal mysticism.This ambiguous, slightly disappointing picture emerges from the exter-nal sources as well. Dee’s name is not an important issue either in secretservice reports or in the correspondence of the papal nuncios; he is notmentioned in the royal annals of the Polish court after his audiences withKing Stephen, and he received only passing mentions in the correspon-dence of the outstanding scientist-humanists of the Prague imperial court,such as Crato von Kraftheim or Tadeásˇ Hájek (Hagecius) whose housesheltered the Doctor in the Bohemian capital (Dee 1659, 212).It seems that Dee received the most extensive treatment in the lettersexchanged between Hájek and his Silesian friend in Breslau (Wroc¬aw),the Hungarian-born humanist Andreas Dudith. Unfortunately Hájek’sletters are not extant, but we have Dudith’s answers whose two mentionsare of great interest. Dudith, who had hosted Philip Sidney in his Wroc¬awhome in 1574 and otherwise had various contacts with English politi-cians and scholars, wrote rather lengthily about the English Doctor onDecember 20, 1585, not long after he had relocated from Poland toPrague. In this letter Dudith mentioned Dee with great reverence andasked Hájek to inquire from the Doctor if he could recommend to hima resident mathematician to whom he was willing to offer a respectablesalary. Dudith also wrote to Pucci, the “Florentine patrician and noble-man” whom he seems also to have esteemed highly, and asked him thesame, that is, to suggest a mathematician to satisfy his personal needs.31There is no record whether along their several journeys betweenPrague and Cracow the Englishmen ever stopped in Wroc¬aw to meetDudith, whose esteem seems to have waned by 1587 when on January"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"262JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM3 he again mentioned Dee in his letter to Hájek. The reference reflectsa great deal of uncertainty and ends with a sarcastic remark: “I have hearda lot about the English all which seem perplexing and little credible tome. Since some people ascertain that he speaks with the angels, I do notknow whom to believe.”32 Then he mentions that apparently the spiritsreturned mere coal in lieu of the treasures Dee had collected for them,and even this coal burned into ashes.33The above quotations corroborate Shumaker’s wry remark: “Few of thepersons admitted to the séances were deeply impressed, and some werefrankly sceptical” (1982, 48). On the contrary, a more than enthusiasticremark can be found about Dee in the materials deriving from VáclavBudovec, noted Lutheran leader in Prague, also an intellectual quite sen-sitive to certain kinds of mysticism. As we know from Robert Evans, heknew Dee personally and in a later recollection remembered as follows:A learned and renowned Englishman whose name was Doctor Deecame to Prague to see the Emperor Rudolf II and was at first wellreceived by him; he predicted that a miraculous reformation wouldpresently come about in the Christian world and would prove the ruinnot only of the city of Constantinople but of Rome also. These predic-tions he did not cease to spread among the populace.34Recently Deborah Harkness commented on this passage, suggestingthat “Dee was not only intent merely on contacting angels, nor in keep-ing detailed diaries of those conversations. He was determined to com-municate and discuss his concerns about the natural world and its futurewith the angels, his associates in the conversations, and, as Budovecreminds us, with a broad popular audience” (1999, 11). There is noreason to have doubts about Dee’s ambition to spread his message to thelargest possible audience; however, Harkness neglects the fact that Budovec’saccount dates from 1616, a time when the Rosicrucian excitement andan upsurge of magical interest aggravated the Lutheran community allover Central Europe. His recollection of Dee and the Doctor’s impact onPrague twenty years earlier must be seen from this special vantage point.By 1616 Dee was long dead and his fame as a scholar startedtranssubstantiating into a legendary lore, the clear signs of which we findin seventeenth and eighteenth-century Central Europe. Let us start fromthe late 1580s, when Dee was staying in Trebona on the Roz ̆mberkestate. According to his private diary he lead a most active social life,regularly meeting with the Count Roz ̆mberk as well as numerous local"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"263Dee and the Interpretive Communityand international intellectuals, including an amazingly large numberof Englishmen.35As we know, the Roz ̆mberks, Vilém and Peter Vok, had splendid courtsand residences in Southern Bohemia, which were not only centers ofsignificant local power, but also places of learning and pilgrimage destina-tions for wandering humanists and scientists. In their castle of Krumlovthey accumulated a ten-thousand-volume library, one of the largest collec-tions in contemporary Central Europe. In neighboring Trebona an al-chemical laboratory was functioning for many years, and Vilém Roz ̆mberkwas as interested in Paracelsus and his work as was Laskithe Pole and theHungarian Batthyány. Vilém even employed humanist-alchemists to translateParacelsica into Czech, as several ornate manuscripts still testify in the StateArchives of Tr ̆ebon ̆ Castle and elsewhere (Evans 1973, 212–13).36The archives in Trebona have preserved a large body of complex cor-respondence between Vilém Roz ̆mberk, his managers, and many passersbywho were seeking patronage and/or refuge on his estates and in his labo-ratory.37 In this heap of material there is surprisingly little to be foundabout the activities of Dee and Kelly. Apart from a two-page manuscript,which seems to be a copy of some fragments of Dee’s diary from 1583through 1587,38 there is only one letter (from Doctor Carl Wideman toVilém Roz ̆mberk) that explicitly refers to Kelly’s alchemical experiments,283and there is no mention of Dee at all. As it turns out, Vilém—in coop-eration with Emperor Rudolf—had large-scale projects for not only labo-ratory alchemy but also for metallurgy and mining. Hence a great numberof experts were busy with various undertakings (Adam of Hradec, VáclavVr ̆esovic, Peter Hlavsa, Daniel Prandtner, the above mentioned CarlWideman, Melchior Horning, and others—see Evans 1973, 216), but Deemust have had only a marginal share in this work, if any. Although hevisited Kaiser Rudolf Stadt (Rudolfov), the center of the new metallurgicalexperiments, in December 1588 (Dee 1998, 238), his only purpose therewas to oversee the making of his coaches, being prepared for the returnjourney to England that started on March 11, 1589.My suggestion is that while Dee and Kelly seem to have had littleimpact on their Eastern European contemporaries, they left behind animage that soon grew into inflated legends. Evans mentions many house-holds from the Czech lands where manuscripts of their works have beenpreserved, and there is also one seventeenth-century example from Hun-gary.40 Furthermore, I have already mentioned Budovec’s story that de-picts Dee as an important prophet-philosopher of the late Renaissance,almost as somebody who was preparing the way for the Rosicrucians."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"264JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThis Rosicrucian image may have been grounded when Dee stayedin Bremen on his return journey and met the mystical adept of Ham-burg, Heinrich Khunrath. Perhaps the English Doctor suggested that hiscolleague visit Vilém Roz ̆mberk because in 1591 he was Vilém’s courtphysician and by 1598 he received Rudolf ’s special copyright privilegesfor his works (Evans 1973, 214; Szulakowska 2000, 79). From BremenDee also corresponded with his old patron and friend, Moritz, theLandgrave of Hesse-Kassel, one of the chief patrons of the occult arts incontemporary Germany.I argue that the transformation of natural philosophy and scienceduring the late Renaissance also produced an epistemological vacuumthat temporarily was filled by various magical applications. This explainsthe great popularity, even prestige, of magic during the sixteenth and thefirst half of the seventeenth centuries, and also the readiness of patronsto support such experiments. The development of such complex andintellectually ambitious alchemical patronage was most characteristic ofthe German kulturkreis of Central Europe, as seen in Emperor Rudolf ’sPrague or in some of the German princely courts which all had strongconnections with their local universities and always had a supply of learnedenthusiasts (Heidelberg, Kassel, Weikersheim, Wolfenbüttel, Helmstedt).41Dee evidently wanted to capitalize on this trend and market his ownmysticism in such a cultural milieu. Alternatively, his dignified stature,when remembered a decade or so later, could be associated with the aimsof the Rosicrucians.The Dee type of intellectuals with their occult and chiliastic visionswere primarily loners; however, their attitude logically culminated in theemergence of secret societies, working for the reformation of the world.Although according to the historical sources Dee never had any directlink with any organized secret society, let alone the Rosicrucians, he hasbeen associated with them both in modern scholarship as well as bywriters in the early modern period. Frances Yates argued that his Monasand his activities in Central Europe fostered the genesis of the Rosicrucianmanifestos published in and around 1616.42 As is known, these docu-ments—growing out of a distinctively Lutheran-Pietist ideological foun-dation—promised the general reformation of the world through the aidof a secret society, the members of which would pursue politics, science,and religion for the purpose of saving mankind.Some researchers of Rosicrucianism have found the archetype of thisprogram in the Naometria of a certain Simon Studion, which was aprophetic-apocalyptic work, propagating the alliance of the Lily (France),"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"265Dee and the Interpretive Communitythe Lion (England), and the Nymph (the Palatinate of Württenberg) oncommon religious grounds (Lutheran Evangelicalism).43 According to Yatesthe tone of the work is similar to that of Dee’s prophecies in the East-Central European angelic conferences, and she suggested that Studionand Dee’s patrons in this region formed a homogeneous intellectual circle.44The forging of a homogeneous intellectual society was undoubtedly agross simplification by Yates, and Urszula Szulakowska’s recent book of-fers very good evidence concerning just how divided even the closestLutheran mystical circles were if one scrutinizes such previously undistin-guished Pietists as Andreae, Arndt, Khunrath, or their enthusiast idol,Valentin Weigel (2000, 82–86; 145–52).It is also true, on the other hand, that Dee indeed had personalcontacts with a number of the patrons and scholars associated with thegenesis of Rosicrucianism, and the following facts perhaps corroboratewhat I have just suggested, namely that in the 1610s Dee’s image mayhave been used in a symbolic sense when the intellectual pedigree ofRosicrucianism had to be assembled.1. It is a fact that Dee indeed dreamed of a general religious andpolitical reform of a unified Europe—which he of course imag-ined to be united under a British banner just as Postel had earlierpropagated a French-coordinated continental integration. It isalso noteworthy that Dee in his Monas hieroglyphica offered amystical-scientific method for the enhancement of the humanintellect by which the reforms could be accomplished.2. Undoubtedly, the Monas excercised quite a strong impact on cer-tain trends of seventeenth-century intellectual history. It was re-published in Lazarus Zetzner’s famous compendium, the Theatrumchemicum (1602 and subsequent editions), which was used in allcorners of the Continent. Even Carlos Gilly, a scholar definitelysceptical about Dee’s direct influence on the Rosicrucians, ad-mits that Dee’s diagram of the hieroglyphic monad could be oneof the archetypes of Adam Haslmayr’s “character cabalisticus”included in the German Rosicrucian’s Consideratio Figurae Ergonet Parergon Fratrum RC (unpublished manuscript of 1626; cf.Gilly 1995, 35). Gilly also sees a possible cross-influence be-tween Dee’s monad and Philippus à Gabella’s alchemistical trea-tise on vitriol, published in his Secretoris philosophiae consideratiobrevis, nunc primum una cum Confessione Fraternitatis RC in lucem"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"266JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMedita (Kassel, 1615; cf. Gilly 1995, 73). Finally, Gilly concludesas follows: “Dee, with many others, belonged to that alchemist-hermeticist tradition from which the alchemists and theosophistsof the seventeenth century learnt a lot” (1995, 74).3. According to the above, we should reconsider the fact that—al-though Rosicrucianism cannot be equated with Christian cabala(as Yates 1972, 89, superficially suggested)—a mystical naturalphilosophy based on number symbolism, such as that of Dee,strongly featured in the thinking of the Rosicrucians, too. As weknow, also from Gilly, in 1619 an eccentric enthusiast Philip Ziegler,turned up in Nurnberg and called himself the king of theRosicrucians (“Origines Philippus von Gottes Gnaden erwählterund gekrönter König von Jerusalem, Siloh, Joseph und David, derBrüder des Rosenkreutzes Oberster und unüberwindlichster Zepterdes Königs in Sion”). This Ziegler in a later, strongly numerologi-cal work mentioned Dee and called him—as a member of theRosicrucians—his spiritual brother (“Joh. Dee Londinensis Anglusde Fratribus RC;” cf. Gilly 1988, 83).Dee’s impact on the seventeenth-century German courtswas recently reassessed by Bruce T. Moran (1991, 92–100),who introduced his chapter on “The Rosicrucian Connection”as follows:There existed a natural language which linked the books of nature,man, and Scripture. Attempts at its reconstruction marked theefforts of Renaissance Neoplatonists like Pico, Ficino, Reuchlinand Agrippa, and defined many parts of Paracelsian literature aswell. Among them all, however, it was John Dee’s Monashieroglyphica which became the best known exercise in pursuingthe real meaning of nature by means of a natural creative lan-guage—in this case a language reduced to a universal symbolreflecting the unity of the world. Dee’s influence, may, in fact,have been partially responsible for one of the most interestingepisodes in the search for a natural language. In this instance, theidea of a language of nature filtered through traditions of Christiancabalism and Paracelsian prophetic mysticism to appear finally inthe early seventeenth century in treatises describing the brother-hood of the Rosy Cross. (1991, 92–93)4. Finally, one should recall how easily Rosicrucianism found its wayback to England. In part it was due to the works of another"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"267Dee and the Interpretive Communityloner, Robert Fludd, which nevertheless had their influence inGermany as well as on the early scientific societies of England.Fludd’s views promoted the English translations of the Rosicrucianmanifestos in the mid-seventeenth century by Thomas Vaughan.45The most recent data concerning Dee’s “Rosicrucianism” derive fromthe research of Roberts and Watson and Urszula Szulakowska. Accordingto these, in 1618 “ex bibliopolio Frobenio” in Hamburg Roger Bacon’sEpistolae de secretis operibus et naturae et de nullitate magiae was publishedin John Dee’s edition. The editorial work had of course been done de-cades earlier, as I have hinted above (cf. p. 194). The German publishermust have acquired Dee’s old manuscript and was careful enough to printthe text together with the English Doctor’s notes and marginalia. Thetitle page straightforwardly identifies Dee as the editor of the text: “Op-era Johannis Dee Londinensis e pluribus castigata [. . .] cum notisquibusdam partim ipsius Johannis Dee, partim edentis” (Roberts andWatson 1990, 62). The preface is dedicated to the Rosicrucian Brothersand sums up the complicated textual history: the edition is based on the1594 Oxford edition that they could obtain only by borrowing the pri-vate copy of an acquaintance.But who could be the editor(s) and whose copy were they using?According to Roberts and Watson, the editors must have been the assis-tants of Dee’s last years, John Pontois and Patrick Saunders. The formermany times visited Germany and Silesia and had contacts with theParacelsist Johannes Montanus in Strigau whose name is mentioned inthe preface. Saunders, in 1619 wrote an inscription in the album amicorumof a Rosicrucian from Lübeck, Joachim Morsius. That year Morsius trav-eled in England and his album also preserves the inscriptions of BenJonson and William Camden, together with Cornelius Drebbel, chiefmechanician of James I, and János Bánfihunyadi who under the name ofJohannes Banfi Hunyades was a researcher in London’s Gresham Col-lege.46 According to the hypothesis put forward by Roberts and Watson,Morsius visited Saunders while he was in London because he wanted toget acquainted with the disciple of the famous Doctor Dee.47William Sherman continued to trace this line; he observed that inthe Hamburg edition (for the title page see Figure 8.1) not only wereDee’s marginalia carefully printed, but these were acknowledged by theDoctor’s monogram. According to Sherman “the reproduction of hisreading notes implies that Dee was also valued as an interpreter” (Sherman1995, 43). Interestingly, although Frances Yates does not seem to have"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"268JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMnoticed this Hamburg edition, she was aware of Gabriel Naudé’s refer-ence to Dee’s Bacon. According to the French mathematician andRosicrucian writer,If we had the book which John Dee, citizen of London and a verylearned philosopher and mathematician, says that he composed indefence of Roger Bacon in which he shows that all that is said abouthis marvellous works should be ascribed to nature and mathematics,rather than to a commerce with demons, which he never had, I protestthat I would speak no more about him. . . . (Yates 1972, 110)48Another interesting reference to Dee from the time of risingRosicrucianism was unearthed by Urszula Szulakowska. While readingKhunrath, that ambiguous and mysterious Pietist-enthusiast, she noticedthat the German alchemical theologian considered Dee one of his prin-cipal mentors. In the dedication of his Quaestiones Tres Per-Utiles (Leipzig,1607), he referred to Dee as “Londinensem [. . .] hoc est, SapientiaeSincerioris Gazophylacem magnum; Angliae Hermetem” (SzulakowskaFIGURE 8.1Epistolae Fratris Rogerii Baconis, De secretis [. . .] naturae [. . .] Ioanni Dee ad sensumintegrum restituta (Hamburg: Frobenius, 1618), title page. Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenbüttel[107 Phys. /4/]."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"269Dee and the Interpretive Community2000, 79). The same terms are repeated in Khunrath’s AmphitheatrumAeternae Sapientiae—an esoteric work that Evans called “the most gran-diose even of that magniloquent age” (1973, 214).Tracing the changing reputation of Dee, Sherman’s remark seems tobe a good interim conclusion: “Less than twenty years after his death,Dee’s textual remains were generating competing portraits—the cabalistmagician and the Baconian mathematician—in relation to a group whoseown affiliations to occult philosophy and mainstream science were beingcontested” (1995, 43).Although Dee’s image was greatly damaged in England by Casaubon’s1659 publication of the True and Faithful Relations . . ., this book inEnglish had no major effect on the Continent where, especially in Cen-tral Europe, Dee’s mythical reputation continued to grow (sometimesthrough curious mutations) well into the eighteenth century. A goodexample is Hungary, where in 1774 the first systematic chronicler ofHungarian science, István Weszprémi, remembered a grandiose programrelated to Dee’s visit in 1563. As he wrote,[In 1584] Laski invited Kelly and Dee to Hungary, who were pleasedto accept the offer, especially Dee who had had practised his craft ofalchemy in Hungary already earlier in 1563 for a long time and tothe great admiration of a number of people. [. . .] The chemicalcollege was opened in Laski’s castle in 1584 where the landlord re-ceived a thorough instruction in the chemical arts and he tortured themineral world day and night with fire, however, at the end flunkedas it usually happens. . . .49The quality of this unfounded hearsay can be compared to the seven-teenth-century English rumors about Dee’s raising the dead and othersuch nonsense;50 its contents are somewhat surprisingly different. Whileit was not uncommon in contemporary Hungary that decent scholarsand humanists were accused of sorcery and the black arts,51 it is surpris-ing that Dee, whose angel magic in fact had some kinship with thosecharges, did not inspire any Faustian legends in this part of Europe. Itseems that here the image associated with the writer of the Monashieroglyphica continued to be more appealing and this may be the reasonwhy in eighteenth-century Vienna a hermetic treatise on exaltatio couldbe published under his name.In 1794 the following curious work appeared in the Habsburg capi-tal:Das Büchlein der Venus, which was included in a larger work offering"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"270JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMold magical literature for the lovers of secret sciences (Handschriften fürFreunde geheimer Wissenschaften, Wien: Blumauer). The “Book of Venus,”a manual of invocations for calling forth various spirits, listed John Deeas author. Its Latin original was relatively widespread in Germany: thereare three surviving manuscripts, one in Erlangen, one in Munich, andone in the Warburg Library in London.52 The origin of this text is ob-scure, but there is no likelihood of Dee’s authorship. Rather it seems tobe a German work, reaching back to the tradition of ceremonial magicdescribed by Kieckheffer (1997). As Jörg Martin (1989) suggests, it mayhave happened that the text became associated with the name of Dee inthe seventeenth century, due to the reputation established during hisEast-Central European travels.It is equally interesting to ask why this work was translated intoGerman in the Vienna of the Enlightenment, and why it was importantfor the editor to emphasize Dee’s authorship. Perhaps it was because theantiquarian works of Weszprémi and others revived the interest in theEnglish Doctor, or perhaps because the intellectual atmosphere that pro-duced Mozart’s The Magic Flute was ripe for such publications. Regard-less, it is clear that the interpretive community never ceased to be inter-ested in Dee, partly because his obscure, admirable, and disquieting figurecontinued to have an attracting, frightening appeal of the Other for thepopulace, partly because his desire for the unattainable exaltatio was alltoo well-known to most people, even centuries after his death.These seventeenth- and eighteenth-century examples of Dee’s recep-tion provide the missing links that connect the mystical truths behind hishieroglyphic diagram and the burning anxieties of the angelic conferenceswith the romantic revival of the nineteenth century and with those modernnovels, paintings, films, and operas that I mentioned in the introduction.MERIC CASAUBON AND THEPOLITICS OF INTERPRETATIONMagician, Heretic, and WitchJohn Dee’s intentions in his magical operations and the angelic conver-sations were entirely pious: he was striving toward a mystical union withGod. Looking at Dee’s reception, however, we see that neither his con-temporaries nor following generations were unanimous in appreciatingsuch piety. On the contrary, in his life and later, he was recurrently"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"271Dee and the Interpretive Communitylabeled a conjuror, a witch, or an arch-heretic. He wrote several apologiesin which he compared himself to such victims, as Socrates, Apuleius ofMegara, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, or Johannes Trithemius.53 In factthese charges crop up paradigmatically in the intellectual and social at-mosphere of the early modern period and the representatives of themagical-hermetic tradition received them almost without exception. Tounderstand the nature of these charges and the mechanism of powerpolitics behind them, one has to look at the relationship between pious,white magic as opposed to wicked, diabolical or black sorcery, and theirconnections to witchcraft and heresy.It is interesting to note that the actual proofs and documents of blackmagic are extremely scarce. The philosophers interested in magic alwaysemphasized their devout aspirations, which were primarily to praise theCreator by demonstrating a human dignity that would corroborate thenotion of man having been created after the true image of God. The mosteminent way to prove this was to accomplish exaltatio, the magus elevatinghimself into the divine spheres, to the side of the Supreme Being.Significantly, most of the information about black magic, such asharmful operations, devil worship, or pacts with the infernal forces, de-rives either from—more or rather less well-founded—denunciations, frompublic or legal accusations, or from literary works. Most notable of thelatter type is the Faust legend and the various theatrical and narrativefictions based on it. I have never come across an authentic first-personaccount (let alone in the most private diary form) from the early modernperiod admitting the intentional practice of black magical operations. Onthe other hand, none of the great magi who did their best to manifesttheir most pious aims with magic could escape charges of sorcery, heresy,even witchcraft.Cornelius Agrippa, for example, was often accused of black magic—and a famous black magical handbook was even written under his name(“The Fourth Book” of Agrippa’s De Occulta Philosophia, which was alsoattributed to Pietro d’ Abano).54 He was not able to waive the suspicions,in spite of his repeated efforts to prove that his magic was totally dependenton religion. For example, in Chapter 3:36, titled “De homine, quomodocreatus ad imaginem Dei,” Agrippa explicated the doctrine of the magicdignity of man in a strictly Christian context: “Nothwithstanding the trueimage of God is his Word. The wisdom, life, light and truth existing byhimself, of which image man’s soul is the image . . .” (Agrippa 1997, 579).Paracelsus, one of Dee’s important models, received similar chargesfrom even such a learned man as Conrad Gessner, the encyclopedist:"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"272JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISM“Once a pupil of Theophrastus and his private assistant reported strangetales concerning the latter’s intercourse with demons . . .” (quoted byJung 1983, 119). One wonders what the motivation was for those oftenextreme charges and if they showed any characteristic pattern at all. Myanswer to the latter question is “yes,” and I suggest that the overallproblem can and should be researched with the help of historical anthro-pology and historical social psychology.As it may have become clear by now, magic, even in its most pious,Christian form, represented a sort of heterodoxy that posed a challenge,the threat of subversion against the existing ideological system. The de-fensive nature of orthodoxy is excellently described by J. Neusner: “aconvention, well-established in a variety of studies, is that one group’sholy man is another group’s magician: ‘what I do is a miracle, but whatyou do is magic’ ” (1989, 4–5).As I see it, the orthodox defense system included the following steps.First, the threatening challenge had to be clearly and unhesitantly labeled assomething very dangerous in order that it could be separated and isolatedfrom the healthy body of the community. The labels had to be reminiscentof a most contageous epidemic so that no one would even think of experi-menting with it. As such, the most severely regarded threats were heresy onthe one hand (usually identified with Arianism or Anabaptism), and witch-craft on the other. Since witchcraft was usually treated as a subgenre of blackmagic, the circle was closed; the feedback to magic provided that the whitemagician could be labeled as a black sorcerer.Second, the isolated phenomenon had to be either radically expurgatedor radically understood and so familiarized. After this could follow itsneutralization and, if necessary, appropriation. During this process the la-bels and charges were used symbolically rather than literally. This technol-ogy was to assure the community that no wicked diabolism could beultimately effective against God’s merciful providence. So if the peoplewere careful and watchful enough, the danger, after all, was not that great.In the following subchapter I shall trace the social and ideologicalmechanisms through which the interpretive community—representedby Dee’s posthumous publisher, the Späthumanist Meric Casaubon—tried to understand (and thus familiarize and neutralize) Dee’s encoun-ter with the Other. His strategy led to the identification of the EnglishDoctor as someone who had become possessed. That is, he came torepresent the Other as something to be frightened of, something thathad to be separated and isolated from the community. This was accom-plished by labeling him a “heretic” and a “witch”; however, the follow-"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"273Dee and the Interpretive Communitying step was to demystify his magic by explaining his angelic confer-ences as delusion and madness.To understand the procedure I shall refer to the mechanisms of“inventing” madness in order to contain and appropriate transgression—as they have been described by Michel Foucault (Madness and Civiliza-tion) and Stephen Greenblatt (Renaissance Self-Fashioning). Especiallypertinent to my argument is the way the latter demonstrates the handlingof the Other through self-fashioning within the contexts of early modernsocieties. His inventory of these “handling mechanisms” offers a goodintroduction to this topic:—Self-fashioning involves submission to an absolute power or author-ity situated at least partially outside the self—God, a sacred book, aninstitution such as church, court, colonial or military administration.—Self-fashioning is achieved in relation to something perceived as alien,strange, or hostile. This threatening Other—heretic, savage, witch,adulteress, traitor, Antichrist—must be discovered or invented in orderto be attacked and destroyed.—The alien is percieved by the authority either as that which is un-formed or chaotic (the absence of order) or that which is false ornegative (the demonic parody of order). Since accounts of the formertend inevitably to organize and thematize it, the chaotic constantlyslides into the demonic, and consequently the alien is always con-structed as a distorted image of the authority.—One man’s authority is another man’s alien.—When one authority or alien is destroyed, another takes its place.—There is always more than one authority and more than one alien inexistence at a given time.—Self-fashioning is always, though not exclusively, in language.—The power generated to attack the alien in the name of the authorityis produced in excess and threatens the authority it sets out to defend.Hence [this process] always involves some experience of threat, someundermining, some loss of self. (Greenblatt 1980, 9)Meric Casaubon’s lengthy Preface clearly illustrates the above postu-lated phases of isolation, familiarization, and neutralization of the danger;represented by Dee.Casaubon (1599–1671), son of Isaac Casaubon one of RenaissanceEurope’s great scholars, was himself an erudite scholar whose criticisms of"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"274JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMthe new science inspired Thomas Sprat’s History of the Royal Society. Oneof his most famous works is Of Credulity and Incredulity in Things Natu-ral, Civil, and Divine (1668), in which he examines arguments for andagainst a belief in witches and other occult phenomena, sharing the viewthat Christians must believe in them or else depart with all beliefs in thesupernatural. His views must have been formed by his encounter withthe diaries of John Dee.Casaubon’s PoliticsCasaubon says in the Preface that his patron invited him to publishDoctor Dee’s newly recovered magical journals with the intention ofsaving Christian souls from such delusions and since “it is very possiblethat every Reader will not at the first be so well able of himself to makethat good use of this sad Story as is aimed at, my chiefest aim in thisPreface is to help such” (Dee 1659, Preface, *255).Casaubon, above all, posed two questions in connection with theangelic conversations: 1. if spirits existed at all; and 2. if yes, what sortof spirits were Dee’s instructors. After having given a humanist-like sur-vey of classical and contemporary literature on apparitions and spirits,Casaubon concluded that it was undoubtedly demons that appeared beforethe Doctor and his medium, Kelly. His rhetoric is remarkable: in theinitial passages he writes in a sceptical-ironical tone, but later he leads thereader step-by-step in the belief concerning the existence of spirits: “Icannot satisfie my self how any Learned man, sober and rational, canentertain such an opinion that there be no Divels nor Spirits, &c.” (*18).At the same time—citing Luther and William Perkins—he elaboratelyasserts that the spirits having appeared to Dee could not be but wickedones, in fact devils. And his judgment is that the person who associatedhimself with devils of necessity becomes a witch. He describes this act as“pawning his Soul [to Satan], such is the power of this kind of Spiritualdelusion” (*34).From the theme of witchcraft he turns to the question of heresy andidentifies Dee’s delusion with Anabaptism. In the Preface he several timesmentions that Dee’s personal characteristics, such as his enthusiasm andphilosophical independence, facilitated the swelling of heresy in his mind:Some men come into the world with Cabalistical Brains; their heads arefull of mysteries; they see nothing, they read nothing, but their brain"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"275Dee and the Interpretive Communityis on work to pick somewhat out of it that is not ordinary. [. . .] Reasonand Sense that other men go by, they think the acorns that the oldworld fed upon; fools and children may be content with them but theysee into things by another Light. They commonly give good respectunto the Scriptures (till they come to profest Anabaptists) because theybelieve them the Word of God and not of men; but they reserve untothemselves the Interpretation....(*23–24)So far goes the identification and isolation of the alien Other. Thecase, having now been identified with the most dangerous supernaturaltransgressions, seems frightening enough to discourage imitation. Butwhat is hyperbolically inflated on the one hand has to be familiarized anddemystified on the other in order to corroborate the feeling in the com-munity that the threat is controllable. It can be contained. Casaubonreaches this aim by rationalizing and explaining Dee’s case on theologicalas well as on psychological grounds and in this respect his argumentationis no less remarkable.He definitely rules out that the spiritual diaries could be produced byimposture or fraud:We intended thereby to justifie what is here printed against any suspitionof forgery. [. . .] By Truth and Sincerity, intending not only Dr. Dee’sfidelity in relating what he himself believed, but also the reality of thosethings that he speaks of, according to his relation: his only (but greatand dreadful) error being, that he mistook false lying Spirits for Angelsof Light, the Divel of Hell for the God of Heaven. (*26)On the contrary, Casaubon attributed the Doctor’s enthusiasm to a co-lossal epistemological misinterpretation, a mistake resulting from thedeficiency of his character, but by no means being simple fantasy:We will easily grant that a distempered brain may see, yea, and hearstrange things, and entertain them with all possible confidence, as realthings, and yet all but fancy, without any real sound or Apparition. Butthese sights and Apparitions that Dr. Dee gives here an account, arequite another nature; [. . .] I say, and not without the intervention andoperation of Spirits, as will easily appear to any man by the particulars.[. . .] These things could not be the operation of a distempered Fancy,will be a sufficient evidence to any rational man. (*26)After having confirmed the reality of the spiritual conversations, Casaubonapplies a rather flat, demystifying, and certainly firmly orthodox critique"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"276JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMof Dee’s attitude toward his apparitions. First, he discredits the reality ofthe program of Renaissance neoplatonist magi concerning the exaltatio ofman: “it is against all Reason as well as Religion to believe that a creatureso much inferior to God, by nature as man is, should see every thing asHe seeth and think as He thinks” (*32). Second, he identifies the desireforexaltatio with simple pride, hybris: “his own deceitful heart it may besuggested unto him, that he might glorify God; but certainly, that himselfmight become a glorious man in the world, and be admired” (*32). Third,he treats this hubris as a very natural thing, not to be surprised at: “ifPride and Curiosity were enough to undoe our first Parent [. . .] shouldwe wonder if it had the same event in Dr. Dee, though otherwise, as hedoth appear to us, innocent, and well qualified” (*32).This argumentation was perfectly in line with Casaubon’s widerphilosophical outlook, which represented learned but orthodoxconservativism identifying sadducism (the denial of spirits) and atheismas the main threatening drives against the church, traditional values, and“good learning.” In his other works, such as the Treatise ConcerningEnthusiasme (1655) and Of Credulity and Incredulity (1670), he alwaysclearly pinpointed the enemies: atheism and scepticism on the one handand enthusiasm and pride on the other.56 Dee obviously fell in the lattercategory, together with his compatriot, the also “enthusiastic” RobertFludd, of whom Casaubon wrote as follows:Robert Fludd, with whom such professions of zeal for the glory of Godare very frequent and ordinary: and to that end to set out his glory inits greatest lustre, doth propose unto us the consideration of the Phi-losophers Stone, applying all or most mysteries of the Scripture to it;so that in very truth, his zeal was more for the Philosophers Stone, thenGod; or the Philosophers Stone, a God of his own making, for whichhe was so zealous.57It is characteristic that Casaubon never questioned either Dee’s highintellectual abilities or his good intentions; however, he also argued thatDee’s mistakes were comparable to the faults of witches, magicians, andheretics, especially the Anabaptist enthusiasts. Through their example, hedemonstrates that a strong trust in prayer is “of much more danger anddelusion, than many do believe” (*53). Casaubon’s motivations in judg-ing Dee became obvious from the Preface: from within an orthodoxcommunity—let it be the community of humanists, university scholars,or believers of a set of religious dogmas—noncomformist behavior and"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"277Dee and the Interpretive Communitydissenting ways of thinking cannot be classified positively. His argumen-tation is a fine blend of correct psychological observations, sound philo-logical analyses, and a clearly ideologically motivated appropriation of theunorthodox Other. All this becomes crystal clear when he rounds out hisPreface by giving the reasons why he decided to publish these documentsand explains the moral teaching of John Dee’s example:Several good uses that may be made of this book:The first is against Atheists, and such as do not believe that therebe any Divels or Spirits. [. . .] I do not know what can be more con-vincing than this sad story. This is a great point and a great ground ofReligion: for if there be Spirits indeed, so wicked and malicious, sostudious and so industrious, to delude men, and to do mischief, whichis their end, all which is so fully represented in this Relation, thencertainly must it follow, that there is a great overruling Power, thattakes care of the Earth and of the Inhabitants of it. [. . .] Englandmight have been over-run with Anabaptism long before this: God bethanked that it was not then, and God keep it from still. . . . (*50)In the last place all men may take warning by this example, howthey put themselves out of the protection of the Almighty God, eitherby presumptuous unlawful wishes, or by seeking not unto Divels only,directly (which Dr. Dee certainly never did, but abhorred the thoughtof it in his heart) but unto them that was next relation unto Divels, asWitches, Wizzardes, Conjurers, Astrologers, Fortune-tellers, and thelike, yea, all books of that subject, which I doubt [= fear], were a greatoccasion of Dr. Dee’s delusion. (*54)Interestingly enough, Casaubon did not deal in depth with the roleof Kelly in the angelic conferences and this has long intrigued scholars.The first historian who offered a serious analysis of The True & FaithfulRelations was Wayne Shumaker and he came to the conclusion that “Kellywas evidently not a man worthy of reliance” (1982, 26). In spite of therefined argumentation of his study, Shumaker treated Kelly all along asa simple fraud and interpreted his relationship with Dee as a ruthlessmanipulator to his victim.58 His analysis overlooked the possibility ofthat psychological and micro-social situation that Geoffrey James ex-pounded: “Kelly was forced to stay with Dee because the money that thedoctor gave him supported Kelly’s wife and brother.

He also pointed outmistakes the supernatural informants were making. One of the mostoften quoted episodes is when after a session devoted to some geographi-cal questions, Kellycame speedily out of his study, and brought in his hand one volumeof Cornelius Agrippa his works, and in one chapter of that book heread the names of countries and provinces collected out of Ptolemaeus.Whereupon he inferred that our spiritual instructors were coseners togive us a description of the world, taken out of other books: andtherefore he would have no more to do with them.

Whereby you may perceive how yourreason is marvellously confounded by your wilful fantasy: for so muchas, wherein you would find fault in our spiritual instructors’ doings,therein they have done that which I requested them, as appeareth: andthat to the intent of known countries we might understand whichangels had the government. [. . .] This is too gross your error. (ibid.)Again, it is rather difficult to understand Kelly’s motivations with theproposal of the infamous matrimonial cross-matching on the basis of dis-honest cheating (cf. Dee 1659, *20–21. [new numbering]). Eventually hecaused more trouble for himself than whatever he gained from the action.I believe that the extraordinary and strained psychotic symbiosis inwhich the two men and their families spent their days invites a complexcombination of arguments. We cannot help feeling that Kelly either musthave believed, at least to some extent, in the prophecies he was commu-nicating, or, if he pretended and invented, he successfully deceived him-self as well. In an atmosphere in which, as Shumaker characterizes, “im-ages and phrases stored up from the Bible, the often overheated pulpitoratory of the period, occultist reading, and dream imagery” (1982, 31)constituted the sources of every day as well as scholarly discourse, Dee’snaive logic and Kelly’s behavior are equally perplexing, but at the sametime understandable."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"279Dee and the Interpretive CommunityTo comprehend this milieu, it is enough to remember the extraordi-nary situation when Edward Alleyn, leading actor of the Elizabethan age,once so perfectly identified himself with Doctor Faustus that at the ap-pearance of the stage devils he stopped the performance and togetherwith the whole audience spent the rest of the evening in fervent prayers.60kAt this point I would like to draw some conclusions from what I haveso far said concerning the hermeneutical practices of the interpretivecommunity in relation to Dee’s magic. To begin with, it seems thatagainst all the efforts of Renaissance magi and/or modern historians, westill do not possess any guaranteed means to distinguish clearly betweenhigh and low/popular magic, or between white and black practices. Be-cause of the theological implications, even the most pious magic can beinterpreted as heresy and hubris inspired by Satan. Dee’s angel magic isa good example of how complex and ambiguous is this phenomenon ofintellectual history.Dee was often unjustly accused of sorcery and Anabaptist dissent. Atthe same time, he indeed was an interconfessionalist, and the fact thatsometimes even Kelly thought the angels to be malevolent and deceivingshows that certain principles, intentions, and practices are indistinguish-able. In the previous chapters, I have repeatedly arrived at the recognitionthat magic is in itself contradictory and paradoxical in nature—considerthe tensions behind Pico’s relation to astrology, Agrippa’s recognition ofSimon Magus, Paracelsus’ Faustian rebellion, or Dee’s realization of theambiguity of catoptrics: from “optical science” to scrying.The greatest merit of Casaubon’s Preface is that while he tried todescribe in an exact, scholarly way the possible motivations and psycho-logical conditions of Dee, quite intuitively he discovered that mechanismthat made occultism one of the important catalyzers of Western culture.His characterization of Dee’s “enthusiasm” (quoted above) highlightedthe drive for seeking “The Light” and the ambition “to reserve untothemselves the Interpretation . . .” (emphasis mine, Preface, *24). Seekingthe light and practicing freedom of interpretation are those things thatproduce the most elevating and at the same time the most dangerousthings. Becausethat for divers years he had been earnest unto God in prayer for Wis-dom; that is as he interprets himself, That he might understand thesecrets of Nature that had not been revealed unto men hitherto; to the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"280JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMend, as he professeth, and his own deceitful heart it may be suggestedunto him, That he might glorify God; but certainly, that himself mightbecome a glorious man in the world. . . . (Preface, *32)Casaubon’s words reveal that double perspective through which wecannot help seeing the shadows of some dark forces behind even the purestambitions of the white magus. On the other hand, as in the case of Marlowe’sFaustus, even in the worst manifestations of hubris and fatal decisions, wecan behold the charisma of heroic individualism and tragic greatness.In looking at Dee’s thought, works, ideology, and symbolic expression,I argue that those historians who offer their interpretation in relation toother systems of culture and civilization (such as science or religion), nomatter how many useful details they discover and explain, still miss theultimate target. These efforts unavoidably end up with setting up typologies,separating white and black magic, identifying them with period styles, andfinally forging grand narratives. And on the way they fail to address thefascinating question: what provides that inner dynamism of magic that itcould be invariably compelling, independent of epoch, even after the greatScientific Revolution of the seventeenth century?I have been trying to approach magic by always concentrating on itsparadoxical character, the vehicle of which has been the program ofexaltatio, which balanced ambition, power politics, and self-fashioningagainst an openness of mind and yearning for the highest and the infinite.Such an approach to magic leads us to our present age where it hasinfluenced fields from cultural anthropology (parapsychology, modernmysticism, New Age and Enochian magic), through philosophy (RudolfSteiner, René Guénon, Manly P. Hall), to great modern artists who havesought inspiration from magic in a variety of ways (W. B. Yeats, MarcelDuchamps, Vassily Kandinsky, Leonora Carrington, Derek Jarman,Umberto Eco) and whose works invite ever new interpretations."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"9Conclusion:Dee and Renaissance SymbolismUntil now I have been trying to inquire into the ideology of John Deethrough the works that he absorbed (“input”) and through the texts inwhich he gave a symbolic expression to the “radicall truthes” he wasseeking (“output”). I have also looked at his reception by examining thereactions of the interpretive community. In the last passages of theprevious chapter I mentioned the long and complex tradition of magic,which is still lively and productive in our own age, inspiring new worksas well as interpretations. As I hinted in the introduction, Dee’s worksand his symbolically elaborated figure has been present in all culturalepochs since the seventeenth century, and his image continues to be anintellectual inspiration as well as a literary and artistic theme. He maybe recognized in such classical theatrical heroes as Shakespeare’s Prosperoor Ben Jonson’s Subtle, and he returns in twentieth-century novels(Meyrink’s The Angel of the West Window, Eco’s Foucault’s Pendulum, andAckroyd’s The House of Doctor Dee), plays, paintings, even operas. Todiscuss all this would require another book, and I am sure somebodyis already working on it.As an epilogue to this monograph, I would like to look at a singlestanza of a sixteenth-century poetical work, the literary symbolism ofwhich shows a crucial parallel to that program Dee tried to express in hismystical-natural philosophy. I am thinking of a microcosmic unit ofEdmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, a particular poetical vision that Isee as an image twinned with the hieroglyphic monad. If I interpretedDee’s cosmogram as a condensed mandalaic symbol of all transcendental281"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"282JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMexperience, so I could call Spenser’s “House of Alma” an artistic experi-ment attempting to speak the lingua adamica.It is interesting to notice that while in the time of the great Renais-sance epistemological paradigm shift the natural scientist still spoke alanguage heavily mixed with rhetorical elements and allegorical narration,poetry, the natural medium of myths, fables, and allegories in turn de-veloped an ambition to include scientific theses, and cosmic schemes.This is what happens in Spenser’s much disputed cryptic stanza describ-ing the House of Alma. As is well known, Spenser’s epic poem is anallegorical work, meaning that each and all of its elements have to betranslated from picture language to a plane of abstract meanings. Almaherself is the soul, and her house is the body, a place of harmony andtemperance. (The episode takes place in Book Two, which is devoted tothe virtue of Temperance.) This allegorical castle is described by Spenseras follows:The frame thereof seemd partly circulare,And part triangulare, O worke diuine;The two the first and last proportions are,The one imperfect, mortall, foeminine;Th’ other immortall, perfect, masculine,And twixt them both a quadrate was the base,Proportioned equally by seven and nine;Nine was the circle set in heauens place,All which compacted made a goodly diapase.(FQ II.ix.22; quoted from Spenser 1980, 251)This stanza is surrounded by a fairly transparent allegorical narrationconcerning Goddess Alma’s harmonious and self-controlled nature. How-ever, the design of the very house has perplexed readers since it was firstwritten. Some suggest that the description refers simply to the basicproportions and dimensions of the human body; others argue that whatwe have here is a revelatory word-emblem that refers to the dualism ofthe macro- and microcosms, the correspondences of the Great Chain ofBeing, and that, similarly to Dee’s monad, it contains mystical numbersymbolism based on the neoplatonic philosophy. In both cases this sym-bolism can be boiled down to the contrast of One and Two, referring tothis existence and the Other, in terms of a threatening abyss that thesemystical cosmograms can bridge in a revelatory way.The mystical, neoplatonic interpretation was established by Sir KenelmDigby (1603–1665), probably the best of Spenser’s early critics. In 1628"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"283Dee and Renaissance Symbolismhe wrote a letter to Sir Edward Stradling (published in 1643) in whichhe tried to document what he had stated in another of his treatises:[Spenser] had a solide and deepe insight in Theologie, Philosophy (es-pecially the Platonike) and the Mathematicall sciences, and in whatothers depend of these three. [. . .] Tis evident that the Authors inten-tion in this Canto is to describe the bodie of a man inform’d with arationall soul, and in prosecution of that designe he sets down particu-larly the severall parts of the one and of the other—as they make oneperfect compound.1In his detailed analysis Digby spoke about the four elements, thethree Paracelsian qualities, the nine angelic hierarchies, the seven planets,concluding that of all God’s works Man is the noblest and the mostperfect—he is a little world, and himself a god (“O worke diuine!”). ThusSpenser can be found as “a constant disciple of Platoes School” as hespeaks about the perfect harmony of the created universe (cf. the phrase“diapase” referring to the eight-scale musical system, the diapaison), dem-onstrating this harmony in the human microcosm, for “in Nature thereis not to be found a more compleat and more exact Concordance of allparts, than that which is betweene the compaction and conjunction ofthe Body and Soul of Man” (Spenser 1971, 157).If we compare the two hermeneutical traditions, that is, the onewhich identifies Alma’s House simply with the physical dimensions of thehuman body and the one which associates it with the Platonic universal-ism, we see that they are not exclusive to each other. The commondenominator between the two concepts is the recognition of certain dia-lectical opposites in this created world (body/soul, man/cosmos, mutabil-ity/eternity); however, they still claim the unity of the whole system. Thisunity is provided by the unifying plan of the Creator and can be com-prehended through the overall present analogies, and correspondences ofthe universe. As Spenser’s contemporary Sir Richard Barckley put intowords in his A Discourse of the Felicitie of Man (1598),The great God of Nature hath tyed together all his creations with somemeane things that agree and participate with the extremities, and hathcomposed the intelligible, ethereall, and elementarie world, by indis-soluble meanes and boundes [. . .] between brute beastes, and those ofa spirituall essence and understanding, which are the Angels, he hathplaced man, which combineth heauen and this elementarie world.(quoted by Patrides 1973, 435)"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"284JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMThe above description as well as Spenser’s stanza naturally call tomind the much discussed concept of the premodern world model aboutthe macro- and microcosms which have been often explained by themetaphors “the scale of nature” or “the Great Chain of Being” (see theintroduction of this book).This metaphorical-allegorical world picture was well known in Eliza-bethan England and could serve various ideological standpoints. Themacrocosm-microcosm analogy could function as a didactic allegory tryingto explain the structure of the universe in a simplified model. One shouldread Henry Peachem’s emblem in his Minerva Brittana (1610) this way:Heare what’s the reason why a man we callA little world? and what the wisest mentBy this new name? two lights CelestiallAre in his head, as in the Element:Eke as the wearied Sunne at night is spent,So seemeth but the life of man a day,At morn hee’s borne, at night he flits away.[. . .]Of Earth, Fire,Water, Man thus framed is,Of Elements the threefold Qualities.(Quoted from Hollander and Kermode 1973;cf. Figure 2.6)In a more complicated approach Sir Walter Raleigh in his The His-tory of the World (1614) used a fairly conventional biblical frameworkwhen discussing the relationship between man and cosmos:Man, thus compounded and formed by God, was an abstract or model,or brief story of the universal, in whom God concluded the creationand work of the world, and whom he made the last and most excellentof his creatures, being internally endued with a divine understanding.[. . .] And whereas God created three sorts of living natures, to wit,angelical, rational, and brutal; giving to angels an intellectual, and tobeasts a sensual nature, he vouchsafed unto man both the intellectualof angels, the sensitive of beasts, and the proper rational belongingunto man, and therefore saith Gregory Nazianzen: ‘Man is the bondand chain which tieth together both natures.’ And because in the littleframe of man’s body there is a representation of the universal, and (byallusion) a kind of participation of all the parts thereof, therefore wasman called microcosmos, or the little world.

As I havementioned above, Ernst Cassirer (1963) considered this notion thegreatest intellectual innovation of the Renaissance as opposed to theMiddle Ages. I have already analyzed Ficino’s views and Pico’s orationon this theme, but even in such a popular version of neoplatonism likeCastiglione’s The Courtier (1528), the thesis is clear. Sir Thomas Hoby’stranslation appeared in 1561 and exercised considerable influence onthe poetry of Spenser. A quotation from Book Four:Think now of the shape of man, which may be called a little world, inwhom every parcel of his body is seen to be necessarily framed by artand not by hap, and then the form altogether most beautiful. (Abrams1986, 1011)[. . .] Man of nature endowed with reason, placed, as it were, in themiddle between these two extremities, may, through his choice inclin-ing to sense or reaching to understanding, come nigh to the coveting,sometime of the one,sometime of the other part. (1007)One of the more learned exponents of this view among Spenser’scontemporaries was John Dee. As we have seen, he accepted theneoplatonic view of man’s special faculties and flexible nature and alsoincorporated into his system the possibility of magical operations. In theMathematical Preface Dee described “anthropographie,” the study of man’smicrocosm as one of the highest degrees among the “artes mathematicall”:[Anthropographie] is an Art restored, and of my preferment to yourSeruice. I pray you, thinke of it, as of one of the chief pointes, ofHuman knowledge.

(Dee 1975, c.iii)To strengthen his standpoint, Dee referred to Pythagoras, to Durer’sDe symmetriae humani corporis, to Vitruvius’s anthropomorphic theory ofarchitecture, and, last but not least, to Agrippa’s De occulta philosophia.From his argumentation it is quite clear that he understood the macrocosm-microcosm analogy not merely as a metaphor which explains certain cor-respondences in nature, but rather as a mystical symbol which in itselfcontains something of the ultimate essence of the world and its creator.As we have also seen, to grasp this metaphysical essence, Dee himselfconstructed his magical-mystical emblem, the hieroglyphic monad. Bythe early seventeenth-century such magical emblems and diagrams be-came fairly common in hermetic and alchemical literature throughoutthe process which—due to the development of printing and book pub-lishing—can be termed as the period of the popularization of secretsciences. The large visual dictionaries of late Renaissance magic, such asthe works of Robert Fludd and Athanasius Kircher, could rely on Dee’smonad as an important forerunner of their hermetic semiotics.The previously reviewed examples demonstrate three ways of inter-pretation of the macrocosm-microcosm analogy: the didactic-conventional,the religious-mystical, and the philosophical-metaphysical. Spenser’s de-scription of the House of Alma, no doubt, belongs to the last category.The question, however, remains: how deeply philosophical was it, andhow essential was this emblematic image in the context of the poet’s artand world picture? To answer this question let me digress to what E. H.Gombrich wrote about the complementary classes of symbolic images,with a special reference to the ontological and epistemological questionsof Renaissance iconography.According to his crucial study (Gombrich 1972, 123–99), there arethree sources of images, namely: experience (representation of an object),convention (representation of an idea—allegory), and expression (privatesymbolism—the artist’s conscious or unconscious mind). The first case issimple and unambiguous: the representation is imitation, the copy ofsomething already physically existing—it is nothing other than primaryreception, or sensation. The second two classes contain images which arethe products of the intellect; they are transformed or transmitted repre-sentations of physical and/or mental sensations.According to their function, these mental images can be ascribed tothree traditions. As Gombrich says, “Our attitude toward the image is"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"287Dee and Renaissance Symbolismbound up with our whole idea about the universe” (125). The threetraditions are the following: didactic (metaphor, the Aristotelian tradi-tion),revelative (symbolic-intuitive, the Platonic tradition), magical (pow-erful esoteric signs, the hermetic tradition).The didactic metaphor is the expression of an idea, the product ofintellectual activity. Its function is decorative and entertaining, it has toimprove the poverty of the language, and it possesses a certain explana-tory, illustrative power in order to make discursive speech clearer. ThePlatonic tradition, however, attributed a different power to the symbolicimage. For the neoplatonist the image was a revelation of somethinghigher, that is, a metaphysical truth which could not be expressed bydiscursive speech. Consequently the image was not considered the prod-uct of rational thinking, but of a momentary intuition which all of asudden could enlighten the observer.This process is not unlike the technique of the gnostic philosopherwho tried to capture Divine Wisdom in visual revelations. Of the gnostic’sknowledge Plotinus said, “It must be not thought that in the IntelligibleWorld the gods and the blessed see propositions: everything expressed thereis a beautiful image” (Enneads 5.8, quoted by Gombrich 1972, 158).2Spenser himself tried to create such a Platonic-revelatory imagery inhisFowre Hymnes, when describing earthly and heavenly beauty and love.His allegory of Wisdom-Sophia runs as follows:There in his bosome Sapience doth sit,The soueraine dearling of the Deity,Clad like a Queene in royall robes, most fitFor so great powre and peerelesse maiesty.(“An Hymne of Heavenly Beavtie”;Fowre Hymnes, IV. 183–86;quoted from Spenser 1970, 598)An extreme case of the revelatory image is the esoteric sign which hasmagic power. It does not only symbolize the intuitively perceptible truthbut it is a representation of the idea (deity or demon) itself. This is howthe medals of zodiacal decans have healing power in Ficino’s De vitacoelitus comparanda, this is how Faustus can compel Mephistophilis toappear in his magic circle, and this is how Dee and Kelly could call angelsby the help of their “great seal.” Or as the seventeenth-century popularimagination suggested, they could even raise the dead practicing theirabominable art in cemeteries (Figures 9.1 and 9.2).3"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"288JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMSpenser’s description of Alma’s House is undoubtedly a symbolicimage, in fact a word-emblem, as defined by Peter Daly (1998, 83–113),but the question remains whether it is the expression, the revelation, orthe representation of its idea. In my opinion this problem cannot besolved by trying to assume the author’s perspective, as neither Spenser’sactual readings not his intellectual preoccupations, even less his authorialintention, can be reconstructed in its entire authenticity from our present-day situation. Gombrich classified symbolic images according to the in-FIGURE 9.1 Conjuring the Devil.

But we can approach the problem from theother direction, from the reader’s viewpoint. And then we shall ask ifAlma’s Castle can be interpreted as a didactic or rather as a revelatoryimage; to be more precise, we can ask if the wider context of Spenser’sart allows this or that type of interpretation.I am inclined to say that Alma’s Castle is a revelatory word-emblem,under the influence of the hermetic way of thinking and, what is more,is inspired perhaps directly by Dee’s monad. Before the actual interpre-tation, I intend to argue that Spenser’s artistic world and what we knowabout the author’s intellectual horizon do not exclude the possibility ofsuch a reading. And this is the border not to be crossed, the boundarylimiting the ambition of the literary critic. Because every great work ofart has such a paradoxical nature that it needs commentary, still nocommentary can fully exhaust the work’s meaning.It is a commonplace in English literary history to label Spenser as aneoplatonist,4 but scholars also have found more specific and more radi-cal occult elements in his works. Fowler (1964) demonstrated the pres-ence of an esoteric number symbolism throughout The Faerie Queene,and Røstvig (1969) used Francesco Giorgi’s De harmonia mundi totius tointerpret the eclogues of The Shepheards Calender. Spenser’s biographyalso contains elements which hint at the sources through which he couldhave developed an interest in the occult arts. His acquaintance with Deeis only indirectly corroborated from the correspondence of Gabriel Harvey,5but his friendship with Sidney is well known, as is known Sidney’s vari-ous contacts with the Doctor. It has also been suggested that behind thephilosophy of the Areopagus—among others—the ideas of Dee might bedetected (French 1972, 135–59).Hopper (1940, 966) and Fowler (1964, 265–84) suggested that Alma’sHouse should be read in relation to Dee’s hieroglyphic monad. I amready to join this view, adding that although no direct formal correspon-dences can be found between the monad and Alma’s House, the idea ofthe anthropomorphic castle can easily be seen as a verbally constructed,concise esoterical image.Fowler’s analysis of Spenser’s number symbolism is too complicated,requiring such complex mathematical apparatus that the literary criticbecomes sceptical about whether even a poeta doctus could afford tohandle them while in the process of constructing a large, several thou-sand line poem. I believe that when interpreting poetry, it is moreconvenient to look for the framework or reminiscences of certain philo-sophical ideas than the scientific tenets themselves. I agree with Fowler(and Kenelm Digby) who claim that Spenser was a poet interested in and"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"290JOHN DEE’S OCCULTISMinfluenced by the hermetic philosophy, but I also think that one shoulddifferentiate between the doctrines of a system of thought and the prod-uct of artistic creation.I have found it very instructive that Frances Yates established an intel-lectual link between the threefold structure of Alma’s emblematic houseand the threefold world model of Giorgi and Agrippa (1979, 97–98).However, unlike in her usually imaginative cross-interpretations of textsand illustrations, in this case she said: “The actual figure which Spenser ishere describing is difficult to determine.” Following her path I am goingto add to the existing interpretations a few illuminating iconographicalparallels (for a more detailed version of this reading, see Szªnyi 1984).In the 1578 French edition of Giorgi’s Harmonia mundi one finds anexplanatory diagram, showing the three spheres of the world—angelical,celestial, elemental—arranged into three circles. The large circles accom-modate smaller circles, of which each further three are separated from eachother by altogether four horizontal lines. Thus each world-sphere is asso-ciated with the numbers 1, 3 (and 9), and 4—corresponding to the geometricfigures of circle, triangle, and square.6 One finds similar numerological-geometrical speculations in Charles de Bouelles’ already cited work (see, forexample, Figure 2.2), an imaginatively illustrated book that was availableto English intellectuals and was in Dee’s library (R&W 311).If we try to arrange geometrically Spenser’s description—“partly cir-cular, part triangular, twixt them both a quadrat was the base”—thegreatest problem is caused by the word twixt which, according to TheOxford Dictionary of English Etymology, has a double meaning: “between”or “in the midst of two,” “in the center of the two.” When saying “partlycircular, part triangular,” Spenser also does not specify which is insideand which is outside. Taking all this into consideration, we can constructat least three different arrangements:a)b)The frame thereof seemed patly circulare,And part triangulare, O worke diuine;And twixt them both a quadraqte was the base . . .c)"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"291Dee and Renaissance SymbolismAll three figures can be associated with some features of the organicworld model (correspondences, analogies, number symbolism) and allthree have numerous representations in early modern occult iconography.According to the (a) version the divine mind (triangle = Holy Trinity)embraces the whole of the world which consists of celestial (circle =planets and the Zodiac) and elemental (square = the four elements andqualities) spheres. Their proportions are seven and nine, the formermeaning the sum of heavenly and earthly things (3 + 4), the latter themultiplication of the Holy Ternary. The House of Temperance thus in-cludes equally the whole universe and the human microcosm becauseman’s body consists of the four elements and the four body liquids (hu-mors). The compound of these constitutes his nature and psychology.One should also remember the notion that the human organism isneither independent of the workings of nature nor of the cosmos. Itdepends on the influences of the stars and the planets which transmit theheavenly energies. The human organs are the receptors of those celestialinfluences and thus can be symbolized by a circle. The triangle may standfor the human intellect, as an image of God. As Augustinus wrote,“Numerus ternarius ad animam pertinet, quaternarius ad corpus.” Ac-cording to Plato there are three souls, the vegetative, the sensitive, andthe rational—the same as three persons in the Trinity.A seventeenth-century engraving from Tobias Schütz’s Harmoniamacrocosmi cum microcosmi enlightens the above. The human figure(microcosm) is standing in a circle of the universe. He is chained to afemale figure above him who represents Nature but another chain leadsup to the Will of God. The picture is bordered by the portraits ofTrismegistus and Paracelsus, associated with the geometrical shapes ofquadrat and triangle, also referring to Paracelsus’ revolution in changingthe four elements for the three essentials.7 The four elements and theParacelsian qualities are represented by a square and a triangle on the titlepage of a 1582 Basel edition of Paracelsus. These elements are, howeverencircled by the celestial sphere, thus illustrating arrangement (c) forwhich we shall see further examples below (see Figure 9.3). The ideologyof this diagram is encapsuled in the aphorism: “Omnia ab uno—adunam omnia.”The (b) reading is a variant of the previous interpretation, except thathere the geometrical shapes are not inside each other, rather on top ofone another. Thus this arrangement is more analogous to the Great Chainof Being or Giorgi’s diagram.

[. . .] By the Triangular Figure he very aptlydesignes the body: as for the Circle is of all other figures the mostperfect and most capatious: so the Triangle is the most imperfect, andincludes least space. It is the first and lowest of all figures. [. . .] MansBody hath all the properties of imperfect matter. And—as the femininesex is imperfect and receives perfection from the masculine: so doth theBody from the Soul, which to it is in lieu of a male. (quoted in Spenser1971, 152–55)Here Digby alludes to the lines “The one imperfect, mortall, foeminine;/ Th’ other immortall, perfect, masculine,” and according to his interpre-tation the perfect soul contains the imperfect body which consists of thefour elements. In the occult-esoterical tradition we can easily find icono-graphical representations of this arrangement, too. While the former twoFIGURE 9.5Mundus and Intellectus in Charles de Bouelles’ symbolic geometry. Liber de intellectu(Paris, 1510), 86v.

Figure 9.6). The drawing shows the Tree of Lifewith a venomous toad among the roots while at the top of the tree,among red and white roses, there is a crown, a symbol of unity. Alongsidethe circles and triangles we find triples significant for both alchemy andspiritual transmutation: white—black—red, Jupiter—Mars—Venus,water—earth—fire, spirit—soul—body, heaven—sun—male, earth—moon—female.

(Dee 1570, ☞.ii)Maier’s emblem has been interpreted by many. Jung primarily ana-lyzed its alchemical contents (1980, 126), while Heninger pointed out itscosmic significance (1977, 189–90). According to the latter the geomet-ric transmutation reflects the harmony as well as the tension between ideaand realization. The same dichotomy was expressed by Robert Fludd,too. On his esoteric diagram the two circles and the inserted trianglebetween them represents on the one hand how God contains the idea ofthe world and on the other the perfect, harmonious relationship betweenGod and the world (Figure 9.8).The basis of all these concepts and, furthermore, that of the wholeoccult world picture, was a Platonic dualism postulating a divide betweenthe perfect, eternal ideas and the changing, mutable material realm. Ac-cording to the platonists, humans live in a world which is always in theprocess of becoming something; still it has no absolute existence. In thisconstant change the program of exaltatio could provide some fair prospect.I cannot describe this perspective better than Heninger has already done:Nevertheless, this constant change can itself be a source of hope. Per-haps it conceals a pattern, a cosmic scheme, a sacred plan, and theconstant change is the efficient means whereby the divine will is real-ized. Perhaps the objects of this world are arranged hierarchically andFIGURE 9.8 The idea of the world in God. Robert Fludd, Utriusque cosmi . . . historia (Oppenheim,1617–1619), 1:20.

Thereis even the optimistic hope that man, placed midway on the scalaintellectualis, will ascend to consort with superior creatures, with saintsand angels, rather than descending to grovel with beasts, and he willfulfill the claim of Genesis that he is created in the image of the deity.”(1977, 190–91)This hope nurtured the idea of the Great Chain of Being and thesacred narrative of the Genesis gave a goal to humankind, which hadalways been among the thoughts of mystical philosophers and whichbecame openly searched for from the time of the Renaissance. This wasthe program that inspired Spenser to compose the poetical Alma’s Houseand this urged Doctor Dee to fashion the hieroglyphic monad.From this perspective it becomes negligible if we read Alma’s Houseaccording to the (a), (b), or (c) variants. More important will be, how-ever, to realize that the poet was bound neither by the disciplinary rigorof philosophers nor by the logic of rational and discursive thinking. Inhis artistic freedom he could most efficiently express the paradox natureof dualism, the dichotomy in unity which is most manifest in the natureof man. Let us remember that the Canto describing Alma’s House beginswith the following lines:Of all Gods workes, which do this world adorne,There is no one more faire and excellent,Then mans body both for powre and forme,Whiles it is kept in sober gouernment;But none then it, more fowle and indecent,Distempered through misrule and passions bace:It growes a Monster, and incontinentDoth loose his dignitie and natiue grace.Behold, who list, both one and other in this place.(FQ II.ix.1)This recognition drives the monumental engine of The Faerie Queene,from the first lines to the Mutability Cantoes. I would argue that thispoetical strength and insight keeps the poem among the greatly appealingtreasures of our culture even today. We still value and use this poem inspite of the fact that its ideological basis has been eroded while thepedant or “enthusiastic” exponents of this ideology—the doctors andphilosophers—have also been forgotten or, at best, reduced to the subjectmatter of doctoral dissertations written on “strangely neglected topics.”10"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"299Dee and Renaissance SymbolismJohn Dee seems to be a spectacular exception. Although his works, oneby one, have been disproved of being cornerstones of early modern scienceor intellectual history, his personality, his thought, and his visions continueto invite scholarly interpretations and artistic deliberations. It seems thathis meticulous and painstaking self-fashioning has been so successful thatit has much outlived the person whose advancement it was to serve.kI hope to have convincingly shown that cultural symbolization inextrica-bly intertwined with the occult philosophy not only until the time of theScientific Revolution but that it still keeps on to being active. I also hopethat John Dee has well served to demonstrate the workings of intellectualsyncretism so characteristic for the epistemological techniques of manyearly modern Europeans. Since these techniques have not disappearedeven after the Cartesian turn, we ought to examine the history of esoterismwith the best scholarly means at our disposal.At the conclusion of this book, I remind my reader once again thatwhile until recently, magically-minded intellectuals like John Dee wereexamined from the perspective of science history, today we should ratherbe inclined to assess them in their own right, as representatives of anintegral and alternative system of thought.

PRINCIPLES AND DEMARCATIONS1.David Fenton was kind enough to supply me with the following list of contem-porary works featuring John Dee the Magus: Simon Rees’s The Devil’s Looking Glass(1985); Ian Sinclair’s parapsychological guidebook to London Lights Out for Territory:Nine Excursions in the Secret History of London (1997); Stephen Lowe’s play The Alchemi-cal Wedding; the opera by John Harle and David Pountney Angel Magick; Hana MariaPravda’s filmscript and Derek Jarman’s films (Angelic Conversations,Jubilee) as well asmany of Jarman’s paintings.2. Cf. the historiographical summary in Malcolm B. Hamilton, The Sociology ofReligion: Theoretical and Comparative Perspectives (London: Routledge, 1994), chapter 2.3. Among the various trends of postmodern critique against historicism in culturaland literary theory, I have been influenced by the early Foucault, primarily The Order ofThings: An Archeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Vintage, 1973); Clifford Geertz’sinterpretive anthropology in The Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973)andLocal Knowledge (New York: Basic Books, 1983); and Hayden White’s highly chal-lenging approach to the literary-rhetorical engines of historical discourse in Metahistory:The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe (Baltimore: Johns HopkinsUniversity Press, 1973), Tropics of Discourse: Essays in Cultural Criticism (Baltimore: JohnsHopkins, 1978), and The Content of the Form (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1987). Beyondthese works, a few influential contributions in literary criticism should be mentioned,such as Frank Lentricchia’s After the New Criticism and Stephen Greenblatt’s RenaissanceSelf-Fashioning (both by the University of Chicago Press, 1980). These works sharpenedmy attention to follow the debate about new historicism over the past fifteen years, andwhat I found problematic in this “subjective materialist” approach (as I call it) to thetheory of interpretation, I tried to correct from the works of the new hermeneuticists(Gadamer, Ricoeur, Jauss, Iser). No matter how deeply influenced I have become by post-structuralism, I am still deeply indebted to the great generation of intellectual and arthistorians who belonged to the Warburg school, such as Gombrich, Kristeller, Panofsky,Walker, Wind, and Frances Yates. Works representing different approaches in the historyof science will be referred to at appropriate points of my discussion.4.

Less comprehensive but detailed surveys about the various parts of hiscareer can be found in the significant body of scholarly literature dealing with diverseaspects of his work.5.

The medieval contexts have recently been explored by Stephen Clucas in his articlesmapping Dee’s interest in the manuscript literature of the Solomonic art (1998; 200?).7. A typical example of this sort or argumentation can be found in J. L. Heilbronn’sintroductory essay to the Propaedeumata Aphoristica (Dee 1978, 12). Lynn Thorndike’sopinion is exceptional for the period of its composition: “[Dee’s] attempted experimentswith angels were in accord with his attributing greater operations to soul than body andwith his semi-spiritual view of nature” (1924–1958, 6: 392).8.

There has been a continuous scholarly debate about the use of the term popular.By employing the term underground, I refer to a mixed register of culture which waspracticed by intellectuals, often déclassée, expelled clerics, and rebel scholars who were notcontent with dealing only with canonical materials and often became attracted to ideasand practices of spurious origin.

Kieckheffer’s expression, “clerical underworld” (1989,151ff.), or William Eamon who speaks about an “intellectual proletariat” in his Scienceand the Secrets of Nature: Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture (Princeton:Princeton University Press, 1994), 69.36.

Frances Yates (1964, 140–46) and the Warburg scholars (cf. Secret 1985, 157–58) of course emphasized the Neoplatonic infuence on his work. Recent Dee scholars,such as Clulee (1988, 123, 127) put the stress on the medieval heritage. A new mono-graph that aims at balancing the two extremes is Brann 1999.

Geber (perhaps the Arab Abu abdullah Jaber ben Hayyam), was supposed to bean eighth- or nineth-century alchemist. His most famous work in Latin translation,Summa perfectionis magisterii, was very popular throughout the Middle Ages and theRenaissance (cf. Berthelot 1893; Stillmann 1960, 176–81, 276–86).17. This “Fourth Book” was published in English in the seventeenth century. Itscontents are discussed with extensive quotations in Waite 1961, 77–89, 324–25.18. Dee in fact possessed several different copies of De occulta philosophia: besidethe authoritative 1550 Basel edition (R&W 742), he had the very rare editio princeps of1531 (R&W 1271) and the 1559 Marburg edition that also contained the Fourth Book(R&W 743).19.

The idea of Mannerism as an independent stylistic period was put forward by theart historian Max Dvorak (“Greco and Mannerism,” 1920). One of the important inspi-rations for studying Mannerism came from the Hungarian-born cultural historian ArnoldHauser; see his The Social History of Art (1951; Book One, Chapters 5–7; in Hauser 1985,97–172) and his monumental The Origins of Modern Art and Literature: The Developmentof Mannerism since the Crisis of the Renaissance (1964, English edition, Hauser 1986).

I have used the 1530 Antwerp edition of De incertitudine . .. and its 1575English translation. As for the comparison between De occulta philosophia and Deincertitudine, my reading has been greatly influenced by Keefer 1988.23. The modernized quotation is from Keefer 1988, 634. Here Keefer notes on therelationship between Agrippa’s “intellectus passibilis” and Ficino’s terminology when hestates that gods are immortal and active, men mortal and passive, while demons areimmortal but passive (cf. In convivium platonis de amore, 6.3; Ficino 1944, 80, 185).24. “But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear” (Matthew13:16) and “Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away” (2Corinthians 3:16).25. Cf. Wisdom 7:17–21, as quoted in my introductory chapter.26. See also Yates 1964, 131. As opposed to this hypothesis, Nauert 1965, 106–11,pointed out that official church authorities and the theologians of the Sorbonne imme-diately condemned De incertitudine . . ., a fact which leads Keefer (1988, 618) to rule outthe possibility that Agrippa wrote his work with the intention to provide a safety valvefor the tensions around him."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"312NOTES TO CHAPTER 527.

According to Trithemius, who personally met the historical Faustus, this char-latan wrote the name of Simon on his visiting card (Brann 1999, 64–65). Frank Baron,writing about the historical Faustus, also mentions Melanchton, and how he associatedFaustus with Simon Magus (1978, 75, 86).33. For an extensive treatment of this phenomenon, see Fehér 1995.34. Examples and interpretations abound in most standard handbooks of sciencehistory. The full-value inclusion of magic in the history of science took place in the 1960sand 1970s, and details were discussed in the so-called hermeticism debate referred to above.35. For the influence of Paracelsus on Western intellectual thought, see Debus 1965and 1977; Pagel 1958; Webster 1976 and 1982.36. In order to orientate in the huge and complex literature on Paracelsus, cf. thebibliographies of Sudhoff 1958 [1527–1893]; Weimann 1963 [1932–1960] and Dilg-Frank 1984 [1961–1982], and Peter Dilg and Hartmut Rudolph’s recent collection ofessays on the new directions of Paracelsus research (1993). The collected works of Paracelsuswere first time published by Johannes Huser in ten volumes (Paracelsus 1589–1591); thedefinitive twenty-volume critical edition was prepared by Karl Sudhoff, WilhelmMatthiessen, and Kurt Goldammer (Paracelsus 1922–1925; 1923; 1928–1933; 1955–1973). Throughout this chapter, wherever possible, I shall quote the following Englishtranslations of Paracelsus: 1894, 1951, and 1975. Among the voluminous literature onParacelsus I have profited from the fundamental studies of Jung (1942), Walter Pagel(1958; 1985) and Will-Erich Peuckert (1976); also from Ambrose 1992; Boas 1962;Goldammer 1953, 1967, and 1979; Kämmerer 1971; Koyré 1971, Ch. 3; Müller-Jahncke1985; Webster 1982; and Weeks 1997.

Recent studies on the Astronomia magna are John D. North, “Macrocosm andMicrocosm in Paracelsus” (in Dilg and Rudolph 1995, 41-58); Ute Gause’s “Aspekte dertheologischen Anthropologie des Paracelsus” (in Dilg and Rudolph 1995, 59–70); Wolf-Dieter Müller-Jahncke, “Makrokosmos und Mikrokosmos bei Paracelsus” (in Zimmermann1995, 59–66); and Hartmut Rudolph, “Prädestination und ‘seliges Leben.’ Ein Beitragzur Verhältnisbestimmung von Weltbild und Theologie bei Paracelsus” (in Zimmermann1995, 85–98).41. It would be profitable to compare Paracelsus’ theology to the spiritual wing ofthe early Reformation. He admittedly was for a while under the influence of the reformedmystic, Sebastian Franck, but the idea of mystical rebirth was not alien from CasparSchwenckfeld and Valentin Weigel, either. The necessity of further research in this direc-tion has been pointed out to me by Bálint Keseru ́ ́. To my knowledge the only extensivecomparative study among the mentioned mystics is Koyré 1971. See also the recentarticle of Horst Pfefferl, “Die Rezeption des paracelsischen Schrifttums bei ValentinWeigel” (in Dilg and Rudolph 1995, 151–68).42. I am employing here the standard notation referring to Paracelsus’ SämtlicheWe r k e. The Roman numerals indicate the section (I=Medizinische, naturwissenschaftlicheund philosophische Schriften; II=Die theologischen und religionsphilosophischen Schriften), theArabic numerals refer to the volume and page number in that section (cf. Paracelsus1922–1925, 1923, 1928–1933, 1955–1973).43. In his seventeenth-century portraits, Paracelsus is usually shown holding a sword,on the handle of which the word Azoth is inscribed. According to some broadsheets,Azoth was an elixir vitae, a secret medicine Paracelsus had discovered and kept in thehandle of his sword. The term appears already in early alchemistical literature (Zozimos,Olympiadorus) and is called by the name of Hermes, or spiritus animatus, the philosophers’sstone. Others think it refers to the beginning and the end: Zeus and Theos (Jacobi inParacelsus 1951, 248).44. “Of Characters” (Paracelsus 1975, 43–44).45. In the terminology of Paracelsus the sidereal body (or ethereal body, astrum) isthe refined upper layer of the physical body which consists of air and fire and receivesthe occult influences of the stars. The sidereal body provides man with sidereal knowl-edge, that is, the knowledge of occult sympathies (cf. Jacobi in Paracelsus 1951, 262; andMüller-Jahncke 1985, 76–77).46. Cf.

In respectof the prisca theologia one should think again of the spiritualistic trends of the GermanReformation. I have already mentioned Sebastian Franck who had some influence onParacelsus (Dee also had several works by Franck—R&W 1175, 2180–82), while bothof them contributed to the mystical philosophy of Valentin Weigel (1533–88) whointerestingly fused Reformation theology and esoteric Neoplatonism. In his Der güldenGriff (printed only in 1613) he claimed that for the microcosmic man, the churchwould be unnecessary because he himself was the temple. “Every man can be a deifiedChrist if he leaves the old Adam behind,” he added.

The quoted text is from the 1651 English publication of Deocculta . .. where it concludes the paratext “The Life of Henry Cornelius Agrippa, Knight”(Agrippa 1997, xlix).54. Biblical scholarship defines the apocrypha as sacred books whose belonging tothe canon is uncertain or has been finally denied by the authorities; pseudepigraphadenotes the body of works which were falsely attributed to ideal figures featured in theOld and New Testaments. Modern scholarship states that by now the terms do not implyanything spurious; the use of the term is simply inherited from earlier scholars, that is,traditional (cf. Charlesworth 1983, xxiv–vi).55.

As Keefer notes: “Some Renaissancehumanists did find a principle of coherence in the Hermetica, and that this principle wasa religious one, is suggested by Lodovico Lazzarelli: ‘Christianus ego sum [. . .] ethermeticum simul esse non pudet’ ” (1988, 625).60. Surprisingly, Postel has been discussed in Dee scholarship as little as Paracelsus.Peter French briefly mentioned him; Yates and Heilbronn (1978) neglected him entirely.Clulee did not pay much attention to him either although, as we shall soon observe, hedid highlight a few crucial connections. Harkness (1999) often mentions Postel in passingbut this is only the beginning of the full recognition of his influence on Dee’s thought.61.

These trends appeared no earlier than the late sixteenth century, as an offspringof the cross-fertilization of neoaristotelism and some versions of the radical Reformation,for example, anti-Trinitarianism.2. “Her Majestie very gratiously took me to her service, at Whitehall before herCoronation . . .” (Dee 1851, 12). “Before her Majesties coronation I wrote at large [. . .]what in my judgement the ancient astrologers would determine of the election day ofsuch a tyme, as was appointed for her Majestie to be crowned, A. 1558” (21).3.

As I am going to show, the case is not so simple.Recently Hans Peterse has also argued and called for a historiographical revaluation(1995, 5–7).49. Peterse clearly makes this differentiation (1995, 2n. 3) and Elisheva Carlebach—as opposed to earlier historians—also uses the term anti-Judaism (in Reuchlin 2000, 20).50. These were also neglected by another, much quoted article by Gundersheimer1963. He, too, decided that Erasmus was simply an anti-Semite.51.

The manuscript of Naometria can be found in Stuttgart, WürttenbergLandesbibliothek, Cod. theol. 4.23.34. It is reviewed by Yates 1972, 33–34; its relationto the Rosicrucians had been asserted by A. E. Waite, Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross(London, 1924), 639 ff. The idea goes back to an eighteenth-century theologian ofWürttenberg, Ludwig Melchior Fischlin (cf. Gilly 1995, 21). Gilly himself considersStudion’s Naometria not a direct source of the Rosicrucian manifestos, rather as a typo-logically related work belonging to the literature of late sixteenth-century chiliasmus(Gilly 1988, 70 ff.).44. Yates mentioned the following persons who, in some way, could indeed beassociated with each other: Christian of Anhalt, the mastermind of the Elector PalatineFrederick; the elector himself; Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel; Vilém Roz ̆mberk; anda number of humanists-scholars already mentioned: Andreae, Bruno, Croll, Dee, andKhunrath (1972, 30–40). Since the publication of The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, mostof Dame Frances’ propositions have been rejected by historians as artificially forged links;however, my analysis will suggest that the supposition of certain intellectual influencesperhaps is not so fantastic and unfounded.325Notes to Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"45.

A detailed analysis of the Treatise Concerning Enthusiasme is offered by Heyd,“Be Sober and Reasonable” (1995), in the chapter “Meric Casaubon and Henry Moore”(72–92).
