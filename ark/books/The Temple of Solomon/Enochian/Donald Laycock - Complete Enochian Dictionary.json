Perhaps both schools ofthought are correct. Where angels, demons, and spirits areconcerned, I personally believe it's all in your headlou justhave no idea how big your head is. Or, to quote my pseudepi-graphic guru, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, \"Yes, the spirits arereal. Yes, the spirits are imaginary. Most of us, however, can-not imagine how real our imaginations are.\"I can, with no small measure of confidence, generallydefend this position with jabs of well-worn qabalistic suppo-sitions concerning the nature of consciousness and the func-tions of the various parts of the soul, and a left hook fromCarl Jung. There have been times, however, when my fieldtheory has been mightily challenged. Mr. Laycock'sComplete Enochian Dictionary played a curious role in onesuch magical bout.In 1978, as part of my perceived duties as an O.T.O.' lodge-master, I began what would become a 23-year weekly magickclass at my home in Costa Mesa, California. At the time,I washard-pressed to stay one jump ahead of the enthusiastic aspi-rants who crowded my living room floor each Thursdayevening. Within a year or so I realized that if I intended to con-tinue teaching,I had learn more myself."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"My magick library was pitifully small in those days. Mynewest treasure was a first edition of Gems from the Equinox,2which contains a selection of books, articles, essays, and ritu-als from Aleister Crowley's monumental work, The Equinox.sI combed through it to see if I could find something novel andexotic to occupy our Thursday nights for a while. I settled onLiber LXXilV vel Chanokh-A Brief Abstract of the SymbolicRepresentation of the Universe Derived by Dr. John DeeThrough the Skrying of Sir Edward Kelly,It is Crowley's intro-duction to the complex and beautiful magical art form that hascome to be known as Enochian.I didn't know it at the time, butChanokh, and the book you are now holding in your hands,would dramatically change the course of my life.At first I found Chanokh completely unfathomable. I readit, re-read it, and checked it against the Enochian material inRegardie's Golden Dawn.a After a day or two of whimpering,I finally started to see the light. The material that treated uponthe evocation of angels of the four Elemental Tablets appearedto be the logical place to start the class.Each Elemental Tablet is made up of 156 lettered squares,each of which is divided so to represent a truncated pyramid.Each has its own particular mixture of elements determined by amost impressive application of Hermetic logic. An angel (whosename is the letter of the square) \"lives\" in every one of the pyra-mids. These single-letter-named angels are modular and join withtheir neighbors to form bigger angels with longer names andmore complex attributes and duties. It is truly an elegant system.My plan was to keep the class occupied for a few weeks byhaving them draw and color their own tablets while I consult-ed with Dr. Regardie and constructed a set of three-dimension-al tablets. Regardie was not keen on the idea. He told me that,to his knowledge, no one had ever done such a thing before,and that the Enochian angels were dangerous enough whenthey inhabited flat tablets. He cautioned, \"Don't give themdimensional elbow-room.\" I joked, and suggested that ftlsangels were probably in a bad mood because they were allsquished up inside his t'lat tablets. I went ahead and prevailedupon a lodgc hrothcr to cut 624 wooden truncated pyramids.viiiThese I would eventually prepare, paint, and assemble into the4 Elemental Tablets (one each for Fire, Water, Air, Earth).The night of our first evocation arrived. I prepared our liv-ing room temple for the evocation of Laidrom, the Mars Seniorof the Tablet of Earth.'The temple opening and operating pro-cedures are outlined admirably in Chanokh, so there was verylittle to do but follow directions. I smugly congratulated myselfon being so well prepared. What I wasn't prepared for, howev-er, was the possibility that the evocation might actually work.The first student to arrive was D. R., who proudly handedme his newly acquired first edition of Laycock'sThe CompleteEnochian Dictionary-the first one I had ever seen.u As Ialways do when someone hands me something rare or expen-sive, I feigned profound gratitude and gushed, \"Oh! Thankyou!\" He quickly snatched it back out of my hands.Once the rest of the class arrived, I asked for a volunteer toread the Call in the angelic language and sit in the visionarydriver's seat. To my great anxiety, our only volunteer wasDavid Wilson, the most cynical member of the class. I was cer-tain that our class curmudgeon would receive no vision what-soever and all of our efforts would be the target of his ridiculefor many months to come. Still, he was willing to give it a try,so I switched on our little tape recorder and we proceeded.After I banished and opened the temple, David read theCall twice, closed his eyes, and sat quietly for only a few sec-onds. Then, to all of our surprise, he casually started todescribe in great detail his vision of a desert of white crys-talline sand that sprouted columns of volcanic rock.We were all thrilled. I asked if he saw any living things, anangel, or a spirit. He said \"No.\" I encouraged him to repeat theCall a third time. As soon as he was finished, he excitedlydescribed an enormous black cone arising from beneath thesand. David fell silent for a moment. He told us the cone wasopening. Then, with a shout that startled us all... \"It's him! It'shim! I see him!\"He described a large, humanoid figure seemingly con-structed from the same material as the cone. It had no face, itshcad was cgg-slrnpocl and flat in front. Its fingerless hands hadlxt"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the appearance of mittens. \"This is Laidrom!\" Davidannounced reverently.We were all in shock. None of us were prepared for this.David.reached for a pad of paper and a pencil and scribbleddown a few notes and a sketch. Before I could stutter out wordsof welcome, David let out a nervous giggle and said,\"Lon,I feel like... I feel... I could make strange sounds.\"\"Go with it!\" I don't think I really meant it.\"Naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayef...this is...\"\"No! Relax, let it happen!\" I tried to sound calm.\"I mean it, I feel like and idiot. I'm too... sil-si anxilxi-to-da-arp nan-ta (inaudible) ... ef... efe thar-zi.I'm sorry... that'sall. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I just felt likedoing it.\"I didn't know what to say. I finally salvaged the presenceof mind to thank Laidrom for appearing. I was painfullyembarrassed that I couldn't think of anything to say to thisperfectly well-mannered angel standing in my living room. Ifinally stuttered something stupid to the effect that we reallyappreciated him stopping by, and we'd sure like to visit withhim again sometime soon, then I hurriedly closed and ban-ished the temple.For a few seconds no one said a word. Then everyone start-ed talking at once. I rewound the tape and we listened to thestrange words that had tumbled out of David's mouth. Ofcourse they didn't make any sense, but it was such a thrill tohear them.We rewound the tape repeatedly and eventually transcribedthree audible strings of syllables:naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayeffzil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arp nan-ta (inaudible)ef...efee thar-zi.We referred to D.R.'s The Complete Enochian Dictionary,and in short order discovered:Nanta, elo Hoath zorge ef.\"Spirit of Earth, first worshiper friendly visit.\"Zil zien\"stretch forth hands\"XZilodarp Nanta\"stretch forth and conquer Spirit of Earth\"Ef 'etharzi\"visit in peace.\"David appeared uncharacteristically shaken by what hadhappened. He insisted, and I didn't doubt his truthfulness, thathe had not so much as even glanced at any of the EnochianCalls before that evening.For the next three years, we would hold class two nights aweek and focus exclusively on Enochian magick. We woulddepend increasingly on The Complete Enochian Dictionary tohelp us navigate the complexities of the angelic hierarchies andserve as our pronunciation guide to angelic language. David'svisions would continue to take us on amazing excursions to theF.lemental worlds, but as he became more accustomed to hear-ing the words of the Calls, his talent for breaking sponta-neously into the angelic tongue diminished and finally ceasedaltogether. Yet he remains the most talented seer I have everencountered.D. R., bless his heart, eventually moved away. We haven'theard from him in many years. I am forever grateful to him forbringing The Complete Enochian Dictionary to class thatmemorable night so many years ago.

In the intervening period, more than adozen bookson Dr. John Dee and the Enochian language have appeared.Some of these have advanced our knowledge of Dee and hismagical systems, by publishing more of his original works. Veryfew of these have added to our knowledge of Enochian, thelanguage, and very few changes have needed to be made to thisdictionary.Some of the other books have merely reworked materialalready available, and a few, such as Gerald Schueler's E nochianPhysics (Llewellyn, 1988) have gone way beyond Dee's originalwork into areas which Dee would neither recognize nor under-stand. Gerald Schueler's Enochian Magic (Llewellyn, 1985) ismuch more relevant to the present work. Some books, such asThe Rosicrucian Secrets (Aquarian, 1985) simply used Dee'sname by bogusly ascribing authorship to Dee.What is for certain is that there is a new generation ofreaders and practitioners (often very different classes ofpeople)who are enthralled by the marvelous and detailed works of thegood Doctor and his rather shifty skryer, Edward Kelley.The first editon if this dictionary was published in theUnited Kingdom by Askin Publishers, a company no longeractive. Askin attempted to publish worthwhile texts of theWestern Magical Tradition which were not otherwise easilyavailable to practitioners.

Don, as a Doctor ofLinguistics at the University of Canberra, left behind manymonuments to his work with language, including that of theAustralian Aborigine and dialects and languages of the SouthPacific. But of all these languages, none was so strange-orfascinated him as much-as the language of the angels, JohnDee's Enochian.During the year or so that he was in London we spent manymonths in the British Museum, reading, copying and summa-rizingthe original manuscripts. On some evenings, we workedtogether on the practical side of the invocations, and Don knewmany of the Calls fluently and resoundingly by heart. For awhile, a copy of the Complete Enochian Dictionary stood in theManuscriptRoom of the BritishMuseum as areference aidto thedecipherment of the original manuscripts themselves, until oneunscrupulous scholar decided that he had more need of it than allthe other readers!The foundation of the British Museums collection was theoriginal collection of Sir Hans Sloane's rare books, manuscripts,and curiosities that were purchased by the trustees of the BritishMuseum for 20,000 pounds in1753. Among these manuscriptswere John Dee's originals and Elias Ashmole's manuscriptcopies. In1759, the British Museum was formally opened, andthe present building was complete in 1847. The great readingroom was opened ten years later. Dee certainly would haveapproved of his works finishing up there, as he had tried tointerest Queen Elizabeth I in founding such a national bookcollection.What Don and I discovered about Dee's systems (for thereare several distinct systems of magic in his manuscripts) andabout his angels, both in the Museum, and in the practical use ofthe Calls, forms the basis of my book on Enochian Magic, whichhas yet to see the light of day.AfterDonreturned to Australia, the manuscriptof this bookwas taken during the course of a burglary. Not content to sitdown under the police assurances that few of such burglaries areever solved, I took counsel with Dee's angels. Although theburglar neither knew me, nor cared about such things, he foundhimself inexorably drawn to find out more about this book andits contents. Within a week he had, much against his will,contacted me to ask about it. The police, of course, followed thisup, and after he was arrested the manuscript returned to mypossession. Since then I have been in two minds about offeringit for publication, despite the efforts of several very persuasivefriends.After the Elizabethan period there were other examples ofboth communication with the angels through mediums, and ofgreat gullibility. An example of both of these occurs tnGoodwinWharton by Kent Clark (OUP, 1984) which is a summary ofWharton's diaries kept during his extraordinary life from 1653 to1701. Wharton felt that he regularly conversed with the fairies,even the Faery Queen herself, and the angels, but each time inEnglish. Dee's work stands alone as a grammatical guide to theangelic language itself.Like Dee, Wharton was interested in everything mechani-cal and spiritual, including practical deep sea diving (he inventedseveral pieces of apparatus for this purpose), searching fortreasure guarded by fierce spirits, and conversations with theangels (through his often pregnant skryer), and even with Godhimself. Like Dee, Uriel and the angel Ahab were two ofWharton's favorite communicating angels. Wharton also hadtime for politics (as did Dee) and had a permanent seat in theHouse of Commons, was involved in several royal intrigues, andwas promoted from Lieutenant-Colonel of Cavalry to Lordof theAdmiralty. A highly public life is not always incompatible withmagical work, and a Renaissance turn of mind seems to havebeen a charaiteristic of such men. Some of Dee's non-magicalworks have appeared in modern scholarly editions, such asWayne Shumaker's John Dee on Modern Astronomy:,, ,.di&ffi&,. \""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Propaedeumata Aphoristica (1558 ctnd 1568), [in] Latin andEnglish (University of California Press, 1978). Other Deefragments from the Monas Hieroglyphica and his preface toEuclid, together with a sampling of his diaries were published byGerald Suster in John Dee Essential Readings (Aquarian/Cru-cible, 1986).Dee has appeared in at least two memorable fiction books.Inthe modern The House of Dr. Dee, by PeterAckroyd (HamishHamilton, 1993),Dee is portrayed as living in a squalid tenementin Cloak Lane in Clerkenwell in East London, rather than in thehistorically correct rambling old house in Mortlake by theThames in West London. Other considerable liberties are takenby the author who is interested in time shifts between Dee's timeand the present. A much more magical portrayal of Dee appearsin the translation of Gustav Meyrink's The Angel of the WestW indow (Daedalus, lggl),which involves the EmperorRudolphof Prague, and some interesting Rosicrucian dreams and visions.However, anyone wishing to really understand Dee's magi-cal work-after the pious sentiments have been stripped out-had better look to the tradition of the early grimoires rather thanto the later and more elaborate system which the Golden Dawnderived from Dee's work. Although the latter is very intellectu-ally satisfying, the roots from which Enochian magicgrew will be found in the rich compost of the grimoires, orgrammars of sorcery which dealt with the calling of both angelsand demons. Mathers, who helped build the Golden Dawnsystem, was also a great translator of grimoires, and if AleisterCrowley is to be believed, a great practitioner as well.A classic example of such a grimoire isThe Sworn Book ofHonorius the Magician, as composed by Honorius throughcounsel with the Angel Hocroell (Heptangle Books, l9l8),which was well-edited from two British Museum manuscripts byDaniel Driscoll. I refer anyone who doubts this connection topage 11 of this beautifully printed edition.The seminal works that have been published in the last twodecades, and which any serious student should acquire, apartfrom those listed in the bibliography, are:Geoffrey James. The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee(Heptangle Books, 1 984), particularly recommended;Adam Mclean. A Treatise on Angel Magic, being aComplete translation of Ms. Harley 6482 in the BritishLibrary (Phanes Press, 1990);Joseph Peterson (editor). The Five Books of MysticalExercises of Dr. John Dee...as revealed to Dr. John Deeand Edward Kelley e. o. l58I-1583 (Magnum Opus,1985);Robert Turner.

It is one of the more complex bridges ever built bet-ween this world and the world of daemons, spirits, and angels, apiece of spiritual engineering created by one of the most brilliantminds of his age. As such it deserves to be traversed with care. Butas it was filtered through the tricksy mind of Dee's metcurial skryerEdward Kelley, this path can easily become the path of the Fool.Stephen SkinnerLondon 1994.- -. ;S**$e&t. ,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACEDuring the 16th Century, Cracow, Antwerp and Prague were thegreat centres of magical and alchemical enquiry and experiment.Cornelius Agrippa published his De Occulta Philosophia in Ant-werp in 1531. Prague during the reign of King Rudolf II wasdevoted to the Hermetic arts and sciences which fascinated itsmonarch to the exclusion of all else. King Stephen of Poland, whohad his seat at Cracow, was related to the Hungarian Bathori fam-ily which legend identifies with Count Dracula. Together withCracow, Prague inherited an extensive heritage of Hasidic ]uda-ism with its heavy mystical, magical and qabalistic content, in factit was in Prague in the 1580's that Rabbi Loew engendered thefamous golem, a figure which has haunted the history of thepractical qabalah, and the ghetto of Prague, ever since.Dr John Dee (1527-1608), mathematician and AstrologerRoyal to Queen Elizabeth I, author of the main introductory text-book on mathematics of his age and innovator of many of the navi-gational aids which enabled the Elizabethan explorers to discoverthe New World, visited each of these cities in turn. First Antwerpin 1550 (and later in 1562-4), then Cracow in 1584, where he hadaudience with Stephen Bathori (King of Poland and relative ofElizabeth Bathori, the 'Bloody Countess'), later passing throughHesse-Cassel (a centre of Rosicrucian activity) after visitingPrague and Trebona during 1586-9.John Dee's interest in magic arose out of his comprehensivestudies, typical of the Renaissance man of the time, which com-menced with Latin, an essential requisite of any scholar of theperiod, at the age of ten. Five years later he was sent to Cam-bridge, where he studied the traditional Triuiun of subjects,grammar, rhetoric and logic. However it was not till the followingyears when he undertook the Quadriaium (arithmetic, geomeuy,music and astronomy), that his studies, and the eventual directionof his life work really got underway, for as he says himself 'I was sovehemently bent to studie, that for those yeares I did inviolablykeepe this order; only to sleepe four houres every night; to allow tomeate and drink (and some refreshing after) two houres everyday; and of the other eighteen houres all (except the time of going-=-.i**e&iui:. -,. *"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"to and being at divine service) was spent in my studies and learn-ing.'At the same time he mastered the two Tongues, Greek andHebrew (the latter not quite as thoroughly as the former) and theThree Philosophies, natural, moral and metaphysical.In 1546 Dee's position as an under-reader in Greek and afounding fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, seemed to prom-ise the beginnings of a brilliant academic career, but the followingsummer he visited the Low Countries where his interest in geo-graphy flowered, following his acquaintance with Giraldus Mer-cator (the famous Dutch cartographer responsible for the well-known square-grid Mercator map projection), and GemmaFrisius, both of whom provided him with geographical equip-ment, globes, astronomer's staff and ring, and material on the artof navigation, which he duly took back to his university.Having realised that some arts and sciences were very muchfurther advanced in Europe than in England, and realising thatEngland could profit by these, he visited Louvain the followingsummer. In 1550 a short trip to Antwerp brought him in contactwith another geographer, Abraham Ortelius (whose house stillstands in Antwerp, and whose detailed geographical charts andequipment now reside in the Antwerp Navigational Museum).Pursuing his other great interest, Mathematics, he lectured onEuclid in Paris, to packed halls, establishing his reputation im-mediately. He was offered a post of King's Reader in Mathemat-ics at Paris University on a stipend of two hundred crowns, whichfor patriotic reasons Dee refused. This pattern was consistentlyrepeated, with Dee refusing to quit the service of Elizabeth I forfar more lucrative positions. On several occasions, the Czar ofRussia, Fedor I, offered Dee a position in his court as advisor andphysician, at the incredible salary of 2,000 crowns a year, withfood supplied from the table of the Czar himself, and a house andadditional salary from the Lord Protector, but the offer was againturned down by Dee. Returningto Englandthe followingyear, hemet Jerome Cardan (1552) who was probably responsible forstirring up Dee's interest in the mathematical conjuration ofspirits and reinforcing the influences that Dee must most certain-ly have encountered earlier in his career at Antwerp.These interests were almost nipped in the bud by the accessionIof Queen Mary to the throne, when his ambiguous interest inmagic coupled with the implied heresy of his predominantlyProtestant leanings resulted in his imprisonment for threemonths in 1555. Interestingly enough, his skill in theology result-ed in Dee being requested by the Bishop of London to act as ajudge in one of the heresy trials, in which he was one of theaccused.When Elizabeth I succeeded to the throne, John Dee's fortuneschanged considerably: he was even asked to select (with duerecourse to the influence of the stars) a propitious date for hercoronation: a calculation which by all accounts ofthe Elizabethanera, must have been well performed!Five years later Dee set out to visit various centres of learningmaking a very rapid tour of most of Europe including Antwerp,where he met Christopher Plantin (whose presses, which stiliexist, were justly famous throughout Europe, and whose typedesign provided the model for that used in setting this book).Here he secured a copy of Trithemius' influentialSteganographia(concerned with 'angel-magic', and perhaps cryptography), be-fore visiting Zurich, Urbino, Rome (where legend has it that hehad audience with the Pope), Venice, and finally Presburg inHungary where he was granted audience with Maximillian II, towhom he was later to dedicate his Monas Hieroglyphica.Dee wrote the Monas in seven days in 1564, and in the sameyear it was published in Antwerp. Significantly it was not toappear in Dee's native tongue till 1947. The Monas, whose fulltitle, The Monad, Hieroglyphically, Mathematically, Magically,Cabbalistically and Anagogically Explained gives a fair indicationof its complexity and scope, is a unique blend of some of the morepicturesque alchemical allegories woven into the otherwise ratherdry fabric of a book, constructed as a series of exact Euclideantype theorems; with liberal sprinklings of interpretations of theMonas itself (which was a combination of the symbols for Mer-cury and Aries drawn in a specific proportion). This is elaboratedwith geometric details for drawing the Monas, and an explanationof the symbolic meanings of these proportions.In the same year as the Monas was published, Dee went to livesouth-west of London, at Mortlake, in a rambling old house well-providcd with various outhouses for his many scientific interests."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The site of the house, opposite the Church of St Mary the Virginwhich Dee later endowed, and in which he is buried, abuts ontothe Thames. Elizabeth I often came to visit him by Royal bargefrom Richmond or Hampton Court Palace.From here, living on the income of several rectories, Dee quiet-ly pursued his studies, which included writing a classic preface tothe first English edition of Euclid's Elements of Geometie, andplanning voyages in search of the north-west passage, or for goldin Labrador. He reputedly accompanied Martin Frobisher on atleast one of these exploratory voyages.In response to Elizabeth's request to Dee for information aboutthe lands to which she was heir, he wrote a work called Of Famousand Rich Discoueries. . ., which whilst purporting to be a treatiseon various voyages ofdiscovery undertaken by Europeans (laterto be used by Hakluyt as a source for his accounts), was in factdesigned to promote Elizabeth's Imperial aspirations, by assuringher of her rightful ownership of various lands, by appealing tohistorical precedent. Considering Dee's reputation, it is interest-ing that he was also called on by the Queen to counteract theeffects of a wax image which had been discovered in Lincoln's InnFields, and which was thought to be part of a magical plot againsther. This establishes Dee's court reputation as that of magician asas well as a geographer and mathematician.After a first marriage which lasted just one year, he marriedJane Fromond (a member of the Queen's household) and threeyears later took up what he considered to be the most importantstudy of his life. This was the communication, via the medium of ashewstone with 'angels' in an attempt to quench his overmasteringdesire for knowledge beyond that normally accessible to mortals,to reach up in fact, like Enoch or the Biblical prophets, to God,the very source of knowledge itself. As Dee put it:'I have often read in thy (God's) books and records, howEnoch injoyed thy favour and conversation; with Mosesthou was familiar; And also that to Abraham, Isaack andJacob, Joshua, Gideon, Esdras, Daniel, Tobias andsundry others thy good angels were sent by thydisposition, to Instruct them, informe them, helpe them,yea in worldly and domestick affaires, yea and sometymest0to satisfie their desires, doubtes, and questions of thySecrete: And furdermore considering, the Shewstone,which the High Prieste did use, by thy owne ordering. . .that this wisdome could not be come by at mans hand orby humaine power, but only from thee (6 God).'Dee reasoned that intercourse with these 'spiritual creatures',provided that malevolent, misleading and demonic spirits werebanished, was one of the highest ends man could aim at. It is herethat magic enters Dee's work. The exactness of mathematicsallied with the convoluted philosophy of the Hebrew qabalah andArabic magico-alchemical works, produced a very solid base fromwhich magic (both natural and metaphysical) could be approach-ed in a scientific manner. This had two effects. First it attractedmen of Dee's calibre to the study of magic. However the secondeffect of this union was the tarring of rnathematics with the samebrush as had previously been reserved for the heretic or the localpractitioner of wort-cunning. This attitude resulted in the sack ofDee's house at Mortlake (during his absence in Europe) and thehaphazard destruction of some of his scientific equipment.Ironically enough his 'instruments of sorcery', his skrying stones,Holy Table, wttx tablets lamen and chest containing the LibriMysteriorum accompanied him to the Continent, and so escapedthe rage of the mob.However it was in 1581, before Dee left for Europe, that hebegan his magical experiments. His avowed aim was to establishcontact with the angels, to discover that knowledge which was notto be had either from books or from experiment.During this period Dee employed Edward Kelley and severalother shryers, or seers, to obtain a series of communications whichhe attributed to the agency of angels and spirits. Despite the factthat the first record of the skrying is dated December 22nd,thereis evidence to suggest that the skrying began in a haphazardwayrs early as March 8th, 1581. The first workings were based on agrimoire type of approach, relying to an extent on equipment.This included wax tablets, a skrying table, a gold lamen andleveral shewstones, of obsidian and rock crystal. This was evolvedinto a sophisticated system which involved setting the skryingltone (several were used including a conventional looking crystal--- 6iLgL ,II"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ball and the black obsidian mirror) upon the elaborately engravedSigillum Aemeth (still preserved in the British Museum) whichwas in turn placed upon a special table inscribed with a hexagram,enclosed within a frame of Enochian letters, and supporting sevenspecially designed talismans, the whole insulated from the floorby a further four wax tablets, miniature versions of the largerSigillum Aemeth.The early communications set down in Dee's Libri Mysteri-orum deal with communications from Annael and Uriel, whodictated exact instructions for the engraving of the table, lamen,ring and sigils required. The third book opens with the designs forthe seven talismans to be used on the skrying table, and concludeswith the Tabula Collecta of the 49 angels whose invocatory modusoperandi is explained in the fourth book.Dee and Kelley pressed on, skrying now as often as severaltimes a day till the complete outline of a self-contained system ofmagic was obtained and set down in Dee's manuscript, De Hept-archia Mystica, so named because of the 7x7 ar^gels, whose in-vocations, hours, seals and sigils are described therein. Dee'sdescription of two of these creatures will suffice to show theirvariety:'He appeared in his red apparell: & he opened hisClothes & there did issue, mighty & most terrible gastlyFlames of Fire out of his sides: which no mortall Eyecould abide to looke upon any long while.

An example of this early Enochian, by way of contrastwith the later (translated) material comes from an'action' dated5th April 1582:'Amchama zeuoth luthimba ganeph iamda ox oho iephadmad noxa voscaph bamgephes noschol apeth iale lod gaNA zuma datques. . .'Returning however to events in the external world, we find Deecorrecting the Julian Calendar in 1582 to a greater degree of ac-curacy than any other contemporary mathematician (althoughthe council of Archbishops turned down his proposals on thegrounds that they smacked of Popishness, thereby putting offEnglish calendar reform by several centuries).In the same year Dee and Kelley met Count Albertus Laski, apalatine of Siradz and aspirant to the Polish Crown. The nextyear the Dee and Kelley household set out for Cracow.It is at this stage that the published part of Dee's Libri Mysteri-orum takes up the account. This was first printed from Dee'smanuscript by Meric Casaubon in 1659 as A True and FaithfulRelation of what Passedfor Many Yeers betweenDrJohnDee . . .andSome Spirits, and re-issued by Askin Publishers, London, in1974.These 'angelic conversations' cover a wide range of material,from the enumeration of every country on the (then known) faceof the earth with their presiding angels, through prophecy (ofvarying degreees of accuracy), to the amazing collection of tran-scripts in the Enochian tongue.Amongst the more 'magical' material, despite passages of in-I4credible triviality and banality, there is a hard core of extremelyinteresting material recurring throughout the 'angelic' conver-sations, such that Elias Ashmole (the famous antiquary and earlyFreemason), and later MacGregor Mathers, one of the foundersof the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, took portions of thesystem and derived from it their own systems of magic. Ashmole'sattempts, covering a period of some five years (1671-76), arecloser to the spirit of Dee's work than Mathers' interpretation,and tend to confirm the objectivity of the intelligences involvedin the original communications.Along these lines there is a record by a different experimenterdated l6th October, 1583, which tends to add weight to the ob-jective existence of the phenomena recorded by Dee in A Trueand Faithful Relation. . . It begins:'At ii a Clock at night, I & my Companions having begunAction, at the request & full consent of all the Company,we did fully agree, that we should not desist, till we hadbrought something to perfection, & having begun Action,& all things for the same purpose ready & fitted; thusgive a briefe & true account of what followes.After the first Invocation, twice or thrice repeated,there appeared two Men, in the furthest Glass, visible tosome part of the Company, & not to other some; butproceeding on, & Invocating highly, there came a verygreat blow upon the Floore, which made a very greatnoise, & before it ceased, it did whirle about severalltymes, to the astonishment & admiration of all yeCompany, & still proceeding on, & reading further, therecame something, which fell pat upon the Table, & fromthe Table upon the Ground, which made a smaller Noiseupon ye floore, then the other did & so vanisht, & soemuch for ye night, only when Action was ended, wecould find nothing that was the cause of ye noise. . .'Returning to a more modern application of Dee's work we findthc brilliant syntheses by MacGregor Mathers into the syllabusof the Adeptus Minor grade of the Golden Dawn at the end of thel9th ccntury. Although he used only a small part of the vast- * -,,g-Si@E-I5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"amount of material that Dee left, he incorporated the ElementalTablets with their associated correspondences and the ThirtyCalls of the Aethyrs before referred to, whilst Westcott, co-founder of the Order, elaborated a four-sided version of chessbased on the Enochian system.Much of Mathers' adaptation of the original system was doneto make it compatible with the Golden Dawn's existing qabalisticbasis, which, although ultimately based upon the qabalah thatDee was familiar with, contained many elements not found inDee's original work, such as the Tarot Atus and the EgyptianPantheon.For Dee, the Angels also provided advice and reproof which heconveyed to two of the most powerful patrons he sought, StephenBathori King of Poland, and Rudolf II of Bohemia. He was luckynot to have incurred any more painful a punsihment for his painsthan a partial banishment by the latter. Dee and Kelley accord-ingly sought refuge in 1586 at the castle of Count Rosenberg atTrebona, where Dee stayed for two years. Meanwhile Kelleymanaged, through his alchemical experiments, to curry favourfirst with the Count and then with Rudolf, who later knightedhim.A True and Faithful Relation... which opened in Lesden inMay 1583 closes with the agreement between Dee and Kelley to'hold their wives in common' (wife-swapping not being an entire-ly modern prerogative) at which point the whole tenor of thecommunications changes and passages of considerable powerappear, contrary to anything Kelley had up to this point pro-duced.The spouse-swapping episode began with an alleged com-mandment by the Angels conveyed by Kelley, 'that we two hadour two wives in such sort as we might use them in common'(April l8th, 1587). This was consummated on the night of 22ndMay as is evident from semi-obliterated remarks in the originalmanuscript which were not printed by Casaubon.This arrangement, which although productive of some of themost interesting material recorded by Dee, probably barely lastedtill July 19th when Dee records ' a certayne kinde of recommen-dation between our wives. Next day saw relenting of E. K. also bymy Lord's entrety'. Unfortunately with the exception of fourl6pages in Casaubon these MS notes belong to the greate Chasmeof 20 years from May 23, 1587 to March 20, 1607: the paperswhich fell into the hands of Elias Ashmole, but which do notappear to have survived. They contain Dee's record of the last'actions' with Kelley before he left Dee's service.The delivery of these passages is in many ways similar toseveral Gnostic works describing the descent of Sophia, The Songof Solomon, and Aleister Crowley's Liber Legis, with which thereare some remarkable similarities in wording. Crowley, inciden-tally, claimed Edward Kelley as one of his past incarnations,which, rather than necessarily supporting transmigration ofsouls, suggests the affinity Crowley felt for Kelley's work, whichmay have led to a certain amount of unconscious plagiarism.In February 1589 Dee saw the last of Kelley, and from thence-forth Dee's skrying experiments were with very inferior skryerssuch as Bartholomew Hickman, whose skrying records were laterburnt when Dee discovered that he was a fraud. Till Kelley'sdeath, Dee continued to hope for a reconciliation with his oldskryer.Dee's enthusiasm had not waned however for he named hisnext daughter Madimi, after the young girl who was a constantvisitor to the crystal during the skrying sessions.By this time he was back in his beloved England where he setabout restoring his house in Mortlake which had been damagedby the mob during his six year absence. He partly re-assembledhis collection of books which contained in excess of 2,500 booksand manuscripts on mathematics, magic, alchemy, philosophy,cryptography, classical literature, geography and the qabalah.The last six years of his life were spent under James I, an un-pleasant situation for anybody remotely suspected of witchcraft,this monarch having been responsible for the most savage per-secution of witches and magicians ever to occur in England.Dee died in 1608 and was buried in the chancel of the churchin Mortlake, opposite his house.On one hand Dee is looked upon as a man of the Renaissancewith heavy medieval leanings, rather like Elias Ashmole, whocombined membership of the Royal Society (avowedly formedfor thc advancement of the empirical sciences) with intimateinvolvcmcnt in astrology, alchcmy and other interests whicht7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"would have been regarded as rather reactionary by other mem-bers of the Royal Society. On the other hand, the populace sawhim as a sorcerer, or to use Dee's words when writing his owndefence 'a companion of hellhounds, and a caller and conjurerof wicked and damned spirits'. Likewise Dee was regardedslightly askance at Court, although it seems he was never oncedoubted by Elizabeth I, to whom he remained devoted for theduration of his life. In between the rather dry but learned magusand the 'damned sorcerer' lies the real Dee: a man who perpetu-ated the tradition of Hermes Trismegistus and helped 'Chris-tianize' the qabalah, who in all modesty aspired to be anotherEnoch, who wished to have God's word directly transmitted byGod's messengers the angels, nevertheless a very humble man, ashis many prayers preceding the skrying actions testify.Dee is a very important link in the magical tradition, not onlybecause he brought back ideas to England from European centresof learning: or because he aided the cross-fertilization of theRosicrucian movement, as is aptly pointed out by Frances Yatesin The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, but because his magical re-search is voluminous, carefully documented, and original.Stephen SkinnerLondon 1975ENOCHIANAngelic language or mortal folly?L.rrg,r\"g.s come and languages go. Something like seventhousand natural languages have been recorded, in one form oranother, since the beginning of recorded history; and at least athousand more languages have been invented by men, for pur-poses ranging from magic to extraterrestrial communication.But no language has a stranger history than the Enochianlanguage documented in this dictionary. Perhaps strangest of allis that we still do not know whether it is a natural language or aninvented language - or whether it is, perhaps, the language of thelngels, as its originators believed. In this introduction, the data ispresented for the reader to make up his own mind.The personalities: John Dee (1527-1608)According to the horoscope he later cast for himself, John Deewas born at Mortlake on the morning of l3 July, 1527, under thecign of Cancer, with Sagittarius in the ascendant - a good omen,tgy the astrologers, for a career based on learning and the occult.His father, Rowland Dee, was Superintendent of the RoyalTable, at the English Court; but John Dee was later to claim aproud genealogy that included Welsh kings and princes, all theway back to King Arthur. $flhatever the truth of these claims, it iscertain that John Dee became a distinguished man in his ownright. Though he published little, it is apparent rhat he exercisedI powerful intellectual influence on the greatest minds of thetime. He was a dedicated, even fanatical, scholar, resolving, whenln undergraduate at Cambridge, to spend eighteen hours in studycrch day, with only four hours for sleep, and two hours for meals.He graduated Master of Arts from Cambridge in 1548, andwent abroad to study further at Louvain. Later he gave lectures' It the University of Paris thar attracted so many students thatthey had to crowd at the windows to listen: at this time, Dee wasOnly twenty-three years old.His reputation in Europe and at home continued to grow,though it was always tempered with the ignorant fear of him as atorcerer and demonolator. He took few actual jobs, beingl8T9"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"dependent for most of his life on royal and ecclesiastical pensions-which never amounted to more than about eighty pounds ayear. For most of his life, he was chronically short of money -which is not surprising when one takes into account that he spentmore than three thousand pounds (or eighty thousand pounds incurrent value) on building up Elizabethan England's greatestlibrary.Some idea of the range of Dee's interests can be obtained fromthe contents of this library, which contained at least 2500 printedbooks and manuscripts. The works dealt with mathematics, al-chemy, philosophy, classical literature, geography - and thehermetic tradition. Dee had thoroughly studied the 'Christiancabbala', particularly from the works of Cornelius Agrippa, andwas to become more and more immersed in the qabalistic tra-dition as time went on.In fact, Meric Casaubon, in his edition (1659) of part of therecord of Dee's seances, scathingly described Dee as 'a Cabalis-tical man, up to the ears'. One can also get a good impression ofDee's character from this longer statement by Casaubon - al-though Casaubon himself does not think much of Dee's mind:'Some men come into the world wrth Cabalistical Brains;their heads are full of mysteries; they see nothing, theyread nothing, but their brain is on work to picksomewhat out of it that is not ordinary; and out of thevery A B C that children are taught, rather than fail, theywill fetch all the secrets of Gods Wisdom; tell you howthe world was created, how governed, and what will bethe end of all things. Reason and Sense that other mengo by, they think the acorns that the old world fed upon;fools and children may be content with them but they seethings by another Light.'The description is a good one, but it can describe two kinds ofindividual: the magus, or the obsessed fool. Which Dee was, thereader will have to decide, on the basis of his spiritist seances. Itis not known just when he began to seek or achieve effective com-munications with the beings he regarded as angels, but it wasprobably not before 1581. From about March of that year, as we20learn from his Priaate Diary, he was troubled by odd dreams, andstrange knockings in the night. To those who accept the objectivereality of Dee's spirits, it would seem that the spirits were anxiousto get in touch with him, rather than the other way round.Be that as it may, by October of that year Dee had found amedium, one Barnabas Saul, who, using as a crystal a stone givenDee by a 'friend', reported to Dee the words of the angels Annaeland Michael - and who later denied seeing any spirits at all, forfear of prosecution for conjuring. But Dee was dissatisfied withSaul as a medium, and dismissed him after working with him foronly a few months.The personalities: Edward Kelley (1555-1595)Opportunely - for Dee's appetite for spiritual communicationshad been thoroughly whetted - there appeared at his house inMortlake on 8 March 1582 a man calling himself Edward Talbot,afterwards to be known by his true name of Edward Kelley.Kelley was about twenty-seven years old at the time; but hisprevious life remains something of a mystery. There is a long-standing tradition - unfortunately not well-substantiated - thathe had had his ears cut off for forgery. He seems to have beensomething of an occult charlatan, travelling England living off areputation for alchemy and the preparation of magical elixirs. Onseveral occasions he is known to have been in possession of oldbooks, sometimes in cipher, purporting to give the location ofburied treasures. He was not uneducated; he had been an under-graduate at Oxford, but was apparently dismissed. He spokeLatin well enough to travel in Europe, and converse with Dee'sContinental friends; he makes frequent grammatical mistakes,but of his general intelligence there is no doubt.Dee was at first suspicious of this young man who offered hisservices as a 'skryer', or mediumistic visionary; he seems to havethought that Kelley might have been a spy sent to gain infor-mation on his conjuring activities, to report him to the authorities.But the doubts must have been resolved, for already on l0 Marchthat year Dee was giving the new medium a trial - with results soruccessful that there began on that day a strange and close associ-Ition between the two men that was to last for some seven years,snd to involvc thcm in a scrics of actions with a host of spirits of\"._ . .*-;riiieiil:r{l: _2I"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Srctur.v,-Dfuf nm &rlt: rrt.-?q,t ca1i.anr?

The original tablet, and smaller similar ones, can stillbe seen in the British Museum. The design may ultimately derivefrom Sloane manuscript 3L3; Kircher, in his book OedipusAegyptiacus (Rome, 1652-4), gives a version of the seal with tra-ditional angelic names in place of the Enochian names of Dee. Itis unlikely that he could have got this from Dee's manuscriprs,then, as now, unpublished.The pattern for almost all the recorded seances is establishedright at the beginning. The seance opens with a prayer, the magiccrystal or 'shewstone' is uncovered, and Kelley sees visions andhears voices, whose content he transmits to Dee, the recorder.Several aids to scrying may have been used. Dee is usually credit-cd with having at least two: a rock crystal globe, and a 'magicmirror' of black obsidian; both of these can be seen in the BritishMuseum. Dee apparently saw and heard nothing (though this isarguable; his Priaate Diary entry for 25 May 1581 reads: 'TodayI had sight offered me in chrystallo, and I saw', and at other timeshe seems to have heard at least some of the sounds produced, suchas thunder, roaring and trumpets).Many of Kelley's 'messages' consisted of letters of the alphabeterranged in squares. It will be necessary to examine some of theearly examples in detail, if we are to be able to formulate anycoherent theories about the mystical language that was producedrt later sessions.Two of the earliest squares transmitted by the'spirits'throughKelley are the following:23.!*, tt 111;-l'{i\\ .- Jarl'*)a-.r]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"[20 March 15821S A A I'JE M E8BTZKASE]OHEIDENEDEIMO30A126 M E G C B EI L A O Ir8'V NIHRLAATT'[2] March 1582]With reference to the first square, Dee is instructed to 'readdownward'; he does so, and, starting with the left-hand column,he finds the following angelic names: Zaphkiel, Zadekiel, Cum-ael, Raphael, Haniel, Michael, Gabriel (with the sign of the crossto fill up the last square).The procedure with the second square is a bit more complicat-ed. The numbers 8, 26 and 30 are to be read as 'L', at the end ofnames, 2l is the letter 'E'1 and the names are to be read offdiagonally, in a south-westerly direction, starting with the 'S'ofthe top left-hand corner. The following names are produced:(S)Zabathiel, Zedekie(i)I, Madimiel, Semeliel, Nogahel, Cora-biel, Levanael.Now, there is nothing new about most of these angelic names.Apart from the archangels Raphael, Michael and Gabriel (Urielwas dictating through Kelley at this point) most of the othernames can be found, in identical or very similar forms, in standard24magical texts such as those of Agrippa and Peter d'Abano - asDee himself comments in a marginal note.This being so, it is hard to believe that these angelic names arein any way deriaed from the squares; it seems much more likelythat they are the formants of the squares. From such a square)once created, it is however possible to derive new n mes, and infect Dee is presented with a series of names created from thesecond square, by reading in different directions along thediagonals. The names were dictated before the square itself wasgiven; the vision was of seven men, seven women, seventwenches', and seven boys, each with letters on the fronts of theirgowns. These 28 visionary manifestations are given planetaryrttributions, as follows:Planct TWomen TMen TWenches TBoysSun EL (L)Moon MEVenus ESEJupiter IANAMars AKELEMercury AZDOBNScturn STIMCVLDirection NE SW NW SEof readingln squareThe procedure is hardly mystifying, if we ignore for the momenrthe claimed spiritual transmission. The names are those used inthe construction of the wax seals (the Sigillum Emeth and fourOthers) used by Dee in invocations. The procedure for generatingthese names would have seemed logical and proper to Dee, asqrbalist and mathematician - though his mathematical sensellust have been upset by the lack of symmetry in the directions forlerding the planetary names. (The desire for symmetry would bebetter satisfied if either the first or second column were read inln the opposite direction - with LVCMITS as the name of alpirit of Saturn).Z I I RH i aaZCaacbpaupnhrh dmh i a ikkaaeeeiieellle e I I MG tISIH ABILR ATHDMAL IZEDHEEOA EKIEIBEIGIA MADIMISTIMCVL ESEMELIEANAVELIBAROCLEHAGONELILEMESE25"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"'\\. .? .1.+r. c(. ?.f . >.lr .Jt.{.-) 4..(..f .I.?.J ty.A..V. ,Yiif#,r:fu,f ?,:,,*2fr:ft#,:i#tt#:#;T\\p ^ tp i--f r.LX: ;(i; i;i a IUAtA'k#&ij, nffiI rr.:\"r ti *-. /.r*-rz /k2-a', ./fr-., ,.11Dee's record of the skrying session for 26 March 1583 when theEnochian letters first appeared, in Sloane MS 3188, f.64. (Cour-tesy of the British Library).26But what is surprising is that never again, in the seven years ofseances that followed, do we get a clear picture of the formation ofe square from previously-known elements - and only rarely arewe in a position to say with certainty just how names have beengenerated from the squares. Almost a hundred further squares aredictated by the spirits, some of them as large as 49x49; some aredictated straight across, letter by letter, others are created by therearrangement of previously-dictated squares. But the details oftheir creation become increasingly baffling - either because theprocedure is increasing in complexity, or because Dee is no longerbothering to set down the details for himself, or both. If theEnochian language is generated by some systematic process fromgquares, whether as a cipher or as a set of mystical words, we donot have the method.The appearance of the Enochian alphabetJust after the dictation of the squares discussed above, on 26March 1583, Edward Kelley produced the first material con-cerning the 'angelicall language'. On that day he has a vision of amagical book, with the leaves, perhaps inevitably, ,all filled withtquares'. The dictating of the contents of this book occupies thegeances of the next thirteen months - with some interruptions,in which the spirits dictate other matter, or prophesy, or refuse torppear at all. There is also some interference from non-angelicrpirits, mostly of the type that occultists would recognise asclcmentals.First of all, the alphabet of the new language appears: twenty-one special characters, each with its own name. The characternemes are odd, and seem to bear no relation to the phonetic valueof the character; but the fact that the names were given in threeSroups of seven, and total in all 64 letters, may suggest that herefSain there may be a square concealed: 8 x 8, or perhaps even 7 x 9or 21x3.The characters appear three times in the manuscript record ofthis session: once wiihout the names, once with the names, andonce as a fair copy, in a slightly different form. They are alsorepeated, in their final and most stylised form, at the end of thewhole sequence, over a year later; there is also a fair copy byKclley in the manuscript l.iher Mysteriorum Sextus et Sanctus\\III27"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"(Sloane MS. 3189), which is a very sloppy transcript of thecontents of the angelic book. In addition, individual words writ-ten in the characters, in the handwriting of both Kelley and Dee,appear sporadically throughout the manuscripts.It is necessary to compare all these versions to get a real idea ofthe characters. The first two versions, for example, look muchmore like Dee's Hebrew characters than later versions (the lettersnamed Veh (C), Ged (G), Graph (E), and Fam (S) are identicalwith Aleph, Cheth, Daleth and Resh). The direction of writing,like that of all Semitic languages, is from right to left, but myattempts to trace this alphabet back to a specific Semitic sourcehave failed. All that can be said is that the characters have a gen-eral appearance rather like Samaritan - though their stylisedforms may also suggest Ethiopic. The scripts they do not resembleare proto-Semitic, or Egyptian hieroglyphic, or Sumerian - aresemblance that would seem essential if we were to believe thatthe script, like the angelical language, dated back to 'before theFlood', and was the most ancient script of mankind.We may seek a plausible explanation for the'angelical' script inthe fact that Dee may well have had in his library ancient manu-scripts in a writing that he could not read, and that either he orKelley could have got the idea from such a source. Moreover, theidea of the 'lost book of Enoch' (mentioned in the Bible at Jude14) was very much in the air in the sixteenth century; it is men-tioned in several Christian commentaries on the qabalah. Thefirst manuscripts of this work, supposed lost throughout all theMiddle Ages, were not found until the middle of the seventeenthcentury, in Ethiopic and Greek versions. Could Dee perhaps havebeen in possession of an Ethiopic version of the Book of Enoch -which he would certainly not have been able to read?Another clue to the origin of the Enochian script is given by asixteenth century work on alchemy: the Voarchadumia of Pan-theus (1530). On page L4-I5 of this work we find another alphabetcalled Enochian; it is perhaps not additionally surprising, thoughit seems never to have been pointed out before, that the BritishMuseum copy of this work had actually belonged to Dee, as earlyas 1559, as attested by the copious marginal notes. Dee's Enoch-ian alphabet bears no relation to that in Pantheus, but Pantheusmay have provided the idea. It seems, in the absence of any other28evidence, that the Dee,/Kelley alphabet may be fanciful, basedperhaps on subconscious recollection of similar scripts in earlierliterature. There is certainly nothing in Casaubon's suggestion, inhis edition of the Dee diaries, that the characters 'are no other, forthe most part but such as were set out and published long agoe byone Theseus Ambrosus out of Magical books'. The reference is toa work published in 1539 (Intoductio in Chaldaicam linguam, byTheseus Ambrosius Albonesius), in which are contained a largenumber of alphabets, both real and magical; and not one of thealphabets resembles Enochian in any way.The first'angelical' languageIn any case, it is by means of these characters that the first texts inthe 'angelical language' are dictated a few days later (29 March1583 * Good Friday, as it happened to be). In the very firstinstance, the archangel Raphael names the letters, and Dee writesdown these names (as if a Greek word, say )royog, were dictatedand written down by the Greek letter names Lambda OmicronGamma Omicron Sigma). Afterwards, Dee wrote out the Englishletters corresponding to the characters, and then read back thetext for checking by the angelic visitors.But after the first two texts, Dee began to realise that themethod was much too slow, considering the amount of materialyet to come:'Yf euery side conteyne 49 rows, and euery row willrequire so much tyme to be receyued as this hath doneit may seme that very long time will be requisite to thisdoctrine receyuing. But if it be gods good liking, we woldfayne haue some abridgment or compendious manner,wherby we might the sooner be in the work ofGods seruyce.'By this remark we see again that the 'texts' really representfurther squares. Each text is in fact one line of a gigantic 49x49lquare, each square containing one word; there are two sets oftuch texts, or 98 in all. The physical difficulties of constructing aiquare so large, and fitting it on to one leaf of a book, dauntedeven Dee and Kelley.We can just takc cach linc of the square as being a text, and for_-.- .-,:-d&i(&ili-29"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"]1POR?IOF< 6NV E =T:ii':,!_!1lls.itiEix:{.3;1.:-:aa7g7raa.Roal1\"E?:ttIT€F,t':a'cry:5 N sodicrrnCt&s litc1qff*\"g7dto(azalFOF'h'sLlrvaa:3llZ F vaaaIHGAu't{fytd\\RHsaIPages L4-15 from the copy of rhe Voarchadumia by Pantheusgiven to John Dee on l8 January 1559, showing an'alphabet of30PRIMA.Scqndi ucro in tnnlio lfunii fibfcripir8 Ahs ?odi..:;ttC!a00 4'JzE qr / 6{(aatR\"F.$$Antiquiore rutcn hir& corrcelliEnoch.th ph dt Z y XaaaaaaK)\\TALaqIBMa1UTcNanTDoavIEPauTFPiaiaratdtdrestitererf ut fupm,Bnoch' and Dee's manuscript note deriving the numerical valueof his name written in these characters.3I"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"easy identification number them from I to 49, with the prefixI or II indicating whether the first or second square is meant,when referring to specific texts later in this chapter.In any case, the angel is annoyed at the request, and whips awaythe chair and the table; the shewstone goes dark.

Thedistinction is important for the understanding of the materialfrom a linguistic point of view; words that are simply 'spelled',and not'pronounced', may be mere random collections of letters,that do not form pronounceable words at all. The evidence wehave is inconclusive. Dee has written the pronunciation oversome letters (such as g as7, frnal u as, - an unnecessary proced-ure if the texts were written down as heard. This pronunciationmust have been given at some stage after the texts were delivered,even though the angels specifically forbid 'dubble repetition', orreading over the text after it is dictated - the quote on page 35gives the reason.On the other hand, the pronounceability of the words of thetexts speaks in favour for a theory of the words having been read32out one after the other, without spelling. There are no sounds thatwould give any trouble to a native speaker of English, and only afew diffi cult combina tions (bdrio s, e x colphabmartbh, longamphlg,lapch). And some of the texts run so fluently, with so muchrepetition, rhyme, alliteration, and other types of phonetic pat-terning, that we are almost forced to conclude that, in the latertexts at least, Kelley was speaking aloud, and probably at normalspeech speed:I.13 Ampri apx ard ardo arga arges argah ax...I.23 . . .arcasa arcasam arcusma...1.24 . . . umas ges umas umas ges umas umas ges gabreumas umascala umphazes umphagam masgamosel. . .L25 . . . zimah zemah zumacah . . .z pne zarvex zorquam. . .zimagauna zonze zamcha.. .1.26 . . . zambuges zambe ach oha zambuges gasca lunpelzadphe zomephol zun zadchal. . .I.37 . . . gasmat gasque gasla gasna gasmaphes gasmagelgasnunabe...Text II.20 alternates one- and two-syllable words for thirty threewords in succession, with one trifling exception; and an evenmore subtle form of patterning is found inIL24, where there ise strong tendency (broken only by minor exceptions) for mono-syllables containing o or u to alternate with disyllables containingthe same vowel (mostly a) repeated with a nasal consonant:II.24 Voh gemse ax pah losquan nof afma ol vamna unsamses oh set, quamsa ol danfa dot fanta on anmao1...What are we to make of this phonetic patterning?

All the facts seem com-patible with Kelley pouring out a string of gibberish while in atrance state. Nevertheless, Dee does add to some of the wordssome puzzling translations in the margin - but I think he couldnot have translated a whole text. A few of these glosses areinteresting:gassagen the divine powre creating the angel of the sametohcoth this name comprehendeth the number of all thefayries, who are diuels next to the state and condition ofmanapachana the slimie things made of dustdonasdogamatastos the furious and perpetuall fireenclosed for the punishment of them that are banishedfrom the gloryWhatever else, it is an economical tongue.So much for the'language' which makes up Liber Logaeth, orthe 'Book of the Speech from God', which exists in Kelley's hand-writing in the British Museum as Sloane MS.3189. Kelley's textshows a number of discrepancies from Dee's (as far as it goes),which I take to be evidence of his general carelessness in suchmatters; but perhaps the conditions he had to work under werenot ideal:'As E.K. was writing the eighteenth leafe, which was of thespirites of the earth, (in the afternone about 4t/, of theclok) he red a parcell thereof, playnely and alowde to himself, and therevpon suddainely at his side appeared threeor fowr spirituall creatures like laboring men, havingspades in theyr hands, & theyr haires hanging abouttheyr eares, and hastely asked E.K. what he would haue,& wherefore he called them.

Dee works out rhe cipher -which is quite a simple one - but has trouble in deciding whetherone cipher character represents K or X, so he notes in the margin:'Of this K I dowt yet'. One biographer of Dee (Charlotte Fell-Smith) took this to mean that Dee was distrustful of Kelley! Wealso find detailed instructions for the magical use of Liber Logaeth.All these are matters which need not concern us here. But at theend of the long session of 5 May 1583 Kelley reports a dreamwhich contains accurate predictions of events then four years inthe future: the Spanish Armada, and the execution of MaryQueen of Scots. These predictions must be borne in mind whenwe come to assess the genuineness) or otherwise, of Kelley'smediumship:'A . As concerning the Vision which yesternight waspresented (vnloked for,) to the sight of E.K. as he sat atsupper with me, in my hall, I meane the appering of theDery sea, and many ships thereon, and the cutting of thehed of e u)omen, by a tall blak man, what are we toimagin thereoPVr[iel] - The one, did signifie the prouision of forraynpowres against the welfare of this land: which they shallshortly put into practise. The other, the death of theQuene of Scotts. It is not long vnto it.'It may not have been difficult for an intelligent man to guess, atthat time, that the execution of Mary Queen of Scots was a likelyevent, and perhaps a foreign invasion appeared probable even in1583; but, nevertheless, this stands out as a remarkably detailedprediction. (Mary was beheaded in 1587, and the SpanishArmada was destroyed off the coast of England in the middle of1588.)About this time the record published by Meric Casaubon in1659 commences; the date of the firsr published seances is 28 May1583, and it begins abruptly with the appearance of a little girl3tlspirit of seven to nine years old, named Madimi. This is one of thenames taken from the second square of letters received by Deeover a year before (see page 24), so he knows at once that her eldersister is Esemeli. (Dee mispronounces this name as Es6meli, andMadimi corrects it to Esem6li.) Madimi, from the earliest session,, is regarded as being a spirit represenring the planet Mercury,which is appropriate for a teacher of languages and magicalSciences; her name, in fact, derives ultimately from the Hebrewword for Mars, Dr'1ND ma'adim - whence also'Madimiel', thename of the intelligence of Mars used in constructing the square.Other spirits appear from time to time, some of them takenfrom the earlier tables; but Madimi - who at times reminds oneof the 'little girl' contacts of nineteenth-century mediums -fT Fakes constant appearances, almost to the very end of the record.; (One biographer of Dee, Richard Deacon, says rhat Madimi grewti up and reached 'womanhood' in the seven years that she appearedil to Dee; but I find no evidence of this, and the period is only four:, ycars (1583-1587). There is a sketch of Madimi in one of his, diaries, in which she looks vaguely nubile - but it must be' -remembered that Dee could see her only in his imagination.)iThe appearance of the true Enochian languageThe seances continue with magical instructions, philosophising,prophesying, misunderstandings, and contradictions. The text ofI new book is dictated, with a new set of 49 invocations (one ofwhich is 'silent'); this is the 'Enochian'language strictly so called,which is the subject of this volume. The differences between thisllnguage and the former one are considerable. Firstly, for theBnochian texts, a translation is provided, a fact which right fromthe beginning makes it look more like a real language. Secondly,the Enochian language appears to be generated, insome way, outof the previous tables and squares of Liber Logaeth - generated,ln fact, out of the earlier 'angelic' language.^' Unfortunately, the details of how the Enochian language isderived from the squares is very unclear. Only for the very firstCrll is the system given in detail, and the details are very obscure.We read:l,i{r#&'#'ia*.'i'*'.;r\"#{.Jf1.*,Sr&,&iryi'i$,39"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"'A. (Two thowsand and fortene, in the sixth Table, is) D7003 in the thirteenth Table, is IA in the 2lst Table. 11406 downwardI in the last Table, one less than Number:a word, Iaida.You shallunderstand, what that Word is before the Sonne go down.Iaida is the last word of the Call.H 49 ascending T 49 descending A 909 directly:O, simply.H 2029. directly. call it Hoath.'[13 April 1584]It is clear that the numbers do not, as some writers have claimed,give the 'row and column' of the table, nor can they give theabsolute number of letters in the square (counting consecutivelyfrom the top left) as there are only 2401 squares (49x49) in eachtable of Liber Logaeth, with each word in the square not exceedinga dozen letters (and the majority much shorter); the numbers inthe dictation, however, go as high as 312004.We can conceive of various ways the letters of the Enochianlanguage can have been taken out of the tables previously given toDee and Kelley. It is possible, for instance, that the letters of theEnochian texts, joined in order on the squares of Liber Logaeth,may form geometrical figures or magical sigils; but there are somany letters to choose from that this approach has proved futile.Other attempts at decipherment, such as that put forward rnTheNecronomicon, London, 1978, researched by Robert Turner andDavid Langford, and introduced by Colin Wilson, are also un-satisfactory.The letter-by-letter dictation of the Enochian language doesaccount for some of the differences of this language from theearlier untranslated language. The 'new' language is less pro-nounceable than the old one, and it has awkward sequences ofletters, such as long strings of vowels (ooaona, mooah) anddifficult consonant clusters Q>aombd, smnad, noncfl. This isexactly the type of text produced if one generates a string of letterson some random pattern. (The reader can test this by taking, forexample, every tenth letter on this Page, and dividing the string40of letters into words. The 'text' created wiil tend to look ratherlike Enochian.)But not all Enochian is of this form; many of the words are verypronounceable, as we shall see. The words of the Enochian lan-guage itself stop short of having the fully random appearance ofthe names of God, and of angels and 'kings', that Dee generatedfrom the letters on the squares of his'elemental tables', that weregiven later by the spirits names such as LSRAHMP,LAOAXRP, HTMORDA, ALHCTGA, AAETPIO, which looka lot less plausible, as words of a language, rhan anything in theEnochian texts.It is also not completely certain that all rhe texts in the Enoch-ian language were dictated by the letter-by-letter method. Itappears that on at least one occasion Kelley (or the spirits) mayhave tried to speed up the process, only to be rebuked by Dee'sinsistence on letter-by-letter transmission. Dee tells Kelley thar'unlesse of this strange language I should have these wordsdelivered unto us letter by letter, we might erre both in Ortho-graphy, and also for want of the true pronunciation of the words'{19 April 1584).The nature of the Enochian languageNo matter what the method of transmission was, there are certainobservations that we can make about the Enochian language, inthe texts that we have. We know something of the pronunciation,from the fact that Dee often wrore the pronunciation of individualwords next to the Enochian text. And this Enochian text, writtenln the Roman alphabet, purporrs to be a transliterarion of theEnochian characters of the text of the original book seen inKelley's vision. As far as we can tell, each letter of the Romanflphabet transcription represents one Enochian character -which means that Enochian spelling, too, has 'hard' and'soft'velues for c and g, and combines letters such as s and ft to make thell sound. Very English behaviour for a language 'which AdamVerily spake in his innocency, and was never uttered nor disclosedto man since till now' (21 April 1584).If the phonology of Enochian is thoroughly English, thelrammar is no less so. But here we are faced with one difficulty:the nature of the translation. The English rendering of the&4I"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"9Enochian calls is very free, often using five or six words where theEnochian has one; thus, the word for 'man' (or 'reasonablecreature') is glossed as 'the reasonable creatures of Earth, orMan'. Proper names, such as ldoigo (one of the 'Names of God')are given translations: 'of Him that sitteth on the holy Throne'.Particles, prepositions, and pronouns are filled in where the senserequires them, but we do not know exactly what they are sup-posed to represent in Enochi an; moooah, for example, is glossed as'it repenteth me' - but it could just as easily be an active verb('I regret').Moreover, of about 250 different words in the Enochian texts,more than half occur only once, so that we have no real check ontheir form or meaning. Nevertheless, we can identify a number ofdifferent roots, often in quite distinct forms: om'understand'know', oma'understanding', omax'knowest', ixomaxip'let beknown'. This is probably the most language-like, and leastexplicable, feature of Enochian. IJ(/hat is less certain, however, ishow much the differences in the spellings reflect the grammar ofEnochian; we find, for example, caosg' caosga 'earth', caosgi 'earth(accusative case)', caosgin 'than the earth\" caosgo 'of earth',caosgon 'to the earth' - but are these really case endings, or justchance variants? The same case endings are not found from onenoun to another, so that there are either a large number of differ-ent declensions (as in Latin or Greek), or else there are no case-endings at all. I incline toward the latter view.The vocabulary elements of the language are probably arbit-rary; certainly they do not seem to be directly derivable fromanything in English, Latin, Greek or Hebrew. But in some caseswe meet words we half recognise, with unfamiliar meanings:angelard 'thought' (from 'angel'?)' babalond 'wicked, harlot'(from' Babylon'? ), christeos' let there be' (from' Christ'?), leaith-mong'beasts of the field' (a blend of 'Leviathan' and'mongrel'?),luciftias 'brightness' (from 'Lucifer'?), nazarth'pillars of glad-ness' (from'Nazareth'?), paracleda'wedding' (from'paraclete'?),paradial'living dwellings', paradiz'virgins' (both from'Para-dise'?), salman 'house' (from'Solomon'?). (Note that most of thesuggested origins are proper names, and are biblical - whateverconclusions may be drawn from that.) The remaining words donot seem to have any assignable etymology, though one can be42seduced by occasional plausible explanations, such as micaolztmighty' from Scots mickle, or izizop'vessels, containers' fromHebrew J'l IUrUN'alilot'vessels'.It is hard to be dogmatic about Enochian grammar. Verbs showsingular and plural forms, and present, future, and past tenses,and have also some participial and subjunctive forms; but we donot have a full declension of any verb.The fullest data is that for the verbs 'say' and 'be', as follows:gohusgohe, goholohulimgohiagoholgohon'I say''he says''we sayt'saying''they have spoken''it is said'zir, zirdogehichiis, chis,as, ziropziromtrianchristeosbolpipamipamis'I am''thou art''helshe,/it is'chiso 'they are'twasttweret'shall be''let there be''be thou!''is not''cannot be'Not much to build a grammar on. We can in addition identifyrcme of the pronouns (o/'I'; i/s'thou'; tox, tbl 'of him'; tia'his';pi'the'; tibl'her (acc.)'; tiobl'inher'; tilb'of her'; z 'they'), a fewmore verb forms, and four ways of expressing negation (chis gehre not'; ip uran 'not see'; ri-pir 'no place'; ag toltorn 'no creat-Ure'). But it is apparent that there is nothing strikingly un-Englishlbout the grammar: no trace of the construct case or irregularplurals of Hebrew or Arabic, no clear indication of multiple casescomplex verb forms, as in Latin and Greek. The grammar,further suggests English with the removal of the articles ('a' andtthc'; and the prepositions - and with a few irregularities thrownto confuse the picture.The order of words is also strongly English. A phrase such ascors ta dobix'cast down such as falf is pure English in its;order, and can not idiomatically be duplicated in four words withthese meanings in any other European or Semitic language.However, this language with an English base was not dictatedt; ln English-speaking surroundings, but in Cracow in Poland -a43"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"part of Dee's six-year absence abroad, living on foreign patron-age. (Kelley never returned to England.) But it would be futile tolook for Polish influence in Enochian - especially as all thescholars with whom Dee and Kelley were in contact spoke Latin.There is one aspect of Enochian 'grammar'that remains totallyinexplicable: the number system. Throughout the Calls, variousnumbers occur, and with a certain amount of extrapolation itseems possible to identify most of the numerals from 'one' to'nine':0-TI - L, EL, L-O, ELO, LA, LI, LIL2 - Y, VI-I-V, VI-VI3-D,R4-S,ES5-O6 _ N, NORZ7-Q8-P9_M,EM10-xHowever, the system that generates the remaining numbers is acomplete mystery. A full list of the numbers occurring in theEnochian Calls is given here:12-os19_AF22-OP24-OL26-OX28 - OB, NI3I_GA33_PD42-V)K456 _ CLAIOOO - MATB1636 - QLIAR3663 _ MIAN5678 - DAOX6332 - ERAN6739 _ DARG7336 - TAXS7699 _ ACAM8763 - EMOD9639 _ MAPM9996 _ CIAL69636 - PEOALThe test of any future spirit-revelation of the Enochian languagewill be the explanation of this numerical system.44The pronunciation of EnochianAs the texts dictated in Enochian consist of a series of 'Calls', orinvocations of supernatural beings, it was clearly necessary forDee and Kelley to know how the words should be uttered; in mostmagical systems, a slight error in the text of a spell or invocation isregarded as potentially leading to disastrous consequences. Ac-cordingly, Dee was in the habit of writing the pronunciation ofthe Enochian words alongside the text\" If Kelley dictated thewords letter by letter, he must have provided the pronunciation ofthe whole word immediately afterward.To make these observations on pronunciation, Dee had to makeshift with the ordinary English alphabet; he had no system ofphonetic notation. But his intention is usually quite clear. Hewrites dg when he means 'soft g' (as in gem); and s for 'soft c','andhe indicates in some places that ch is to be pronounced as A. Hemarks the stressed vowels in most words. Sometimes - but notoften - he indicates that a letter is to be given its pronunciation inthe alphabet - thus ds is to be pronounced'dee ess', and z in a fewinstances is given the pronunciation 'zod'. (The letter z has notelways been called'zed'or 'zee';it has had many names, amongthem being'izzard', and, at the end of the sixteenth century,fezod'. 'Zod' is nothing but a variant of this last name.) In moredifficult cases, he gives examples from English, thus, zorge is saidto be pronounced to rhyme with 'George', and ul tobe said 'withluch sound to U as we pronounce yew, whereof bows are made'-that is, z/ is pronounced like 'Yule'.With all of these instructions we can get a fairly good idea ofhow Enochian sounded to Dee and Kelley. We have to makelllowances, of course, for the fact that the two men spoke Englishof more than four centuries ago - and also that, while Dee camefrom the Midlands, Kelley came from Worcestershire, at a timewhen the dialect variations in England were greater than they arenow. Fortunately, linguists are in the possession of sufficientCvidence - in the forms of pronunciation guides in schoolbooks,Ihymes, misspellings, and the like - to establish the pronun-ciation of most forms of Elizabethan English with a high degree oftccuracy (passages of Shakespeare, for instance, have been pub-llched in phonetic transcription, representing Shakespeare's ownpronunciation).45a_"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The resulting pronunciation of Enochian makes it sound muchmore like English than it looks at first sight.

Though thediaries give only the viewpoint of Dee, the characters of both mencome through clearly. Dee is credulous, and willing, usually, togive the spirits the benefit of the doubt; but he keeps a close watchon them too, and queries them when he catches them out in adiscrepancy. (The spirits chide him time and time again for askingso many questions - awkward questions.) Kelley, on the otherhand, is often surly, and largely uninterested in what the spiritsare transmitting through him, except where he sees a chance tofind out how to work his alchemical powder, and turn base metalinto gold. On one occasion, apropos of nothing, he interrupts thegirl-spirit Madimi with the question: 'Canst thou, Madimi,lendme a hundred pounds for a fortnight?' - only to be told, roughlyenough, that 'I have swept all my money out of doors'.Kelley apparently wanted the money in order to clear out, andabandon Dee. A few days before this request, on 29 June 1583, thespirits, speaking through Kelley, warned Dee about this inten-ded departure. The warning was in Greek, which Dee understoodwell enough, but Kelley certainly did not; he says to the spiritMadimi: '[Jnlesse you speak some language which I understand,I will expresse no more of this Ghybbrish'. Madimi also announ-ces: 'It is the Syrian tongue you do not understand it'; can Kelleybe trying to throw Dee off the scent here? This episode providesevidence of Kelley speaking yet another language he could notknow consciously - and here, if we are to believe that he fakedthe episode, we must still endeavour to explain how or where, inLondon at that epoch, he could have learned the necessary Greekphrases. (Kelley was even supposed to be ignorant of the Greekalphabet; in his regular diaries, Dee used to write English inGreek letters, whenever he had something to hide from theprying eyes of Kelley. I am not entirely convinced, however, thata sharp man like Kelley would not have penetrated this device.)Kelley perhaps wished to leave because the first date announ-ced for the performance of the'Enochian' magic (August 1583) isclose at hand, and he does not want to be around in case it is a48:.:J'.rj@-'fiasco; but it is still hard to see why (and how) he would delivera message against himself in a language he did not know.Be that as it may, Kelley is persuaded to stay (with a pay rise),and the spirits continue their instruction. They dictate pages ofletters and symbols which seem to lead nowhere, and fill up evenmore pages with vague prophesying that resembles the sermonsof a third-rate evangelical preacher. Their pracrical knowledgetends to be earthly rather than supernatural, and they have readthe same books as Dee and Kelley. (For example, the spirits dic-tate a list of 91 parts of the earth, ruled by 9l 'princes', in theEnochian system of magic; Kelley turns up next day and announ-ces, in some agitation, that the complete list can be found in ,abook of Agrippa's'. The question that immediately arises is: didKelley make this announcement to forestall a discovery that Deewould eventually make?)The spirits show many of Kelley's limitations, in imaginationand thought; and they tend to identify the many books on Dee'sshelves by the characteristics of their bindings, and not by theirtitles or contents. They have also been poking around in thehidden recesses of the house: on one earlier occasion they an-nounce their knowledge of a record of Dee's seances with prev-ious mediums. Dee had stuffed it up the chimney in an attemptto hide it from Kelley.On at least one occasion, Kelley can be shown to have falsifiedthe spirit doctrine for his o*r, .rrdr. Almost at the end,of the LibriMysteriorum, on 18 April 1587,we find recorded that on the prev-ious day (at a time when Dee was not present) Madimi hadtuggested to Kelley that the two men share their wives in common- the attractive young Jane Dee, and the almost unknown JoannaKelley. Dee queries this, and the spirits dictate, as confirmation,r string of numbers in what turns out to be a very elementarycipher. The 624letters of the large square (24x26) of the ,Elem-cntal Tables' dictated some time before are numbered from I to624, each number designating a letter. The letters dictated spellout the following message in Latin:'Cara tibi uxor, carior tibi sapientia, carissimus tibi ego.Electus tremis, ac hesitando peccas: Noli igitur [hesitare]ad genium, et carnem sapere; sed obtempera mihi: ductor"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"enim tuus sum, et auctor spiritus omnibus. Hec omnia ame sunt, et licita vobis.'Which reads:'Dear to you is your wife, dearer to you is wisdom,dearest to you am I. Though chosen, you tremble, and inhesitating you sin. Do not therefore [hesitate] to knowthe mind and the flesh; but obey me, for I am yourleader, and the creator of all spirits. All these things arefrom me, and are permitted to you.'(The Latin text is that yielded by the cipher, with a few literalerrors silently corrected. There should be another verb - per-haps hesitare - after igitur, and spiritus omnibus should probablyread spirituum omniuml but Kelley's Latin was always shaky. Forexample, the Casaubon edition of the Dee-Kelley seances hasauctor spiritus omnium at the end of the penultimate sentence -which we could translate, somewhat facetiously, as 'I am theghost-writer of all'.)The cipher shows a number of minor errors - apart from themajor fault that most of the numbers are one outl Dee's marginalnote is 'I perceive that commonly one is to be abated of thenumber'. It would require a great deal of credulity to ascribe suchan error to the angels, rather than to Kelley.The wife-swapping episode took place, in spite of the attemptsof some biographers of Dee to suggest that it did not. In theoriginal manuscripts there is a section, heavily erased and barelylegible, recording the seance of 23 May 1587 - the morning afterthe wife-swapping. The spirits ask Kelley: 'Was thy brother'swife [Jane Dee] obedient and humble unto thee?' - and Kelleyreplies: 'She was'. Dee returns the same answer concerningJoanna Kelley.Dee's association with Kelleyr and apparently also with theEnochian angels, ended shortly after this episode - perhaps thetensions in that household of two British couples in Bohemia werebecoming too much to bear, and Kelley set himself up as analchemist in a separate establishment. Nevertheless, the Dees didnot leave for England until March 1589, arriving there in Decem-ber of that year. Kelley stayed on at the court of Emperor Rud-50 ....dd*&elA gold disc engraved within a dream.

(Thi usual story is that he was imprisoned for failing toproduce alchemical gold, and fell from a tower when trying toescape.) Kelley was forty at the time - but on 2l August 1584,the angel Uriel had promised that he would live till eighty-seven(and fee till a hundred and twenty-two). Not even angels areright all the time.-Dee died in poverty in England in 1608, at the age of 8l ' Thereis no record oi any seance with Kelley after the wife-swappingincident; both men appear to have had enough of the angeliccommunications. In later life, however, Dee did record a fewmore attempts of his own; there is a record of a seance in 1607'which is concerned with such mundane matters as his penury andhis 'bleeding fundament'. The fantastic angelic revelations seemto have departed with KelleYr and there is no evidence that Deeever made \"ny tt. of the Enochian system of magic which he wasat such pains to receive.Judgment on the sPiritsWhat are we to makJof all this? Can we accept the spirits at facevalue, or must we, in a rational age, look for some other explan-ation? If we insist on a prosaic rationale, there are only twopossible candidates for the dubious honour of having fabricatedihe whole series of spirit-communications: John Dee and EdwardKelley. It was rare for anyone else to be present at the seances'excepi on a few occasions when Jane Dee and Joanna Kelleyturned up to query the wife-swapping incidents.The spirits, incidentally, show a marked anti-feminist attitude.On 21 i4,arch 1585, they rebuke Jane Dee, who has put in apetition for more housekeeping money,'because-she is awoman',and on 23 May 1587 (the morning after the wife-swap) a spiritcalling herself 'The Daughter of Comfort' says: 'Disclose not mysecrets unto women'.Dee could certainly have fabricated the whole record. He hadthe knowledge to do so, and the diaries are in his handwriting; andhe delightedln phying with magic squares, circles, and sigils. Butsuch aluggestiron must founder on the question: why on earthwould he have done so? only a man clinically insane - and Deewas certainly not that - would have filled many hundreds of52pages, covering more than two decades in all, with a private fan-tasy that became revealed to the world only by accident. Therecords of the seances were never intended for publication; Deehad enough experience in his life of the dangers of appearing to bea magician, without adding fuel to the fire by making public hisactions with spirits. (Already in 1583 a mob, disturbed by hisreputation for trafficking with spirits, had raided his house inMortlake, and destroyed a large part of his library.) Moreover,no-one can read the spiritual diaries, which on internal evidencewere written down at the seances themselves, or very soon after,and doubt the sincerity of Dee himself believing in the reality ofthe spirits.I think, therefore, that we can acquit Dee of any deliberatefraud or mystification in this matter. It is not so easy to acquitKelley. All we knou' of him (and that is not in fact a very greatdeal) suggests that he was an occult charlatan, an opportunistlooking for ways to make a'quick quid'; and we have seen himonI number of occasions inject his own personality into the spiritcommunications. He had motive enough; not only the d50 a yearhe was paid by Dee as a retainer, but also, perhaps, pride in being, able to create a magical system that would be accepted by a cred-ulous old man, the opportunity to use Dee's library and alchemic-al laboratories, the chance to bask in Dee's reflected glory, theperks of free travel on the continent, and the freedom to make apass at Jane Dee. And even in this last motive there may be morethan meets the eye: there could well have been a homosexualcomponent in Kelley's attachment to Dee. Kelley married late,tnd only when the spirits advised him to, admitting that he him-gelf 'had no natural inclination thereto'; and it is a well-establish-ed psychological fact that the attraction of a man for a member ofhis own sex may manifest itself in a desire to possess the beloved'swife, if the beloved himself is not accessible.But did Kelley have the knowledge to create all his spirit revel-rtions? The Enochian system shows a much deeper knowledge ofthe qabalah than Kelley would seem to have possessed - but notnecessarily more than he might have been able to glean by a sur-reptitious reading of Dee's books. Nevertheless' there is a re-msrkable consistency about the whole system, which for Kelleyto have invented would argue a phenomenal memorYr or the keep-53"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ing of notes (which would have been hard to conceal from Dee).The Enochian Calls, for example, are translated in their entiretyoften days after the original dictation: could Kelley have carriedall this in his head, or on pieces of paper small enough to escapeDee's attention? (During the sessions of 14 May 1584, and onsome other occasions, the spirit communications become verygarbled - is this an indication of Kelley getting his notes out oforder?)Kelley's predictions of future events, and the production of thewarning in Greek, also need to be accounted for, in any explan-ation. In favour of the Kelley-fraud hypothesis, however, is thefact that the communications of the spirits, though consistent, dochange over time; and the 'system' tends to fall into watertightcompartments. There is little real relationship, for instance,between the earlier Heptarchia system of the 49 Good Angels, andthe later Claaes Angelicae system of the Enochian tables. Thelatter is more thorough-going, and, as we have seen, the associat-ed language is more convincing: can Kelley have got better atproducing what was required of him, as time went on? He musthave learnt a great deal from living in close contact with Dee, andDee's credulity'would blind him to slight internal contradictions.(Dee does, as we have seen, query inconsistencies as he findsthem; but there could have been others that he did not record,perhaps subconsciously repressing them. We have after all onlyDee's record of the seances.)Perhaps Kelley was just feeding Dee's own fantasies back tohim. Or perhaps again he may have been picking up Dee's sub-conscious thoughts, by some kind of ESP, and elaborating onthem. Or perhaps, after all, the spirits were all they said theywere, and the Enochian system of magic is the most powerful ofwhich we have a record in the English language. The reader isinvited to make his own judgment; mine appears in the con-clusion to this chapter.Is Enochian a cipher?One further possibility remains to be considered: that the Enoch-ian texts are really a cipher, and that some other message isconcealed in them. The suggestion was first made by RobertHooke in a lecture to the Royal Society towards the end of the54seventeenth century, and has been resurrected by RichardDeacon, a modern biographer of Dee (lohn Dee: Scientist, Geo-grapher, Astrologer and Secret Agent to Elizabeth I, London,1968). The possibility cannot be immediately discounted; Deewas familiar with ciphers, and had the mathematical sophisti-cation to develop systems to a high degree of complexity. $7ehave noted already two clear-cut instances of cipher in the spiri-tual diaries: the decipherment of Kelley's treasure-manuscript,and the cipher of the wife-swapping incident. There is anothercipher in the diaries that should be mentioned, as an instance ofthe tortured nature of some of the spirit communication, and asevidence of the types of ciphers then employed.The communication was received by the magicians in the firstpart of 1585. A figure of an old man appears and reads in a book of'Ivory bone' a text interspersed with odd words and garbledsyntax:'Take of your Dlasod dignified, and Luminl,ls, or fromdue degrees. Gather or take fiery degree. . ._ Notwithstanding, work it diverse dayes multiplying fourdigestions. . . And double then Dlasod, and thy. . .Rlodnr. . .

In spite.,..*;giit5&ii$si*..55"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of many errors in the transmission, Dee finally works it out, andthe entry for 20 March 1585 prints the corrected plaintext:'Take common Audcal; purge and work it by Rlodnr offour divers digestions, continuing the last digestion forfourteen dayes, in one and a swift proportion, untill it beDlasod fixed, a most red and luminous body, the Imageof Resurrection.Take also Lulo of red Roxtan, and work him throughthe four fiery degrees, until thou have his Audcal: andthere gather him.Then double every degree of your Rlodnr, and by thelaw of Coition and mixture work and continue themdiligently together.

Levanael appears and ex-plains that Audcal is 'gold', Dlasod is 'sulphur', Roxtan is 'pureand simple Wine in her sel?, Lulo is 'Tartar, simply of red wine' ormother of vinegar, Darr is the philosopher's stone, and Rlodnrmust be something like 'furnasg' - but there is no key to theformation of these strange words.Perhaps it was the practical application of this strange formulathat gave Kelley his reputation as an alchemist able to transmutebase metal into gold, a reputation that got him the position ofalchemist at the court of the Emperor Rudolph. But in any casewe can see that the angelic spirits were not averse to using cipherwhen the need arose.Nor, of course, was Dee, even if he were not acting as a'secretagent' of Queen Elizabeth abroad. Many years before, he had ac-quired a manuscript copy of Trithemius' Steganographia, foftyyears before it was first printed; and this work not only deals with56various cipher systems, but also contains a'mystical language' (inreality a fairly simple cipher) that in some ways resembles Enoch-ian. \\J(/hat Dee thought of this book is contained in a letter to SirWilliam Cecil from Antwerp, dated 16 February 1563:'Allready I have purchased one boke, for which athousand Crownes have ben by others offred, and yetcould not be obtained. A boke, for which many a lernedman hath long sowght, and dayly yet doth seeke: Whoseuse is greather than the fame thereof is spread. . . A bokefor your honor, or a Prince, so meet, so nedefull andcomodious, as in humayne knowledge, none could bemeeter, or more behofefull.'But the various keys of Trithemius do nor work on either of themystical languages produced by Kelley. The whole Enochiangystem, with its complexity of squares filled with lerters, wouldgeem to lend itself to both transposition and substitution ciphersof all kinds; yet checks of some of the more likely possibilities haveyielded nothing worth following up. There may be a cipher in thefirst set of untranslated invocations that Kelley produced initially(but then these invocations would not look so much like glos-rolalia), but I do not believe there can possibly be cipher in theEnochian Calls. Let us see why not.The Enochian Calls) as we have seen, are accompanied by atranslation. If this translation is genuine, then the Calls musttepresent the enciphered version of this translation, in English orlome other plausible language. And, since the words of theBnochian text occur consistently with the same translation, theonly kind of cipher possible is substitution (whether simple orpolyalphabetic). Transposition ciphers, and ciphers with polyal-phabetic substitution, just would notyield the same'word' con-tistently.But simple substitution cannot have been used in the Calls, orthey would have been cryptanalysed by now. Simple substitutionln any of the likely languages (let us say for aigrr-ent Latin,Hebrew, Greek, English, or any common Europian tongue) isGompletely transparent - and how much more so when the trans-; lrtion is available! Take the word ROR, for example, meaning' rlun', if this werc a word in a simple substitution cipher, it must,7"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"represent a three-letter word in which the first and the last lettersare the same. The best candidate is Hebrew UtrU meaning'sun';but substituting the value of these letters in other words (e.9. R inGRAA 'moon') does not yield any further Hebrew words. Wecould perhaps assume a form of multiple substitution, and tryEnglish sun or Latin sol for ROR, and English moon or Latinlunafor GRAA. The reader is welcome to try this; he will find it leadsnowhere. Perhaps even more conclusive, however, is that theletter-frequencies per thousand of the Enochian Calls (as cal-culated by computer) do not produce a graph resembling that ofthe letter-frequencies for any of the languages under consider-ation.But the most damning case against cipher is the fact that thereis a translation at all. What would be the point of writing a text inan elaborate cipher, and then writing the plaintext underneath?It is barely possible, of course, that the translation is a mere blind,and that the Calls contain a totally different enciphered text. Butthere is a difficulty in this too; it would be extremely difficult(though not entirely impossible) to construct a workable cipherthat would first encipher one text, and still yield a consistent'pseudo-translation' as another text. But Enochian is far toomuch like the language its translation represents for this to bevery likely.Further, if the magical languages and the squares do contain acipher, why bother to surround it with all the other material fromthe spirits: prophecies, dictation, general talk, and indication ofbreaks for dinner? If Dee had wanted to write messages in cipher,for his own use, he could have done so without creating this elab-orate fiction.I think, therefore, it is possible to assert, with a high degree ofconfidence, that there is no cipher contained in the 'angelical'language, or in the Enochian Calls.The later history of EnochianThe use of Enochian as a language after the death of Dee andKelley, and of the related system of magic, cannot yet be fullydocumented. But as interest in Dee continues to our own day, it isrelevant to sketch in some of the main developments.Dee died in 1608, in the odour of sanctity, and was buried in the58chancel of the church at Mortlake, near his house. Kelley, as wehave seen, was already dead. If any of Dee's acquaintances orfamily - perhaps his son, Arthur Dee, who had once tried toserve as a medium for his father, and later became an alchemist inhis own right - continued with the practice of Enochian magic,it was without the seance records, which in the second half of theseventeenth century turned up, rather surprisingly, in a secretdrawer of a cedarwood chest that had belonged to Dee.The papers were discovered in the chest in about 1662 by thewife of a certain Mr $fale. He subsequently gave them to EliasAshmole in exchange for a copy of the latter's book on the Orderof the Garter.Elias Ashmole (1617-1692) was apparently fascinated by theircontents, spending a great deal of effort on reconstructing theEnochian system of magic from the often difficult text. He wasprobably the first man after Dee to attempt to make contact withDee's angelic spirits, in a series of seances extending from 1671to 1676.As the founder of English freemasonry, Ashmole may have hadan even greater significance, in introducing the Enochian systeminto esoteric freemasonry, and into the English occult tradition ingeneral. However, we do not know for certain whether he did ornot, for it is to be some two hundred years before Enochian ismentioned publicly again. It seems that some of the nineteenth-century freemasons with occult interests (such as FrederickHockley and Kenneth Mackenzie) may have been aware of theDee manuscripts (by then in the British Museum), but it is un-likely that Enochian magic played any part in masonic rituals.It was to be another Mason and antiquarian who broughtEnochian back into English occultism: \\trfynn $Testcott (1848-1925), one of the founders (in 1888) of the highly influentialoccult Order of the Golden Dawn. It was certainly lfestcott whointroduced into the Order the complex system of 'Rosicrucian\"chess', a divination system blending the Enochian system withEgyptian god-forms and Indian four-handed chess (Chaturanga),on which last Westcott was an expert.The Enochian Calls, and the general system of Enochianmagic, were required subjects of study for the Golden DawnSrsde of Adeptus Minor - though it seems that few members of59"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the Order ever knew much about them. Most of the originalmaterial (first made publicly available in detail by Israel Regardiein his book on the rituals of the Golden Dawn in 1937-40) is byWestcott, but some notes were also included by Westcott's co-founder of the Order, S. L. MacGregor Mathers. An interestingdevelopment is the description of a special pronunciation forEnochian. The advice of 'sapere Aude' (Wynn Westcott) is asfbllows:'In pronouncing the Names, take each letter separately.M is prounced Em; N is pronounced En (also Nu, sincein Hebrew the vorvel following the equivalent letter Nunis 'u')1 A is Ah; P is Peh; S is Ess; D is Deh.'NRFM is pronourrced En-Ra-Ef-Em orEn-Ar-Ef-Em. ZIZA is pronounced Zod-ee-zod-ah.ADRE is Ah-deh-reh or Ah-deh-er-reh. TAAASD isTeh-ah-ah-ah-ess-deh. AIAOAI is Ah-ee-ah-oh-ah-ee.BDOPA is Beh-deh-oh-peh-ah. BANAA isBeh-ah-en-ah-ah. BITOM is Beh-ee-to-em orBeh-ee-teh-oo-em. NANTA is En-ah-en-tah. HCOMA isHeh-co-em-ah. EXARP is Eh-ex-ar-peh.'The note by 'S Rioghail Mo Dhream (MacGregor Mathers)describes essentialiy the same system, but with some idiosyn-cratic viewpoints:'Briefly, regarding the pronunciation of the AngelicalLanguage, thou shalt pronounce the consonants with thevowel following in the nomenclature of the same letterin the Hebrew Alphabet. For example, in Beth, the vowelfollowing 'B' is 'e' pronounced AY. Therefore, if 'B' in anAngelical Name precede another as in 'Sobha', thoumayest pronounce it 'Sobeh-hah'. 'G' may be eitherGimel or Jimel (as the Arabs do call it) following whetherit be hard or soft. This is the ancient Egyptian use,whereof'the Hebrew is but a copy, and that many timesa faulty coplr save in the Divine and Mystical Names,and some other things.'Also 'Y' and'I' are similar, also 'V' and 'IJ',depending whether the use intended be vowel or60consonant. 'X' is the ancient Egyptian power of Samekh;but there be some ordinary Hebrew Names wherein'X'is made Tzaddi.'The Egyptology is that of the nineteenth century, and we maysuspect that this pronouncing system is of the same period; cer-tainly it is not, as we have seen, the pronunciation used by Deeand Kelley. But it is a practical system for coping with some of theconsonant-clusters of the Enochian language, especially thedivine Names. In use, the system was modified somewhat; thus,saanir'parts' was apparently pronounced as 'saanire', and not -as the instructions above would suggest -'Ess-ah-ah-en-ee-reh'or something similar.The occultist Aleister Crowley took the Enochian system veryseriously, and published the text of the Calls, together with thedetails of making the Enochian magical tablets, in his publicationThe Equinor (1909-1913). His version of the Calls is given in hisinterpretation of the the expanded Golden Dawn pronunciation;the Call of the Aethyr LIL opens:'Madariatza das perifa LIL cahisa micaolazoda saanirecaosago od fifisa balzodizodarasa Iaida. NonuEa gohulime:Micama adoianu MADA faoda beliorebe, soba ooaonacahisa luciftias peripesol, das aberaasasa nonugafenetaaibe caosaji od tilabe adapehaheta damepelezoda...'(Compare this with the reconstructed'original' pronunciationgiven above, page 47.)Crowley's own experiences with the Angels of the Aethyrs werealso published in the Equinor, and also later as a separate book,The Vision and the Voice; but it is not generally known that he alsocomposed a set of additional conjurations in the Enochian lan-guage. These are published in his edition of MacGregor Mathers'translation of the Goetia or Lesser Key of Solomon - but are omit-ted from many current editions. This additional Enochian ma-terial of Crowley's, be it spirit revelation, inspired re-creation, orlinguistic dilettantism, tends to use the words of Enochian foundln the Calls, but with some extended meanings and a few appar-ently original words. A specimen, from the invocation entitledtYe constraynte':!..r;;ii:*i&*s!l6I"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"'Od commemah6 do pereje salabarotza kynutzire'And I bind thee in the fire of sulphur mingledfabaonu, od zodumebi pereji od salabarotza:with poison and the seas of fire and sulphur:nllsa,eca,dorebesa na-e-el od zodameranucome forth, therefore, obey my power and appearasapeta vaunesa komesaloh6.'before this circle.'Since the time of the Golden Dawn and the various later Ordersin one way or another related to it - for details of which seeFrancis King's book on Ritual Magic in England - various occultgroups have attempted to use the Enochian system to try to estab-lish contact with the spirits seen by Kelley. Some have claimedsuccess, in the form of new Enochian material (both language andmagical formulas) that is not for profane ears. It is difficult tojudge such claims until they appear in print - but one simple testthat can be applied is to ask the adepts if they know the Enochianword for'seven'.One group that is known to be using the Enochian Calls is theChurch of Satan, headed by Anton La Vey in California. La Vey'sSatanic Bible prints the Enochian Calls, in a form that makes itquite clear that they are taken from Aleister Crowley's version -but he substitutes the name 'Saitan' wherever the original has'Iaida' ('The Highest'), and makes other minor modifications inthe translation: 'Lord of the Earth' for'God of Justice', and'Kingof Hell' for 'The Highest'. Whether Dee's spirits still respond,I do not know.Dee's spirits have recently been associated with those fromanother source, the essentially Sumerian and Akkadian demonsof the Necronomicon, a frctitious work invented by the Americanfantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft. In all there have been in excess ofhalf a dozen 'editions' of this title, all of different content: ofwhich the Necronomicon, Barnes Graphics, New York, 1977 hasdrawn on Sumerian and Akkadian sources. In the edition of theNecronomicoz published by Neville Spearman, London, 1978,there is a purported translation of Dee's Liber Logaeth. Readerswho have followed this introduction so far will be able to assessthe validity of the supposed translation for themselves - but it is62a long way from ancient Sumeria to Dee's London, and there isnot much evidence that H.P. Lovecraft had more than a fictionwriter's knowledge of either.Occult groups which have been known to use the Enochiansystem in recent years include, in London, the Order of thePyramid and the Sphinx, and the Aurum Solis; in the Midlands,the Order of the Cubic Stone; and elsewhere the LuculentusAstrum. It is hoped that the material in the present book may beof assistance to them, and to all such groups who are pursuingresearches in this area.ConclusionIn the preceding pages, the arguments for and against regardingEnochian as a genuine language, and for and against acceptingthe reality of the angelic spirits supposedly contacted by Dee andKelley, have been put at some length. I do not think anyone canafford to be dogmatic in this area. As a scholar, I am by temper-ament inclined to doubt wherever doubt is possible; but I haveknown well people who have pursued the study of Enochian fromthe point of view of practical occultism, and who claim that, what-ever the origin of the system, it works as practical magic. AndI have no particular reason to disbelieve them.I believe, myself, that a combination of factors produced Dee'sangelic communications. I am sure that Kelley went into genuinetrance states, in which he saw visions which he faithfully report-ed; but I am equally sure that at least on some occasions he con-sciously elaborated on those visions, and at times even inventedthem, and fabricated messages from the spirits, for his own ends;and that he used, consciously and unconsciously, any inform-ation that he picked up from Dee, and relayed it back to him.Nevertheless, there may be genuine revelations at the core ofhis reported visions. But I think that real angels would speak amore euphonious and more consistent tongue than Enochian,that they would not make mistakes, and that they would havemore of import to transmit to man than the interminable out-pouring of 'Enoch his boke'. Shakespeare's Macbeth claimed ofhis witches that 'they have more in them than mortal knowledge';it would be hard to make the same claim for Dee's angels. Theirlimitations arc those of Kelley; their occasional sublimities, those63"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of Dee. If the true voice of God comes through the shewstone atall, it is certainly as through a glass darkly.The element of doubt remains, however, and therefore it is notsurprising that in the 27th Invocation to the Good Angels, wefind, in the words of the first angelical language, the sequence:'...lafet vncas laphet vanascor torx glust hahaha...'The spirits may well have the last laugh.Donald C.

(Note: only rarely are these words notidentifiable with the words of Dee's Enochian;but there are many misprints and mistranslat-ions.)65"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Another source of Enochian vocabulary, La Vey's Satanic Bible,was examined, but the Enochian here follows AC: C exactly, withonly two additional misprints (mamao for momao, and gianai forgina) which were thought too insignificant to include in theDictionary. However, this publication is remarkable for theliberties it takes with the English text of the Calls, as well asomitting, for some odd reason, all the numerals of the originaltext.\\Xlords which do not have a source given them in the Dictionaryare all from Dee; occasionally a form is identified as C (Casaubon)when it does not tally with the manuscripts. The words from theCalls, which are of course the most important source of Enochian,are provided with an indication of pronunciation, as far as can bedetermined from Dee's notes, and from the principles outlined inthe chapter on Enochian. There remain many uncertainties, how-ever, and some readers may prefer to use the pronunciation assuggested by the spellings of Aleister Crowley or the GoldenDawn rituals, as this now has a relatively long occult tradition.In giving the pronunciation, the rule has been followed of 'con-sonants as in English, vowels as in Italian' - this means z as input, not (Southern British English) but. Longvowels are markedwith a bar over them (a, i), and the English murmured vowel (asin the last syllable of father) has been represented by 6 when noother symbol would do; but it would also be possible to pro-nounce all sequences of er, ir and ur as Er wherever they occur.Note that the r, in Dee's time, would have been pronouncedeverywhere it occurred; a light Scottish burr sounds good, but anAmerican r will suffice.A note must be added on zod, which is frequent in the AleisterCrowley versions of Enochian words. This was simply a short-lived Elizabethan word for the letter Z (which we now call zed orzee). As the letter was used less frequently in Elizabethan Englishthan now, but had a high frequency in Enochian, Dee would oftenwrite zod over the letter z, to remind himself that it was not to bespelt s. I think that only rarely did he intend this to suggest apronunciation with zod.Another characteristic of Elizabethan usage was the (to us) in-consistent writing of z and a, and to a lesser extent i and7. Deealmost invariably writes z, at the beginning of words, ancl a in the66middle, whether u or a (of modern English) was intended. Withregard to i and j, he almost always writes only i; j appears only ascapital I or J, and at the end of words (mostly Latin). TheseElizabethan habits in the spelling of Enochian have given rise tosome odd-looking words, such as anchi (where we would nowwrite unchl). These anomalies have been regularised in the Dic-tionary, according to modern spelling conventions.Also, in accordance with the values of the Enochian alphabetgiven by Dee, U and V are placed together in the Dictionary, asare l and Y. However,J is placed with G rather than withf sincethe only Enochian words that have ever been spelled withJ arethe Aleister Crowley versions of words beginning with 'soft g'.Similarly, K is included with C.Enochian variants that differ only inthese spelling alternations(such as z for a) are not always included separately. Nor arevariants that differ only in the use of capitals, hyphens, or spaces.Thus, the reader who has encountered, in Aleister Crowley'sGoetia, the word dari-lapa, will only find listed darilapa (whichalso occurs in the Goetia). It is not expected that this will causethe reader any inconvenience in finding words.All variants are cross-referenced to the best possible form ofthe word as used by Dee, as far as this can be determined; butwhere there are many Dee variants, these are usually to be takenas all equivalent.A few variant words are to be found a line or two away fromtheir true alphabetical place, to avoid multiplying cross-refer-ences; thus butamonu occurs within the entry butmon, and notbefore it. This should not cause inconvenience; if a word is notfound at its strict alphabetical place, simply look a line or twohigher or lower.Variants that appear to arise from miscopying or printers'errors are marked with a following asterisk: thus coasg* (forcaosg). Such errors are frequent in all previously published workscontaining any Enochian material; it is to be hoped that theprinter treats this work better.A fairly comprehensive list of divine and angelic names, mainlyfrom Dee's magical manuscripts, is included, but the reader iswarned against regarding this list as complete, in the sense ofgiving the key to the complete Dee magical system. Only those-- -..,-*aiiiriisSlriu', . -. .*g$&el*- .67"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"names actually used by Dee (and, preferably, those used withsome frequency) are included. The texts contain instructions forgenerating many additional names, from the various Enochianiables, but no names have been generated for this Dictionary.Also, a large number of angelic names that are given in the GoldenDawn rituals are omitted, as these appear to have been createdfrom the tables in ways not intended by Dee. In addition, onlythe barest outline of the nature and functions of the various spiritscan be given in the Dictionary. The publisher of this volume willbe bringing out a complete guide to Enochian magic at a laterdate.The Enochian Letter at the beginning of each part of the Angelic-English section of the Dictionary is reproduced in facsimile fromthJoriginal letters in Dee's manuscript diary for 6 May 1583(Sloane MS 3188 f.104).

I have modernised his often erraticspelling, punctuation, and word-division; and here and thereI have replaced an archaic word or phrase with its modern equi-valent. Other minor amendments have been made to allow theEnglish text to be compared with the Enochian more closely.I have, however, resisted the temptation to interfere with theEnochian text, except for corrections which Dee himself made.Capitalisation and word-division conform to the English text, inaccord with my grammatical analysis of Enochian. The Enochianwords appear directly under the English words to which theymost closely relate, except in a few instances where either theEnglish text or the Enochian text is defective. There is still roomfor dispute in some of the identifications, and in one or two in-stances arbitrary decisions had to be made.
